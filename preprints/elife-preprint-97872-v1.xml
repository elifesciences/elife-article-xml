<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> is one of the most pervasive symbionts, estimated to infect ∼50% of arthropod species. It is primarily transmitted vertically, inducing a variety of fascinating reproductive manipulations to promote its spread within host populations. However, incongruences between host and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> phylogenies indicate substantial horizontal transmissions, the mechanisms of which are largely unexplored. By systematically analyzing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> surface protein (<italic>wsp</italic>) sequences on NCBI, we found that parasitism, not predation, is the primary route of intertropical <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transmission. This conclusion held after accounting sampling bias. One example of frequent <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transfers is between egg parasitoid wasps, <italic>Trichogramma</italic>, and their lepidopteran hosts. Moreover, both bioinformatics and experimental results showed that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from the parasitoid wasp <italic>Encarsia formosa</italic> can be transmitted to its whitefly host <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>, through unsuccessful parasitism. Once <italic>En. formosa Wolbachia</italic> is transferred to whiteflies, it can be vertically transmitted within whiteflies and induce fitness costs. To our knowledge, this is the first compelling evidence that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can be transmitted from parasitoid wasps to their hosts, revealing the bidirectional nature of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transfers between parasitoids and their hosts. Overall, our findings enrich the current understanding of the horizontal transmission of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and shed new light on its ecology and evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Symbiosis with microbes, ranging from parasitism to mutualism, is prevalent in both plants and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The ubiquity of microbial symbionts is likely attributed to their profound impact on host biology, including host survival, development, immunity, reproduction, and even behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The transmission mode of symbionts is a key factor in shaping the ecology and evolution of both symbionts and their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). In addition to vertical transmission, incongruence between symbionts and host phylogenies indicates a large number of horizontal symbiont transfers across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). These events are important, as they allow symbionts to expand their host range and enable hosts to acquire new symbionts and alter their fitness. However, the transmission of symbionts has been relatively little studied compared to their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> (Rickettsiales, Alphaproteobacteria) is intracellular gram-negative bacteria and one of the most famous endosymbionts that infests ∼50% arthropod and several filarial nematode species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). On the one hand, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can induce a range of fascinating phenotypes, including a variety of reproductive manipulations, provision of nutrients, and alteration of host behavior, thus facilitating its spread among populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). On the other hand, although <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is primarily maternally transmitted, there are widespread and frequent horizontal transfers across hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Together, these characteristics make <italic>Wolbachia</italic> the most infectious microbe on Earth in terms of the number of species it infects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> has also received much attention for its applications in controlling pests and vector-borne diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Specific strains of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are artificially transfected into target pests and subsequently released into the field to either suppress pest populations or replace populations to depress the spread of vector-borne diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Understanding how <italic>Wolbachia</italic> spreads horizontally is critical in assessing its successful application and potential risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). This is because the released <italic>Wolbachia</italic> may leak into natural pest populations, frustrating population suppression strategies based on the cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. It may also spread to nontarget organisms, potentially disrupting their population dynamics, reducing genetic diversity, and even leading to extinction. Therefore, the lack of a thorough understanding of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transmission and its consequences could hinder its broader application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the extensive interest in the horizontal transmission of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, our understanding of this subject remains incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Similar to other symbionts, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> host shifts may occur through three main routes: parasitism, predation, and shared plant or other food sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The relative contributions of these three routes to the transmission process remain unclear. Multiple surveys report a significant similarity in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences between parasitoid wasps and their respective hosts, suggesting that parasitism may serve as a primary route for <italic>Wolbachia</italic>’s host shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). However, without quantitative tests, this observation could simply reflect a bias in research focus. For the intertrophic transmission of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> between parasitoid wasps and their hosts, experimental evidence has shown that parasitoid wasps can acquire hosts’ <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and vertically transmit them for several generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). However, it remains uncertain whether <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can be transferred from parasitoid wasps to their hosts. Some have argued that the transfer of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> between parasitoid wasps and their hosts is unidirectional, from host to wasp, as all parasitoid wasps emerge from their hosts, but parasitized hosts are eventually killed or castrated if not killed immediately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, our objective was to elucidate the role of parasitism and other potential routes in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> horizontal transmission and to investigate whether <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can be transferred from parasitoids to their hosts. We conducted a systematic survey of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> surface protein (<italic>wsp</italic>) sequences from the NCBI database and executed experiments using the whitefly <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> and its parasitoid wasp <italic>Encarsia formosa</italic>. Our study illuminates the crucial role of parasitism in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> intertrophic transmission, demonstrates the bidirectional nature of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transfer between parasitoids and their hosts, and thus expands the current understanding of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> horizontal transmission.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title><italic>Wolbachia</italic> is frequently transmitted between parasitoid wasps and their hosts</title>
<p>To investigate potential horizontal transmission of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, we retrieved 4685 <italic>wsp</italic> sequences from the NCBI database. Out of these 4685 sequences, 4253 could be assigned to 1377 species. We constructed a phylogenetic tree of <italic>wsp</italic> sequences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) and extracted the minimum genetic distances of <italic>wsp</italic> between every species pair. Based on the relationships between species, we defined the species pairs into categories “Parasitism”, “Plant-sharing”, “Predation” and “Others” (for details, see Methods and Materials). Among these species pairs, 16.5% (53 out of 321) in “Parasitism” pairs had the minimum interspecific <italic>wsp</italic> distances less than 0.01 (i.e., &gt; 99% identity). This proportion is significantly greater than the 6.3% (145 out of 2294) in “Plant-sharing” pairs, the 1.1% (13 out of 1146) in “Predation” pairs, and the 1.5% (14120 out of 943315) in “Others” pairs (<italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> test; all comparisons: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e<sup>-5</sup>). Consistently, the minimum interspecific <italic>wsp</italic> distances in “Parasitism” relationships were significantly shorter than those in “Plant-sharing”, “Predation”, and “Other” relationships (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>; Mann‒Whitney U test (MWUT); all comparisons: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-12). The minimum <italic>wsp</italic> distances in “Plant-sharing” were also significantly smaller than those in “Others” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>; MWUT; <italic>W</italic> = 730215564, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2e<sup>-16</sup>). However, the minimum <italic>wsp</italic> distances showed no significant difference between “Predation” and “Others” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>; MWUT; <italic>W</italic> = 699285646, <italic>p</italic> = 0.096).</p>

<p>To test whether these effects were merely due to sampling bias, we further obtained divergent times from TimeTree for 95.2% (901,615 out of 947,376) of the species pairs. As expected, the minimum interspecific <italic>wsp</italic> distance increased as the divergent time increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>; Spearman’s correlation; <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2e<sup>-16</sup>). Considering the impact of divergent time, linear regression analyses were conducted with the <italic>wsp</italic> distance as the dependent variable and divergent time as the independent variable. We found that both “Parasitism” and “Plant-sharing” had significant effects (both tests: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2e<sup>-16</sup>). The estimated effect of “Parasitism” (-0.28) was more profound than that of “Plant-sharing” (-0.13) (<italic>p</italic> = 3.9e<sup>-16</sup>). Given that we cannot obtain divergence times for all species pairs, especially for those closely related, we also classified the species pairs according to their last common ancestor. We divided all species pairs into six categories based on whether the two species belonged to the same genus, family, order, class, phylum, or kingdom. Similar results were observed (Supplementary Note 1). To further rule out potential influences of sampling bias, subsampling analyses were conducted using three methods: 1) shuffling species relationships, 2) subsampling by controlling divergent time, and 3) subsampling by controlling the last common ancestor (for details, see Methods and Materials). For all three methods, both “Parasitism” and “Plant-sharing”, but not “Predation”, exhibited significantly shorter minimum interspecific distances of <italic>wsp</italic> than randomly generated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1</xref>; both “Parasitism” and “Plant-sharing”: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; “Predation”: <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). These results confirmed that parasitism and plant-sharing promote interspecific transfers of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, rather than being due to sampling bias.</p>
<p>An example of frequent <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transfers between parasitoids and their hosts is observed in <italic>Trichogramma</italic> wasps and their lepidopteran hosts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). <italic>Trichogramma</italic> is a genus of generalist egg parasitoids, targeting mainly lepidopterans such as moths and butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> displays representative <italic>wsp</italic> sequences from <italic>Trichogramma</italic> and lepidopterans, illustrating potential interspecific transitions of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. In the analyzed dataset, 16 out of 23 (69.6%) <italic>Trichogramma</italic> species exhibited the minimum interspecific <italic>wsp</italic> distance of less than 0.01 with at least one lepidopteran species. Similarly, 79 out of 254 (31.1%) surveyed lepidopteran species displayed a minimum interspecific <italic>wsp</italic> distance of less than 0.01 with at least one <italic>Trichogramma</italic> species. These results suggest frequent <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transitions between <italic>Trichogramma</italic> wasps and lepidopterans.</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings support that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are frequently transmitted between parasitoid wasps and their hosts.</p>

<title><italic>Wsp</italic> phylogeny suggests transfer directions of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> between the whitefly <italic>B. tabaci</italic> and its parasitoid wasps</title>
<p>However, the interspecific identities of <italic>wsp</italic> between parasitoids and their hosts typically offer no clues about the direction of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transmission. We noticed frequent <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transfers between the whitefly <italic>B. tabaci</italic> and its parasitoid wasps (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Notably, one of the juvenile parasitoids of <italic>B. tabaci</italic> is <italic>En. formosa</italic>. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> induces parthenogenesis and has evolved into an obligate symbiont in <italic>En. formosa</italic>, exhibiting a 100% infection rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>).

<p>One clade of the <italic>wsp</italic> phylogeny contained 99 sequences from <italic>B. tabaci</italic>, 14 sequences from <italic>Encarsia</italic> and <italic>Eretmocerus</italic> parasitoid wasps of <italic>B. tabaci</italic>, and 8 other sequences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The prevalence of <italic>B. tabaci</italic> sequences interspersed with those of the parasitoids suggests that the transmission direction of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in this clade may be primarily from <italic>B. tabaci</italic> to its parasitoid wasps. Notably, in another clade of <italic>wsp</italic>, nine <italic>En. formosa</italic> and five <italic>B. tabaci wsp</italic> sequences are clustered together, along with one <italic>wsp</italic> sequence detected in cotton and 12 sequences from other parasitoid wasps of <italic>B. tabaci</italic>, such as <italic>En. inaron</italic>, <italic>En. lutea</italic>, <italic>En. bimaculata</italic>, <italic>Er. mundus</italic>, and <italic>Aimtus hesperidum</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Given that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is obligate with a 100% infection rate in <italic>En. formosa</italic>, it is reasonable to infer that the transmission direction of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in this clade was from <italic>En. formosa</italic> to <italic>B. tabaci</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>Wolbachia</italic> can be transmitted from the parasitoid wasp <italic>En. formosa</italic> to its whitefly host in cage experiments</title>
<p><italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> is a species complex of at least 40 cryptic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Infection rates of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> reported across multiple populations within these cryptic species exhibit dramatic fluctuations, ranging from 0% to 100% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). To investigate whether <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can be transmitted from parasitoid wasps to their whitefly hosts, we first established a <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free iso-female line of <italic>B. tabaci</italic> Q biotype. Subsequently, we conducted outdoor cage experiments using the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free <italic>B. tabaci</italic> and its parasitoid <italic>En. formosa</italic>, which was 100% infected with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). After introducing <italic>En. formosa</italic>, the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection rate in whiteflies increased from zero to 4.17% after 20 days and reached 10.83% after 100 days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>; ANOVA; <italic>F</italic><sub>5,17</sub>=11.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Correspondingly, the female ratio of whiteflies decreased from 69.17% to 60.08% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>; ANOVA; <italic>F</italic><sub>5,17</sub>=3.14, <italic>p</italic> = 0.048). In contrast, the whitefly population with no exposure to wasps maintained a zero infection rate of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), and the female ratio showed no significant changes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>; ANOVA; <italic>F</italic><sub>5,17</sub> = 0.076, <italic>p</italic> = 0.99). Additionally, the Sanger sequencing results showed that <italic>wsp</italic> sequences from both whitefly and <italic>En. formosa</italic> were identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from <italic>En. formosa</italic> can be rapidly transmitted to its whitefly host.</p>

<title>Parasitism failure transmits <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from the parasitoid wasp <italic>En. formosa</italic> to its whitefly host</title>
<p>We hypothesized that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was transmitted from parasitoid wasps to their hosts through unsuccessful parasitism. To test this hypothesis, we performed parasitism experiments on wasp individuals and applied irradiation treatment to wasps to reduce their parasitism success rate. After 60 Gy irradiation, the fecundity of <italic>En. formosa</italic> in 12 h significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>; Student’s t test; <italic>t</italic> = 12.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and the parasitism success rate on whiteflies drastically declined from 78.8% to 9.9% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>; Student’s t test; <italic>t</italic> = 13.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Correspondingly, the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection rate increased from 7.5% to 78.3% in whiteflies survived from parasitism (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>; Student’s t test; <italic>t</italic> = 6.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), despite a decrease in the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> titer in <italic>En. formosa</italic> post irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>The effect of parasitism on <italic>Wolbachia</italic> horizontal transmission</title>
<p>As with previous studies, we utilized the sequence similarities of <italic>wsp</italic> to infer potential horizontal transfers of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Here, we systematically investigated all <italic>wsp</italic> sequences in the NCBI database, enabling us to examine the effect of potential factors such as parasitism, plant-sharing, and predation. Our findings clearly indicate that parasitism exhibits shorter interspecific <italic>wsp</italic> distances than plant-sharing and predation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fact that herbivores sharing plants have identical <italic>wsp</italic> sequences does not necessarily imply plant-mediated horizontal transfer of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. This is because species that share the same plants often have recent divergent times (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), which increases the potential for hybridization and also sharing common parasitoid wasps. Therefore, the plant-sharing category overestimates the extent of plant-mediated <italic>Wolbachia</italic> horizontal transmission, further supporting the notion that parasitism is the primary route of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> horizontal transmission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Directions of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transmission between parasitoids and their hosts</title>
<p>However, investigations based on <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequence similarity have significant limitations. First, determining the direction of transfer is challenging based solely on the identity of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains. In certain exceptional cases, inferences of transfer direction might be drawn from the prevalence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection in the two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). For example, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is obligate in <italic>En. formosa</italic> and exhibits a 100% infection rate across all populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). This unique instance of horizontal <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transfer between <italic>En. formosa</italic> and its whitefly hosts provides compelling evidence, suggesting that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is likely transmitted from the parasitoid wasp to its host, rather than the reverse. Second, the PCR detection of <italic>wsp</italic> does not necessarily indicate horizontal transfer of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Instead, it could merely represent contamination that arises during predation or parasitism. The contamination can be <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected tissues or even just fragmented <italic>Wolbachia</italic> DNA, which could be found on the surface, within the gut, or inside the body cavity (as in the case of parasitized hosts).</p>
<p>To verify <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transmission from parasitoid wasps to their hosts, we conducted outdoor cage experiments and indoor tests using <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free whitefly <italic>B. tabaci</italic> and its parasitoid <italic>En. formosa</italic>. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was detected by nested PCR in whitefly adults (G<sub>0</sub>) that survived parasitism. <italic>Encarsia formosa</italic> parasitizes <italic>B. tabaci</italic> nymphs, which undergo a pseudo-pupal stage to reach adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). In our experiments, PCR detection of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> typically occurred 3∼7 days post-parasitism, minimizing risks of contamination from parasitism. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was also detected by PCR in subsequent generations (G1–G5) of whiteflies and induced notable fitness costs. PCR sequencing confirmed that the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain in the <italic>B. tabaci</italic> matched that of <italic>En. formosa</italic>. Furthermore, FISH assays revealed a tissue-specific distribution of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in both nymphs and adults of the whiteflies, matching previously reported patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Collectively, these findings provide compelling evidence that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from <italic>En. formosa</italic> can be horizontally transmitted to <italic>B. tabaci</italic>, beyond mere DNA contamination.</p>
<p>Although previous research has demonstrated that parasitoids can acquire <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from their hosts, the reverse direction of transmission, from host to parasitoid, has been largely overlooked and lacks supportive experimental evidence. One possible reason for this oversight is that all parasitoids emerge from their hosts, but hosts are eventually killed by the parasitism of parasitoid wasps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). However, parasitoid wasps’ success in parasitizing their hosts does not always reach 100% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Some hosts can manage to survive after parasitism. Various factors can influence the outcome of parasitoid-host interactions, including environmental conditions, the species and genotype of both wasps and hosts, the host’s age, and the presence of symbiotic bacteria within the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Moreover, we used radiation to reduce the parasitism success rate, which notably enhanced the transfer of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from <italic>En. formosa</italic> to its whitefly host.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Potential intertrophic transmission network of <italic>Wolbachia</italic></title>
<p>A previous study reported that parasitoid wasps can act as vectors to transmit <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, without the necessity of being infected themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Through the probing actions of the <italic>Eretmocerus</italic> parasitoid, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can be transmitted among whitefly hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). This is often referred to as the ’dirty needle’ model. Conversely, hosts can also serve as vectors for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transmission among parasitoid wasps. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can be transferred from infected to noninfected <italic>Trichogramma</italic> wasps through superparasitism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). However, the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transmission of these two modes is restricted within the same trophic level. In contrast, the transmission of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> between parasitoid wasps and hosts can cross trophic levels. Our findings, when combined with existing knowledge, suggest that the intertrophic transmission of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is bidirectional between parasitoid wasps and their hosts. This greatly enhances our understanding of the horizontal transmission of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found on NCBI that a strain of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> detected in the cotton plant was identical to the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from <italic>En. formosa</italic>, based on the <italic>wsp</italic> sequence and MSLT typing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and S6). This <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain was probably transmitted to the cotton plant from the feeding of whiteflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Given that <italic>En. formosa</italic> is 100% infected with its obligate <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain, a possible transmission route could be from <italic>En. formosa</italic> to whiteflies via parasitism and then to the cotton plant through the feeding of whiteflies. This finding indirectly supports our conclusion that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can be transmitted from parasitoid wasps to their hosts. This suggests that once the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> of parasitoids is transmitted to herbivorous hosts, it may further spread to host plants. The reverse transmission route can also be possible. It is likely that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>’s widespread and complex horizontal transmission network is established through such bidirectional transmissions across multiple trophic levels, e.g., &quot;plant-herbivore-parasitoid-hyperparasitoid&quot;. Further investigations are needed to test these hypotheses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title><italic>Wolbachia</italic> establishment after host transfers</title>
<p>Moreover, the physical transfer of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> often represents merely the first step of its establishment in a new host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Several subsequent steps are required for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to establish itself within new species, e.g., entry into germ cells, vertical transmission, and mechanisms that promote its spread within the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). First, we found that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from <italic>En. formosa</italic> was enriched in the ovaries of whiteflies and vertically transmitted after entering <italic>B. tabaci</italic>. However, the vertical transmission efficiency is low, ranging from 22.2% to 33.3%. We also noted an absence of reproductive manipulations by the newly introduced <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in whiteflies. The reduced female ratio after infection does not support the induction of parthenogenesis, feminization or male-killing by <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. We neither observed cytoplasmic incompatibility, where the mating of infected males and uninfected females resulted in reduced offspring hatching.</p>
<p>In contrast, the introduced <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from <italic>En. formosa</italic> reduced whiteflies’ egg laying and hatching, larval survival, and female proportion, demonstrating significant fitness costs in the new host. This is likely due to <italic>Wolbachia</italic>’s coevolution with its host in <italic>En. formosa</italic>, which may have led to the loss of its ability to colonize new host species. Given the low vertical transmission rate, high fitness cost, and lack of clear reproductive manipulations, it is reasonable to predict that the spread of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in its new host population will be limited. Finally, these factors, together with the frequency of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> introductions by parasitoids and its spread via parasitoid or plant vectors, shape the dynamics and equilibrium of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. These dynamics could shift with the emergence of reproductive manipulation or other beneficial phenotypes that promote <italic>Wolbachia</italic> spread, probably through gene mutation, recombination or horizontal gene transfer within <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). There are still many questions waiting to be further studied in these steps of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> host shifts.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>By investigating <italic>wsp</italic> sequences from the NCBI database, we found frequent intertrophic transmission of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> by parasitism but not predation.

<title>Effects of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> on whitefly fitness</title>
<p>Given the inability to obtain a whitefly strain with 100% <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection, we selected individuals from the infected whitefly population, which initially acquired <italic>Wolbachia</italic> through parasitism of irradiated <italic>En. formosa</italic> and subsequently maintained for over five generations. Whitefly nymphs were individually isolated into PCR tubes at their 4<sup>th</sup> instar stage. After emergence, female and male whitefly adults were paired and allowed to oviposit for five days within a Petri dish containing a tomato leaf. These adults were then removed for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> detection via PCR. For the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected female adults, we recorded several fitness parameters. These included the total number of eggs laid, the number of first instar nymphs, the developmental time from egg to eclosion, and the number of eclosed male and female offspring. This procedure was replicated with 60 pairs, and whiteflies from the original <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free population were used as controls. Additionally, we examined the effects of various paternal and maternal infection status combinations on whitefly fitness. A similar procedure was employed, with the exception that all whitefly adults were sourced from the infected population, and their infection status was determined through <italic>wsp</italic> nested PCR.</p>

<title>Statistics of the experimental data</title>
<p>Statistical analysis of experimental data was conducted using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The proportions were arcsine-square root transformed. Two independent samples were compared using Student’s T test. One-way ANOVA was performed for analysis of multiple samples. Means were then compared using Honest Student’s Tukey test. Data were visualized using GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA).</p>

<p>We divided all species pairs into six categories based on whether the two species belonged to the same genus, family, order, class, phylum, or kingdom. These categories represent different divergent levels between species pairs. Considering the impact of the divergent level, linear regression analyses were conducted with the wsp distance as the dependent variable and the category of divergent levels as the independent variable. We found that both “Parasitism” and “Plant-sharing” had significant effects (both tests: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2e<sup>-16</sup> 11 ), while “Predation” showed no significant effect (<italic>p</italic> = 0.58). The estimated effect of “Parasitism” (-0.28) was more profound than that of “Plant-sharing” (-0.14) (<italic>p</italic> = 1.32e<sup>-15</sup>).</p>

<p><italic>Encarsia formosa</italic> wasps that had emerged within 24 h were exposed to Co<sup>60</sup> radiation at doses of 60, 80 and 100 Gy. On day 15 after irradiation treatments, the survival rate of adult wasps was 73.33 ± 3.33% in the nonirradiated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. S8</xref>). In contrast, the survival rates were 45.56 ± 1.92%, 7.78 ± 6.94%, and 3.33 ± 3.33% after exposure to 60 Gy, 80 Gy, and 100 Gy radiation, respectively. The survival rate of adult wasps decreased with increasing irradiation doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. S8</xref>; ANOVA; F3,8 = 34.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). After irradiation, the ovaries were dissected, and changes in egg dimensions were recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig. S9</xref>). Following 80 and 100 Gy irradiation, almost no eggs were detected starting from day 4, while after 60 Gy irradiation, eggs were nearly absent starting from day 9. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10</xref> shows the ovaries on days 1, 4, and 9 post-exposure to various irradiation doses. In the nonirradiated <italic>En. formosa</italic>, there were no obvious changes in the morphology of the ovarioles or oocytes from days 1 to 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10</xref>). However, 4 days post-irradiation, the ovarioles of wasps exposed to 60 Gy appeared thinner, and some oocytes had dissolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10</xref>). In addition, the ovarioles of wasps exposed to 80 Gy and 100 Gy had become transparent, with the majority of the oocytes disappearing and becoming invisible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10</xref>).  Parasitism experiments demonstrated that the nonirradiated <italic>En. formosa</italic> laid 7.3 ± 1.1 eggs in 12 h. This number significantly dropped to 3.2 ± 0.9 eggs for wasps exposed to 60 Gy radiation (Fig. 3a; Student's t test; <italic>t</italic> = 12.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The wasps exposed to 80 Gy and 100 Gy radiation almost completely ceased egg laying, resulting in insufficient data collection.</p>

<p>Summary and Strengths:</p>
<p>The ability of Wolbachia to be transmitted horizontally during parasitoid wasp infections is supported by phylogenetic data here and elsewhere. Experimental analyses have shown evidence of wasp-to-wasp transmission during coinfection (eg Huigins et al), host to wasp transmission (eg Heath et al), and mechanical ('dirty needle') transmission from host to host (Ahmed et al). To my knowledge this manuscript provides the first experimental evidence of wasp to host transmission. Given the strong phylogenetic pattern of host-parasitoid Wolbachia sharing, this may be of general importance in explaining the distribution of Wolbachia across arthropods. This is of interest as Wolbachia is extremely common in the natural world and influences many aspects of host biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The first observation of the manuscript is that the Wolbachia strains in hosts are more closely related to those in their parasitoids. This has been reported on multiple occasions before, dating back to the late 1990s. The introduction cites five such papers (the observation is made in other studies too that could be cited) but then dismisses them by stating &quot;However, without quantitative tests, this observation could simply reflect a bias in research focus.&quot; As these studies include carefully collected datasets that were analysed appropriately, I felt this claim of novelty was rather strong. It is unclear why downloading every sequence in GenBank avoids any perceived biases, when presumably the authors are reanalysing the data in these papers.</p>
<p>I do not doubt the observation that host-parasitoid pairs tend to share related Wolbachia, as it is corroborated by other studies, the effect size is large, and the case study of whitefly is clearcut. It is also novel to do this analysis on such a large dataset. However, the statistical analysis used is incorrect as the observations are pseudo-replicated due to phylogenetic non-independence. When analysing comparative data like this it is essential to correct for the confounding effects of related species tending to be similar due to common ancestry. In this case, it is well-known that this is an issue as it is a repeated observation that related hosts are infected by related Wolbachia. However, the authors treat every pairwise combination of species (nearly a million pairs) as an independent observation. Addressing this issue is made more complex because there are both the host and symbiont trees to consider. The additional analysis in lines 123-124 (including shuffling species pairs) does not explicitly address this issue.</p>
<p>The sharing of Wolbachia between whitefly and their parasitoids is very striking, although this has been reported before (eg the authors recently published a paper entitled &quot;Diversity and Phylogenetic Analyses Reveal Horizontal Transmission of Endosymbionts Between Whiteflies and Their Parasitoids&quot;). In Lines 154-164 it is suggested that from the tree the direction of transfer between host and parasitoid can be inferred from the data. This is not obvious to me given the poor resolution of the tree due to low sequence divergence. There are established statistical approaches to test the direction of trait changes on a tree that could have been used (a common approach is to use the software BEAST).</p>

<p>The paper by Yan et al. aims to provide evidence for horizontal transmission of the intracellular bacterial symbiont Wolbachia from parasitoid wasps to their whitefly hosts. In my opinion, the paper in its current form consists of major flaws.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The dogma in the field is that although horizontal transmission events of Wolbachia occur, in most systems they are so rare that the chances of observing them in the lab are very slim.</p>
<p>
For the idea of bacteria moving from a parasitoid to its host, the authors have rightfully cited the paper by Hughes, et al. (2001), which presents the main arguments against the possibility of documenting such transmissions. Thus, if the authors want to provide data that contradict the large volume of evidence showing the opposite, they should present a very strong case.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the paper fails to provide such concrete evidence. Moreover, it seems the work presented does not meet the basic scientific standards.</p>
<p>My main reservations are:</p>
<p>- I think the distribution pattern of bacteria stained by the probes in the FISH pictures presented in Figure 4 looks very much like Portiera, the primary symbiont found in the bacterium of all whitefly species. In order to make a strong case, the authors need to include Portiera probes along with the Wolbachia ones.</p>
<p>- If I understand the methods correctly, the phylogeny presented in Figure 2a is supposed to be based on a wide search for Wolbachia wsp gene done on the NCBI dataset (p. 348). However, when I checked the origin of some of the sequences used in the tree to show the similarity of Wolbachia between Bemisia tabaci and its parasitoids, I found that most of them were deposited by the authors themselves in the course of the current study (I could not find this mentioned in the text), or originated in a couple of papers that in my opinion should not have been published to begin with.</p>
<p>- The authors fail to discuss or even acknowledge a number of published studies that specifically show no horizontal transmission, such as the one claimed to be detected in the study presented.</p>

<p>This is a very ordinary research paper. The horizontal of endosymbionts, including Wolbachia, Rickettsia etc. has been reported in detail in the last 10 years, and parasitoid vectored as well as plant vectored horizontal transmission is the mainstream of research. For example, Ahmed et al. 2013 PLoS One, 2015 PLoS Pathogens, Chiel et al. 2014 Enviromental Entomology, Ahmed et al. 2016 BMC Evolution Biology, Qi et al. 2019 JEE, Liu et al. 2023 Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, all of these reported the parasitoid vectored horizontal transmission of endosymbiont.

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary and Strengths:</p>
<p>The ability of Wolbachia to be transmitted horizontally during parasitoid wasp infections is supported by phylogenetic data here and elsewhere. Experimental analyses have shown evidence of wasp-to-wasp transmission during coinfection (eg Huigins et al), host to wasp transmission (eg Heath et al), and mechanical ('dirty needle') transmission from host to host (Ahmed et al). To my knowledge this manuscript provides the first experimental evidence of wasp to host transmission. Given the strong phylogenetic pattern of host-parasitoid Wolbachia sharing, this may be of general importance in explaining the distribution of Wolbachia across arthropods. This is of interest as Wolbachia is extremely common in the natural world and influences many aspects of host biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The first observation of the manuscript is that the Wolbachia strains in hosts are more closely related to those in their parasitoids. This has been reported on multiple occasions before, dating back to the late 1990s. The introduction cites five such papers (the observation is made in other studies too that could be cited) but then dismisses them by stating &quot;However, without quantitative tests, this observation could simply reflect a bias in research focus.&quot; As these studies include carefully collected datasets that were analysed appropriately, I felt this claim of novelty was rather strong. It is unclear why downloading every sequence in GenBank avoids any perceived biases, when presumably the authors are reanalysing the data in these papers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and we will make the necessary amendments in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I do not doubt the observation that host-parasitoid pairs tend to share related Wolbachia, as it is corroborated by other studies, the effect size is large, and the case study of whitefly is clearcut. It is also novel to do this analysis on such a large dataset. However, the statistical analysis used is incorrect as the observations are pseudo-replicated due to phylogenetic non-independence. When analysing comparative data like this it is essential to correct for the confounding effects of related species tending to be similar due to common ancestry. In this case, it is well-known that this is an issue as it is a repeated observation that related hosts are infected by related Wolbachia. However, the authors treat every pairwise combination of species (nearly a million pairs) as an independent observation. Addressing this issue is made more complex because there are both the host and symbiont trees to consider. The additional analysis in lines 123-124 (including shuffling species pairs) does not explicitly address this issue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur with your observation regarding the non-independence of the data due to phylogenetic relationships. While common phylogenetic correction methods are indeed not directly applicable to wsp distances between species pairs, we are investigating the potential of phylogenetic mixed models to address this issue. We hope to include a revised analysis using this approach in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The sharing of Wolbachia between whitefly and their parasitoids is very striking, although this has been reported before (eg the authors recently published a paper entitled &quot;Diversity and Phylogenetic Analyses Reveal Horizontal Transmission of Endosymbionts Between Whiteflies and Their Parasitoids&quot;). In Lines 154-164 it is suggested that from the tree the direction of transfer between host and parasitoid can be inferred from the data. This is not obvious to me given the poor resolution of the tree due to low sequence divergence. There are established statistical approaches to test the direction of trait changes on a tree that could have been used (a common approach is to use the software BEAST).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments regarding the transfer direction of Wolbachia between whiteflies and their parasitoids. We acknowledge the concern about the resolution of the phylogenetic tree and the inference of the direction of Wolbachia transmission based on the available data. We considered the high infection frequency and obligate nature of Wolbachia in En. formosa, which exhibits a 100% infection rate, as a strong indicator that recent transmission of Wolbachia in this clade likely occurred from En. formosa to B. tabaci. We appreciate your recommendation and will ensure that our conclusions are supported by a more statistically sound approach. As you suggested, we will employ the software BEAST to rigorously test the direction of transmission, and we will revise our statements accordingly.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The paper by Yan et al. aims to provide evidence for horizontal transmission of the intracellular bacterial symbiont Wolbachia from parasitoid wasps to their whitefly hosts. In my opinion, the paper in its current form consists of major flaws.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The dogma in the field is that although horizontal transmission events of Wolbachia occur, in most systems they are so rare that the chances of observing them in the lab are very slim.</p>
<p>For the idea of bacteria moving from a parasitoid to its host, the authors have rightfully cited the paper by Hughes, et al. (2001), which presents the main arguments against the possibility of documenting such transmissions. Thus, if the authors want to provide data that contradict the large volume of evidence showing the opposite, they should present a very strong case.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the paper fails to provide such concrete evidence. Moreover, it seems the work presented does not meet the basic scientific standards.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for your critical perspective on our work. Nonetheless, we are confident in the credibility of our findings regarding the horizontal transmission of Wolbachia from En. formosa to B. tabaci. Our study has documented this phenomenon through phylogenetic tree analyses, and we have further substantiated our observations with rigorous experiments in both cages and petri dishes. The horizontal transfer of Wolbachia was confirmed via PCR, with the wsp sequences in B. tabaci showing complete concordance with those in En. formosa. Additionally, we utilized FISH, vertical transmission experiments, and phenotypic assays to demonstrate that the transferred Wolbachia could be vertically transmitted and induce significant fitness cost in B. tabaci. All experiments were conducted with strict negative controls and a sufficient number of replicates to ensure reliability, thereby meeting basic scientific standards. The collective evidence we present points to a definitive case of Wolbachia transmission from the parasitoid En. formosa to the whitefly B. tabaci.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>My main reservations are:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>I think the distribution pattern of bacteria stained by the probes in the FISH pictures presented in Figure 4 looks very much like Portiera, the primary symbiont found in the bacterium of all whitefly species. In order to make a strong case, the authors need to include Portiera probes along with the Wolbachia ones.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are very grateful for your critical evaluation regarding the specificity of FISH in our study. We assure the reliability of our FISH results based on several reasons.</p>
<p>1. We implemented rigorous negative controls which exhibited no detectable signal, thereby affirming the specificity of our hybridization. 2) The central region of the whitefly nymphs is a typical oviposition site for En. formosa. Post-parasitism, we observed FISH signals around the introduced parasitoid eggs, distinct from bacteriocyte cells which are rich in endosymbionts including Portiera (FIG 3e-f). This observation supports the high specificity of our FISH method. 3) In the G3 whiteflies, we detected the presence of Wolbachia in bacteriocytes in nymphs and at the posterior end of eggs in adult females (FIG 4). This distribution pattern aligns with previously reported localizations of Wolbachia in B. tabaci (Shi et al., 2016; Skaljac et al., 2013). Furthermore, the distribution of Wolbachia in the whiteflies does indeed exhibit some overlap with that of Portiera (Skaljac et al., 2013; Bing et al., 2014). 4) The primers used in our FISH assays have been widely cited (Heddi et al., 1999) and validated in studies on B. tabaci and other systems (Guo et al., 2018; Hegde et al., 2024; Krafsur et al., 2020; Rasgon et al., 2006; Uribe-Alvarez et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2013).
Taking all these points into consideration, we stand by the reliability of our FISH results.</p>

<list-item><p>If I understand the methods correctly, the phylogeny presented in Figure 2a is supposed to be based on a wide search for Wolbachia wsp gene done on the NCBI dataset (p. 348). However, when I checked the origin of some of the sequences used in the tree to show the similarity of Wolbachia between Bemisia tabaci and its parasitoids, I found that most of them were deposited by the authors themselves in the course of the current study (I could not find this mentioned in the text), or originated in a couple of papers that in my opinion should not have been published to begin with.</p>

<p>We appreciate your meticulous examination of the sources for our sequence data. All the sequences included in our phylogenetic analysis were indeed downloaded from the NCBI database as of July 2023. The sequences used to illustrate the similarity of Wolbachia between B. tabaci and its parasitoids include those from our previously published study (Qi et al., 2019), which were sequenced from field samples. Additionally, some sequences were also obtained from other laboratories (Ahmed et al., 2009; Baldo et al., 2006; Van Meer et al., 1999). We acknowledge that in our prior research (Qi et al., 2019), the sequences were directly submitted to NCBI and, regrettably, we did not update the corresponding publication information after the article were published. It is not uncommon for sequences on NCBI, with some never being followed by a published paper (e.g., FJ710487- FJ710511 and JF426137-JF426149), or not having their associated publication details updated post-publication (for instance, sequences MH918776-MH918794 from Qi et al., 2019, and KF017873-KF017878 from Fattah-Hosseini et al., 2018). We recognize that this practice can lead to confusion and apologize for the oversight in our work.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This is a very ordinary research paper. The horizontal of endosymbionts, including Wolbachia, Rickettsia etc. has been reported in detail in the last 10 years, and parasitoid vectored as well as plant vectored horizontal transmission is the mainstream of research. For example, Ahmed et al. 2013 PLoS One, 2015 PLoS Pathogens, Chiel et al. 2014 Enviromental Entomology, Ahmed et al. 2016 BMC Evolution Biology, Qi et al. 2019 JEE, Liu et al. 2023 Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, all of these reported the parasitoid vectored horizontal transmission of endosymbiont. While Caspi-Fluger et al. 2012 Proc Roy Soc B, Chrostek et al. 2017 Frontiers in Microbiology, Li et al. 2017 ISME Journal, Li et al. 2017 FEMS, Shi et al. 2024 mBio, all of these reported the plant vectored horizontal transmission of endosymbiont. For the effects of endosymbiont on the biology of the host, Ahmed et al. 2015 PLoS Pathogens explained the effects in detail.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your insightful comments and for highlighting the relevant literature in the field of horizontal transmission of endosymbionts, including Wolbachia and Rickettsia. After careful consideration of the studies you have mentioned, we believe that our work presents significant novel contributions to the field. 1) Regarding the parasitoid-mediated horizontal transmission of Wolbachia, most of the cited articles, such as Ahmed et al. 2013 in PLoS One and Ahmed et al. 2016 in BMC Evolutionary Biology, propose hypotheses but do not provide definitive evidence. The transmission of Wolbachia within the whitefly cryptic species complex (Ahmed et al. 2013) or between moths and butterflies (Ahmed et al. 2016) could be mediated by parasitoids, plants, or other unknown pathways. 2) Chiel et al. (2014 in Environmental Entomology reported “no evidence for horizontal transmission of Wolbachia between and within trophic levels” in their study system. 3) The literature you mentioned about Rickettsia, rather than Wolbachia, indirectly reflects the relative scarcity of evidence for Wolbachia horizontal transmission. For example, the evidence for plant-mediated transmission of Wolbachia remains isolated, with Li et al. 2017 in The ISME Journal being one of the few reports supporting this mode of transmission. 4) While the effects of endosymbionts on their hosts are not the central focus of our study, the effects of transgenerational Wolbachia on whiteflies are primarily demonstrated to confirm the infection of Wolbachia into whiteflies. Furthermore, the effects we report of Wolbachia on whiteflies are notably different from those reported by Ahmed et al. 2015 in PLoS Pathogens, likely due to different whitefly species and Wolbachia strains. 6) More importantly, our study reveals a mechanism of parasitoid-mediated horizontal transmission of Wolbachia that is distinct from the mechanical transmission suggested by Ahmed et al. 2015 in PLoS Pathogens. Their study implies transmission primarily through host-feeding contamination, without the need for Wolbachia to infect the parasitoid, suggesting host-to-host transmission at the same trophic level. In contrast, our findings demonstrate transmission from parasitoids to hosts through unsuccessful parasitism, which represents cross-trophic level transmission. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that Wolbachia can be transmitted from parasitoids to hosts. We believe these clarifications and the novel insights provided by our research contribute valuable knowledge to the field.</p>
