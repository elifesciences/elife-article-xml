<title>Abstract</title><p>The integrated stress response (ISR) is a conserved pathway in eukaryotic cells that is activated in response to multiple sources of cellular stress. Although acute activation of this pathway restores cellular homeostasis, intense or prolonged ISR activation perturbs cell function and may contribute to neurodegeneration. DNL343 is an investigational CNS-penetrant small molecule ISR inhibitor designed to activate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) and suppress aberrant ISR activation. DNL343 reduced CNS ISR activity and neurodegeneration in a dose-dependent manner in two established <italic>in vivo</italic> models – the optic nerve crush injury and an eIF2B loss of function (LOF) mutant – demonstrating neuroprotection in both and preventing motor dysfunction in the LOF mutant mouse. Treatment with DNL343 at a late stage of disease in the LOF model reversed elevation in plasma biomarkers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and prevented premature mortality. Several proteins and metabolites that are dysregulated in the LOF mouse brains were normalized by DNL343 treatment, and this response is detectable in human biofluids. Several of these biomarkers show differential levels in CSF and plasma from patients with vanishing white matter disease (VWMD), a neurodegenerative disease that is driven by eIF2B LOF and chronic ISR activation, supporting their potential translational relevance. This study demonstrates that DNL343 is a brain penetrant ISR inhibitor capable of attenuating neurodegeneration in mouse models and identifies several biomarker candidates that may be used to assess treatment responses in the clinic.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) is a heterodecameric protein that plays an indispensable role in regulating translation of mRNA into protein. This process is initiated by the assembly of GTP-bound eIF2 and methionine-carrying initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi) into a ternary complex (TC) which, along with other initiation factors, delivers Met-tRNAi to the AUG start codon. Upon recognition of the start codon, GTP is hydrolyzed, and the resulting eIF2-GDP dissociates from the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gebauer and Hentze 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch 2009</xref>). The continual success of translation initiation is dependent on replenishment of active GTP-bound eIF2 through the exchange of GDP for GTP by eIF2B, a dedicated guanidine exchange factor for eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bogorad, Lin et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hanson, Hodgson et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>eIF2B activity is dynamically modulated by the integrated stress response (ISR), an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that is activated in response to diverse cellular stresses, such as viral infection, amino acid deprivation, protein misfolding, and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pakos-Zebrucka, Koryga et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Costa-Mattioli and Walter 2020</xref>). ISR activation centers on the phosphorylation eIF2B binding partner, eIF2, which led to structural changes that alter its interaction with eIF2B, turning it from a substrate into a competitive inhibitor of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of eIF2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Adomavicius, Guaita et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gordiyenko, Llacer et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kenner, Anand et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Schoof, Boone et al. 2021</xref>). As a result, the availability of eIF2-GTP and the subsequent TC become limited, leading to attenuation of global translation. This also gives rise to the paradoxical increase in translation of some stress response proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harding, Novoa et al. 2000</xref>). A common feature of these proteins are upstream open reading frames (uORF) in the 5’ region that act as translational decoys to the main protein coding sequence (MCS). Under non-stress conditions these regulatory elements are translated instead of the MCS. However, during ISR activation, when TC and initiation cofactors are limited, translation of these uORFs are bypassed in place of the MCS due to leaky ribosomal scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wethmar, Smink et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Young and Wek 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen and Tarn 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Costa-Mattioli and Walter 2020</xref>). One such protein is activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vattem and Wek 2004</xref>), the primary effector of the ISR which regulates the expression of a wide range of adaptive genes aimed at restoring homeostasis or, in the event that the stress signal cannot be mitigated, triggering apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Walter and Ron 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Dysregulation of the ISR pathway has pathological consequences. In human and rodent models, mutations that lead to persistent activation of the ISR are associated with neurological disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harding, Zhang et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Borck, Shin et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Abdulkarim, Nicolino et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kernohan, Tetreault et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Skopkova, Hennig et al. 2017</xref>) and those that affect the eIF2B subunits cause a rare leukodystrophy called vanishing white matter disease (VWMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">van der Knaap, Pronk et al. 2006</xref>). Additionally, evidence of constitutive pathway activation has been found in neurodegenerative conditions like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ilieva, Ayala et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ito, Yamada et al. 2009</xref>) and Alzheimer’s disease (Hoozemans, Veerhuis et al. 2005, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Unterberger, Hoftberger et al. 2006</xref>, Hoozemans, van Haastert et al. 2009, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Stutzbach, Xie et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Storkebaum, Rosenblum et al. 2023</xref>), suggesting that dysregulation of the ISR may contribute to these disorders.</p>
<p>Pharmacological modulation of the ISR is a key area of therapeutic research and has been accomplished through a variety of approaches, including inhibition of upstream ISR kinases, inhibition of eIF2 phosphatases, and activation of eIF2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hetz, Axten et al. 2019</xref>). Inhibition of upstream kinases such as PERK has been shown to cause on-target toxicity, which limits their therapeutic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Halliday, Radford et al. 2015</xref>). In contrast, eIF2B activators have proven to be well tolerated in animal models while also improving memory and neurological deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sidrauski, Acosta-Alvear et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chou, Krukowski et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbink, Wisse et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wong, LeBon et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Krukowski, Nolan et al. 2020</xref>). The first published eIF2B activator, ISRIB, binds to and stabilizes the eIF2B complex in its decameric form and promotes the GEF activity of eIF2B regardless of the presence of phosphorylated eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tsai, Miller-Vedam et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zyryanova, Weis et al. 2018</xref>). ISRIB and its analog, 2BAct, were also neuroprotective in an eIF2B mutant mouse model of VWMD that displays ISR-mediated neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbink, Wisse et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wong, LeBon et al. 2019</xref>). Despite this, further development of ISRIB is hampered by its poor solubility and oral bioavailability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang, Tan et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbink, Wisse et al. 2019</xref>), and 2BAct due to its cardiovascular liability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wong, LeBon et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>DNL343 is an investigational small molecule eIF2B activator that is undergoing clinical development for ALS (NCT05006352, NCT05842941). In immortalized cells and iPSC-derived neurons expressing ALS-linked mutations that are exposed to stressors, DNL343 inhibits the ISR and both prevents and reverses stress granule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sun, Tsai et al. 2023</xref>). The high potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic profile of DNL343 across preclinical species make it an ideal tool for studying ISR inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Osipov 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we show that DNL343 reduces ISR activation and neurodegeneration brought on acutely by an optic nerve crush (ONC) injury or chronically by a germline eIF2B LOF mutation in mice. We also show that DNL343 treatment, initiated at a late stage of disease which more accurately replicates a clinical dosing paradigm, reversed these ISR and neurodegeneration biomarkers and prevented premature mortality in the eIF2B LOF mutant. Further, we identified CNS biomarkers of the ISR and neurodegeneration that are measurable in biofluids and showed data that support their translational relevance in samples from patients with VWMD and potentially other indications that are mediated by ISR activation.</p>

<title>DNL343 is a novel brain-penetrant ISR inhibitor</title>
<p>To study the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of our investigational small molecule eIF2B activator, DNL343 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>), we first demonstrated its suitability for acute and chronic dosing and evaluated brain exposure in wild-type mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>).

<title>DNL343 reduced ISR activation and neuronal loss in an optic nerve crush injury model in mice</title>
<p>To determine the impact of DNL343 on ISR dependent neurodegeneration, we first utilized an ONC injury model. This model was selected based on the precedence for ISR activation and reproducible degeneration within a relatively short time period following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larhammar, Huntwork-Rodriguez et al. 2017</xref>). ONC was performed on the left optic nerve of wild-type mice, following which mice were given either vehicle or increasing doses of DNL343 once daily <italic>via</italic> oral gavage. (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). The mice were euthanized at 2 or 14 days following the ONC procedure. Unbound concentrations of DNL343 measured in plasma or brain were similar, again confirming CNS penetration (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). DNL343 exposure increased in a dose-proportionate manner and demonstrated low variability between animals (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). We then measured the expression of ISR-dependent transcripts known to be altered in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larhammar, Huntwork-Rodriguez et al. 2017</xref>) in the retina to confirm DNL343 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that many of these transcripts were robustly increased in the ipsilateral retina <italic>vs</italic> undamaged contralateral control retinas at 2 days and, to a lesser extent, 14 days after the ONC (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). DNL343 modulated the expression level of these ISR-dependent transcripts in a dose-dependent fashion (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>) confirming its ability to inhibit ISR <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, the highest dose of DNL343 at 12 mg/kg reduced axonal degeneration (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>) and the two highest doses, 3 and 12 mg/kg, led to significant reduction in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss as measured by immunofluorescence analysis of neuronal markers (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-F</xref></bold>).

<title>eIF2B loss of function causes CNS ISR activation in the mouse</title>
<p>We next sought to develop a model that displays chronic ISR activation in the CNS to further test the effect of DNL343 treatment <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, we generated an eIF2B LOF mouse model by knocking in an <italic>Eif2b5 R191H</italic> point mutation that is homologous to the VWMD-causing human <italic>R195H</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fogli, Wong et al. 2002</xref>). Homozygous knock-in mice will hereafter be referred to as eIF2B HOM. Previous reports of independently generated <italic>Eif2b5 R191H</italic> mutant showed ISR overactivation in the CNS and disease phenotypes relevant to human VWMD, such as demyelination and motor function deficit, that ultimately led to premature mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dooves, Bugiani et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbink, Wisse et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wong, LeBon et al. 2019</xref>). In line with this, characterization of select transcript markers in our eIF2B HOM model at 13-19 weeks of age confirmed ISR activation in the brain of mice homozygous for the mutation, but not in heterozygous or wild-type littermates (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref></bold>). The robust elevation of ISR markers were further confirmed in a bulk brain RNA sequencing analysis of a separate cohort of homozygous mutant and wild-type littermates. Known ISR markers rank highly among the 492 protein-coding genes that showed significant differences between eIF2B HOM and wild-type animals (FDR &lt;5%, <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>, Supplemental Table 1</bold>). Genes reported as upregulated due to eIF2B loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wong, LeBon et al. 2019</xref>) were significantly enriched (gene set enrichment p-value &lt;10<sup>-20</sup>).</p>
<p>ISR activation appears to be most prominent in the CNS since tissues such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or spleen have no marked upregulation of the ISR markers in homozygous mice relative to wild-type controls (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">D</xref></bold>). This is consistent with the reported CNS and peripheral phenotypes of independently generated models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dooves, Bugiani et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbink, Wisse et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wong, LeBon et al. 2019</xref>)..</p>

<title>Proteomic analysis reveals distinct brain &amp; CSF signatures of ISR activation and neurodegeneration in eIF2B mutant mice</title>
<p>To further characterize the consequences of eIF2B LOF mutation in the mouse brain, we performed bulk brain proteomic characterization on an independent cohort of 11-15-week-old mice. Out of the 7,939 proteins detected, we found 96 proteins that showed significant alteration in the eIF2B HOM genotype relative to wild-type controls (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Of these, 45 proteins were also dysregulated on a transcriptional level (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1 B</xref></bold>) suggesting some overlap between the transcriptomic and proteomic changes. In keeping with this, proteins that are regulated by ATF4, a transcription factor the levels of which are known to be ISR-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pakos-Zebrucka, Koryga et al. 2016</xref>), are among those that are most significantly elevated, such as solute carrier (SLC) membrane transport proteins (SLC3A2, SLC7A1, SLC7A1), cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Results from the proteomic analysis also show that disturbances in metabolic pathways appear to be the main consequences of the eIF2B LOF mutation on the brain proteome. Indeed, pathways related to metabolism and transport appear to dominate the 5 of the most significantly (adjusted P &lt;0.05) dysregulated protein sets identified in the fast pre-rank protein set enrichment analysis (FPSEA) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). This is further supported by our unsupervised principal component analysis which shows that the top proteins contributing to genotype separation are those that are involved in lipid, amino acid, and 1-carbon metabolism (ACSS1, PSAT1, PHGDH, SLC3A2, SHMT2, SLC7A1, ALDH18A1) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>, dim2). Taken together, these results show that eIF2B LOF leads to gross cerebral metabolic derangement that may contribute to the neurodegenerative phenotype associated with this model.</p>

<p>To understand how the ISR-dependent changes in brain proteins correlate to more clinically translatable fluid biomarkers, we also interrogated the CSF proteome of these eIF2B HOM mice. CSF tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomic analysis identified a total of 572 unique proteins, 472 of which were detected in both CSF and the brain. In contrast to the brain, variances in CSF proteins were insufficient to clearly discriminate eIF2B HOM from wild-type mice by PCA analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>). Reflecting this poorer resolution, univariate analysis identified a total of 58 proteins that were changed with unadjusted P &lt;0.05 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). Notably, the protein with the largest fold decrease in the eIF2B HOM CSF was MUP17 (log<sub>2</sub> fold change (FC): -1.3, adjusted P &lt;0.05), a major urinary protein (MUP) and a member of the broader lipocalin protein family, which has been shown to be decreased by ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Weber, Yang et al. 2022</xref>). Several proteins associated with microglial activation (CSF1R, LYSZ, and SIRPA) and matrisome remodeling (COL3A1, ITGLB1, CLSTN1) were also higher in homozygous mice relative to wild-type controls (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). To further examine subtle pathway moderations in the CSF proteome, fast pre-ranked protein set enrichment (FPSEA) analysis was performed. The results showed a highly significant increase in proteins related to the mitochondrial TCA cycle and respiratory electron transport and decreases in proteins associated with cell cycle (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>)</bold>. While their magnitude of changes were modest, alterations in CSF levels of proteins associated with microglial activation and matrisome remodeling may indicate elevations in inflammatory burden associated with demyelination and neurodegeneration phenotypes seen in humans and other mouse models with mutations in the eIF2B protein (Bugiani, Vuong et al. 2018, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbink, Wisse et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wong, LeBon et al. 2019</xref>). Taken together, our data show very different proteome changes in the brain and CSF from eIF2B HOM mice and collectively, these data point to the CSF proteome representing biomarkers of demyelination and inflammation in the model while the changes in the brain appear to more directly represent cellular ISR dysregulation.</p>

<p>A 13-week treatment with DNL343 with doses that ranged from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg showed significant (P &lt;0.05) dose-dependent normalization of proteins that were downregulated in brains of eIF2B HOM mice (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, top cluster</bold>). These included APOE, SLC7A10, CD63, TST and ETNPPL that are associated with cholesterol, exosome, amino acid transport, detoxification and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Chronic treatment also lowered key ISR proteins that were significantly upregulated in eIF2B HOM brains, including proteins involved in serine/glycine/1-carbon metabolism (PSAT1, ALDH1L2, CTH) and alanine/glutamine/leucine transporters (SLC3A2, SLC7A11, SLC7A3) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom cluster</bold>). Further, we identified proteins of amino acid metabolism pathway to be most significantly enriched in DNL343-<italic>vs</italic> vehicle-treated eIF2B HOM mice (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). CSF proteomic analysis also showed a clear DNL343 dose-dependent correction of protein biomarkers of microglial activation such as CSF1R, HEXB, CTSS, LYZ2, and CTSB (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). As predicted by these results, the pathway most impacted by DNL343 treatment was identified to be those that were associated with immune system responses (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). As increased abundance of these proteins in the CSF have been associated with higher microglia activation, their correction by DNL343 may reflect downregulation of inflammation observed in the mutant mice. Furthermore, significant increases in 7-ketocholesterol and CE accumulation observed in eIF2B HOM mice were also dose-dependently corrected by chronic DNL343 treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>). Together these omics studies revealed that DNL343 can robustly correct biomarkers of ISR activation in the brain and markers of gliosis and demyelination in the CSF of eIF2B HOM mice at doses ≥3 mg/kg.</p>

To assess the potential of these biomarkers for clinical translation, we leveraged plasma and CSF samples from patients with VWMD (<bold>Supplemental Table 2</bold>), a neurodegenerative disease that is driven by eIF2B mutations and chronic ISR overactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">van der Knaap, Bonkowsky et al. 2022</xref>), in addition to samples from DNL343-treated eIF2B HOM mice.</p>
<p>Both mRNA and protein levels of GDF-15 were increased in the eIF2B HOM brains relative to wild-type controls and were dose-dependently reduced by DNL343 treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A and B</xref></bold>). These changes were replicated in a separate cohort of animals (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">B</xref></bold>) and were also detected in the mouse CSF (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 4C</xref></bold>) suggesting that detection of this biomarker in the fluid could be a potential surrogate to assess CNS ISR activation and modulation. GDF-15 protein levels were also elevated in the CSF and plasma of VWMD patients relative to healthy controls (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C and D</xref></bold>) despite the age dependent increase in this biomarker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lockhart, Saudek et al. 2020</xref>) that is particularly apparent in the plasma of patients for which longitudinal samples were available (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 5A</xref></bold>). The astrocyte activation marker GFAP was elevated in eIF2B HOM mice with levels of mRNA in the brain and protein in the plasma both being corrected by DNL343 treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E and F</xref></bold>). In line with these data in the preclinical disease model, GFAP protein concentrations were higher in the CSF and plasma from VWMD patients relative to controls (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G and H</xref></bold>). Although both TIMP-1 and MCP-1 levels were elevated in the eIF2B HOM mice, TIMP-1 levels were not altered in VWMD patients relative to controls in either the CSF or plasma and MCP-1 protein was only elevated in VWMD patient plasma (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I-P</xref></bold>). Additionally, levels of other potential neurodegeneration biomarkers, interleukin 18 (IL-18) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), did not diverge in VWMD patients relative to controls (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">C</xref></bold>). On the other hand, NfL, a marker of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gaetani, Blennow et al. 2019</xref>), was significantly elevated in the plasma and CSF of VWMD patients (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6Q-S</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 5D-E</xref></bold>) mirroring the changes seen in the eIF2B HOM mice (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>DNL343 treatment initiated at advanced stage of disease rescued premature mortality and reversed biomarkers of neurodegeneration in the eIF2B HOM mice</title>
<p>Having shown that DNL343 can robustly prevent ISR activation and disease phenotypes in the eIF2B HOM mouse, we tested the effectiveness of DNL343 to reverse disease in older eIF2B HOM mice after disease onset (based on clinical signs and plasma NfL (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 6B</xref></bold>)). DNL343 was administered in food at a concentration of 100 mg/kg chow for 4 weeks starting when the animals were 19-26 weeks of age, which corresponded to an advanced disease stage (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>). As expected, and previously established, this led to robust unbound plasma and brain exposure that is equivalent to an oral gavage dose of 10 mg/kg (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Within only 4 weeks of treatment, DNL343 fully restored normal body weight gain (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></bold>) and reduced the elevated expression of ISR transcripts in the eIF2B HOM brain (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>), suggesting that administration of DNL343 can not only prevent ISR activation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>), but also reverse it in animals with advanced disease. With this short duration of DNL343 treatment, neither motor function nor plasma NfL were fully rescued (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">B</xref></bold>). Given the robust effects on both ISR markers and weight gain, we evaluated the effects of longer treatment with DNL343 in this treatment paradigm starting when the animals were 24-32 weeks of age (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 7A</xref></bold>), when independently generated eIF2B mutant mice were approaching their survival limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dooves, Bugiani et al. 2016</xref>). In line with our hypothesis, 20 weeks of DNL343 treatment normalized the elevated plasma NfL level in eIF2B HOM mice (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></bold>). This dosing paradigm also reversed the increased level of plasma GFAP in eIF2B HOM mice and normalized it to wild-type control level (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref></bold>). Correction in these plasma biomarkers was accompanied by a robust extension of survival in the eIF2B HOM mice. As expected, in this 20-week study only 25% (N=3/12) of vehicle-treated eIF2B HOM mice survived to the end of the study. In contrast, 84.6% (N=11/13) of DNL343-treated eIF2B HOM mice survived beyond the study cessation (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 7B</xref></bold>), confirming that DNL343 can reverse disease phenotype. Together these data demonstrate that DNL343 is a potent, CNS penetrant, ISR inhibitor that can correct or reverse downstream effects of chronic ISR overactivation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that the ISR plays a causative role in a broad range of CNS disorders such as ALS and VWMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Costa-Mattioli and Walter 2020</xref>, Storkebaum, Rosenblum et al. 2023). DNL343 is an investigational small molecule eIF2B activator that is developed to address ISR-mediated neurodegeneration. Here, we showed that DNL343 robustly inhibited the ISR in the CNS whether activated acutely by mechanical crush injury to the optic nerve or chronically by an eIF2B LOF mutation. DNL343 also exerted a neuroprotective effect in both models by preventing either degeneration of the RGC or elevation in a plasma biomarker of neurodegeneration, NfL, and motor function deterioration. Initiating DNL343 treatment after disease onset in the eIF2B LOF model led to equally robust inhibition of the ISR and even reversed the elevated levels of plasma markers of neurodegeneration, NfL, and neuroinflammation, GFAP, and prolonged survival in the model. Our study also put forth candidate biomarkers that were identified in the mouse model and cross validated in clinical samples from patients with VWMD to potentially enable clinical assessment of CNS ISR activation and modulation, and their downstream consequences. Together these data demonstrate the therapeutic effects of DNL343 in nonclinical <italic>in vivo</italic> settings and present clinical biomarker candidates.</p>
<p>DNL343 is a novel small molecule eIF2B activator that was engineered for high CNS penetration. Consistent with this, data across multiple dosing studies in mice showed that DNL343 achieved comparable unbound exposures in the plasma and brain. DNL343 exposure also showed a favorable dose-dependent profile with no notable differences between healthy animals and disease models. In a chronic setting, DNL343 steady-state concentration was rapidly achieved and maintained, and the compound was well tolerated at above neuroprotective exposure levels in the ONC and eIF2B LOF models. In line with its preclinical pharmacokinetic data, DNL343 showed low pharmacokinetic variability and high CSF distribution in healthy volunteers and participants with ALS, supporting its progression as an investigational therapeutic for CNS indications (Sun, Tsai et al. 2023).</p>
<p>Data from our <italic>in vivo</italic> models showed that DNL343 can inhibit the ISR in multiple mouse models. In an acute ONC model, we showed significant ISR upregulation in the retina 2 days following ONC as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larhammar, Huntwork-Rodriguez et al. 2017</xref>). This activation persisted but was less pronounced after 14 days suggesting that the ISR is activated most strongly as an early response to acute injury. At both time points, DNL343 dose-dependently normalized the ISR pathway leading to protection against RGC loss with mice treated at doses ≥3 mg/kg showing numbers of surviving RGCs that were comparable to that of uncrushed controls. The neuroprotective potential of ISR inhibition in the model was previously demonstrated using ISRIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larhammar, Huntwork-Rodriguez et al. 2017</xref>). In contrast to our data however, treatment with ISRIB at a higher and more frequent dose of 10 mg/kg (b.i.d.) led only to a partial correction of <italic>Chac</italic>1 (an ISR marker that is assessed in both the published data and our study) and RGC survival. This points to improved potency as a potential differentiator between DNL343 and the previous generation ISR inhibitor. Another consideration could be that the greater extent of ISR activation seen in the published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larhammar, Huntwork-Rodriguez et al. 2017</xref>) exceeded the cellular threshold beyond which ISRIB would have no effect. To date, such a phenomenon had only been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> in the context of sodium arsenite induced stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rabouw, Langereis et al. 2019</xref>); whether it also underlies the discrepancy in these <italic>in vivo</italic> studies remains to be evaluated. Other possible explanations include greater unbound DNL343 exposure in the brain owing to greater CNS penetration and/or lower protein binding, and improved cellular potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Osipov 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The robust ISR inhibition and neuroprotection in the acute nerve injury model led us to study the effect of DNL343 in chronic ISR-dependent neurodegeneration in an eIF2B LOF model. Our independently generated eIF2B LOF mouse exhibits features that are consistent with previously reported models, namely prominent ISR activation in the CNS that was detectable in early adulthood and persisted throughout life, accompanied by stunted body weight growth that does not appear to be driven by hypophagia, and motor function impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dooves, Bugiani et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbink, Wisse et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wong, LeBon et al. 2019</xref>). In addition, we showed a progressive escalation in the level of a plasma neurodegeneration biomarker, NfL, that corresponded to the degree of motor function loss. DNL343 treatment, initiated before overt disease manifestation, dose-dependently normalized these phenotypes with doses ≥3 mg/kg reverting body weight gain, plasma NfL level, and motor function to wild-type-like levels. While preventative modulation of some of the endpoints shown in this study is consistent with published literature utilizing other eIF2B activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbink, Wisse et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wong, LeBon et al. 2019</xref>), our data provided further insight to DNL343 effects not previously explored. Our longitudinal data on plasma NfL levels throughout the dosing study allowed us to observe that DNL343, at doses of 3 &amp; 10 mg/kg, not only led to reduction but reversal of plasma NfL elevation that hinted at the potential for this molecule to reverse the consequences of chronic ISR activation. Indeed, when dosed in a therapeutic paradigm starting at ages that corresponded to end of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dooves, Bugiani et al. 2016</xref>), DNL343 not only suppressed ISR activation in the eIF2B LOF brain but also robustly reversed the elevated levels of plasma NfL and GFAP. Reduction in these markers were apparent after 8 weeks, but not at the earlier timepoint of 4 weeks of treatment and this timeframe appears consistent between the prophylactic and the therapeutic dosing studies, suggesting that resolution of active neurodegeneration &amp; neuroinflammation is predicated on correction of upstream consequences of CNS ISR activation. Further, 4 weeks of therapeutic dosing with DNL343 did not restore motor function. While this was not further tested, we postulate that prolonging the treatment may not lead to further improvement as motor neurons likely were already degenerated at the time of treatment initiation. On the other hand, longer treatment with DNL343 in the clinically relevant therapeutic dosing paradigm extended the otherwise shortened life span of the eIF2B LOF mouse with most mice surviving past 50 weeks of age when the study was terminated. These key insights that DNL343 can robustly inhibit the ISR, reverse disease biomarkers and extend life span in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model when treatment was administered after the onset of disease have direct clinical relevance and are a major step forward in understanding the therapeutic potential of eIF2B activators.</p>
<p>We conducted both targeted and unbiased analyses using brain, CSF, and plasma samples from DNL343-treated eIF2B LOF mice to discover biofluid based biomarkers that could be harnessed to monitor CNS ISR activation and modulation, and their downstream consequences in the clinic. We were surprised to find a disconnect between proteins that were altered in the eIF2B LOF mouse CSF relative to those in the brain. While bulk brain transcriptomic and proteomic analyses show consistent changes in transcripts and proteins that belong to the ISR and amino acid metabolism pathways, as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wong, LeBon et al. 2019</xref>), our CSF proteomic findings identify proteins that represent downstream disease consequences such as demyelination and neuroinflammation. These findings were replicated in 2 cohorts of animals at 3-4 and 5-7 months of age which correspond to stages before and when disease presentation becomes evident in the eIF2B LOF model, respectively, speaking to the robustness of the findings but also highlighting the early onset of neurodegeneration in the model that precedes functional manifestation. Chronic treatment with DNL343 corrected these genotype-associated changes in the respective samples. Targeted analyses of proteins led us to discover additional markers of the ISR and neuroinflammation that could be measured in biofluids. Increased transcript or protein level of GDF-15, GFAP, and TIMP-1 in the eIF2B LOF brain and their dose responsive modulation by DNL343 were reflected by their changes in the CSF (GDF-15 and TIMP-1) and plasma (GFAP). Of these, we showed that GDF-15, a transcriptional target of ATF4, and GFAP, a marker of neuroinflammation and reactive astrocytes, were also elevated in the CSF and plasma of patients with VWMD, a rare neurodegenerative indication that is caused by biallelic recessive mutations in <italic>EIF2B1-5</italic> and in which the ISR is a central mechanism. While astrocytes are heavily implicated in the pathophysiology of VWMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dietrich, Lacagnina et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">van der Knaap, Pronk et al. 2006</xref>), astrocyte dysfunction is also increasingly being recognized to contribute to the initiation and progression of diverse neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brandebura, Paumier et al. 2023</xref>), so GFAP is of particular interest as a CNS biomarker. NfL, a marker of axonal degeneration that is increased and correlated with disease progression in other neurodegenerative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huang, Zhu et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Uphaus, Steffen et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chelban, Nikram et al. 2022</xref>) and in the eIF2B LOF mouse model, was also significantly elevated in both the plasma and CSF from VWMD patients. Inflammatory markers, such as TIMP-1 and MCP-1, that we identified in the mouse model based on changes relative to wild-type control and dose responsiveness to DNL343 were unchanged in samples from patients with VWMD, highlighting contrasts that may be driven by species-specific differences. Nonetheless, the eIF2B LOF mouse serves as an important tool that models the biological consequences of chronic ISR activation in the CNS and from which biomarkers identified have broad applicability in other neurodegenerative indications. To this point, our DNL343 studies in two <italic>in vivo</italic> models allowed us to observe commonality in ISR transcript markers despite the distinct modes of activation and CNS tissues (acute activation in the retina after ONC and chronic activation in the eIF2B HOM brain). To our knowledge, our study is the first to perform multi-omics characterization of the CNS-adjacent and clinically accessible CSF in an ISR-dependent model of neurodegeneration. The biofluid-based candidate biomarkers we cross-identified in patients with VWMD – GDF-15, GFAP, and NfL – could serve as potential biomarkers to monitor the extent and consequences of ISR activation and therapeutic modulation in the clinic.</p>

<p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) GDF-15 is increased on both the mRNA and protein level in the brain of eIF2B HOM mice relative to wild-type controls and 4 weeks of DNL343 in diet treatment at a dose equivalent to 10 mg/kg reduced its level. (<bold>C</bold>) Measurement of GDF-15 in the mouse CSF is feasible and shows changes that recapitulate findings in the brain. Data from the animal model is presented as mean ± SEM of N=7-11 mice per group. Statistical significance for DNL343 effect in the mouse model was determined by a two-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparison tests against vehicle-dosed animals of the same genotype (****, P &lt;0.0001).</p></caption>

<title>Balance Beam Test</title>
<p>To assess balance and motor coordination, animals were trained to walk along a 98.5 cm long x 13 mm diameter wooden beam, elevated at 40 cm above the bench surface lined with a soft foam mattress (104 x 74 x 10 cm). A length of 80 cm was marked on the beam as the distance the animals were required to cross. A spotlight was placed at the starting end to serve as an aversive stimulus. A dark enclosure (black matte acrylic box, 20 x 15 x 20 cm) with bedding material and carton tube was placed at the opposite end to serve as an escape box with a more agreeable condition. A video camera was set in front of the starting end to record foot slips as the animal progressed across the beam.</p>
<p>Animals underwent 3 training runs one day prior to the testing. Each mouse was first placed in the escape box for about 1 minute, then placed at an increasing distance away from the escape box over 3 trials. If an animal paused on the beam, or tried to turn and advance the wrong way, it was gently touched on the hindquarters and encouraged to keep moving toward the escape box. Animals were habituated to the experimental room for at least one hour prior to testing. To begin an experiment, each subject was placed on the starting end of the beam and allowed a cutoff time of 30 seconds (s) to cross. The elapsed time was only recorded while the subject actively moved towards the finish line. If a fall occurred, the subject was restarted at the beginning of the beam. Each subject was given three attempts to complete the balance beam. If a subject failed all three attempts, it was assigned a time of 30 s and a value of 3 falls. The number of foot slips was quantified from the video recording only if the animal completed the task. The balance beam was cleaned with a 70% solution of isopropanol and dried between each subject. The escape box was cleaned with isopropanol and dried, and the bedding and carton tube replaced between animals of different cages. The experiment was video recorded. Time to traverse the beam and number of falls were recorded live by an experimenter who was blinded to the genotypes of the animals. Foot slip scoring was done post-hoc by another experimenter, who was blinded to both genotypes and treatment, using the video recordings.</p>

<title>DNL343 pharmacokinetics</title>
<p>Plasma and brain concentrations of DNL343 were measured using LC-MS/MS by Quintara Discovery. Brain samples were homogenized in 3 volumes of ice-cold water, then further diluted 2-fold with blank mouse plasma. An aliquot of 20 μL of plasma sample or plasma diluted brain homogenate was extracted with 100 μL of acetonitrile containing internal standard (warfarin). The mixture was vortexed on a shaker for 15 minutes and subsequently centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes. An aliquot of 70 μL of the supernatant was mixed with 70 μL of 35% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid for injection to the LC-MS/MS. Calibration standards and quality control samples were prepared by dilutions of the 2 mg/mL DNL343 stock solution with 70% acetonitrile added to blank mouse plasma. These standards and QC samples were extracted alongside unknown samples in each bioanalytical batch. The final extracts were analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography and negative electrospray ionizations (LC-MS/MS) with multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) of the test article and the internal standard. The standard curve was fitted by linear regression to quantify DNL343 in the matrix using Analyst 1.6.3 software (AB Sciex).

<title>qPCR Gene Expression Analysis</title>
<p>For analysis of gene expression after ONC, retinas from the left and right eyes were collected into RNAprotect (Qiagen, catalog # 76104) and stored at room temperature until further processing. RNA from the retina was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen, catalog # 74034). RNA from the brain using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, catalog # 74134). RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Fluidigm Reverse Transcriptase Master Mix (Fluidigm, catalog # 100-6298). Specific target amplification of cDNA was done per manufactures recommendations as the initial step for the real time qPCR on the Biomark HD system (Fluidigm, catalog # BMKHD-BMKHD). Briefly, 20X TaqMan assays were pooled and diluted with DNA Suspension Buffer (Teknova, catalog # T0221) to a final concentration of 0.1X of each assay. PCR reactions were carried out for each cDNA sample with the Taqman assay pooled in 5 μl volumes, each containing 1.2 μL of the pooled assay mix, 1 μL PreAmp Master Mix (Fluidigm, # 100-5580), 1.5 μL of H2O, and 1.25 μL of cDNA. The preamplification PCR was performed at one cycle of 95 °C for 2 minutes, followed by 14 cycles of 95 °C for 15 seconds and 60 °C for 4 minutes, and then 4 °C. Specific target amplification products from the PCR reactions were diluted 5x with DNA Suspension Buffer (Teknova, catalog # T0221). Gene expression analysis was carried out using the 96.96 dynamic arrays IFC (Fluidigm, catalog # BMK-M-96.96) on the Biomark HD system (Fluidigm, catalog # BMKHD-BMKHD). 10x assay mixture and sample pre-mix were prepared, with each assay being prepared in triplicates. Each 10x assay mix contained 2.5 μL of 20x TaqMan gene expression assay (Thermofisher) and 2.5 μL of 2X Assay Loading Reagent (Fluidigm, catalog # 100-7611). All qPCR TaqMan probes (FAM) were ordered from Thermo Fisher Scientific (see Key Resources Table). Sample pre-mix was made by combining 2.5 μL TaqMan Fast Advance PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, catalog # 4444557), 0.25 μL of 20X GE Sample Loading Reagent (Fluidigm, # PN 100-7610) and 2.5 μL pre-amplified cDNA. IFC controller (Fluidigm, catalog # 68000112 I1) were used to prime the 96.96 dynamic arrays IFC Chip (Fluidigm, catalog # BMK-M-96.96) with the 96.96 control line fluid (Fluidigm, catalog # 89000021). 5 μL of each assay and sample mix was then transferred into the appropriate inlets of the primed chip and loaded with the IFC controller. The PCR was performed at 70 °C for 40 minutes, 60 °C for 30 seconds, 98 °C for 1 minute, followed by 35 cycles of 97 °C for 5 seconds, 60 °C for 20 seconds. The data was analyzed with Fluidigm Genetic Analysis software. For relative quantification, the amount of target gene expression was normalized to the geometric means of Actb, Gapdh, and Ubb expression, relative to samples from vehicle-dosed controls and was calculated using the 2−Ct method. The data were analyzed with Real-Time PCR Analysis Software (Fluidigm).</p>

<title>Assessment of RGC survival</title>
<p>For immunofluorescence analysis of RGC survival and axonal degeneration, the left (ipsilateral to crush) and right eyes were collected 14 days after the ONC procedure and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 1 hour. Retinas were then dissected from the eyes for wholemount staining. The degree of RGC loss and axonal degeneration at 14 days after ONC was assessed from whole-mount retinas. Floating whole mouse retinas were blocked in 5% normal goat serum in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS at 4°C for 2 hours. Primary antibodies were incubated over two nights at 4°C, followed by rinsing and incubation with secondary antibodies in PBS. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the following antibodies: rabbit anti γ-synuclein (1:200, Abcam, ab55424) and mouse anti TuJ1 (1:40, BioLegend, 801203). Retinas were mounted on slides after being cut with four incisions along the radial axes. Retinas were imaged using a spinning disk confocal microscope (Cell Observer CSU-X1, Carl Zeiss MicroSystem). Images were processed for brightness and contrast in Adobe. RGCs, identified as TuJ1 and γ-synuclein double-immunopositive cells, were quantified manually. Retinal axon degeneration was scored based on density of axon bundles immunolabelled with TUJ-1, using a graded scale from 0–5, where 0 corresponds to no degeneration, and five to complete degeneration.</p>

<title>Proteomic analysis of the eIF2B LOF brains and CSF</title>
<p>Proteomics analysis was conducted at BGI Americas (San Jose, CA). For mouse CSF, samples were processed via an in-solution digest. Briefly, 4 µl CSF per sample was reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAM). 100mM HEPEs pH 8.5 was added and the samples were digested overnight with Tryp/LysC. The digestion was quenched with 10% TFA, desalted using C18 PhyTips (PhyNexus) and dried by SpeedVac and reconstituted in 100mM HEPES, pH 8.5. Samples were assigned respective TMT channels in one of four 8-plexes with the final channel being a pool of all the samples to normalize between TMT plexes. Samples were labelled with respective 8-plex TMT channels at room temperature for 1 hour. Approximately 1% of sample from each channel were mixed, dried down, stage-tipped and injected into the mass spec for label check then the reaction was quenched with 5% hydroxylamine, mixed in equal amounts, dried down and cleaned up using C18 PhyTips (PhyNexus). For mouse CSF, due to the low sample amount no fractionation was performed prior to injection on the MS.</p>
<p>Tissue samples were lysed in 5% SDS in triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.1 and assayed for concentrations. 6ug of each sample was processed using the STrap MS sample prep device according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Protifi). More specifically: samples were reduced with dithiothreitol (DTT) and alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAM); the IAM reaction was then quenched with DTT; the resulting samples were digested in the STrap device with Trypsin/Lys-C overnight. Digested samples were eluted from the STrap according to the manufacturer’s protocol. An aliquot of 1 µg was taken from each eluted sample; and the aliquots were pooled to form a composite for TMT bridging. 4 aliquots of 5ug were taken out as 4 TMT bridges, with each bridge being used for each TMT batch. All samples were dried by SpeedVac. The samples were reconstituted with 50mM TEAB pH 8.5 and incubated with their assigned TMT channels for 1 hour at room temperature. For each of the four TMT batches: the same amount of each TMT-labelled sample was aliquoted; and the aliquots were pooled and mixed with 1% formic acid. The 4 resulting mixtures were loaded onto the nano LC-MS/MS system for Label Check. After the Label Check was passed, all samples were dried by SpeedVac and reconstituted with 2% formic acid. The reconstituted samples of each batch were combined. The resulting three mixtures were further desalted using EVOLUTE® EXPRESS ABN according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Biotage). The eluted samples were dried by SpeedVac, reconstituted with high-pH reversed-phase buffer A, and loaded onto the offline HPLC for fractionation. Either 8 or 12 fractions were obtained from each sample batch.</p>
<p>All samples were reconstituted with mobile phase A and loaded onto the nano LC-MS/MS system.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, the authors evaluated a novel eIF2B activator, DNL343, in two mouse models representing different forms of the integrated stress response (ISR). They first assessed the pharmacokinetics of DNL343, demonstrating its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and exhibit good bioavailability. In an acute ISR model induced by optic nerve crush (ONC) injury, DNL343 treatment reduced ISR-induced transcriptional changes and neuronal loss, demonstrating neuroprotective effects. Next, the authors generated an eIF2B loss-of-function mice model by knocking in disease-causing Eif2b5 variants. The model presents a chronic ISR and mimics vanishing white matter disease (VWMD). DNL343 treatment from the pre-symptomatic stage improved body weight and motor functions corrected transcriptional changes, and reversed proteomic and metabolomic alterations in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. DNL343 treatment initiated at an advanced disease stage also showed positive effects, restoring body weight gain, suppressing ISR, reducing neurodegeneration biomarkers, and extending lifespan. These findings highlight DNL343 as an effective ISR inhibitor with potential applications in treating VWMD and other neurodegenerative disorders involving ISR.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study's findings regarding the novel compound DNL343 offer significant promise in addressing VWMD, a condition currently lacking disease-modifying treatment. DNL343 directly targets eIF2B, the disease-causing complex in VWMD, and demonstrates notable efficacy in reversing the integrated stress response (ISR) and mitigating neurodegeneration in a VWMD mouse model. These results raise hope for the potential application of DNL343 in VWMD treatment, a development eagerly anticipated by patients and the VWMD research community. Moreover, the study hints at the broader potential of DNL343 in treating other ISR-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a prospect that holds broader interest. Additionally, the study's identification of potential biomarkers for VWMD represents a notable strength, potentially leading to improved disease progression assessment pending further confirmation in future research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are a couple of notable concerns in this study. Firstly, while the in vivo evidence strongly supports the efficacy of DNL343 in mitigating ISR and neurodegeneration, there is a lack of direct biochemical evidence to confirm its activity in eIF2B activation. Secondly, the potential for cardiovascular toxicity, which has been reported for a related eIF2B activator in a canine model (as mentioned in the manuscript), has not been evaluated for DNL343 in this study. This data gap regarding toxicity could be crucial for informing the future development of DNL343 for potential human use. Further investigation into these areas would be valuable for a comprehensive understanding of the compound's mechanisms and safety profile.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors developed DNL343, a CNS-penetrant small molecule integrated stress response (ISR) inhibitor, to treat neurodegenerative diseases caused by ISR.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
DNL343 is an investigational CNS-penetrant small molecule integrated stress response (ISR) inhibitor designed to activate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) and suppress aberrant ISR activation. The therapeutic efficacy of DNL343 has been extensively characterized in two animal models. Importantly, plasma biomarkers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration can be reversed with DNL343 treatment. Remarkably, several of these biomarkers show differential levels in CSF and plasma from patients with vanishing white matter disease (VWMD) upon DNL343 treatment. Overall, this is a very exciting study to target ISR for therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
My main questions center around the characterization of DNL343.</p>
<p>1. Is there any biochemical evidence showing DNL343 activates eIF2B, such as binding assays or in vitro biochemical activity assays? A conference presentation was cited - &quot;Osipov, M. (2022). Discovery of DNL343: a Potent Selective and Brain-penetrant eIF2B Activator Designed for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases. Medicinal Chemistry Gordon Research Conference. New London, NH.&quot; However, there needs to be public information about this presentation.</p>
<p>2. How was the selectivity of DNL343 demonstrated? What are the off-targets of DNL343, in particular when DNL343 is administered at a high dose? Thermal-proteasome profiling or photoaffinity labeling experiments could be considered.</p>
<p>3. What are the total drug concentrations in the brain and plasma? What are the unbound ratios?</p>
<p>4. If DNL343 is given intravenously, what are the concentrations in the brain and plasma after 5 minutes and 1 hour or longer time points? In other words, does DNL343 cross BBB through passive diffusion or an active process?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
ISR contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, FTD, VWMD, etc. Targeting ISR is a promising avenue for potential therapeutics. However, previously identified ways to target ISR present some challenges. PERK inhibitors suppress ISR by inhibiting eIF2alpha phosphorylation and cause pancreatic toxicity in mice. In order to bypass eIF2alpha, previous studies have identified ISR suppressors that target eIF2B, such as ISRIB and 2BAct. These molecules suppress neurodegeneration but do not cause detrimental effects in mouse models. However, ISRIB is water-insoluble, and 2BAct causes cardiovascular complications in dogs, preventing their use in clinics. Here, the authors showed that DNL343, a new ISR inhibitor targeting eIF2B, suppresses neurodegeneration in mouse models. Combined with their previous results of a clinical phase I trial showing the safety of DNL343, these findings suggest the promise of DNL343 as a potential drug for neurodegenerative diseases in which ISR contributes to pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The finding is important and has disease implications, and the conclusion is not surprising.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The experimental design and data are hard to comprehend for an audience with a basic research background. This reviewer suggests that the authors use the same way that previous studies on ISRIB and 2BAct (e.g., Wong et al; eLife, 2019) designed experiments and interpret data.</p>
