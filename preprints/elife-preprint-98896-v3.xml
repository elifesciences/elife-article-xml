<title>Abstract</title><p>Soil salinity is one of the major threats to agricultural productivity worldwide. Salt stress exposure alters root and shoot growth rates, thereby affecting overall plant performance. While past studies have extensively documented the effect of salt stress on root elongation and shoot development separately, here we take an innovative approach by examining the coordination of root and shoot growth under salt stress conditions. Utilizing a newly developed tool for quantifying the root:shoot ratio in agar-grown Arabidopsis seedlings, we found that salt stress results in a loss of coordination between root and shoot growth rates. We identify a specific gene cluster encoding domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), and characterize one of these genes as <underline>S</underline>alt <underline>R</underline>oot:shoot <underline>R</underline>atio <underline>R</underline>egulator <underline>G</underline>ene (SR3G). Further analysis elucidates the role of SR3G as a negative regulator of salt stress tolerance, revealing its function in regulating shoot growth, root suberization, and sodium accumulation. We further characterize that <italic>SR3G</italic> expression is modulated by <italic>WRKY75</italic> transcription factor, known as a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance. Finally, we show that the salt stress sensitivity of <italic>wrky75</italic> mutant is completely diminished when it is combined with <italic>sr3g</italic> mutation. Together, our results demonstrate that utilizing root:shoot ratio as an architectural feature leads to the discovery of new stress resilience gene. The study’s innovative approach and findings not only contribute to our understanding of plant stress tolerance mechanisms but also open new avenues for genetic and agronomic strategies to enhance crop environmental resilience.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Salt stress is predominant in the dryland areas where evaporation rate exceeds water input. As all water contains dissolved ions, the prolonged exposure to drought stress results in increased accumulation of salts in the upper soil layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abrol et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fischer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Richards, 1969</xref>). Dryland areas of South America, southern and western Australia, Mexico, southwest United States, and South Africa were previously identified as primary hotspots for soil salinization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hassani et al., 2021</xref>). As fresh water becomes scarcer, understanding the mechanisms of salt stress resilience becomes of paramount importance in the context of global agricultural productivity and sustainability.</p>
<p>Salt stress detrimentally affects plant growth and development, decreasing the activity of the meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">West et al., 2004</xref>). Studies utilizing main root elongation as an indicator of salt tolerance have led to identification of many crucial components of salt stress signaling and tolerance, including genes involved in salt-overly sensitive signaling (SOS) pathway, jasmonate, ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in glycophytes and halophytes alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Geng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hu et al., 2023</xref>; Şekerci et al., 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Valenzuela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wu et al., 1996</xref>). Additionally, negative halotropism response, that describes a directional growth of main root away from the salt gradient, was used to identify a wide range of molecular components regulating the auxin redistribution and cell-wall remodeling, to actively avoid high salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Deolu-Ajayi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Galvan-Ampudia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Korver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yu et al., 2022</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zou et al., 2022</xref>). The development of lateral roots is affected by salinity, and the differential effect on main and lateral roots within specific genotype can result in substantial reprogramming of root system architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">2014</xref>). The shoot development is impacted by salt stress, as the salt impacts the plant transpiration and photosynthetic efficiency instantaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Awlia et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Julkowska et al., 2016</xref>). Many forward genetic studies were highly successful in associating natural variation in root and shoot growth with allelic variation in gene coding and promoter regions, thereby identifying potential new target traits for improved stress resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Awlia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">2016</xref>). However, these studies typically focus on either above or below ground tissue.</p>
<p>The coordination of root and shoot growth rate is an important aspect of seedling establishment, and becomes even more critical under abiotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bacher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Karcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). The importance of increased root:shoot ratio, maximizing water scavenging while limiting transpiration, is well studied under drought stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Karcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Uga et al., 2013</xref>). However, the effect of salt stress on root:shoot ratio is yet to be described, and its contribution to salt stress remains unknown. Here, we developed a tool to quantify root:shoot ratio from agar-grown Arabidopsis seedlings, and re-analyzed the natural diversity panel of Arabidopsis exposed to salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>). We have observed that while salt stress does not elicit a clear response in root:shoot ratio, it results in loss of coordination of root and shoot growth rates. The locus associated with salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio consisted of a gene cluster encoding domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), with majority of SNPs clustering into one specific gene (At3g50160), that we named as Salt Root:shoot Ratio Regulator Gene (SR3G). Further characterization of SR3G revealed its function as a negative regulator of salt stress resilience, through regulation of root suberization, shoot growth, and Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation. We found WRKY75 transcription factor, a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance, acts upstream of SR3G, binding directly to the SR3G promoter in yeast. While <italic>sr3g</italic> and <italic>wrky75</italic> mutants showed contrasting salt stress response, the double mutants of <italic>sr3g/wrky75</italic> displayed reduced sensitivity to salt stress.</p>

<title>Screening HapMap population for the increase in root and shoot size</title>
<p>The images collected within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>) were re-analyzed in this manuscript to examine salt-induced changes in the root:shoot ratio for the data presented here. 360 accessions of the Arabidopsis HapMap population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Weigel and Mott, 2009</xref>) were screened over 7 experimental batches, using 4 biological replicates per genotype per condition. The seeds were surface sterilized, incubated in sterile MQ water at 4°C for 48 h, and germinated on media containing ½ Murashige-Skoog, 0.5% sucrose, 0.1% MES buffer, pH 5.8 (KOH) and 1% Dashin agar. The 4-day-old seedlings were subsequently transferred to media additionally supplemented with 0, 75 or 125 mM NaCl. The plates were scanned every 2nd day using a flat-bed scanner for 8 consecutive days.</p>
<p>The collected images were analyzed for green and white pixels, corresponding to the projected surface of the shoot and root, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ronellsicat/PlantSeg">https://github.com/ronellsicat/PlantSeg</ext-link>). A Matlab-based tool was developed to simplify and speed up the segmentation and analysis pipeline. For automatic segmentation, the tool uses a combination of image operations (histogram equalization), thresholding on different color spaces (e.g., RGB, YCbCr, Lab, HSV), and binary image processing (boundary and islands removal). As the tool is digitalizing various color scales and classifies pixels into either white (root), green (shoot) or blue (background) categories, the adjustment for white balance is obsolete. For analysis, the tool uses connected components analysis to extract the plants (combined roots and shoots) and can guide the user to find possible mistakes which can be manually corrected via the user interface.

The collected data from the HapMap panel was analyzed using R for potential outliers (samples identified to be more than 3x standard deviation from the mean of each genotype within each condition), and the genotype-specific mean was calculated using the stats package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Team et al., 2018</xref>). The overall increase in root and shoot area was investigated for differences between control and salt stress conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S2</xref>).

<p>For the most promising candidate loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S4</xref>), we have identified the gene open reading frames that were located within the genome-wide linkage-disequilibrium (LD) of the associated SNPs. The LD was expanded if multiple SNPs were identified within the region, and the region of interest was expanded based on the number of coding genes within the LD window. The protein-coding genes were subsequently used for haplotype analysis. All the SNPs located within the gene coding region were used to perform a haplotype analysis.

<p>Identified orthologs were translated into amino acid, then aligned by MUSCLE. Alignments were carefully validated by manual correction. Briefly, diverged insertions were trimmed, shifted frames were adjusted, and conserved regions after translation were retained for phylogeny reconstruction. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the RAxML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>) plug-in within Geneious (Geneious Prime 2022.1.1) with the GAMMA-GTR nucleotide model, rapid bootstrapping with a parsimony search, and 100 bootstraps.

The alternative hypotheses (HAs) here allow for differential selection to be applied to respective branch(es). Specifically, the five alternative hypotheses are listed here: H<sub>1</sub>: ω -rest branches = ω0 = ω3 = ω1 ≠ ω2, H<sub>2</sub>: ω -rest branches = ω0 = ω1 = ω2 ≠ ω3, H<sub>3</sub>: ω -rest branches = ω0 ≠ ω1 ≠ ω2 ≠ ω3, H<sub>4</sub>: ω -rest branches ≠ ω0 ≠ ω1 ≠ ω2 ≠ ω3, H<sub>sep</sub>: each branch has its unique ω value.

<title>Natural variation in salt stress-induced changes in root:shoot ratio</title>
<p>To investigate salt stress-induced changes in root:shoot ratio, we developed a custom tool that quantifies green and white pixels, corresponding to shoot and root of Arabidopsis seedlings grown on agar plates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The projected area of root and shoot showed high correlation with root and shoot fresh weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S1</xref>), indicating that projected root and shoot area can be used as an accurate proxy to non-destructively measure the increase in root and shoot biomass from the images of seedlings grown on agar plates.</p>

The increase in the projected area of shoot and root (Fig. S2) was used to estimate (A) shoot and (B) root exponential growth rate. (C) The root:shoot growth rate ratio was calculated per genotype. The histograms represent the number of accessions across three studied conditions (0, 75 and 125 mM NaCl), whereas the population average is indicated using the dashed line.

<p>Using our custom tool, we re-analyzed the data consisting of 360 Arabidopsis accessions grown on plates supplemented with 0, 75, and 125 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>), for salt stress-induced changes in the root:shoot ratio (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S2</xref>). The growth of root and shoot for each plant was estimated using the exponential function. Salt stress-induced reduction in growth rate was observed to be dose-dependent for both root and shoot (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). In general, the root growth was more sensitive to salt stress compared to shoot growth, with the population-wide relative growth rates reduced to a fraction of 0.67 and 0.41 of the growth rates observed at control for 75 and 125 mM NaCl, respectively. In comparison, the growth rates of the shoot were significantly reduced to 0.71 and 0.43 of the control in 75 and 125 mM NaCl treatments, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S3</xref>). While the mean value of root:shoot growth rate did not change upon salt stress treatment, the variance in the root:shoot ratio significantly expanded with the increasing concentrations of salt (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). These results suggest that while root and shoot growth are well coordinated under non-stress conditions, salt stress exposure results in loss of coordination of organ growth across Arabidopsis accessions. To test whether there is a clear directional correlation between the change in root:shoot ratio and overall salt stress tolerance, we have used the overall seedling size as a proxy for plant salt tolerance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S4, S5</xref>). No significant correlation was found between the root:shoot growth ratio and total seedling size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S4, S5</xref>), indicating that the relationship between coordination of root and shoot growth and salt tolerance during the early seedling establishment is complex.</p>

<title>Identification of genetic components underlying salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio</title>
<p>To identify genetic components underlying salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio, we used the collected data as an input for GWAS. The associations were evaluated based on the p-value, the number of SNPs within the locus, and the number of traits associated with individual loci. As Bonferroni threshold differs depending on the minor allele count (MAC) considered, we identified significant associations based on a Bonferroni threshold for each subpopulation of SNPs based on MAC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S3</xref>). While we conducted a GWAS on directly measured traits, as well as their Salt Tolerance Index (STI) values, however the amount of associations with STI was much lower compared to directly measured traits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S3</xref>). This observation aligns with the understanding that plastic responses to environmental conditions tend to be genetically more complex. This complexity likely stems from the involvement of more genetic regulators compared to low-plasticity phenotypes.</p>
<p>The initial GWAS was performed using 250 k SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Horton et al., 2012</xref>), and led to the identification of 14 significantly associated loci, of which 3 and 7 loci were associated with traits measured at 75 or 125 mM NaCl treatments, respectively. We identified one salt specific association on chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S6</xref>), where two SNPs were identified within AT2G27300 encoding NAC-domain containing transcription factor (NTL8). Additionally, salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio and shoot:total seedling area were associated with SNPs on chromosome 3, where 2 significantly associated SNPs were flanking AT3G22430, encoding an unknown gene encoding a domain of unknown function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S7</xref>).</p>
<p>To refine our analysis and further prioritize candidate genes for validation, we repeated the GWAS using a higher-density 4M SNP panel (1001 Genomes Consortium, 2016). This increased SNP density provided more associations and highlighted loci with greater confidence due to the higher resolution. The higher-density panel also allowed us to capture different linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks across the genome. One locus on chromosome 2, detected by both the 250K and 4M SNP panels, appeared to be in a region of strong LD or possibly under selection, consistently identified by both panels. However, most loci were not detected by the lower-density 250K panel, likely due to differences in the panels’ resolution and statistical power.</p>
<p>The new GWAS with the 4M SNP panel revealed 32 additional loci, with only one locus (locus 30, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S3</xref>). being detected by both the 250K and 4M SNP panels. We prioritized the identified loci based on several factors, including the number of significantly associated SNPs, MAC, and the number of traits associated with each locus. This led to the identification of three loci of major interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S4</xref>). We further examined the regions in LD with the significantly associated SNPs for sequence divergence and open reading frames (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S8, Fig. S9</xref>).</p>

<p>Out of identified associations, locus 30 stood out as it consisted of nine SNPs associated with p-value above the Bonferroni threshold, and was associated with both root:shoot and shoot:total seedling area at 6 and 8 days after transfer of the seedling to 125 mM NaCl (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S8, Table S4</xref>). The significantly associated SNPs were located in and around the gene coding region of AT3G50160, which encodes a domain of unknown function 247 (DUF247). We investigated the region for sequence divergence, and found that the region contained not only a high degree of sequence diversity but also potential structural variants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). To identify allelic variation underlying the initial associations, we performed haplotype analysis, where accessions with shared SNP pattern within the protein-coding part of AT3G50160 were grouped into individual haplotype-groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Each unique haplotype, represented by at least three accessions, was subsequently studied for differences in observed phenotypes. We observed that Haplotype 1, represented by 46 accessions including Col-0, was significantly different from Haplotype 11, represented by 11 accessions including Blh-1, in shoot-per-total seedling area at 6 days after transfer to 125 mM NaCl (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), as well as shoot growth rate and relative shoot growth rate at 125 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S9</xref>). Upon further investigation and sequencing of AT3G50160 in both Col-0 and Blh-1 accessions, we discovered that the Blh-1 allele carries a large insertion at 644 nucleotides downstream from the ATG of AT3G50160, followed by multiple other sequence variations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S10</xref>). The first insertion leads to a premature STOP-codon within the DUF247 domain after Gly-215 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S11</xref>), resulting in a truncated protein that still carries a nuclear localization signal and coiled-coil domain, but is missing a major part of the calcium-binding domain and a predicted transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S12</xref>). As there are other DUF247s within the locus associated with salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio, we decided to name the gene containing majority of the associated SNPs (At3g50160) as Salt Root:shoot Ratio Regulator Gene (SR3G). Together, these results suggest that the allelic variation in SR3G protein sequence might underlie the observed differences in root:shoot ratio under salt stress conditions.</p>

<title>Evolutionary context of SR3G locus reveals its origin in local genome duplication</title>
<p>SR3G sits in what appears to be a tandemly duplicated array of DUF247s along Arabidopsis chromosome 3. The genome-wide identification of SR3G included eight DUF247 paralogs, AT3G50120, AT3G50130, AT3G50140, AT3G50150, AT3G50170, AT3G50180, AT3G50190, and AT3G50200. Reciprocal best BLAST within CoGe’s BLAST tool of these nine DUF247 paralogs against the genomes of seven other Brassicaceae (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S5</xref>) revealed a total of 50 potential orthologs used for downstream analysis. While the copy number of DUF247 loci are similar across the examined species, the noted exceptions are those with recent whole genome duplication events (<italic>Brassica rapa</italic> and <italic>Camelina sativa</italic>). Given these data, it appears that DUF247 loci are commonly tandemly duplicated, although the eight paralogs observed in Arabidopsis represents an extreme case for this gene family.</p>
<p>To examine conservation within the predicted DUF247 functional domains, we generated an amino-acid based multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE. All of the identified DUF247 proteins contained the DUF247 domain near the center of the translated sequence. While partial deletions were identified outside of the DUF247 domain at the C-terminus of a few DUF247s, such as <italic>CARHR159180</italic>, <italic>Csa09g052970</italic>, and <italic>Bra01902</italic>, in general the DUF247 domains were highly conserved across Brassicaceae. The amino acid sequences spanning the “coiled-coil domain” (Amino acid position: Met153-Lys173), putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding domain (Amino acid position: Gly210-Phe372), and super polar fragment (Amino acid position: Ser301-Ile320) were further selected for phylogenetic reconstruction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The resulting phylogeny demonstrated that SR3G is sister to a clade containing AT3G50150 and representatives from <italic>C. sativa</italic>, <italic>Capsella rubella,</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, with representative DUF247s from <italic>B. rapa</italic> and <italic>Eutrema salsugineum</italic> serving as a monophyletic outgroup. These data support a hypothesis where SR3G is a recent duplicate (likely A/C Clade specific; Forsythe et al., 2020) of AT3G50150 and that representative SR3G sequences in <italic>C. sativa</italic>, <italic>C. rubella</italic>, and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> have been lost.</p>

Lastly, the Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) was performed to test the probability of sites along with ω &gt; 1 over the DUF247 (AT3G50160).

<p>Given the specific retention of AT3G50150 in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, we next tested whether this locus is experiencing directional selection. To test this assumption, we grouped the branches leading to SR3G into four groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>: ω0, ω1, ω2, and ω-rest) and then performed a branch-site model A hypothesis test. In our null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>), we hypothesized that all branches have the same selection pressure (H<sub>0</sub>: ω -rest branches = ω0 = ω3 = ω1 = ω2; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S6</xref> for omega values for each hypothesis). For our alternative hypothesis, we created five different ω groups to cover scenarios where specific branches may be experiencing directional selection (See Methods). Based on our analysis, the branch leading to SR3G is experiencing directional selection (likelihood score = 20625.5, Chi-square derived P value; P = 0.00418). Interestingly, no other branches appeared to be experiencing the same selection. To pinpoint specific amino acids within SR3G under selection, we performed the Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) test, identifying three sites with a posterior probability &gt; 0.90, including 124C (P = 0.992), 206A (P = 0.951), and 209A (P = 0.988).

<p>We further examined expression profiles of other <italic>DUF247</italic> genes that directly neighbor <italic>SR3G</italic> in response to salt stress using the eFP Browser. We observed that the expression of DUF247-120 (At3g50120) remained undetectable under control conditions, except for a slight increase in rosette leaves after 6 hours of salt stress exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S14</xref>). For DUF247-130 (At3g50130), -140 (At3g50140), -150 (At3g50150), and -170 (At3g50170), high expression was detected in roots under non-stress conditions, but expression levels decreased upon salt stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S14</xref>). The expression of DUF247-180 (At3g50180) remained unchanged with or without salt stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S14</xref>). DUF247-190 (At3g50190) exhibited high expression in roots during early salt stress exposure, which then declined at later stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S14</xref>). For DUF247-200 (At3g50200), its already low detectable expression disappeared entirely during prolonged salt stress exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S14</xref>). Because <italic>DUF247-150</italic> (At3g50150) is closely located to the <italic>SR3G</italic> in chromosome 3, we investigated its gene expression in young seedlings. We observed that its expression was significantly higher in shoot compared to the root tissue. However, its expression remained unchanged in both root and shoot under salt stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Together, these results suggest that <italic>SR3G</italic> is the most prominent DUF247 studied herein involve in regulation of root development under salt stress.</p>

<title>SR3G relocates from plasma membrane to nucleus/cytosol after removal of its transmembrane domain</title>
<p>SR3G protein is predicted to contain a nuclear localization signal (Lys15-Ala19), a coiled-coil domain (Met153-Lys173), a Ca2<sup>+</sup> binding pocket (Gly210-Phe372), and a trans-membrane domain (Pro469-Thr503) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S15</xref>). We generated constitutive expression constructs of full-length <italic>SR3G</italic> gene CDS, and a combination of individual domains (refer to as A, B, and AB domains) to identify their subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S15</xref>). Fragment A comprised a nuclear localization signal, a coiled-coil domain, and the initial segment of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding pocket, encompassing seven amino acids. Fragment B encompassed the remaining segment of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding pocket. Fragment C only included the transmembrane domain. All constructs contained N-terminal fusion of mVenus. The individual constructs were used in transient expression assay in tobacco leaves. Our result showed that full-length SR3G localizes to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) as its signal overlapped with FM4-64, the plasma membrane marker (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The SR3G fragments from which the transmembrane domain was excluded—namely fragments A, B, and AB— exhibited localization in both the nucleus and cytosol, resembling the pattern observed with free-GFP localization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-F</xref>). It is noteworthy that while the signal from fragment A was directed to both the cytosol and nucleus, its intensity was notably stronger in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), aligning with the prediction that it contains the nuclear localization signal. Together, these findings indicate that the positioning of SR3G within the plasma membrane is due to the transmembrane domain encoded within the fragment C, and its removal could potentially release the protein into both the nucleus and cytosol.</p>

<title>Lower expression of <italic>SR3G</italic> results in reduced lateral root development under salt stress</title>
<p>To investigate role of <italic>SR3G</italic> in salt-induced changes in root growth and development, we studied the root system architecture of two T-DNA insertion lines: <italic>sr3g-4</italic> (SAIL_690_E12) and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> (SAIL_608_C06) localized in second exon and first intron region of the <italic>SR3G</italic> gene, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S16A</xref>). Among these two mutant lines, <italic>SR3G</italic> expression was reduced in the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant compared to Col-0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S16B</xref>), indicating the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> is a knockdown mutant. We did not observe any differences in <italic>SR3G</italic> transcript abundance between <italic>sr3g-4</italic> and Col-0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S16B</xref>). Moreover, we examined the transcript abundance of the closely related gene (i.e., <italic>DUF247-150, At3g50150</italic>) in the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant, and found no significant difference. In the case that <italic>DUF247-150</italic> would act redundantly to <italic>SR3G</italic>, we would expect that the expression of <italic>DUF247-150</italic> would be increased in <italic>SR3G</italic> knockdown mutant. As this is not the case, these results further contribute to the evidence that <italic>SR3G</italic> and <italic>DUF247-150</italic> are not acting redundantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S16C</xref>).</p>
<p>Two T-DNA insertion lines were subsequently studied for salt-induced alterations in root architecture (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S17 and S18</xref>). Among the various features of the root system architecture that we investigated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S17</xref>), <italic>sr3g-5</italic> exhibited a significantly reduced growth rate of lateral roots under 75 mM NaCl, but not under 125 mM NaCl, when compared to Col-0 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Likewise, the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant displayed a significant reduction in the Stress Tolerance Index (STI), calculated as the ratio of growth rate under salt to growth rate under control conditions, for lateral root length under 75 mM NaCl (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). No significant difference was observed between <italic>sr3g-4</italic> and Col-0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S18</xref>), except for Stress Tolerance Index (STI) calculated using growth rates of lateral root length under 125 mM salt stress (Fig. S18-E). In this case, the sr3g-4 mutant exhibited a non-significant decrease compared to Col-0, consistent with the observations made for the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant line (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Based on the RT-qPCR results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S16</xref>), we proceeded to further investigate the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> in salt stress, focusing on the sr3g-5 mutant in our subsequent investigations.</p>

<p>As Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion from the shoot is one of the main mechanisms of salt tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Møller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Munns and Tester, 2008</xref>), we further investigated the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> in ion exclusion using plate-grown seedlings. We used root and shoot samples collected for Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant to examine Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> accumulation using ICP-AES at 14 days after exposure to salt stress. We observed no significant differences between Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> accumulations and their corresponding ratio upon salt stress exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S17</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>SR3G</italic> plays a role in root development under the salt, but does not affect ion accumulation at early developmental stages.</p>
<p>To evaluate the effects of other closely related DUF247 genes on root development, we have investigated the T-DNA insertion lines targeting the neighboring DUF247 genes (AT3G50120, AT3G50130, AT3G50140, AT3G50150, AT3G50170, AT3G50180, AT3G50190, AT3G50200), and RNAi lines targeting one or more DUF247s within the interval (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S4, Fig. S19-S23</xref>). For the screened T-DNA insertion lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S19-20</xref>), we have not observed consistent changes in main or lateral root development in either control or salt stress conditions across alleles targeting the same gene. The only exception was <italic>DUF247-200</italic> encoded by AT3G50200, where two out of three studied T-DNA insertion alleles exhibited increased salt tolerance index for main root growth rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S20</xref>).</p>
<p>For the screened RNAi lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S4, Fig. S21-S23</xref>), we observed the most interesting root architecture phenotypes in lines targeting the neighboring genes of the <italic>SR3G</italic> (RNAi line #04, targeting AT3G50150, RNAi line #16 targeting AT3G50130, <italic>SR3G</italic>, and AT3G50170, and RNAi line #19 targeting AT3G50130, AT3G50140, AT3G50150, <italic>SR3G</italic>, AT3G50170, AT3G50180, and AT3G50190). Three out of five screened independent transformation lines from RNAi line #04 showed a decreased relative main root length (Salt / Control, CSHL #4 B2a, D4a, and G1d), whereas two lines showed a decrease in relative lateral root number (CSHL #4 D4a and F1b), and one line showed decreased lateral root length at 75 mM NaCl (CSHL #4 D4a <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S21-23</xref>). Two out of two independent transformants for RNAi line #16 showed a decreased relative main root length and increased lateral root number at 75 mM NaCl (CSHL #16 A2c and B1a, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S21-23</xref>). In three of the four screened independent transformants of line #19 we observed an increased lateral root length at 75 mM NaCl (CSHL #19 F1a, I3c, and L1c <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S21-23</xref>). We did not observe strong reduction in lateral root development across RNAi lines targeting two closely related DUF247 genes (i.e., RNAi line #22, targeting AT3G50150 and <italic>SR3G</italic>), as in the single mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S21</xref>). The above results further support that these two genes do not act redundantly in the context of lateral root development.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>SR3G</italic> results in increased salt tolerance in soil</title>
<p>To investigate <italic>SR3G’s</italic> contribution to salt stress tolerance beyond seedling stage and agar plate conditions, we evaluated the performance of Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant in soil. We exposed the soil-grown plants to salt stress and imaged the rosette size every 30 minutes for two weeks using the automated imaging platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yu et al., 2023</xref>). As salt-induced changes depend on the developmental stage at which the stress is applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>), we examined the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> exposed to salt stress at 2 or 3 weeks after germination, corresponding to early and late vegetative stages. We calculated a daily growth rate for each plant, using the projected rosette area. No significant difference was observed between Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> under control conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>), indicating that <italic>SR3G</italic> does not play a role in rosette growth and development under non-stress conditions.

Late stress exposure resulted in significantly higher <italic>sr3g-5</italic> growth rate at two and three days after exposure to salt stress (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant showed a significantly higher rosette area compared to Col-0 exclusively when plants were exposed to salt stress at an earlier stage of their development (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). No significant difference was observed between Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant in terms of water content under either of conditions tested, providing no substantial evidence for SR3G to regulate water content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S24</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> in the maintenance of cellular integrity during salt stress, we evaluated the salt-induced changes in cell membrane integrity by measuring ion leakage in the leaf discs at the end of the experiment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). While ion leakage increased in Col-0 under early salt stress conditions, no noticeable salt-induced change was observed for <italic>sr3g-5</italic> compared to control condition (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Although the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant exhibited significant increase in ion leakage in response to late salt stress, this phenomenon may be more closely associated with the onset of senescence rather than direct exposure to salt stress (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>We further explored the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> in ion exclusion by quantifying the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions in the rosette at the end of the experiment (4-weeks-old plants). We observed a reduced accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutants compared to Col-0 for plants exposed to salt stress at an earlier timepoint (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). No significant differences in Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation was observed between the Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> at the late salt stress regime (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>).

<p><italic>WRKY75</italic> was previously described to act as a positive regulator of salt stress response by enhancing <italic>SOS1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lu et al., 2023</xref>). To investigate whether the <italic>SR3G</italic> expression depends on <italic>WRKY75</italic>, we examined the <italic>SR3G</italic> expression in the <italic>wkry75</italic> T-DNA insertion lines. <italic>SR3G</italic> expression was undetected in <italic>wrky75</italic> knock-down mutants (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>WKRY75</italic> regulates <italic>SR3G</italic> expression. In comparison, expression of <italic>WRKY75</italic> remained unchanged in the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant when compared to Col-0 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>). To investigate whether <italic>WRKY75</italic> directly binds to the <italic>SR3G</italic> promoter, we performed Y1H assay. Similar to the two positive controls, the strains transformed with WRKY75-AD and SR3G:pLacZ grew on the SD/-Trp/-Ura + X-Gal medium, thereby confirming the interaction between <italic>WRKY75</italic> and <italic>SR3G</italic> promoter region (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). In contrast, <italic>WRKY75</italic> did not show binding affinity to the promoter region of the adjacent gene to the <italic>SR3G</italic> (i.e., DUF247-150, AT3g50150), thereby reinforcing the uniqueness of the interaction between the <italic>SR3G</italic> and <italic>WRKY75</italic> (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref>).</p>
<p>To further examine the functional consequences of the relationship between SR3G and WRKY75, we generated <italic>wrky75-3/sr3g-5</italic> double mutants, and examined their root system architecture alongside the single mutants and Col-0. Under control conditions, both <italic>sr3g-5</italic> and <italic>wrky75-3</italic> mutants showed significant reduction in main root length compared to Col-0 and the two double mutants (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>). Under 75 mM salt, only <italic>wrky75-3</italic> showed significant reduction in main root length compared to all other genotypes tested, confirming the previously described salt sensitivity for <italic>wrky75</italic> mutant under salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lu et al., 2023</xref>). We have not observed any differences in main root length under 125 mM salt across all genotypes tested (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>). Regarding lateral root number (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>) and length (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10C</xref>), we observed significant reduction in lateral root number and length for the two single mutants, <italic>sr3g-5</italic> and <italic>wrky75-3</italic>, compared to other genotypes only under control condition (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B-C</xref>). We further investigated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> accumulations as well as Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio in plate grown seedlings (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S25</xref>). At 75 mM salt concentration, a subtle non-significant reduction in root Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio was observed in the <italic>wrky75</italic> single mutant compared to the other genotypes tested. Conversely, shoot Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio exhibited a slight non-significant decrease in the two double mutants compared to the other three genotypes at 75 mM salt concentration. At 125 mM salt concentration, root Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio non-significantly decreased in the two double mutants compared to Col-0 and the two single mutants. Similarly, the two double mutants maintained lower Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratios compared to Col-0 and the two single mutants in shoot at 125 mM salt concentration (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10D</xref>), indicating that the <italic>SR3G</italic> mutation indeed compensated for the increased Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation observed in the <italic>wrky75</italic> mutant under salt stress.</p>

<p>Exposure to abiotic stress alters plant architecture by affecting biomass distribution between individual organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Julkowska and Testerink, 2015</xref>). Exposure to drought alters the distribution of the biomass between root and shoot, to optimize water uptake, while limiting transpiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Karcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Uga et al., 2013</xref>). While the processes underlying salt-induced changes in shoot and root growth dynamics and architecture have been systematically described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ariel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Awlia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Deolu-Ajayi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Duan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Geng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>; Yutao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zou et al., 2022</xref>), the methodological exploration of biomass distribution between root and shoot for plants exposed to salt stress is underexplored in the current body of research. Here, we developed a tool that allows a non-destructive quantification of root and shoot projected area of the seedlings grown on agar plates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This new tool allows us to efficiently describe changes in biomass accumulation and stress-induced alterations in root and shoot growth. Although the method is restricted to small plants and early developmental stages, it provides valuable insight into stress responses. The application of this tool to an Arabidopsis natural diversity panel revealed that salt stress exposure results in loss of coordination between root and shoot growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), rather than a clear directional change, as in the case of drought. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of changes in root:shoot ratio. The developed tool for quantifying root and shoot size in plate-grown Arabidopsis has the potential to significantly advance research by enabling developmental and stress studies, focusing on coordination of root and shoot development during seedling establishment. Facilitating detailed comparisons of root:shoot ratios, this tool can aid in formulating new hypotheses about the mechanisms contributing to seedling vigor and stress tolerance.</p>
<p>The natural variation in salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio revealed a clear association with SNPs on chromosome 3 within <italic>SR3G</italic>, that is situated within a region containing eight other <italic>DUF247</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). SR3G was previously associated with self-incompatibility in grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Crain et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lian et al., 2021</xref>), as well as with lesions and dwarfism in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kondou et al., 2013</xref>) through constitutive activation of defense responses. However, the <italic>SR3G</italic> associated with constitutive defense response was AT3G60470 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kondou et al., 2013</xref>), which is located outside the interval associated with salt stress-induced changes in root:shoot ratio (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Because we did not observe any consistent phenotypes in the T-DNA insertion lines of <italic>DUF247s</italic> neighboring the <italic>SR3G</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S19-20</xref>), we examined the RNAi lines targeting multiple <italic>DUF247s</italic> including <italic>SR3G</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S21-23</xref>). Our root system architecture analyses revealed no redundancy between <italic>SR3G</italic> and other DUF247s, and the reduced lateral root development in double mutants of RNAi lines simply mimics the phenotype of <italic>sr3g-5</italic> single mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S21</xref>). Further, we demonstrated that only <italic>SR3G</italic> is regulated by <italic>WRKY75</italic> (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B-E</xref>). As these genes are result of tandem duplication, they are expected to accumulate a lot of variation in the cis-regulatory regions. Therefore, differential regulation of two closely related genes can be expected by the accumulated variation within the promoter region.</p>
<p>The results acquired in this study provide multiple layers of evidence that support the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> as a negative regulator of salt stress response in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function <italic>SR3G</italic> maintained higher shoot growth rate and larger rosette area when exposed to salt stress in the soil (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>), probably due to reduced Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), which in turn resulted in lower rates of cellular damage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). This increased salt tolerance feature can be explained by the increased root suberization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) as suberin-deficient mutants show susceptibility to salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barberon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Shukla et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ursache et al., 2021</xref>). For example, Arabidopsis <italic>CYP86A1/HORST</italic> (At5g58860) encodes a cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme that is responsible for catalyzing fatty acid ω-hydroxylation. It plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of aliphatic suberin, particularly expressed in the root endodermis. Knock-out mutations of <italic>CYP86A1/HORST</italic> result in a substantial decrease of approximately 60% in total root suberin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Höfer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, the diminished aliphatic suberin content in the roots of <italic>cyp86a1</italic> mutants leads to increased permeability to water and solutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ranathunge and Schreiber, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>SR3G</italic> expression is enhanced by salt stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S13</xref>), specifically in the root stele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Fig. S13B</xref>). The root stele encompasses vascular bundles, procambium and pericycle, which gives rise to the secondary growth and lateral root primordia respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Birnbaum et al., 2003</xref>). The stele is central to the systemic transport of water, minerals, and nutrients within the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ramachandran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zarebanadkouki et al., 2019</xref>), and to the exclusion of salt ions from the transpiration stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Møller et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The deposition of hydrophobic residues of lignin and suberin in the Casparian strips poses a significant barrier to apoplastic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Foster and Miklavcic, 2017</xref>). Previously, silencing genes involved in Casparian strips formation resulted in increased lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). As the suberization of the Casparian strips increases upon salt stress, it limits the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> and loss of K<sup>+</sup> ions from the root stele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barberon et al., 2016</xref>). However, the effects of increased root suberization under salt stress have thus far not been described to affect lateral root development. Here, we have identified <italic>SR3G</italic> as a negative regulator of root suberization under salt stress (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), which provides an additional layer of protection against sodium accumulation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), but negatively impacts lateral root development (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-B</xref>).</p>
<p>As SR3G was previously not described in the context of salt stress, we attempted to identify its molecular context through its transcriptional regulation. Through our <italic>in-silico</italic> analysis, we have identified <italic>WRKY75</italic> as a putative regulator of <italic>SR3G</italic> expression, and confirmed it using RT-qPCR and Y1H assay (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). WRKY75 was previously described to act as a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance through activation of <italic>SOS1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lu et al., 2023</xref>). Similar to previous study, we also observed <italic>wrky75</italic> mutants to be more sensitive to salt stress within our experiments (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A-C</xref>). Nevertheless, when the <italic>wrky75</italic> mutation was coupled with <italic>sr3g-5</italic>, the roots displayed a phenotype identical to Col-0 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>), implying that the salt sensitivity of the <italic>wrky75</italic> mutant was counteracted by the <italic>SR3G</italic> mutation. Considering <italic>WRKY75’s</italic> role in positively regulating <italic>SOS1</italic> expression during salt stress, it is plausible that its binding to the <italic>SR3G</italic> promoter inhibits its expression, thereby enhancing salt tolerance on a larger scale.</p>
<p>One of the main players in Na<sup>+</sup> transport is High-affinity K<sup>+</sup> Transporter (HKT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Laurie et al., 2002</xref>). HKT1 is expressed in root stele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mäser et al., 2002</xref>), where it retrieves Na<sup>+</sup> from the transpiration stream and limits ion accumulation in the shoot, resulting in higher salt stress tolerance at later developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Møller et al., 2009</xref>). At early developmental stages, <italic>HKT1</italic> overexpression reduces the development of lateral root primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>), thus creating less Na<sup>+</sup> entry gate into the main root, resulting in less Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in shoot. Similarly, <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutants developed fewer lateral roots that are consistent with the lower Na<sup>+</sup> levels in the root upon salt stress (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The effects of HKT1 and SR3G differ in the magnitude of repression of lateral root development, with HKT1 mutants resulting in almost complete cessation of lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>), whereas repression of SR3G function has much more subtle phenotype. Whereas the effect of cell-type specific overexpression of HKT1 on plant performance was negative during the early developmental stage, due to impairing lateral root development, the <italic>sr3g</italic> mutants showed increased salt tolerance when exposed to salt stress treatment during their early vegetative growth (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). These results suggest that reduced lateral root development under salt stress can have a gradient of responses leading to increased and decreased salt tolerance, and the effect is highly dependent on the wider physiological mechanisms, and their contributions to ion exclusion and maintained plant development throughout salt stress exposure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the study of salt-induced changes in the root:shoot ratio, alongside the development of new tools to quantify these changes during the seedling establishment stage, represents an important new perspective into mechanisms underlying salt stress tolerance. Identification of SR3G as a novel regulator of root suberization, shoot growth, and Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation provides better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to salt stress, but also offers a new avenue to explore more nuanced and tissue-specific strategies for enhancing salt stress tolerance.</p>

<p>The authors aim to assess the effect of salt stress on root:shoot ratio, identify the underlying genetic mechanisms, and evaluate their contribution to salt tolerance. To this end, the authors systematically quantified natural variations in salt-induced changes in root: shoot ratio. This innovative approach considers the coordination of root and shoot growth rather than exploring biomass and development of each organ separately. Using this approach, the authors identified a gene cluster encoding eight paralog genes with a domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), with the majority of SNPs clustering into SR3G (At3g50160).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Salt stress is a significant and growing concern for agriculture in some parts of the world. While the effects of sodium excess have been studied in Arabidopsis and (many) crop species, most studies have focused on Na uptake, toxicity and overall effects on yield, rather than on developmental responses to excess Na, per se. The work by Ishka and colleagues aims to fill this gap.</p>
<p>Working from an existing dataset that exposed a diverse panel of A. thaliana accessions to control, moderate, and severe salt stress, the authors identify candidate loci associated with altering the root:shoot ratio under salt stress. Following a series of molecular assays, they characterize a DUF247 protein which they dub SR3G, which appears to be a negative regulator of root growth under salt stress.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a well-executed study which demonstrates the functional role played by a single gene in plant response to salt stress in Arabidopsis.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>All of the issues that I raised in previous reviews have been addressed by the authors. That said, there are several points that I see have come up in subsequent reviews that remain unresolved.</p>
<p>In response to Reviewer 1, comment 2, regarding changes in expression differences, the authors are misinterpreting simple statistical results. They say that they performed Tukey tests for differences of means, finding, for example, that two means have the same group assignments (in this case, both &quot;c,d&quot;) but then argue that &quot;we still observed a clear reduction in WRKY75 transcript abundance.&quot; This is not how statistical tests work - we cannot perform a formal test for means and then just do an eyeball test. They also misinterpret the result in which one mean is assigned &quot;b,c,d&quot; results and a second &quot;c,d&quot; - these are statistically overlapping means.</p>
<p>Having said this, I do think that the subtle differences in expression between these different alleles is not critical to the central message of the study. It can be difficult to recapitulate results between labs, much less between different synthetic alleles. I think, in this case, we can let readers decide for themselves whether the reported differences - or lack thereof - is important for follow-up work.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to assess the effect of salt stress on root:shoot ratio, identify the underlying genetic mechanisms, and evaluate their contribution to salt tolerance. To this end, the authors systematically quantified natural variations in salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio. This innovative approach considers the coordination of root and shoot growth rather than exploring biomass and the development of each organ separately. Using this approach, the authors identified a gene cluster encoding eight paralog genes with a domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), with the majority of SNPs clustering into SR3G (At3g50160). In the manuscript, the authors utilized an integrative approach that includes genomic, genetic, evolutionary, histological, and physiological assays to functionally assess the contribution of their genes of interest to salt tolerance and root development.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>As the authors correctly noted, variations across samples, genotypes, or experiments make achieving statistical significance challenging. Should the authors choose to emphasize trends across experiments to draw biological conclusions, careful revisions of the text, including titles and figure legends, will be necessary to address some of the inconsistencies between figures (see examples below). However, I would caution that this approach may dilute the overall impact of the work on SR3G function and regulation. Therefore, I strongly recommend pursuing additional experimental evidence wherever possible to strengthen the conclusions.</p>
<p>(1) Given the phenotypic differences shown in Figures S17A-B, 10A-C, and 6A, the statement that &quot;SR3G does not play a role in plant development under non-stress conditions&quot; (lines 680-681) requires revision to better reflect the observed data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you to the reviewer for the comment. We appreciate the acknowledgment that variations among experiments are inherent to biological studies. Figures 6A and S17 represent the same experiment, which initially indicated a phenotype for the sr3g mutant under salt stress. To ensure that growth changes were specifically normalized for stress conditions, we calculated the Stress Tolerance Index (Fig. 6B). In Figure 10, we repeated the experiment including all five genotypes, which supported our original observation that the sr3g mutant exhibited a trend toward reduced lateral root number under 75 mM NaCl compared to Col-0, although this difference was not significant (Fig. 10B). Additionally, we confirmed that the wrky75 mutant showed a significant reduction in main root growth under salt stress compared to Col-0, consistent with findings reported in The Plant Cell by Lu et al. 2023. For both main root length and lateral root number, we demonstrated that the double mutants of wrky75/sr3g displayed growth comparable to wild-type Col-0. This result suggests that the sr3g mutation compensates for the salt sensitivity of the wrky75 mutant.</p>
<p>We completely agree with the reviewer that there is a variation in our results regarding the sr3g phenotype under control conditions, as presented in Fig. 6A/Fig. S17 and Fig. 10A-C. In Fig. 6A/Fig. S17, we did not observe any consistent trends in main root or lateral root length for the sr3g mutant compared to Col-0 under control conditions. However, in Fig. 10A-C, we observed a significant reduction in main root length, lateral root number, and lateral root length for the sr3g mutant under control conditions. We believe this may align with SR3G’s role as a negative regulator of salt stress responses. While loss of this gene benefits plants in coping with salt stress, it might negatively impact overall plant growth under non-stress conditions. This interpretation is further supported by our findings on the root suberization pattern in sr3g mutants under control conditions (Fig. 8B), where increased suberization in root sections 1 to 3, compared to Col-0, could inhibit root growth. While SR3G's role in overall plant fitness is intriguing, it is beyond the scope of this study. We cannot rule out the possibility that SR3G contributes positively to plant growth, particularly root growth. That said, we observed no differences in shoot growth between Col-0 and the sr3g mutant under control conditions (Fig. 7). Additionally, we calculated the Stress Tolerance Index for all aspects of root growth shown in Fig. 10 and presented it in Fig. S25.</p>
<p>To address the reviewer request on rephrasing the lines 680-681 from&quot;SR3G does not play a role in plant development under non-stress conditions&quot; (lines 680-681) statement, this statement is found in lines 652-653 and corresponds to Fig. 7, where we evaluated rosette growth in the WT and sr3g mutant under both control and salt stress conditions. We did not observe any significant differences or even trends between the two genotypes under control conditions, confirming the accuracy of the statement. To clarify further, we have added “<italic>SR3G</italic> does not play a role in rosette growth and development under non-stress conditions”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I agree with the authors that detecting expression differences in lowly expressed genes can be challenging. However, as demonstrated in the reference provided (Lu et al., 2023), a significant reduction in WRKY75 expression is observed in T-DNA insertion mutant alleles of WRKY75. In contrast, Fig. 9B in the current manuscript shows no reduction in WRKY75 expression in the two mutant alleles selected by the authors, which suggests that these alleles cannot be classified as loss-of-function mutants (line 745). Additionally, the authors note that the wrky75 mutant exhibits reduced main root length under salt stress, consistent with the phenotype reported by Lu et al. (2023). However, other phenotypic discrepancies exist between the two studies. For example, 1) Lu et al. (2023) report that w¬rky75 root length is comparable to WT under control conditions, whereas the current manuscript shows that wrky75 root growth is significantly lower than WT; 2) under salt stress, Lu et al. (2023) show that wrky75 accumulates higher levels of Na+, whereas the current study finds Na+ levels in wrky75 indistinguishable from WT. To confirm the loss of WRKY75 function in these T-DNA insertion alleles the authors should provide additional evidence (e.g., Western blot analysis).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer acknowledging the challenge of detecting expression differences in lowly expressed genes, such as transcription factors. Transcription factors are typically expressed at lower levels compared to structural or enzymatic proteins, as they function as regulators where small quantities can have substantial effects on downstream gene expression.</p>
<p>That said, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s interpretation that there is no reduction in WRKY75 expression in the two mutant lines tested in Fig. 9C. Among the two independent alleles examined, <italic>wrky75-3</italic> showed a clear reduction in expression compared to WT Col-0 under both control and salt stress conditions. Using the Tukey test to compare all groups, we observed distinct changes in the assigned significance letters for each case:</p>
<p>Col/root/control (<bold>cd</bold>) vs wrky75-3/root/control (<bold>cd</bold>): Although the same significance letter was assigned, we still observed a clear reduction in WRKY75 transcript abundance. More importantly, the variation in expression is notably lower compared to Col-0.</p>
<p>Col/shoot/control (bcd) vs wrky75-3/shoot/control (a): This is significant reduction compared to Col</p>
<p>Col/root/salt (cd) vs wrky75-3/root/salt (bcd): Once again, the reduction in WRKY75 transcript levels corresponds to changes in the assigned significance letters.</p>
<p>Col/shoot/salt (bc) vs wrky75-3/shoot/salt (ab): Once again, the reduction in WRKY75 transcript levels corresponds to changes in the assigned significance letters.</p>
<p>To address the reviewer’s comment regarding the significant reduction in WRKY75 expression observed in T-DNA insertion mutant alleles of WRKY75 in the reference by Lu et al., 2023, we would like to draw the reviewer’s attention to the following points:</p>
<p>a) Different alleles: The authors in <italic>The Plant Cell</italic> used different alleles than those used in our study, with one of their alleles targeting regions upstream of the WRKY75 gene. While we identified one of their described alleles (WRKY75-1, SALK_101367) on the T-DNA express website, which targets upstream of WRKY75, the other allele (wrky75-25) appears to have been generated through a different mechanism (possibly an RNAi line) that is not defined in the <italic>Plant Cell</italic> paper and does not appear on the T-DNA express website. The authors mentioned they have received these seeds as gifts from other labs in the acknowledgement ”We thank Prof. Hongwei Guo (Southern University of Science and Technology, China) and Prof. Diqiu Yu (Yunnan University, China) for kindly providing the <italic>WRKY75<sub>pro</sub>:GUS</italic>, <italic>35S<sub>pro</sub>:WRKY75-GFP</italic>, wrky75-1, and wrky75-25 seeds. We thank Man-cang Zhang (Electrophysiology platform, Henan University) for performing the NMT experiment”.</p>
<p>However, in our study, we selected two different T-DNAs that target the coding regions. While this may explain slight differences in the observed responses, both studies independently link WRKY75 to salt stress, regardless of the alleles used. For your reference, we have included a screenshot of the different alleles used.</p>

<p>b) Different developmental stages: They measured WRKY75 expression in 5-day-old seedlings. In our experiment, we used seedlings grown on 1/2x MS for 4 days, followed by transfer to treatment plates with or without 75 mM NaCl for one week. As a result, we analyzed older plants (12 days old) for gene expression analysis. Despite the difference in developmental stage, we were still able to observe a reduction in gene expression.</p>
<p>c) Different tissues: The authors of <italic>The Plant Cell</italic> used whole seedlings for gene expression analysis, whereas we separated the roots and shoots and measured gene expression in each tissue type individually. This approach is logical, as WRKY75 is a root cell-specific transcription factor with higher expression in the roots compared to the shoots, as demonstrated in our analysis (Fig. 9C).</p>
<p>Based on the reasoning above, we did work with loss-of-function mutants of WRKY75, particularly wrky75-3. To more accurately reflect the nature of the mutation, we have changed the term &quot;loss-of-function&quot; to &quot;knock-down&quot; in line 717.</p>
<p>The reviewer mentioned phenotypic discrepancies between the two studies. We agree that there are some differences, particularly in the magnitude of responses or expression levels. However, despite variations in the alleles used, developmental stages, and tissue types, both studies reached the same conclusion: WRKY75 is involved in the salt stress response and acts as a positive regulator. We have discussed the differences between our study and <italic>The Plant Cell</italic> in the section above, summarizing them into three main points: different alleles, different developmental stages, and different tissue types.</p>
<p>To address the reviewer’s comment regarding &quot;Lu et al. (2023) report that wrky75 root length is comparable to WT under control conditions, whereas the current manuscript shows that wrky75 root growth is significantly lower than WT&quot;: We evaluated root growth differently than <italic>The Plant Cell</italic> study. In <italic>The Plant Cell</italic> (Fig. 5, H-J), root elongation was measured in 10-day-old plants with a single time point measurement. They transferred five-day-old wild-type, wrky75-1, wrky75-25, and WRKY75-OE plants to 1/2× MS medium supplemented with 0 mM or 125 mM NaCl for further growth and photographed them 5 days after transfer. In contrast, our study used 4-day-old seedlings, which were transferred to 1/2 MS with or without 0, 75, or 125 mM salt for additional growth (9 days). Rather than measuring root growth only at the end, we scanned the roots every other day, up to five times, to assess root growth rates. Essentially, the precision of our method is higher as we captured growth changes throughout the developmental process, compared to the approach used in <italic>The Plant Cell</italic>. We do not underestimate the significance of the work conducted by other colleagues in the field, but we also recognize that each laboratory has its own approach and specific practices. This variation in experimental setup is intrinsic to biology, and we believe it is important to study biological phenomena in different ways. Especially as the common or contrasting conclusions reached by different studies, performed by different labs and using different experimental setups are shedding more light on reproducibility and gene contribution across different conditions, which is intrinsic to phenotypic plasticity, and GxE interactions.</p>
<p><italic>The Plant Cell</italic> used a very high salt concentration, starting at 125 mM, while we were more cautious in our approach, as such a high concentration can inhibit and obscure more subtle phenotypic changes.</p>
<p>To address the reviewer’s comment on &quot;Lu et al. (2023) show that wrky75 accumulates higher levels of Na+, whereas the current study finds Na+ levels in wrky75 indistinguishable from WT,&quot; we would like to highlight the differences in the methodologies used in both studies. <italic>The Plant Cell</italic> measured Na+ accumulation in the wrky75 mutant using xylem sap (Supplemental Figure S10), which appears to be a convenient and practical approach in their laboratory. In their experiment, wild-type and wrky75 mutant plants were grown in soil for 3 weeks, watered with either a mock solution or 100 mM NaCl solution for 1 day, and then xylem sap was collected for Na+ content analysis. In contrast, our study employed a different method to measure Na+ and K+ ion content, using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) for root and shoot Na+ and K+ measurements. Additionally, we collected samples after two weeks on treatment plates and focused on the Na+/K+ ratio, which we consider more relevant than net Na+ or K+ levels, as the ratio of these ions is a critical determinant of plant salt tolerance. With this in mind, we observed a considerable non-significant increase in the Na+/K+ ratio in the shoots of the wrky75-3 mutant (assigned Tukey’s letter c) compared to the Col-0 WT (assigned Tukey’s letters abc) under 125 mM salt, suggesting that this mutant is salt-sensitive. Importantly, the Na+/K+ ratio in the double wrky75/sr3g mutants was reduced to the WT level under the same salt conditions, further indicating that the salt sensitivity of wrky75 is mitigated by the sr3g mutation.</p>
<p>Based on the reasons mentioned above, we believe that conducting additional experiments, such as Western blot analysis, is unnecessary and would not contribute new insights or alter the context of our findings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Salt stress is a significant and growing concern for agriculture in some parts of the world. While the effects of sodium excess have been studied in Arabidopsis and (many) crop species, most studies have focused on Na uptake, toxicity and overall effects on yield, rather than on developmental responses to excess Na, per se. The work by Ishka and colleagues aims to fill this gap.</p>
<p>Working from an existing dataset that exposed a diverse panel of A. thaliana accessions to control, moderate, and severe salt stress, the authors identify candidate loci associated with altering the root:shoot ratio under salt stress. Following a series of molecular assays, they characterize a DUF247 protein which they dub SR3G, which appears to be a negative regulator of root growth under salt stress.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a well-executed study which demonstrates the functional role played by a single gene in plant response to salt stress in Arabidopsis.</p>
<p>Review of revised manuscript:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my point-by-point comments to my satisfaction. In the cases where they have changed their manuscript language, clarified figures, or added analyses I have no further comment. In some cases, there is a fruitful back-and-forth discussion of methodology which I think will be of interest to readers.</p>
<p>I have nothing to add during this round of review. I think that the paper and associated discussion will make a nice contribution to the field.</p>

<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s recognition of the significance of our work to the field.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Lines 518-519: The statement that other DUF247s exhibit similar expression patterns to SR3G, suggesting their responsiveness to salt stress, is not fully supported by Fig. S14. Please clarify the specific similarities (and differences) in the expression patterns of the DUF247s shown in Fig. S14, as their expression appears to be spatially and temporally diverse. Additionally, the scale is missing in Fig. S14.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer. We fixed the text and added expression scales to Figure S14.</p>

<p>Lines 721-723: The signal quantification in Fig. 8B does not support the claim that &quot;in section one,..., sr3g-5 showed more suberization compared to Col-0.&quot; Given the variability and noise often associated with histological dyes such as Fluorol Yellow staining, conclusions should be cautiously grounded in robust signal quantification. Additionally, please specify the number of biological replicates used in both Fig. 8B and C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. We believe the statement in the text accurately reflects our results presented in Figure 8B, where we stated “non-significant, but substantially higher levels of root suberization in <italic>sr3g-5</italic> compared to Col-0 in sections one to three of the root under control condition (Fig. 8B).” Therefore, we kept the statement and have included the number of biological replicates in the figure legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 731-732: Please provide a more detailed explanation of how the significant changes in suberin monomer levels align with the Fluorol Yellow staining results, and clarify how these findings support the proposed negative role of SR3G in root suberization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fluorol Yellow is a lipophilic dye widely used to label suberin in plant tissues, specifically in roots in this study. Given the inherent variability in histological assays, we confirmed the increase in suberization using an alternative method, Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Both approaches revealed elevated suberin levels in the sr3g mutant compared to Col-0. Since the overall suberin content was higher in the mutant under both control and salt stress conditions, we proposed that SR3G acts as a negative regulator of root suberization.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 686-688 and Figure S24: The authors calculated water mass as FW-DW. A more standard approach for calculating water content is (FW-DW)/FW x 100. Please update the text or adjust the calculation accordingly. Additionally, if the goal is to test differences between WT and the mutant within each condition, a t-test would be a more appropriate statistical method.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer. We added water content % to the figure S24. We kept the statistical test as it is as we wanted to be able to observe changes across conditions and genotypes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 633-635 states that &quot;No significant difference was observed between sr3g-4 and Col-0 (Fig. S18), except for the Stress Tolerance Index (STI) calculated using growth rates of lateral root length and number.&quot; However, based on the Figure S18 legend and statistical analysis (i.e., ns), it appears that the sr3g-4 mutant shows no alterations in root system architecture compared to Col-0. Please revise the text to accurately reflect the results of the statistical analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer. We now fixed the text to reflect the result.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 698-707: The statistical analysis does not support the reported differences in the Na+/K+ ratio for the single and double mutants of sr3g-5 and wrky75-3 (Fig. 10D, where levels connected by the same letters indicate they are not significantly different). Furthermore, the conclusion that &quot;the SR3G mutation indeed compensated for the increased Na+ accumulation observed in the wrky75 mutant under salt stress&quot; is also based on non-significant differences (Fig. S25B). Please revise the text to accurately reflect the results of the statistical analysis. Additionally, since each mutant is compared to the WT, I recommend using Dunnett's test for statistical analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their feedback. We have carefully revised the text to better support our findings. As previously mentioned, variations among samples are evident and are well-reflected across all our datasets. We have presented all data and focused on identifying trends within our samples to guide interpretation.</p>
<p>We observed that the SR3G mutation effectively compensated for the increased Na+ accumulation observed in the wrky75 mutant under salt stress. A closer examination of the shoot Na+/K+ ratio under 125 mM salt shows that the wrky75 single mutant has a higher Na+/K+ ratio (indicated by the letter &quot;c&quot;) compared to Col-0 (indicated by &quot;abc&quot;) and the two double mutants (also indicated by &quot;abc&quot;). Therefore, we have retained the statistical analysis as originally conducted, and maintain our conclusions as is.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 6: data in panel C present the Na/K ratio, not Na+ content. Based on the statistical analysis of root Na+ levels presented in Fig. S17C, there is no significant difference between sr3g-5 and WT. Please update the title of Fig. 6. In addition, in panel A, the title of the Y-axis and figure legend should be &quot;Lateral root growth rate&quot; without the word length, and in panel C, the statistical analysis is missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer. We updated Fig. 6 title and fixed the Y-axis in panel A, and added statistical letters to panel C. Legend was updated to reflect the changes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 7: Please clearly label the time points where significant differences between genotypes are observed for both early and late salt treatments. Was there a significant difference recorded between WT and sr3g-5 on day 0 under early salt stress? Such differences may arise from initial variations in plant size within this experiment, as indicated by Fig. 7B, where significant differences in rosette area are evident starting from day 0. Additionally, please indicate the statistical analysis in panel E.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We updated the figure with a statistical test added to the panel E. Although the difference between sr3g mutant and Col-0 is indeed significant in its growth rate at day 0, we would like to draw the attention of the reviewer that this growth rate was calculated over the 24 hours after adding salt stress. Therefore, this difference in growth rate is related to exposure to salt stress. Moreover, the growth rate between Col-0 and sr3g mutant does not differ in two other treatments (Control and Late Salt Stress) further supporting the conclusion that sr3g is affecting rosette size and growth rate only under early salt stress conditions.</p>
<p>We have also added the Salt Tolerance Index calculation to Figure S24 as additional evidence, controlling for potential differences in size between Col-0 and sr3g mutant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure S17: statistical analysis is not indicated in panels A, B, and D.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for spotting that. We updated the figure with a statistical test.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figures S21-23: The quality of these figures is insufficient, hindering the ability to effectively interpret the authors' results and main message. Furthermore, a Dunnett's test, rather than a t-test, is the appropriate statistical method for this analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this observation. We have now added a high resolution figures for all supplemental figures, which should increase the resolution of the figures. As we are comparing all of the genotypes to Col-0 one-by-one - the results of individual t-tests are sufficient for this analysis.</p>
