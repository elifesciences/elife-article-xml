<title>Abstract</title><p>Interpretation of variants identified during genetic testing is a significant clinical challenge. In this study, we developed a high-throughput CDKN2A functional assay and characterized all possible <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants. We found that 40% of all missense variants were functionally deleterious. We also used our functional classification to assess the performance of in silico models that predict the effect of variants, including recently reported models based on machine learning. Notably, we found that all in silico models similarly when compared to our functional classifications with accuracies of 54.6 – 70.9%. Furthermore, while we found that functionally deleterious variants were enriched within ankyrin repeats, rarely were all missense variants at a single residue functionally deleterious. Our functional classifications are a resource to aid the interpretation of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> variants and have important implications for the application of variant interpretation guidelines, particularly the use of in silico models for clinical variant interpretation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genetic testing of patients with cancer to identify variants associated with an increased cancer risk and sensitivity to targeted therapies is becoming more common as broad testing criteria are integrated into clinical care guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Goggins et al., 2020</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Stoffel et al., 2019</xref></xref>). American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) provides a framework to integrate multiple types of evidence, including variant characteristics, disease epidemiology, clinical information, and functional classifications, to interpret variants in any gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Richards et al., 2015</xref></xref>). In silico variant effect predictors are also integrated into AMCG variant interpretation guidelines as supporting evidence to aid classification of variants. While numerous models have been developed, varied accuracy, poor agreement between models, and inflated performance on publicly available data have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cubuk et al., 2021</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jaffe et al., 2011</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wilcox et al., 2022</xref></xref>). Recently developed variant effect predictors aim to overcome these limitations by incorporating deep-learning based protein structure predictions and by not training on human annotated datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brandes et al., 2023</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cheng et al., 2023</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gao et al., 2023</xref></xref>). However, post-development assessment of machine learning based variant effect predictors to determine accuracy on novel experimental datasets and suitability for clinical use are limited.</p>
<p>Variants that cannot be classified as either pathogenic or benign are categorized as variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). However, while pathogenic and benign variants identified during genetic testing are clinically actionable, VUSs are the cause of deep uncertainty for patients and their health care providers as an unknown fraction are functionally deleterious and therefore, likely pathogenic. For example, individuals with germline VUSs in a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene would not be eligible for clinical surveillance programs that are associated with improved patient outcomes, unless they otherwise meet family history criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Goggins et al., 2020</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Stoffel et al., 2019</xref></xref>). Similarly, patients with breast or pancreatic cancer and a germline <italic>BRCA2</italic> VUS would not be eligible for treatment with olaparib, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Golan et al., 2019</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tutt et al., 2021</xref></xref>). Reclassification of VUSs into pathogenic or benign strata has real-world, life-or-death consequences that necessitate a high degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>Germline VUSs in hereditary cancer genes are a frequent finding in patients with cancer and frequently can be reclassified as pathogenic on the basis of in vitro functional characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kimura et al., 2022</xref></xref>). In patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), germline <italic>CDKN2A</italic> VUSs affecting p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, most often rare missense variants, are found in up to 4.3% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chaffee et al., 2018</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kimura et al., 2021</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">McWilliams et al., 2018</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Roberts et al., 2016</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shindo et al., 2017</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhen et al., 2015</xref></xref>). As functional data from well-validated in-vitro assays are incorporated into ACMG variant interpretation guidelines, we recently determined the functional consequence of 29 <italic>CDKN2A</italic> VUSs identified in patients with PDAC using an in vitro cell proliferation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kimura et al., 2022</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Richards et al., 2015</xref></xref>). We found that over 40% of VUSs assayed were functionally deleterious and could reclassified as likely pathogenic.</p>
<p>Functional characterization is time-consuming, expensive, and requires technical and scientific expertise. These limitations hinder assessment of in silico variant effect predictors and patient access to functional data that may allow reclassification of VUSs into clinically actionable strata. As <italic>CDKN2A</italic> VUSs will continue to be identified in patients with cancer undergoing genetic testing, we developed a multiplexed functional assay to provide a broad interpretation framework for <italic>CDKN2A</italic> variants. We characterized all possible <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants and compared our functional classifications to including recently developed in silico models based on machine learning to determine the accuracy of variant effect predictions.</p>

<title>Functional characterization of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants</title>
<p>We utilized a codon optimized <italic>CDKN2A</italic> sequence for our multiplexed functional assay (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Appendix 1-table 1</xref>). Expression of codon optimized CDKN2A or three synonymous CDKN2A variants, p.L32L, p.G101G, and p.V126V, in PANC-1, a PDAC cell line with a homozygous deletion of <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, resulted in significant reduction is cell proliferation (P value &lt; 0.0001; <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Conversely, expression of three pathogenic variants, p.L32P, p.G101W, and p.V126D, in PANC-1 cells did not result in any significant changes in cell proliferation. To determine if there were unappreciated selective effects during in vitro culture, we generated a CellTag library based on the pLJM1 plasmid that contained twenty non-functional 9 base pair barcodes of equal representation. We then transduced PANC-1 cells stably expressing codon optimized CDKN2A with the CellTag library and determined representation of each barcode in the cell pool, before and after in vitro culture. We found no statistically significant changes in barcode representation, indicating that representation of a pool of functionally neutral variants is stable over a period of in vitro culture representing our assay time course (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>We next determined whether we could identify functionally deleterious <italic>CDKN2A</italic> variants at a single residue when all amino acid variants were assayed simultaneously. We generated lentiviral expression libraries for two CDKN2A amino acid residues, p.V126 and p.R144, that include pathogenic and benign variants, respectively. Each lentiviral expression library contained all amino acid variants (19 missense and 1 synonymous variant) at a single residue. We then transduced PANC-1 cells with each of the lentiviral expression libraries and determined the representation of each variant in the resulting cell pool before and after a period of in vitro culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Synonymous variants, p.V126V and p.R1441R, as well as a previously reported benign variant, p.R144C, either decreased or maintained their representation in the cell pool during in vitro culture. Representation of a previously reported pathogenic variant, p.V126D, increased in the cell pool. Notably, several other variants including p.V126R, p.V126W, p.V126K, and p.V126Y, increased in representation, suggesting that additional amino acid changes at this residue are functionally deleterious (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, to functionally characterize 2,964 <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants, we generated 156 CDKN2A lentiviral expression libraries where each library contained all possible amino acid substitutions at a single residue. PANC-1 cells were then transduced with each of the lentiviral expression libraries and representation of each <italic>CDKN2A</italic> variant in the resulting cell pool determined before and after a period of in vitro culture. Variant read counts were then analyzed using a gamma generalized linear model and variants with statistically significant P values were classified as functionally deleterious. Variants with P values that did not reach statistical significance were classified as functionally deleterious.</p>
<p>We found that 1,182 of 2,964 missense variants (39.9%) characterized in our assay were functionally deleterious and that 1,782 variants (60.1%) were functionally neutral (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Appendix 1-table 2). In general, our results were consistent with previously reported classifications. Thirty-two variants identified in patients with cancer and previously reported to be functionally deleterious in published literature and/or reported in ClinVar as pathogenic or likely pathogenic were characterized as functionally deleterious in our assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, Appendix 1-table 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chaffee et al., 2018</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chang et al., 2016</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Horn et al., 2021</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hu et al., 2018</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kimura et al., 2022</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">McWilliams et al., 2018</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Roberts et al., 2016</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhen et al., 2015</xref></xref>). Of 162 benign variants, including 156 synonymous variants and six missense variants previously reported to be functionally neutral in published literature and/or reported in ClinVar as benign or likely benign, all were characterized as functionally neutral in our assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, Appendix 1-table 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kimura et al., 2022</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">McWilliams et al., 2018</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Roberts et al., 2016</xref></xref>). Similarly, of 50 missense variants classified as VUSs in ClinVar that also have previously reported functional data, only two variants, p.G35Q and p.G101R, had divergent functional classifications. Both variants were previously reported to have functionally neutral effects but were characterized as functionally deleterious in our assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, Appendix 1-table 2, 3).</p>

<title>Comparison to in silico prediction algorithms</title>
<p>As in silico predictions of variant effect are integrated into ACMG variant interpretation guidelines as supporting evidence, we compared the ability of different algorithms, including recently described algorithms that incorporate deep-learning models of protein structure to predict the functional consequence of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants. Using our functional classifications for all <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants as truth, we compared our functional classifications to predictions from CADD, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, VEST, AlphaMissense, ESM1b, and PrimateAI-3D. Predictions for all missense variants (1,182 functionally deleterious and 1,782 functionally neutral) were available for comparison for all algorithms, except CADD and PrimateAI-3D, where 910 (349 functionally deleterious and 561 functionally neutral) and 904 (349 functionally deleterious and 555 functionally neutral) missense variants had predictions available respectively (Appendix 1-table 4). In silico variant effect predictors performed similarly across a broad range of performance characteristics (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Appendix 1-table 5</xref>). Accuracy of in silico model predictions were 54.6 – 70.9% (CADD – 56.8%; PolyPhen-2 – 54.6%; SIFT – 61.4%; VEST – 70.8%; AlphaMissense – 70.9%; ESM1b – 64.9%; and PrimateAI-3D; 66.7%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We also assessed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for each model. We found that sensitivity was 0.15 – 0.90 (CADD – 0.86; PolyPhen-2 – 0.9; SIFT – 0.64; VEST – 0.67; AlphaMissense – 0.69; ESM1b – 0.77; and PrimateAI-3D – 0.15), specificity was 0.31 – 0.99 (CADD – 0.39; PolyPhen-2 – 0.32; SIFT – 0.60; VEST – 0.74; AlphaMissense – 0.72; ESM1b – 0.57; and PrimateAI-3D – 0.99), positive predictive value was 0.46 – 0.93 (CADD – 0.47; PolyPhen-2 – 0.46; SIFT – 0.51; VEST – 0.63; AlphaMissense – 0.62; ESM1b – 0.54; and PrimateAI-3D – 0.93), and negative predictive value was 0.65 – 0.82 (CADD – 0.81; PolyPhen-2 – 0.82; SIFT – 0.71; VEST – 0.77; AlphaMissense – 0.78; ESM1b – 0.79; and PrimateAI-3D – 0.65).</p>

<title>Distribution of functionally deleterious variants</title>
<p>Functionally deleterious missense variants were not distributed evenly across CDKN2A. CDKN2A contains four ankyrin repeats that mediate protein-protein interactions, ankyrin repeat 1 at codon 11-40, ankyrin repeat 2 at codon 44-72, ankyrin repeat 3 at codon 77-106, and ankyrin repeat 4 at codon 110-139 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Goldstein, 2004</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ruas and Peters, 1998</xref></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sun et al., 2010</xref></xref>) (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Functionally deleterious variants were enriched in ankyrin repeat 1 (44.8%, adjusted P value = 8.5 x 10<sup>-4</sup>), ankyrin repeat 2 (47.4%, adjusted P value = 1.4 x 10<sup>-6</sup>), and ankyrin repeat 3 (55.0%, adjusted P value = 6.1 x 10<sup>-22</sup>), and depleted in ankyrin repeat 4 (27.2%, adjusted P value = 1.6 x 10<sup>-8</sup>), non-ankyrin repeat residue 1-10 (22.0%, adjusted P value = 1.5 x 10<sup>-5</sup>), and residues 140-156 (9.1%, adjusted P value = 4.5 x 10<sup>-30</sup>) (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, functionally deleterious variants were further enriched within 10 residue subregions of ankyrin repeats 1-3, with 59.5% of variants in residues 14 – 23 of ankyrin repeat 1, 63.5% of variants in residues 46-55 of ankyrin repeat 2, and 81.5% of variants in residues 80-89 of ankyrin repeat 3 being classified as functionally deleterious (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Appendix 1-table 2). Furthermore, analysis of functionally deleterious variants may highlight critical and non-critical resides for CDKN2A function.

At six amino acid residues, p.G55, p.P81, p.H83, p.D84, p.G89, and p.P114, all missense variants were functionally deleterious. These residues are conserved between human and murine p16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Byeon et al., 1998</xref></xref>).

<title>Functional effect of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> somatic mutations</title>
<p>Somatic alterations in <italic>CDKN2A</italic> are a frequent finding in many types of cancer. However, not all somatic alterations are unequivocally deleterious to protein function. Missense somatic mutations, for example, are particularly challenging to functionally interpret and the presence of a functionally neutral somatic mutation may impact patient care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tung et al., 2020</xref></xref>). To understand the functional effect of missense somatic mutations in <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, we functionally classified mutations reported in the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Forbes et al., 2009</xref></xref>), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Muddabhaktuni and Koyyala, 2021</xref></xref>), patients with cancer undergoing sequencing at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHU), Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets Clinical Sequencing Cohort (MSK-IMPACT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cheng et al., 2015</xref></xref>). Overall, 355 unique missense somatic mutations were reported, of which 193 (54.4%) were functionally deleterious (Appendix 1-table 6). The percent of missense somatic mutations that were classified as functionally deleterious was greater than the percent of all possible <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants that were classified as functionally deleterious, suggesting enrichment of functionally deleterious missense changes among somatic mutations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Appendix 1-table 6). The prevalence of functionally deleterious missense somatic mutations was similar in COSMIC, TCGA, JHU, and MSK-IMPACT with 55.9%, 68.0%, 65.7%, and 66.7% of mutations being classified as functionally deleterious, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Appendix 1-table 6). Similar to all functionally deleterious variants, functionally deleterious missense somatic mutations were not distributed evenly across <italic>CDKN2A</italic>. Functionally deleterious somatic mutations were enriched within the ankyrin repeat 3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, Appendix 1-table 6), We found that 29.0%, 37.1%, 50.8%, and 42.9% of all functionally deleterious missense somatic mutations occurred within ankyrin repeat 3 in COSMIC, TCGA, JHU, and MSK-IMPACT, respectively, and within this domain, 62.7%, 73.1%, 72.7%, and 70.8% of functionally deleterious mutations were in residues 80-89 in COSMIC, TCGA, JHU, and MSK-IMPACT, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>We were also able to assess the contribution of functionally deleterious <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense somatic mutations in COSMIC, TCGA, JHU, and MSK-IMAPCT by cancer type, and found that 44.4 – 95.7% of reported <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense somatic mutations were functionally deleterious when stratified by cancer type (<xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A-D</xref>).

As the proportion of missense somatic mutations that were functionally deleterious was less in colorectal carcinoma compared to other types of cancer, we assessed whether somatic mutations in mismatch repair genes (<italic>MLH1</italic>, <italic>MSH2</italic>, <italic>MSH6</italic>, and <italic>PMS2</italic>) were associated with the functional status of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense somatic mutations. Thirty-six samples in COSMIC had a <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense somatic mutation, of which 12 samples (33.3%) had a somatic mutation in a mismatch repair gene. We found that 3 of 12 samples (25%) with a somatic mutation in a mismatch repair gene had a functionally deleterious <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense somatic mutation compared to 12 of 24 samples (50%) without a somatic mutation in a mismatch repair gene (Fisher’s exact test; P = 0.2821).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>VUSs in hereditary cancer susceptibility genes, predominantly rare missense variants, are a frequent finding in patients undergoing genetic testing and the cause of significant uncertainty. ACMG variant interpretation guidelines incorporate functional data, as well as other evidence such as in silico predictions of variant effect, to aid classification of variants as either pathogenic or benign. <italic>CDKN2A</italic> VUSs are a frequent finding in patients with PDAC. We previously found that over 40% of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> VUSs were functionally deleterious and therefore could be reclassified as likely pathogenic using ACMG variant interpretation guidelines. In this study, we developed a validated high-throughput in vitro assay and functionally characterized 2,964 <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants, representing all possible single amino acid variants. We found that 1,182 missense variants (39.9%) were functionally deleterious. These pre-defined functional characterizations are resource for the scientific community and can be integrated into variant interpretation schema, such as those from the ACMG, to aid classification of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> germline variants and somatic mutations.</p>
<p>Our comprehensive characterization of all possible <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants allowed us to assess the ability of in silico algorithms – including recently published predictors based on machine learning AlphaMissense, ESM1b, and PrimateAI-3D – to predict the pathogenicity or functional effect of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants. We found that all in silico variant effect predictors assessed performed similarly. Overall, PolyPhen-2 had highest sensitivity and negative predictive value at 0.90 and 0.82 respectively. PrimateAI-3D had the highest specificity and positive predictive values at 0.99 and 0.93, respectively. However, while specificity and positive predictive values were high, Primate AI-3D lowest sensitivity and negative predictive values at 0.15 and 0.65 respectively. Highest accuracy was observed with AlphaMissense at 70.9%, closely followed by VEST at 70.8%. Given that reclassification of VUSs in hereditary cancer genes into inappropriate strata has significant implications for patients, integration of in silico models, including those utilizing machine learning, may be premature. Ultimately, our data support current ACMG guidelines that include in silico predictions of variant effect as supporting evidence of pathogenicity or benign impact.</p>
<p>Our study also provides other insight for the implementation of variant interpretation guidelines. ACMG guidelines include presence of a missense variants at a residue with a previously reported pathogenic variant as moderate evidence of pathogenicity. We found that the mean percent of functionally deleterious missense variants per residue was 39.9% and that only six amino acid residues were all missense variants functionally deleterious. These data suggest, at least for <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, that the presence of a pathogenic missense variant at a residue should be used with caution when classifying other missense variants at the same residue.</p>
<p>Our high-throughput functional assay characterized variants based upon a broad cellular phenotype, cell proliferation, in a single PDAC cell line. However, there appear to be limited cell-specific and assay-specific differences in functional classifications of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> variants. In our previous study, we characterized 29 <italic>CDKN2A</italic> VUSs in three PDAC cell lines, using cell proliferation and cell cycle assays, and found agreement between all functional classifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kimura et al., 2022</xref></xref>). Nevertheless, our assay may not encompass all cellular functions of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and underestimate the number of functionally deleterious missense variants. Moreover, in this study, we found that functionally deleterious effects were enriched among somatic missense mutations compared to all <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants, further supporting the veracity of our functional classifications. Furthermore, in silico models to predict variant effect may characterize function (CADD, PolyPhen-2, and SIFT) or pathogenicity (VEST, AlphaMissense, ESM1b, and PrimateAI-3D). As our assay does not directly characterize pathogenicity, to compare in silico assays, we assumed that predicted pathogenic variants were functionally deleterious.</p>
<p>In this study, we determined functional classifications for all possible <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants to aid variant classifications. Furthermore, comparison of our functional classifications to in silico variant effect predictors, including recently described algorithms based on machine learning, provides performance benchmarks and supports current recommendations integrating data computational data into variant interpretation guidelines.</p>

<title>Functional characterization of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> variants using gamma generalized linear model</title>
<p>We determined if a variant has a fitness advantage by assessing the significance of the observed ratio r<sub>v,cf</sub> at confluence between the number of cells with a missense variant 𝑣 and the number of cells with a synonymous variant at a given amino acid position. Under the assumption that the missense variant is neutral (null model), we assumed that the distribution of r<sub>v,cf</sub> can be explained by two key covariates: 𝑟<sub>𝑣,𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡</sub>, which represent the missense variant-to-synonymous variant ratio at day 9, and 𝑝<sub>𝑣,𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡</sub>, the proportion of the missense variant cells among other variants, including the synonymous variant, at the studied position. More specifically, given the variables 𝑟<sub>𝑣,𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡</sub> 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑝<sub>𝑣,𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡</sub>, the ratio at confluence follows a distribution:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="573507v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where the mean 𝑢<sub>𝑣</sub> of the Gamma distribution is such that:
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="573507v1_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Here, the parameters of the null model to estimate are α, 𝑎, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑏, where α, is the shape parameter of the Gamma distribution and is assumed to be the same for all variants. This model is a Gamma Generalized Linear Model (GLM) over the response variable 𝑟<sub>𝑣,𝑐𝑓</sub> with a log-link function and covariates 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑟<sub>𝑣,𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡</sub>) and 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑝<sub>𝑣,𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡</sub>). Estimating the parameters will provide a null distribution of 𝑟<sub>𝑣,𝑐𝑓</sub>, generating a p-value for every observed 𝑟<sub>𝑣,𝑐𝑓</sub> for any variant at a given position.</p>
<p>To estimate the parameters α, a, and 𝑏, we utilized three control experiments where the CellTag plasmid library was transduced into PANC-1<sup>CDKN2Aco</sup> cells so that each CellTag represented a neutral variant. For a single experiment, every variant can be considered as wild-type, and we test the other 19 variants against it, knowing that they are neutral and therefore follow the null distribution. This provides us with 19 x 20 triplets <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="573507v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, for every experiment, yielding 1140 datapoints when considering all three experiments together. To estimate the parameters using these 1140 data points, we fit the GLM corresponding GLM model using the sklearn.linear_model module.</p>
<p>After the estimation of parameters α, a, and 𝑏, every observation for a tested variant 𝑣 at a given position of the triplet <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="573507v1_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> yields a p-value, defined as the probability of observing a ratio at confluence that is at least 𝑟<sub>𝑣,𝑐𝑓</sub> given 𝑝<sub>𝑣,𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡</sub>, 𝑟<sub>𝑣,𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡</sub> under the null Gamma model. As some variants were tested in repeated experiments, we combined their associated p-values into a single p-value using Fisher’s method. Finally, to determine if a variant presents a fitness advantage, we apply a Benjamini-Hochberg estimator on all the tested variants p-values, fixing the False Discovery Rate at a level of 0.05.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Kimura et al performed a saturation mutagenesis study of CDKN2A to assess the functionality of all possible missense variants and compare them to previously identified pathogenic variants. They also compared their assay result with those from in silico predictors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
CDKN2A is an important gene that modulates cell cycle and apoptosis, therefore it is critical to accurately assess the functionality of missense variants. Overall, the paper reads well and touches upon major discoveries in a logical manner.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The paper lacks proper details for experiments and basic data, leaving the results less convincing. Analyses are superficial and do not provide variant-level resolution.</p>

<p>This study describes a deep mutational scan across CDKN2A using suppression of cell proliferation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells as a readout for CDKN2A function. The results are also compared to in silico variant predictors currently utilized by the current diagnostic frameworks to gauge these predictors' performance. The authors also functionally classify CDKN2A somatic mutations in cancers across different tissues.</p>
<p>This study is a potentially important contribution to the field of cancer variant interpretation for CDKN2A, but is almost impossible to review because of the severe lack of details regarding the methods and incompleteness of the data provided with the paper. We do believe that the cell proliferation suppression assay is robust and works, but when it comes to the screening of the library of CDKN2A variants the lack of primary data and experimental detail prevents assessment of the scientific merit and experimental rigor.</p>
