<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Visual detection is a fundamental natural task. Detection becomes more challenging as the similarity between the target and the background in which it is embedded increases, a phenomenon termed “similarity masking”. To test the hypothesis that V1 contributes to similarity masking, we used voltage sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) to measure V1 population responses while macaque monkeys performed a detection task under varying levels of target-background similarity. Paradoxically, we find that during an initial transient phase, V1 responses to the target are enhanced, rather than suppressed, by target-background similarity. This effect reverses in the second phase of the response, so that in this phase V1 signals are positively correlated with the behavioral effect of similarity. Finally, we show that a simple model with delayed divisive normalization can qualitatively account for our findings. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that a nonlinear gain control mechanism in V1 contributes to perceptual similarity masking.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Searching for, and detecting, visual targets in our environment is a ubiquitous natural task that our visual system performs exceptionally well. A key feature of behavioral detection performance is that the texture similarity between the target and the background in which it is embedded profoundly affects target detectability. The more similar are the target and the background, the harder it is to detect the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Campbell &amp; Kulikowski 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Foley 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sebastian et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Stromeyer &amp; Julesz 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Watson &amp; Solomon 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wilson et al 1983</xref>). This phenomenon, which is termed “similarity masking”, is the foundation of camouflage.</p>
<p>An example of similarity masking is illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>. Detecting a low contrast oriented visual target is easy on a uniform gray background (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Detectability decreases when the target has a similar orientation as the background (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The neural basis of similarity masking is not well understood.</p>

<caption><title>Target-background similarity masking and behavioral task.</title>
<p>(A) Low contrast orientated targets can be easily detected on uniform background. (B) Similarity masking is induced by an orientated background. The same additive target from (A) becomes hard to detect when target orientation matches background orientation. (See also perceptual demonstration in the Supplementary Information.) (C-E) Orientation masking was assessed in two awake behaving macaque monkeys performing a target detection task. Monkey commence the task by fixating at the small bright square (C). A few moments later, a 4° raise-cosine-masked background grating was flashed at ∼3° eccentricity for target detection (D). In 50% of the trials, a small additive horizontal Gabor target was also added to the background (E). The monkey indicated the presence of the target by making a saccade to the target location, and indicated target absent by maintaining gaze at the fixation point. The Gabor target was always the same – a cosine centered, horizontal Gabor at 4cpd on 0.33° FWHM envelope. The background grating was also cosine-centered at 4cpd such that the background completely aligned with the target when they were the same orientation (as in B). Orientation of the grating ranged from 0° to 90° with respect to the Gabor target and was randomized between trials. Bg – background; TBg – target plus background.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The main goal of the current study was to test the hypothesis that neural interactions between the representations of the target and background in the primary visual cortex (V1) contribute to the perceptual effect of similarity masking.</p>
<p>The responses of visual neurons to a target can be strongly modulated by the context in which the stimulus is presented. Such contextual modulations have powerful, complex and diverse effects in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Allman et al 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Angelucci et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Angelucci &amp; Bressloff 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bai et al 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cavanaugh et al 2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Michel et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sceniak et al 1999</xref>). Most of these effects reflect sublinear interactions between the target and the background, suggesting that they could potentially contribute to behavioral masking effects. If nonlinear computations in V1 contribute to similarity masking, we would predict that the signals evoked by a target will be maximally reduced by a background that is similar to the target.</p>
<p>We tested this hypothesis by measuring V1 population responses in macaque monkeys while they performed a visual detection task under masking conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-E</xref>). Because the nature of contextual modulations in V1 is complex, a second goal of our study was to quantitatively characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of V1 population responses to different combinations of targets and backgrounds.</p>
<p>As a first step, we characterized the behavioral effects of similarity masking in two macaque monkeys, demonstrating clear effects of similarity on target detectability and reaction times. These results confirm that macaque monkeys are a good animal model for human similarity masking.</p>
<p>Second, we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grinvald &amp; Hildesheim 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Seidemann et al 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shoham et al 1999</xref>)) to measure V1 population responses at two scales: the scale of the retinotopic map and the scale of orientation columns, while the monkeys performed the similarity masking detection task. To study the effect of similarity masking on the neural detection sensitivity, we constructed a task-specific decoder at each scale. Each decoder first pools the responses using a scale- dependent spatial template and then combines these responses over time to form a decision variable. The distributions of the decision variable in target-present vs. target-absent trials are used to compute neural sensitivity that can be compared to behavioral sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Seidemann &amp; Geisler 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that V1 population responses to the target and background display two distinct phases. An initial transient phase that starts at response onset, and a second phase that lasts until stimulus offset or the animal’s response. Surprisingly, the first phase displays a paradoxical effect; during this phase the target evoked response is strongest when the target and background are similar and is therefore anti- correlated with behavior. This effect reverses in the second phase so that in this phase the target- evoked response is reduced with increased target-background similarity. V1 responses during this second phase are therefore consistent with behavior.</p>
<p>We also observed complex spatiotemporal dynamics of the population response to the target and background stimuli, including a repulsion of V1 columnar-scale representation of target orientation in the direction away from the background orientation.</p>
<p>Finally, we show that a simple dynamic population gain control model can qualitatively account for our physiological and behavioral results, and that the estimated properties of the gain-control mechanism are consistent with a principled computational approach to feature encoding and decoding. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that contextual interactions between the representations of the target and background in V1 are likely to contribute to the perceptual phenomena of similarity masking.</p>

<title>Behavioral effect of target-background similarity masking</title>
<p>To study the neural basis of visual similarity masking, we trained two monkeys (macaque mulatta) to perform a visual detection task in which a small horizontal target appeared on a larger background at a known location in half of the trials (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The monkey indicated target absence by maintaining fixation and target presence by making a saccadic eye movement to the target location as soon as it was detected. Within a block of trials, the contrast of the target and the background were fixed, while the orientation of the background varied randomly from trial to trial, allowing us to test for the effect of target-background orientation similarity on behavioral and neural detection sensitivities.</p>
<p>We tested the behavioral effect of similarity masking over five combinations of target and background contrasts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). For each combination, we measured the behavioral sensitivity as a function of background orientation. Performance with no background (uniform gray screen) served as a baseline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, dashed horizontal lines). Performance as a function of background orientation was fitted with an inverted Gaussian function. At all five target and background contrast combinations, detection sensitivity was lowest when background and target orientations matched, confirming the expected similarity masking effect from human subjects. These results demonstrate that macaque monkeys are a good animal model for studying the neural basis of human similarity masking.</p>

<caption><title>Behavioral effect of target-background similarity masking.</title>
<p>(A) Target detection performance in monkeys was affected by the orientation of the background grating over a variety of target contrast (T## = ##% contrast target) and background contrast levels (Bg## = ##% contrast background). Signal detection measure d-prime (d’) of the target is plotted for uniform background (dotted lines), and for each background orientation (markers). In most cases there was a general performance reduction from uniform background to a grating background. Additionally, performance was further reduced when the background orientation was more aligned to the target (0°). A fitted Gaussian (solid line) illustrates the performance change due to orientation masking. d’ was calculated from the hit rate (correctly identify target present) and the false alarm rate (incorrectly identify the target when it was absent). The relationship between d’ and optimum performance level in percent correct is plotted in (B). (C) Reaction time – calculated from stimulus onset to saccade initiation for Hit trials – is plotted for uniform background (dotted lines) and for each background orientation (solid lines). Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Data were pooled within each monkey across experiments. Each experiment contains a single combination of target and background contrast levels, with uniform background and orientated background trials assessed in separate blocks.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The supplementary information includes a perceptual demonstration of similarity masking for a wide range of target amplitudes, orientations, and spatial-frequencies (Supplementary Material: “Orientation Masking Demo”). This demonstration can give the reader an intuitive sense of the masking effects studied here.</p>
<p>We also examined the effect of target-background orientation similarity on the monkeys’ reaction times (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We find two distinct effects of orientation similarity on reaction times. At higher target and background contrasts, reaction times are maximal when the background and target have the same orientation (when detectability is lowest and the task is hardest) and monotonically decrease as target- background similarity decreases (detectability increases and the task becomes easier). Surprisingly, at lower target and background contrasts, reaction times are low when the background matches target orientation, then increases as the background-target orientation difference increases, and then drops again when the background approaches the orthogonal orientation to the target. Thus, under these conditions, we see an interesting decoupling between difficulty and reaction time, so that reactions times can be shortest in the harder conditions. This surprising effect is present in both monkeys.</p>
<p>Our next goal was to test the hypothesis that contextual interactions between the representations of the target and background in V1 contribute to the observed behavioral similarity masking results.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Neural population responses to target and background stimuli in macaque V1</title>
<p>While the monkeys performed the similarity masking detection task, we used VSDI to measure V1 population responses to the target and the background. In each cranial window, we first used a fast and efficient VSDI protocol to obtain a detailed retinotopic map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yang et al 2007</xref>). We then positioned the target so that its neural representation fell at the center of our imaging area.</p>
<p>The target elicits V1 population activity at two fundamental spatial scales. At the large retinotopic scale, the target evokes an activity envelope that spreads over several mm<sup>2</sup> and is well fitted by a two- dimensional (2D) Gaussian (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, top row; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sit et al 2009</xref>)). Our 8×8 mm<sup>2</sup> imaging area allows us to capture this entire target-responsive region. Because the background is much larger than the target and is centered at the same location in the visual field, it produces a relatively uniform response within the imaging area (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, second row). Similarly, the target-plus- background stimulus elicits activity within the entire imaged area, with a relatively elevated activity at the retinotopic region corresponding to the target location (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, 3<sup>rd</sup> row). However, the target- evoked response in the presence of the background (response to target plus background minus response to the background alone) appears significantly weaker than the response to the target alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> vs. 4<sup>th</sup> row). This reduced target-evoked response in the presence of the background could contribute to the perceptual masking effect of the background. Our goal here was to determine how this sublinear interaction between the response to the target and background depends on target- background similarity in orientation.</p>

<caption><title>VSD response and decoder schematic.</title>
<p>(A) A cranial chamber and a transparent artificial dura provided chronic imaging access to V1 of the monkey. (B) Example recording of the voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) response in an 8×8mm imaging region-of-interest (ROI). Response to the Garbor target on uniform background could be easily identified in VSD (top row). The visual span of the background grating extended beyond the coverage of the imaging window, evoking an encompassing response over the entire ROI (2<sup>nd</sup> row). When the background was presented with the additive target, the response to the target was diminished (3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> rows). Each VSD response map were averaged across 50 trials, over 5 frames captured at 100Hz. T only – target only; Bg – background only; TBg – target &amp; background; ΔTBg – target &amp; background minor background only. (C) Target response was extracted at the retinotopic scale by estimating its response profile with a two-dimensional Gaussian. The profile was estimated from response from a separate recording block on each experiment day. To optimized signal-to-noise, in this recording block, the target was flashed repeatedly at 5Hz while the monkey maintained fixation. The effect of spatially correlated VSD noise was minimized by estimating a whitening kernel from trials without stimulus presentation (see Methods). (D) Target response was extract at the columnar scale by estimating the orientation map within the imaging area. This was constructed from full-field gratings flashed at 5Hz in a separate recording block on each experiment day (see Methods). The columnar map in the 0°-90° axis was extracted and windowed down to the retinotopic profile to identify the columnar scale response of the target.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="547970v1_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>In addition to the retinotopic-scale response envelope, fine scale response modulations at a scale of individual orientation columns (diameter of ∼0.3 mm) reflect the orientation of the target and background. These columnar scale modulations have a relatively small amplitude and therefore appear as small ripples riding on top of the larger retinotopic response envelope. The relatively smaller VSDI responses at the columnar scale is due to a mixture of robust non-orientation selective V1 population responses in V1 as well as optical and biological blurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al 2012</xref>). We can selectively access the columnar scale signals by spatially filtering the responses at the scale of the orientation columns.</p>
<p>Despite their small relative amplitude, these columnar-scale signals provide high quality single-trial orientation decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Benvenuti et al 2018</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Retinotopic-scale effect of target-background similarity masking</title>
<p>To study the effect of similarity masking on V1 responses at the retinotopic scale, we used an optimal linear decoder of V1 population responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen et al 2008</xref>) that allows us to assess the neural detection sensitivity of V1 population responses (i.e., how well one can detect the target from single-trial V1 population responses) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>). The retinotopic decoder takes into account the location and shape of the envelope of the target-evoked response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), as well as the structure of the noise covariance matrix (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al 2006</xref>)).</p>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> summarizes the dynamics of the retinotopic template output in response to the V1 signals across all of our experiments for two combinations of target and background contrasts (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Fig. S1 for the full set of tested target/background combinations). When presented on a uniform gray background, the target-related retinotopic signal begins to rise ∼40 ms after target onset, reaches its peak ∼100 ms after stimulus onset, and remains high for the next 100 ms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,H</xref>, black curve).</p>

<p>(A-F) Average response and dynamics from recordings with 12% target contrast (T12) and 7% background contrast (Bg7). (A) Response time course from stimulus onset (t=0ms) for background only trials. Background orientation are identified by color. Backgrounds with the same clockwise and anticlockwise orientation disparity from the target were pooled. (B) Response time course with the same additive target on different oriented background. Response of the target on uniform gray background is illustrated in black. (C) The target-evoked response time course was obtained by subtracting background only response (A) from response to target &amp; background (B). Target evoked response was initially strongest for backgrounds close to 0° (red), then inverted around t=100ms such that response became the stronger for background closer to 90° (blue). (D) Response was averaged over 50-200ms and fitted with a Gaussian to illustrate the change in response magnitude with respect to background orientation. Here, response to clockwise and anti-clockwise background orientations are plotted separately. Size of markers indicate the number of trials tested for each orientation. (E) The animals’ behavior performance was anti-correlated with the initial phase of the retinotopic response, and was more aligned in the latter phase. Correlation coefficient was calculated across background orientations between each frame of the retinotopic response in (C) against the overall behavior performance in (F). Red dots indicate frames reaching statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>t</italic>-test for correlation coefficient, see Methods). The vertical offset of the gray horizontal line indicates the correlation between the integrated response (over the time interval shown in (C)) and the behavior.

<p>However, when the same target is added to the background, the target-related retinotopic signals display a wide range of responses that depend on background orientation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,H</xref>, colored curves).</p>
<p>Our main interest here is in the target-evoked response in the presence of the background (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C,I</xref>), which can be extracted by subtracting the response to the background alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,G</xref>) from the response to the target plus background (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,H</xref>). If V1 contextual interactions at the retinotopic scale contribute to the behavioral effect of similarity masking, we would expect that target-evoked responses would be weakest with high target-background similarity (similar target and background orientations) and strongest with low target-background similarity (orthogonal target and background orientations).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we find that the target-evoked response in V1 displays two distinct phases, with the early phase showing a paradoxical neural dependence on target-background orientation similarity that is anti- correlated with the behavioral masking effect, and with a later phase that is consistent with the behavioral masking effect. Specifically, in the early phase which starts at response onset, the target- evoked response is highest when the background matches the target orientation even though behaviorally this is the condition in which detection performance is the worst. However, after this initial phase, the high-similarity target-evoked response starts to drop, while the low-similarity target-evoked response continues to build up, so that in the later stages the target-evoked response is strongest on the dissimilar background and weakest on the similar background, consistent with the behavioral effect of similarity.</p>
<p>To quantify the relation between the neural and behavioral effects of similarity masking, we computed the correlation between the effect of orientation similarity on behavior and its effect on the integrated neural responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D,J) in individual 10 ms frames (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E,K). This analysis reveals a robust paradoxical negative correlation between the early neural V1 response and behavior, weak positive correlation between the late neural V1 response and behavior, and no correlation between behavior and the integrated neural response.</p>
<p>Because the target and background are defined by their orientation, the correspondence between the neural signals in V1 and behavior may be better captured by V1 responses at the columnar scale. Our next step was therefore to examine the dynamics of the columnar-scale target-evoked responses in V1.</p>

<title>Neural effects of target-background similarity masking at the scale of orientation columns</title>
<p>To study the effect of similarity masking on V1 responses at the columnar scale, we developed a linear columnar decoder of the VSDI signals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). The columnar decoder takes into account the location of the orientation columns within the retinotopic envelope of the target-evoked response. Because the target is horizontal, the output of the columnar template is expected to be positive for the horizontal target and background stimuli and negative for the vertical background stimulus (since the horizontal and vertical columnar maps are anti-correlated).</p>
<p>As with the output of the retinotopic-scale template, the output of the columnar-scale template displays two distinct phases. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows the time course of the columnar template signals to background alone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A,G</xref>), the target plus background (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B,H</xref>), and target in the presence of the background (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C,I</xref>). In the early phase, the target-evoked response is highest when the background and target have similar orientations, producing a paradoxical neural response that is anti-correlated with the behavioral masking effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D,E</xref>,J,K). In the second phase the trend reverses and the target-evoked response is strongest on the dissimilar background and weakest on the similar background, consistent with the behavioral effect of similarity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D,E</xref>,J,K). Similar results were obtained with other target and background contrast combinations (Figure S2).</p>

<p>Because the first phase of the response is shorter than the second phase, when V1 response is integrated over both phases, the overall response is positively correlated with the behavioral masking effect. Therefore, our results suggest that the neural masking effect at the columnar scale in V1 could play a major role in the behavioral similarity masking effects.</p>

<title>Dynamics of columnar-scale orientation population trajectories</title>
<p>Our decoding analysis focuses on the columnar-scale orientation signals along the 0°-90° axis and reveals complex columnar-scale dynamic interactions between the target-evoked response and the response evoked by the background (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). To examine these dynamics in more details, we performed two types of population-vector analyses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). First, we assigned each pixel within the retinotopic footprint of the target-evoked response to one of 12 equally spaced preferred orientations, creating 12 orientation selective clusters of pixels.

<p>Target plus background responses display complex spatiotemporal dynamics. To examine the dynamics of the target-evoked response in the presence of the background, we subtracted the background only response from the target plus background response (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A, F</xref>, 3<sup>rd</sup> row). The results reveal complex target-background interactions which could lead to a population tuning peak (white curve) that significantly deviates from the target orientation. For example, in some conditions, we observe an orientation tuning peak that is repelled from target orientation in the direction away from background orientation. An interesting goal of future studies would be to examine potential perceptual correlates of these interactions.</p>
<p>To further examine the dynamics of the population vector, we plotted the response trajectories for each stimulus using the vector representation in polar coordinates (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B-E</xref>, G-J). After stimulus onset, the population vector for background only moves in the direction corresponding to the background orientation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B,G</xref>) and for target only moves in direction corresponding to the target (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E,J</xref>).</p>
<p>The trajectories in the target plus background conditions are more complex. For example, when background orientation is at +/- 45 deg to the target, the population response is initially dominated by the background, but then in mid-flight, the population response changes direction and turns toward the direction of the target orientation.</p>
<p>Such complex interactions can be used to constrain models of V1 population response.</p>

<title>Dynamic gain control model qualitatively captures similarity masking effects in V1</title>
<p>Our next goal was to determine whether the observed interactions between the background- and target-evoked responses can be qualitatively captured by a gain control model. In this model, orientation columnar response was tuned to one of 12 equally spaced orientations. The responses of each orientation column were specified by the simple normalization model summarized in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>. Specifically, the spatiotemporal input stimulus generates an excitation signal and a normalization signal that are both linear with the input root mean square (rms) contrast. The normalization signal is then combined with a normalization constant to obtain the normalization factor. The normalized response is obtained by dividing the excitation signal by the normalization factor. The final response is then obtained by applying a response exponent <italic>p</italic>, which is similar to applying a spiking nonlinearity.</p>

<p>Importantly, the excitation and normalization signals can differ in their spatial extent, orientation tuning width, and temporal impulse response (see Methods for model parameters).</p>
<p>We find that this simple model qualitatively captures our key results. First, in response to background alone (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>), the modeled population vector peaked at ∼100 ms after stimulus onset and then dropped to a lower amplitude, as in our data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A,G</xref>). This reduction in response amplitude was due to normalization signal that was delayed relative to the excitation signal. Second, as in the real data, response to the target plus background is less than the sum of the responses to each component separately. Third, as in our results, the target-evoked response in the presence of the background is biphasic, having a brief early component in which the response is enhanced by target-background similarity, and a longer-lasting late component in which the response is suppressed by target- background similarity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). This leads to an early phase in which the response is anticorrelated with the behavioral effect of similarity masking, and a late phase that is positively correlated with the behavioral effect of similarity masking (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, this simple model can also display the curved trajectories of the population vector in response to the target plus background (compare <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref> to <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C,H</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that a simple gain control model with different spatial extent, orientation tuning width, and temporal dynamics of excitation and divisive gain control, can qualitatively capture the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of V1 population responses to localized oriented targets added to a larger oriented background.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that nonlinear computations in V1 contribute to the perceptual effect of similarity masking, we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) to measure neural population responses from V1 in two macaque monkeys while they performed a visual detection task in which a small oriented target was detected in the presence of a larger background of varied orientations. Like human observers, the monkeys were strongly affected by the orientation similarity of the target and the background. Their detection threshold increased with increased target-background orientation similarity, while their reaction times showed complex, and in some cases non-monotonic, dependency on target-background orientation similarity.</p>
<p>To quantify the neural effects of similarity masking, we measured neural sensitivity to the target at two fundamental spatial scales of V1 topographic representations. The large scale of the retinotopic map and the finer scale of the columnar orientation map. We discovered that at both scales, V1 population responses to the target and background display two distinct phases. An initial transient phase in which target-evoked V1 response is strongest when the target and background have similar orientations. At this early phase, V1 responses are therefore paradoxically anti-correlated with the behavioral effect of similarity masking. In the second phase, the masking effect reverses, and the target-evoked response is maximally reduced when the target and background are similar. In this second sustained phase V1 population responses are therefore consistent with the behavioral similarity masking effect.</p>
<p>The positive correlation between the neural and behavioral masking effects occurred earlier and was more robust at the columnar scale than at the retinotopic scale, suggesting that behavioral performance in our task is dominated by columnar scale signals in the second phase of the response. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of such decoupling between V1 responses at the retinotopic and columnar scales, and the first demonstration that columnar scale signals are a better predictor of behavioral performance in a detection task.</p>
<p>We find that when the target and background have similar orientations, columnar-scale information about the target is restricted to the first phase of the response and then largely disappears during the second phase of the response. These physiological results could be related to the surprising mismatch between task difficulty and reaction times. Rather than having reaction times that monotonically increase with task difficulty, in our masking detection task, reaction times can be shortest when target and background orientations match, even though it is hardest to detect the target under these conditions. The short reaction time to this stimulus may be the consequence of the target information being best represented in the early phase of the response.</p>
<p>The nature of contextual modulations in V1 is quite complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Angelucci et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Angelucci &amp; Bressloff 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bai et al 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cavanaugh et al 2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Michel et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Polat et al 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sceniak et al 1999</xref>). A second goal of our study was to quantitatively characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of columnar- scale V1 population responses to targets and backgrounds of different orientations and contrasts. Using a dynamic population vector analysis, we find that in the presence of an oriented background, the peak of the population orientation tuning to the target can deviate significantly from target orientation. For example, in some conditions, we observe a population orientation tuning peak that is repelled away from target orientation in the direction opposite to background orientation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). These orientation- dependent interactions could contribute to non-veridical perceptual representations of orientation such as in the well-known tilt illusion effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Clifford 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Schwartz et al 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wenderoth &amp; Johnstone 1987</xref>). An important goal for future studies would be to test for this possibility.</p>
<p>Using the population vector analysis, we find that columnar scale V1 representations are initially dominated by the orientation of the background. The target orientation then appears in the second phase of the response, which leads to curved population vector trajectories (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C, H</xref>). Identifying possible perceptual consequences of such dynamic and complex trajectories and understanding the neural circuit mechanisms that give rise to such responses are two important goals for future work.</p>
<p>Nonlinear response properties in V1 are commonly modeled as a consequence of a divisive gain control mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Albrecht &amp; Geisler 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Carandini &amp; Heeger 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Heeger 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Heeger 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sit et al 2009</xref>). As a first step toward understanding the mechanisms that could give rise to the observed V1 responses, we tested whether a simple dynamic gain control model could account for our findings (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). We find that a simple gain control model can qualitatively account for our results, but that in order to do so, the model has to display two important properties. First, to account for the biphasic nature of V1 response, the divisive normalization signals have to be delayed relative to the excitatory signal. Second, in order to account for the reduced neural sensitivity with target-background similarity in the second phase of the response, the divisive normalization signal has to be orientation selective. Because in primates and carnivores, robust orientation selectivity first emerges in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hubel &amp; Wiesel 1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hubel &amp; Wiesel 1968</xref>), these results suggest that a significant portion of the nonlinear interactions observed in the current study originate in V1 rather than being inherited from the ascending inputs that V1 receives from the LGN. While our experimental and computational results point to a delayed gain control signal that operates at the level of V1, they do not directly speak to the circuit and biophysical mechanisms that contribute to the implementation of this gain control in V1. Multiple candidate mechanisms for implementing gain control in V1 have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Angelucci et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Angelucci &amp; Bressloff 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ozeki et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Rubin et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Tsodyks et al 1997</xref>). Our results provide new and powerful constraints for such mechanistic models.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that the tuned similarity normalization that explains the neural and behavioral similarity-masking effects reported here is consistent with a principled encoding strategy for feature detection under natural conditions. When viewing a static scene under natural conditions, human and non-human primates make 3-4 saccadic eye movements per second, with fixations between saccades of 200-300 ms. Given the typical size of the saccades, most visual receptive fields are stimulated during each fixation by a largely statistically independent random sample of natural image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Frazor &amp; Geisler 2006</xref>). Analysis of the responses of linear receptive fields to random samples of natural image shows that the standard deviation of the response increases in proportion to the product of the luminance, the contrast and the similarity of the natural background to the receptive field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sebastian et al 2017</xref>). Thus, divisive normalization by the product of luminance, contrast and similarity causes the standard deviation of the responses across natural images to be much more constant (i.e., nearly independent of the luminance, contrast and similarity of the background within the receptive field). This more constant standard deviation makes it possible, with relatively simple decoders, to reach near optimal feature- detection performance, under the high levels of stimulus uncertainty that occur under natural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Schwartz &amp; Simoncelli 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sebastian et al 2017</xref>).</p>

The combination of a 50 mm fixed-focus objective lens (cortex end, Nikkor 50mm f/1.2) and an 85 mm fixed-focused (Canon EF 85mm f/1.2L USM) camera lens provided 1.7x magnification, corresponding to imaging approximately an 8 x 8 mm<sup>2</sup> area of the cortex. Fluorescence signals were measured through a dichroic mirror (650-nm long-pass filter) and an emission filter (RG 665). VSD molecules were excited by light at 630 nm. Imaging data were collected at 512 × 512 resolution at 100 Hz. Data acquisition was time locked to the animal’s heartbeat (EKG QR up-stroke, HP Patient Monitor HP78352C).

<title>Behavioral Task with Optical Stimulation</title>
<p>Monkeys were trained to detect a small additive horizontal Gabor target (4cpd, with σ = 0.14°, 0.33° FWHM envelope) centered on a sinusoidal grating background mask of the same spatial frequency (4° raised-cosine windowed). The background grating was oriented at 0°, ±15°, ±30°, ±45°, ±60, and 90° from the Gabor target orientation. Both the Gabor and background grating were bright-centered – that is, the 0° orientation background was completely in phase with the target. The contrast of the target and background were varied in combinations of levels, reported in Michelson contrast:</p>
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="547970v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<p>For each experiment, a Fixation recording block and a Detection recording block were made using the same target and background conditions. In both blocks, the target and background were centered at 1.6° to 3° eccentricity from the fixation point and -40° to -65° (from the right horizontal meridian) in the visual hemifield corresponding to the working cortical chamber. At these coordinates, the spatial extent of the target was fully imaged through the cortical window, and the larger oriented background uniformly activated the entire imaging area.</p>
<p>In the Fixation block, the monkeys were required to remain fixated for each imaging trial while either the target or full-field sinusoidal gratings at 100% contrast were flashed at 5Hz (60ms ON, 140ms OFF) for 1.0s. These recordings were processed to obtain retinotopic and columnar orientation response maps that were used to decode the detection recording responses from the same experiment day (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>).</p>
<p>In the Detection recordings blocks, a background with random orientation appeared on every trial, with a 50% chance of an accompanying Gabor target (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-E</xref>). The monkeys were tasked to report the presence of the target. Each trial began with fixation on a bright 0.1° square. An auditory tone and the dimming of the fixation square cued the monkey to the start of the detection task trial. 250ms later, the background with or without the target was presented. The monkeys were trained to maintain gaze at the fixation cue on target absent trials or saccade to and hold gaze (for 150ms) at the target position to indicate target detection (with a 75ms minimum allowed reaction time). When the target was present, it remained on screen for a maximum of 250ms or was extinguished immediately upon the monkeys’ saccade initiation. The monkey was given 600ms to make the saccade or to hold fixation and was subsequently rewarded on correct choices: stay (correct reject) on target absent trials, or saccade to target (hit) on target present trials. The target and background contrast level were fixed for each recording block. The probability of each orientated background and target presence were balanced for each recording block.</p>
<p>A separate target only Detection block on uniform gray background was also taken on each experiment day using the same routine as above. This block was later used as the reference data to normalize response amplitudes across experiment days.</p>
<p>Experiments were conducted with custom code using TEMPO real-time control system (Reflective Computing). The visual stimulus was presented on a Sony CRT (1024×768 @ 100 Hz), distanced 108 cm from the animal (50 pixels-per-degree), with mean luminance 50 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. The visual stimulus was generated using in-house real-time graphics software (glib).</p>

<title>VSD Imaging</title>
<p>For each trial, an image sequence was captured for a total of 1.2 seconds including pre-stimulus and post- stimulus frames. The image sequence was analyzed to extract the response using a variant of the previous reported routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bai et al 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen et al 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Image stabilization was introduced as the first stage of pre-processing to de-accentuate blood vessel edges in the ΔF/F response map caused by micro movements of the camera and/or the cortex during imaging. The image intensity across time at each individual pixel was modelled with separable motion-free (<italic>I</italic><sub>xO</sub>(<italic>t</italic>)) and motion-related (<italic>α⃗<sub>x</sub>. v⃗(t)</italic>) components as follows:</p>
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="547970v1_ueqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<p>For each trial, a single global motion vector <italic>v⃗(t)</italic> was obtained by estimating the translational motion of the center portion of the images (1/4 of the imaging area). The motion coefficients <italic>α⃗<sub>x</sub></italic>for each pixel was then obtained using least squares fitting to the model. The motion-corrected image is <italic>I<sub>xO</sub>(t)</italic> . This approach to image stabilization (compared to traditional image registration approach) has the advantage of correcting for non-rigid movements (rotations, expansion/contractions, affine transformation, local distortions, etc.) and sub-pixel motion.</p>

<title>Retinotopic and Columnar Template Decoding</title>
<p>Template decoding was used to summarize the retinotopic and columnar response for each image frame. The retinotopic response map of the target and columnar orientation map of the imaging area were estimated from the Fixation recording blocks, in which response were stimulated with visual presentation at 5Hz. The preprocessing steps for the Fixation recording blocks were: image stabilization, 5Hz FFT response extraction, ΔF/F normalization, then down-sampling to 128×128 pixels (from 512×512). Baseline florescence (<italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic>) was estimated by the average florescence over frames -80 to 0ms relative to stimulus onset. ΔF/F was calculated as:</p>
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="547970v1_ueqn6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<p>The retinotopic response map of the Gabor target (<italic>H<sub>ret</sub>(x)</italic>) was estimated by fitting a 2D Gaussian over the 5Hz flashing Gabor amplitude response. The full-ROI (8×8mm<sup>2</sup> imaging area) columnar orientation response maps (<italic>H<sub>ori</sub>(x)</italic>) were estimated from the flashing full-field grating, where the 5Hz FFT grating response amplitudes were bandpass filtered from 0.8 to 3.0 cycles/mm and the orientation tuning of each pixel was estimated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al 2012</xref>). Subsequently, the full-ROI orientation map was windowed by the retinotopic map to co-localize the retinotopic and the columnar decoders. The columnar map comprised of pixelwise response magnitude (<italic>A</italic>(<bold>x</bold>)) and tuning angle (<italic>θ(<bold>x</bold>)</italic>), represented in modified Euler’s form:</p>
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="547970v1_ueqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<p>These maps served as templates for decoding the retinotopic and columnar response from the Detection blocks. To further reduce effect of motion artefacts, a pixel-wise reliability weighted approach was adopted. The Detection blocks was preprocessed with image stabilization, down-sampling to 128×128, and ΔF/F normalization as above. From the pre-processed images, the retinotopic scale variance <italic>σ<sup>2</sup><sub>ret</sub> (<bold>x</bold>)</italic> and columnar scale variance <italic>σ<sup>2</sup><sub>col</sub> (<bold>x</bold>)</italic> were calculated to be used as reliability weights. The variance was obtained from condition-mean subtracted residuals taken across all frames across trials, with the ΔF/F response (<italic>R<sub>ret</sub>(x, t)</italic>) bandpass filtered between 0.8 to 3.0 cycles/mm (<italic>R<sub>col</sub>(x, t)</italic>) for the columnar scale variance. Reliability weighting was implemented by normalizing each template pixel by the corresponding pixel-wise variance.</p>
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="547970v1_ueqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<p>Two different columnar decoding methods were employed. The first examined the overall response aligned to the orientation of the Gabor (0° orientation tuning axis). A second columnar decoding scheme was employed to examine the full orientation population response. This second scheme comprised of 12 decoders that evenly partitioned the orientation space, such that each decoder contained the column response magnitude in a subset of pixels tuned with ±7.5° centered at -75° to 90° in 15° steps. Each decoder therefore represents the population response of similarly tuned neural ensembles spanning the orientation space every 15°. Each decoder was normalized by the summed response magnitude of its pixel subset; in this way, each sub-population response is equally represented in the population tuning curve.</p>
<p>The formulation for the reliability weighted templates and the decoding is summarized below for the retinotopic response time course (<italic>r<sub>ret</sub>(t)</italic>), columnar response time course (<italic>r<sub>O9O</sub>(t)</italic>), columnar population tuning time course (<italic>r<sub>0</sub>(t)</italic>).</p>

<title>Response Pooling across Experiments</title>
<p>Across experiments, the varying effectiveness of VSD staining led to large variations in the noise level and amplitude of the ΔF/F response. For pooling data across experiments, response amplitudes were normalized based on singular value decomposition (SVD). Here, the decoded response of the reference target only Detection block was used. These were trials of varying target contrast levels on the uniform, mean luminance background instead of the oriented grating background, collected on the same day. The assumption is that the neural response amplitude and dynamics to the target should be the same irrespective of the experiment day. Retinotopic and columnar decoder responses for the target only block were calculated as with the background detection block as described above. Target contrast response for each experiment were interpolated so that all assessed target contrast levels across experiments were represented, then SVD was performed over the frames -100 to 200ms about the stimulus onset across all experiments. In this way, the first component of the SVD (SVD1) represented the average neural dynamics of the target contrast response, and the SVD1 coefficients represent the magnitude of this target contrast response each experiment day. Responses from each experiment was then scaled to match the experiment with the largest SVD1 coefficient. This was performed for each decoded response separately. When pooling data for the mean and standard deviation, the inverse of the scaling factor squared was used as the reliability weighting.</p>
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="547970v1_ueqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<p>Lastly, responses are expressed in a modified z-score, obtained by normalizing the response by its standard deviation. To calculate this standard deviation, responses were grouped by presented stimuli, and the means of each group was subtracted. The residuals from the mean-subtraction from frames 50 to 250ms post stimulus onset was pooled according to the aforementioned experiment reliability weights <italic>w<sub>exp</sub></italic> to obtain the response standard deviation.</p>
<p>Response beyond the saccade may contain unwanted signals. Frames beyond the reaction time for each trial were therefore omitted from summary statistics. For the integrating response within trials, responses were averaged up to the frame of saccade. For frame-by-frame averaging across trials for response time course, trials were dropped out from the averaging beyond their reaction time frame.</p>

<title>Normalization model of orientation masking dynamics</title>
<p>A simple model of the neuronal population response with divisive normalization described our results qualitatively. In this model, orientation columnar response was tuned to one of 12 different orientations: -75° to 90° in 15° increments. The responses of each orientation column were specified by the simple normalization model summarized in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>. The input stimulus is specified by the contrast and orientation of the target, the contrast and orientation of the background, and the duration of the stimulus: <bold>s</bold> = (<italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic>, <italic>θ<sub>T</sub></italic>, <italic>C<sub>B</sub></italic>, <italic>θ<sub>B</sub></italic>, <italic>D</italic>) . In the model, the input stimulus generates and excitation signal <italic>r<sub>e</sub></italic> (<italic>t</italic> <bold>s</bold>,<italic>θ</italic><sub>max</sub>) that is linear with stimulus contrast and a normalization signal <italic>r<sub>n</sub></italic> (<italic>t</italic> <bold>s</bold>,<italic>θ</italic><sub>max</sub>) that is also linear with stimulus contrast. These excitation and normalization signals are controlled by the excitation and normalization parameters, <bold>Ω</bold><italic><sub>e</sub></italic> and <bold>Ω</bold><italic><sub>n</sub></italic>, described below. The normalization signal is then combined with a normalization constant <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> to obtain the normalization factor. The normalization constant limits how small the normalization factor can become. The normalized response is obtained by dividing the excitation signal by the normalization factor. The final response is then obtained by applying a response exponent <italic>p</italic>, which is similar to applying a spiking nonlinearity:</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> contribution that extends earlier single-unit work on orientation-specific center-surround interactions to the domain of population responses measured with Voltage Sensitive Dye (VSD) imaging and the first to relate these interactions to orientation-specific perceptual effects of masking. The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence of a pattern of results in which the initial effect of the mask seems to run counter to the behavioral effects of the mask, a pattern that reversed in the latter phase of the response. It seems likely that the physiological effects of masking reported here can be attributed to previously described signals from the receptive field surround.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
In this experiment, Voltage Sensitive Dye Imaging (VSDI) was used to measure neural activity in macaque primary visual cortex in monkeys trained to detect an oriented grating target that was presented either alone or against an oriented mask. Monkeys' ability to detect the target (indicated by a saccade to its location) was impaired by the mask, with the greatest impairment observed when the mask was matched in orientation to the target, as is also the case in human observers. VSDI signals were examined to test the hypothesis that the target-evoked response would be maximally suppressed by the mask when it matched the orientation of the target. In each recording session, fixation trials were used to map out the spatial response profile and orientation domains that would then be used to decode the responses on detection trials. VSDI signals were analyzed at two different scales: a coarse scale of the retinotopic response to the target and a finer scale of orientation domains within the stimulus-evoked response. Responses were recorded in three conditions: target alone, mask alone, and target presented with mask. Analyses were focused on the target evoked response in the presence of the mask, defined to be the difference in response evoked by the mask with target (target present) versus the mask alone (target absent). These were computed across five 50 msec bins (total, 250 msec, which was the duration of the mask (target present trials, 50% of trials) / mask + target (target present trials, 50% of trials). Analyses revealed that in an initial (transient) phase the target evoked response increased with similarity between target and mask orientation. As the authors note, this is surprising given that this was the condition where the mask maximally impaired detection of the target in behavior. Target evoked responses in a later ('sustained') phase fell off with orientation similarity, consistent with the behavioral effect. When analyzed at the coarser scale the target evoked response, integrated over the full 250 msec period showed a very modest dependence on mask orientation. The same pattern held when the data were analyzed on the finer orientation domain scale, with the effect of the mask in the transient phase running counter to the perceptual effect of the mask and the sustained response correlating the perceptual effect. The effect of the mask was more pronounced when analyzed at the scale.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
The work is on the whole very strong. The experiments are thoughtfully designed, the data collection methods are good, and the results are interesting. The separate analyses of data at a coarse scale that aggregates across orientation domains and a more local scale of orientation domains is a strength and it is reassuring that the effects at the more localized scale are more clearly related to behavior, as one would hope and expect. The results are strengthened by modeling work shown in Figure 8, which provides a sensible account of the population dynamics. The analyses of the relationship between VSDI data and behavior are well thought out and the apparent paradox of the anti-correlation between VSDI and behavior in the initial period of response, followed by a positive correlation in the sustained response period is intriguing.</p>
<p>Points to Consider / Possible Improvements</p>
<p>
The biphasic nature of the relationship between neural and behavioral modulation by the mask and the surprising finding that the two are anticorrelated in the initial phase are left as a mystery. The paper would be more impactful if this mystery could be resolved.</p>
<p>The finding is based on analyses of the correlation between behavior and neural responses. This appears in the main body of the manuscript and is detailed in Figures S1 and S2, which show the correlation over time between behavior and target response for the retinotopic and columnar scale.</p>
<p>One possible way of thinking of this transition from anti- to positive correlation with behavior is that it might reflect the dynamics of a competitive interaction between mask and target, with the initial phase reflecting predominantly the mask response, with the target emerging, on some trials, in the latter phase. On trials when the mask response is stronger, the probability of the target emerging in the latter phase, and triggering a hit, might be lower, potentially explaining the anticorrelation in the initial phase. The sustained response may be a mixture of trials on which the target response is or is not strong enough to overcome the effect of the mask sufficiently to trigger target detection.</p>
<p>It would, I think, be worth examining this by testing whether target dynamics may vary, depending on whether the monkey detected the target (hit trials) or failed to detect the target (miss trials). Unless I missed it I do not think this analysis was done. Consistent with this possibility, the authors do note (lines 226-229) that &quot;The trajectories in the target plus mask conditions are more complex. For example, when mask orientation is at +/- 45 deg to the target, the population response is initially dominated by the mask, but then in mid-flight, the population response changes direction and turns toward the direction of the target orientation.&quot; This suggests (to this reviewer, at least) that the emergence of a positive correlation between behavioral and neural effects in the latter phase of the response could reflect either a perceptual decision that the target is present or perhaps deployment of attention to the location of the target.</p>
<p>It may be that this transition reflected detection, in which it might be more likely on hit trials than miss trials. Given the SNR it would presumably be difficult to do this analysis on a trial-by-trial basis, but the hit and miss trials (which make each make up about 1/2 of all trials) could be averaged separately to see if the mid-flight transition is more prominent on hit trials. If this is so for the +/- 45 degree case it would be good to see the same analysis for other combinations of target and mask. It would also be interesting to separate correct reject trials from false alarms, to determine whether the mid-flight transition tends to occur on false alarm trials.</p>
<p>If these analyses do not reveal the predicted pattern, they might still merit a supplemental figure, for the sake of completeness.</p>

<p>This is an important contribution that extends earlier single-unit work on orientation-specific center-surround interactions to the domain of population responses measured with Voltage Sensitive Dye (VSD) imaging and the first to relate these interactions to orientation-specific perceptual effects of masking. The authors provide convincing evidence of a pattern of results in which the initial effect of the mask seems to run counter to the behavioral effects of the mask, a pattern that reversed in the latter phase of the response. It seems likely that the physiological effects of masking reported here can be attributed to previously described signals from the receptive field surround.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up the relation of our results to findings from previous orientation-specific center-surround interactions studies. In our revision, we will add a paragraph discussing this important issue. Briefly, for multiple reasons, we believe that the majority of the behavioral and neural masking effects that we observe may be from target-mask interactions at the target location rather than from the effect of the mask in the surround. First, in human subjects, perceptual similarity masking effects are almost entirely accounted for by target-mask interactions at the target location and are recapitulated when the mask has the same size and location as the target (Sebastian et al 2017). Second, in our computational model (Fig. 8), the effect of mask orientation on the dynamics of the response are qualitatively the same if the mask is restricted to the size and location of the target. Third, in our model, our results are qualitatively the same when the spatial pooling region for the normalization signal is the same as that for the excitation signal. These points will be elaborated in the revised manuscript and points 2 and 3 will be demonstrated in a supplementary figure.</p>
<p>We would also like to point out some key differences between the stimuli that we use and the ones used in most previous center-surround studies. First, in our experiments, the target and the mask were additive, while in most previous center-surround studies the target occludes the background. Such studies therefore restrict the mask effect to the surround, while in our study we allow target-mask interactions at the center. Second, most center-surround studies have a sharp-edged target/surround, while in our experiments no sharp edges were present. Unpublished results form our lab suggest that such sharp edges have a large impact on V1 population responses.  We will expand on these issues in the revised manuscript. A third key difference is that our stimuli were flashed for a short interval of 250 ms corresponding to a typical duration of a fixation in natural vision, while most previous center-surround studies used either longer-duration drifting stimuli or very short-duration random-order stimuli for reverse-correlation analysis.</p>
<p>In addition, we would like to emphasize that our results go beyond previous studies in two important ways. First, we study the effect of similarity masking in behaving animals and quantitatively compare the effect of similarity masking on behavior and physiology in the same subjects and at the same time. Second, VSD imaging allows us to capture the dynamics of superficial V1 population responses over the entire population of millions of neurons activated by the target at two important spatial scales. Such results therefore complement electrophysiological studies that examine the activity of a very small subset of the active neurons.</p>

<p>Thank you for this suggestion. In the revised manuscript we will include a supplementary figure that will show how the model’s predictions are affected by the orientation tuning and spatial extent of the normalization signal, and by the size of the mask.</p>

<p>We agree that this is a limitation of the current study. These are challenging experiments and we were unable to collect all target/background contrast combinations from both monkeys. However, in the common conditions, the results appear similar in the two animals, and the key results seem to be robust to the contrast combination in the animal in which a wider range of contrast combinations was tested.

<p>We agree that testing the effect of stimulus duration on similarity masking is interesting, but unfortunately, it is beyond the scope of the current study. We would also like to point out that the duration of the presentation was selected to match the typical time of fixation during natural behaviors, so much shorter or much longer stimulus durations would be less relevant for natural vision.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments. In our view, while our results are surprising, there may not be a remaining mystery that needs to be resolved. As our model shows, the biphasic nature of V1’s response can be explained by a delayed orientation-tuned gain control. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that perception is based on columnar-scale V1 signals that are integrated over an approximately 200 ms long period that incorporates both the early and the late phase of the response, since such decoded V1 signals are positively correlated with the behavioral similarity masking effect (Fig. 5D, J).  We will explain this more clearly in the discussion of our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this interesting possibility. The analysis in the manuscript was based on both correct and incorrect trials, raising the possibility that our results reflect some contribution from decision- and/or attention-related signals rather than from low-level nonlinear encoding mechanisms in V1 that we postulate in our model (Fig. 8). To explore this possibility, we re-examined our results while excluding error trials. We found that our key results from Figs 4 and 5 – namely that there is an early transient phase in which the neural and behavioral similarity effects are anti-correlated, and a later sustained phase in which they are positively correlated – hold even for the subset of correct trials, reducing the possibility that decision/attention-related signals play a major role in explaning our results. We will include the results of this analysis as a supplementary figure in the revised manuscript. This analysis, however, does seem to reveal interesting differences between correct and incorrect trials which we will discuss in the revised manuscript. s</p>
