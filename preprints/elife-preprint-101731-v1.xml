<title>Abstract</title><p>Lung cancer is preceded by premalignant lesions, and what factors drive this transformation and the potential regulatory mode in the context of tumor initiation remain to be elucidated. In the course of precancerous lesions, we found a phasic shift in metabolic patterns. Macrophages are a heterogeneous cell population with high plasticity in the tumor microenvironment. Single-cell interaction and metabolic analyses highlighted a cellular state, S100a4<sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages, which exhibited distinct fatty acid metabolic activity, such as palmitic acid metabolism, at the atypical adenomatous hyperplasia stage, accompanied by an angiogenic promoting function in a pre-neoplastic setting. These findings were reproducible in human single-cell transcriptome and had been confirmed by histopathological staining and in vitro cell coculture assays. Taken together, the results from this study demonstrated that specific alveolar macrophage subset contributes to tumorigenesis by altering its metabolic state, suggesting that metabolic interventions targeting this cell state in the early stage of disease may delay neoplastic transformation of the lung epithelium.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ontology of lung cancer is a multi-gene involved, multi-stage, long-term and extremely complex pathological process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Greaves &amp; Maley, 2012</xref>). Emerging evidence indicates that multistep tumorigenesis develops through a series of progressive pathologic changes known as preneoplastic or precursor lesions, which present prior to the onset of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Pich et al., 2022</xref>). With the development of imaging technology and the application of molecular biomarkers for lung cancer screening in recent years, the detection rate of early lung cancer, especially precancerous lesions, has increased significantly. Some of the abnormalities in precancerous lesions are reversible, early diagnosis and guiding precancerous patients away from carcinogens or early intervention and blocking may reverse their further development to minimize the risk of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yatabe, Borczuk, &amp; Powell, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) predominantly arises from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zacharias et al., 2018</xref>). For the classification of LUAD and its precursors, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) is considered to be the first step in a continuum of histomorphologic changes in malignant adenocarcinomas, and is in continuity with preinvasive adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) in terms of morphological alterations, then microinvasive lesions termed minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and eventually invasive adenocarcinoma (IA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sivakumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Travis et al., 2011</xref>). However, the scarcity and difficult accessibility of adequate samples limit the investigation of the cellular and molecular landscape of LUAD precursors. Alternatively, studies also found AAH-like lesions in mouse models, as well as adenomas and AIS, prior to the appearance of LUAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nemanja Despot Marjanovic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Weichert &amp; Warth, 2014</xref>). These models accurately mimic human lung precancerous lesions at the molecular and histopathological levels, providing well-suited materials for our study. Gradually shifting the target of lung cancer treatment from middle and advanced patients with clinical symptoms to asymptomatic patients with early or precancerous lesions is precisely the new concept of oncotherapy in the future.</p>
<p>The tumor microenvironment (TME) homeostasis is determined by close crosstalk within and across all cellular components, including malignant, immune, endothelial, and stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Vitale, Manic, Coussens, Kroemer, &amp; Galluzzi, 2019</xref>). Unveiling potential communications between malignant cells and TME underlying oncogenesis are critical for the future development of mechanism-informed, subset-targeted tumor immunotherapy strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Feng &amp; Gao, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wen, Lambrecht, Ju, &amp; Tacke, 2021</xref>). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a cell population with plasticity and heterogeneity in the TME. As an important player of tumor pathobiology, on the one hand macrophages may be educated by neoplastic cells to provide a favorable microenvironment, supporting the malignant transformation, disease progression in spite of immunosurveillance, metastasis, and resistance to treatment; and on the other they may play a role in anti-tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mantovani, Marchesi, Malesci, Laghi, &amp; Allavena, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ruffell, Affara, &amp; Coussens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sica &amp; Mantovani, 2012</xref>). Part of such heterogeneity may be attributed to the diversity of phenotypic characteristics, metabolic patterns, and functional profiles of TAMs in response to environmental perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cassetta &amp; Pollard, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Tumorigenesis relies on reprogramming of cellular metabolism, and metabolic mining of immune cells in the TME have expanded our understanding of tumor-associated metabolic alterations at different stages of tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">W. Li et al., 2018</xref>). Metabolic changes of TAMs in TME have been reported to be accompanied by phenotypic and functional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Vitale et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xia et al., 2020</xref>). The metabolic landscape of TAMs in the context of tumor initiation and the interdependent relationship of development, metabolism, and functional plasticity in TAMs remain largely unraveled. Exploring the major metabolic circuits by which TAMs remodel the TME and digging metabolic clues that affect the functional polarization of TAMs will contribute to the proposal of immunometabolic strategies that utilize TAMs for tumor prevention and therapy.</p>
<p>In order to simulate the process of human lung adenocarcinogenesis, we established a spontaneous LUAD mouse model and used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to parse the metabolic changes of malignant epithelial cells and macrophages during precancerous period, explore the metabolic heterogeneity and pro-tumor mechanism of alveolar macrophage, so as to probe the key links of metabolic pattern shifts whereby alveolar macrophage subset condition epithelial cell transformation. In depth understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of aberrant phenotypes at precancerous and further carcinogenesis stage may accelerate the identification of precancerous metabolic intervention targets. Therefore, the diagnosis and prevention of lung cancer can be advanced to the stage of precancerous lesions, and measures can be taken to prevent or reverse the further development of precancerous lesions.</p>

<title>Histopathology profiling and scRNA-seq of precancerous lesions in mice</title>
<p>A/J mice have the highest incidence of spontaneous lung tumors among various mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Landau, Wang, Yang, Ding, &amp; Yang, 1998</xref>). To more comprehensively mirror tumor initiation and progression process of human lung cancer, A/J mice were feed for 12-16 months, which resulted in three recognizable precancerous and cancerous lesions in the lung. A total of 19 tissues were histologically categorized by two pathologists into four subtypes, including eight normal tissues, three AAHs, three adenomas, and five AISs, which confirmed by Ki67 staining, spanning the cascade from normal to tumor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). To characterize cell diversity along tumorigenesis, we conducted a time-ordered single-cell transcriptomic profiling starting with normal tissue and ending with AIS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). For each sample, we isolated single cells without prior selection for cell types and used the 10x Chromium platform to generate RNA-seq data. After removing low quality cells, a total of 119698 cells that passed quality control were retained for subsequent analysis, which yielded a median of 910 detected genes per cell. The cell count and genes expressed in each sample were provided in Figure S1A and S1B.</p>

<p>To identify distinct cell populations based on gene expression patterns, we performed dimensionality reduction and unsupervised cell clustering using methods implemented in Seurat, followed by removing batch effects among multiple samples. As shown using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), profiles along the cascade were derived, and a total of 13 main cell clusters were finally identified, which we defined as the single-cell transcriptome atlas of mouse lung in premalignant and early-malignant lesions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Based on the expression of canonical markers, we classified immune cells into T cells (Cd3e, Cd3d, Cd3g), B cells (Cd79a, Ms4a1, Igkc), neutrophils (Retnlg, S100a8, S100a9), macrophages (Mrc1, Cd68, C1qa), monocytes (F13a1, Ms4a6c), dendritic cells (H2-Eb1, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1), and mast cells (Csf1, Il6), and identified five clusters of non-immune cells including epithelial cells (Sftpc, Scgb1a1, Sftpb), fibroblasts (Col1a1, Dcn, Gsn), endothelial cells (Cdh5, Ramp2, Cldn5), mesothelials (Gpm6a, Upk3b, Msln), and smooth muscle cells (Acta2, Tagln, Myh11). In addition, a cluster expressing prolifering markers (Top2a, Mki67) was identified, named cell cycle cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Each of these populations was captured from different pathological stages of different mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The proportion of cell types across the four stages showed a dynamic trend, while transcriptional homogeneity was reduced with precancerous progression, illustrating the importance of heterogeneity in tumorigenesis and also proving the reliability of the sampling in this study (Figure S1C, S1D and 1G).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Identification of initiation-associated epithelial marker and resolution of metabolic pattern in malignant epithelial cells</title>
<p>Tumorigenesis relies on reprogramming of cellular metabolism. To obtain comprehensive cell type-specific metabolic profiles, metabolism-related genes were extracted from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and metabolic clustering was performed on scRNA-seq data. The metabolic subsets and cell types corresponded well, indicating metabolic heterogeneity among cell types (Figure S2A and S2B). Through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) against metabolic pathways, 16 subsets manifested distinct metabolic activities, with neutrophils, epithelial cells, and macrophages showing relatively higher metabolic activities (Figure S2C).</p>
<p>Generally, malignant transformation of epithelial cells is the starting point for the development of precancerous lesions. AT2 cells, ciliated cells, and AT1 cells were identified in our epithelial transcriptome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). At the stages of LUAD evolution, despite possible sample heterogeneity and other interference, we observed increased interactions between epithelial cells and surrounding stromal and immune cells in the microenvironment, indicating gradually frequent cell-cell communication and showing a tendency to malignant transformation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). It was worth noting that the Spp1-Cd44 ligand-receptor complex showed more interactions in AAH stage than AIS stage, between epithelial cells and other cell types, especially myeloid cells (macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils). SPP1-CD44 axis was reported to be involved in tumor initiation and growth, and CD44 level was found to higher in AAH, compared to AIS and IA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kerr et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pietras et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the pattern of the App-Cd74 signaling suggested incremental communications between epithelial cells and immune cells during the occurrence of LUAD, and it was reported to be implicated in tumor progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson et al., 2023</xref>). Then we sought to identify initiation-associated epithelial markers underlying LUAD pathogenesis. Ldha was gradually enriched in the early occurrence of lung cancer, and the increased expression trend along with tumor initiation process were verified by immunofluorescent staining (Figure S2D and 2C). Moreover, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database indicated that the initiation-associated gene LDHA was highly expressed in LUAD and showed an increasing trend in the early stages of the disease, and its high expression was correlated with poor prognosis of LUAD patients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-F</xref>). Thus, it deserves to be further evaluated as potentially promising biomarker during lung tumorigenesis.</p>

<p>To distinguish malignant cells from non-malignant cells based on karyotypes, chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) from each epithelial cellâs profile were inferred (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> and S2E). There were some CNV variations in the normal group, which may be related to the nature of the algorithm, the sample collection operation or the late processing of the cells; these cells were excluded from subsequent analyses. To explore the phasic metabolic changes in malignant epithelial cells, metabolic activity was quantified using the scMetabolism package. The results indicated that malignant epithelial cells in adenoma stage were enriched in lipid metabolism-related pathways, while in AIS stage, significant enrichment of glycometabolism-related pathways was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). The Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) enrichment analysis showed a concordant variation trend (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). These data suggested that epithelial cells manifest diverse metabolic patterns during malignant transition.</p>

<title>S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro exhibited active fatty acid metabolism in the AAH phase</title>
<p>With the development of tumor metabolism research, it has been found that the metabolism of other cell types in the microenvironment besides epithelial cells can also regulate tumorigenesis. Macrophage was the most prominent cell type that interacted with malignant epithelial cells, as shown by Cell chat analysis (Figure S3A). Macrophages were composed of alveolar macrophages (Itgax and Siglecf) and interstitial macrophages (Itgam and Cx3cr1) in subclustering (Figure S3B and S3C). Further analysis revealed a higher correlation between alveolar macrophages and malignant epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and S3D). To resolve the metabolic pattern of alveolar macrophages at a higher resolution, we subclassified them into four subpopulations based on gene expression (Figure S3E and S3F). Enrichment analysis was performed for each of the four subpopulations, and scMetabolism analysis revealed that one of the alveolar macrophage subpopulations already showed a metabolically active state at the AAH stage, especially lipid metabolism, which we hereafter termed as S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). As a representative, the overall abundance trends of glycerolipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids were displayed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>. Next, we used the Compass algorithm to model the metabolic flux of cells for S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro, quantitatively analyzed the metabolic activity of cells, and then focused on metabolic enzymes and genes related to lipid metabolism for in-depth analysis. Fatty acid metabolism was found to be relatively more active in the AAH phase, which was represented by changes in palmitoyl-CoA desaturase, palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase, and carnitine palmitoyl-transferase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistently, the expression levels of related genes Cpt1a and Acot2 were also higher in precancerous lesions relative to normal circumstance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). In our preliminary validation, the presence of F4/80<sup>+</sup>/Cd11c<sup>+</sup>/S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro was identified in the corresponding tissues by multiplexed immunohistochemistry staining, and their number and proportion were observed to be significantly greater in AAH samples than in normal samples (Figure S3G, S3H and 3G). Cpt1a is responsible for the fatty acid Î²-oxidation in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nakamura, Yudell, &amp; Loor, 2014</xref>), and its positivity was found more frequently in the S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro of AAH group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting fatty acid metabolism in this subpopulation was activated at the AAH stage.</p>

<title>Angiogenesis in S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro was associated with fatty acid metabolism</title>
<p>Metabolic profile is coupled with phenotype and functional program of macrophages. Among all pathological stages, although there was no significant difference in the cell proportion of S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro in macrophages, its proportion in alveolar macrophages was obviously the highest in AAH stage (Figure S4A and 4A). To evaluate changes in the functional programs of this macrophage subpopulation in the context of precancerous lesions, we performed a GSEA enrichment analysis of the well-known macrophage phenotypes. It was revealed that the capacities for angiogenesis and M2-like polarization were found to be higher in AAH or other precancerous stages relative to normal stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Correlation analysis was used to measure the relationship between these functional programs and metabolic activity, where angiogenic and M2-like phenotypes of S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro were proved to be positively correlated with lipid metabolism (Figure S4B). Further investigation showed that both of them were positively correlated with palmitic acid related metabolic reactions (DESAT16_2_pos, C160CPT1_pos, and RE0577C_pos, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Next, we queried the angiogenesis gene signature in S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro, and the expression levels of the pro-angiogenic genes Anxa2 and Ramp1 were detected to be higher in AAH group than normal group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Anxa2 supports angiogenesis in specific tumor-related settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Huang et al., 2022</xref>), and its expression level was positively correlated with that of Cpt1a in S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Whatâs more, the correlation between Cpt1a and Anxa2 was verified in the immunostaining of AAH tissues, revealing more F4/80<sup>+</sup>/Cd11c<sup>+</sup>/S100a4<sup>+</sup>/Cpt1a<sup>+</sup>/Anxa2<sup>+</sup> alv-macro compared to normal tissues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).

<title>S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro displayed the potential to promote the early malignant transformation of lung epithelial cells in vitro</title>
<p>To further validate our findings from scRNA-seq and histological staining, we established S100a4-overexpressed (OE) alveolar macrophages with murine MH-S cell line, which was verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).

After culture with conditioned medium (CM) of S100a4-OE MH-S, the proliferation and migration ability of mouse lung epithelial MLE12 cells were significantly promoted, and the cell cycle was more arrested in the G2/M phase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-F</xref>).

<p>During the in vitro carcinogenesis process, a battery of assays allow for the identification of the cells in the initiation, promotion or aggressive stages of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barguilla et al., 2023</xref>). We found increased expression of DNA damage marker p-Î³H2ax and decreased expression of adhesion protein E-cadherin, but no marked changes in N-cadherin, Vimentin, and stem-like markers (Cd44 and Cd133) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). The expression of tumorigenesis associated proteins (c-Myc, p-Erk, Sftpa, Vegfa, and Hif-1Î±) were elevated in OE-CM-cultured MLE12 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). Combined with the above observations and the absence of difference in invasion potential, we speculated that the coculture partially activated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, and the transformation of lung epithelial cells was still in the early or intermediate stage and had not yet reached the advanced stage, which validated our findings to a certain extent and might correspond to the AAH stage in histology. In addition, the expression of pro-tumor indicators in macrophages (Vegfa, Mmp9, Tgf-Î², and Hif-1Î±) were also higher in S100a4-OE MH-S (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>). Next, we sought to identify the metabolic and functional changes found in the AAH phase mentioned above. As expected, fatty acid metabolism-related genes (Cpt1a and Acot2) and angiogenesis-related genes (Anxa2 and Ramp1) were up-regulated in S100a4-OE MH-S, and angiogenesis-related upregulation was also found in the corresponding cocultured MLE12 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L</xref>). In summary, we demonstrated in vitro that S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro promotes the early malignant transformation of lung epithelial cells by promoting angiogenesis through up-regulation of fatty acid metabolism.</p>

A total of 23 human tissues were included in our study to proceed aforementioned analysis, including nine normal lung tissues, three AAHs, four AISs, three MIAs, and four IAs, all have been pathologically confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and pathologist assessment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The annotation of scRNA-seq profiles yielded 15 cell types, in which macrophages and AT2 cells similarly exhibited significant enrichment of metabolic activities (Figure S6A-C). Malignant cells were extracted from epithelial cells by inferring chromosomal copy number alterations, and GSVA enrichment analysis of malignant epithelial cells was performed across the four pathological stages (Figure S6D and S6E). Along with scMetabolism analysis, the results collectively suggested that human malignant epithelial cells showed relatively active lipid metabolism during the AAH phase, as for the IA phase, glycometabolism and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were obviously enriched (Figure S6F). Besides, the enrichment of macrophage migration and chemotaxis indicated the vital role of macrophages throughout the whole malignant transformation process of LUAD.</p>

<p>In order to figure out whether phenotypically and functionally similar subset of alveolar macrophages also exist in human LUAD precancerous lesions, human alveolar macrophages were further subdivided into four cell subsets, which led us to find that the same was true for human S100A4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). In addition, the activities of palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase and carnitine palmitoyl-transferase were also verified to be elevated during the AAH phase, corresponding to metabolic reactions RE0577C_pos and C160CPT1_pos in the Compass analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). For the macrophage phenotype, several functional programs with higher abundance in the AAH phase in the mouse scRNA-seq followed a consistent trend in human data, including angiogenesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). In terms of gene expression, the expression of fatty acid metabolism-related genes CPT1A and ACOT2 and angiogenesis-related gene ANXA2 in the AAH stage was also in line with expectations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Furthermore, we also noticed greater amounts of S100A4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro in human AAH tissues and verified the correlation between CPT1A and ANXA2 in this subset (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Taken together, these results illustrated that human S100A4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro promotes their angiogenic function by modulating fatty acid metabolism, thereby accelerating the occurrence of precancerous AAH lesions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, our scRNA<italic>-</italic>seq data provided a comprehensive resource to investigate cell state changes alongside tumor initiation in a mouse model of spontaneous tumor simulating the oncogenic transformation in clinical LUAD. We extensively mapped the transcriptional landscape of cell subpopulations and switching cell interactions, some of which were essential in reshaping microenvironment favoring tumor evolution. In the course of precancerous lesions, the transcriptional heterogeneity was gradually enriched, indicating underlying progressive molecular and cellular changes during carcinogenesis. We identified an initiation-associated gene LDHA, it was suggested that this glycolysis-related gene was significantly upregulated in LUAD and could serve as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable overall survival and recurrence-free survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yu et al., 2018</xref>), illustrating the potentially vital role of metabolic alternations in tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Based on the understanding that TME can affect the state of epithelial cells, metabolic fluctuations in this context are closely linked to cell phenotype and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Buck, Sowell, Kaech, &amp; Pearce, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">de Visser &amp; Joyce, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">J. Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Macrophages are no exception to this rule, their metabolic profile can be shaped by specific histological TME, and the cellular state is thus activated and exhibits remarkable plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mazzone, Menga, &amp; Castegna, 2018</xref>). Besides, it has been demonstrated that macrophages contribute to the induction of early lung cancer lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Casanova-Acebes et al., 2021</xref>), and purine metabolism has been confirmed to determine the pro-tumor phenotype of macrophage population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">S. Li et al., 2022</xref>). In our exploration of malignant epithelial cells in the initiation of LUAD, alveolar macrophage was identified as the cell population with which they interacted most strongly. The scRNA-seq approaches enable the resolution of macrophage heterogeneity, assisting us in understanding how these transcriptionally defined subsets connect to macrophage metabolic status and functional phenotypes. Individual macrophage subsets possess distinct metabolic profiles, our analysis highlighted a specific cell subset, which persisted throughout lung carcinogenesis and observably defined by the expression of S100a4 that have previously not been implicated in tumor-associated alveolar macrophages. The most intriguing finding about this cellular state was that the fatty acid metabolism became active during the AAH phase, accompanied by angiogenetic like properties. S100A4, which was regarded as an angiogenesis regulator, has been stated to enhance macrophage protumor phenotype by control of fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kazakova et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">S. Liu et al., 2021</xref>). What is more convincing was that S100A4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro with similar characteristics was extended to scRNA-seq profiles of human precancerous AAH lesions. CPT1A was thought to play a crucial role in this metabolic paradigm shift, and CPT1A-mediated fatty acid oxidation has been proved to be conducive to tumor metastasis, radiation resistance, and immune escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Z. Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Y.-N. Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the metabolic pattern of existing subcluster may also be reprogramed in the subsequent phases of precancerous lesions, possibly undergo a transition from lipid metabolism to glucose metabolism, based on the results so far. In terms of subset functional phenotype, S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro enriched for fatty acid metabolism held restricted M1-like and antigen presentation capacities at the AAH stage, but exhibited M2-like and angiogenic features, creating a permissive environment for neoplasia. The role of ANXA2 in angiogenesis has been widely recognized and it has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of aggressive cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sharma, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">T. Wang, Wang, Niu, &amp; Wang, 2019</xref>). Additionally, the elevated expression of Cpt1a and Anxa2 found in our subgroup analysis were also confirmed in mice, as well as in human AAH tissues.</p>
<p>The in vitro cell transformation assays were also carried out, indicating that S100a4 overexpression in alveolar macrophages acquired molecular features associated with fatty acid metabolism and angiogenesis, and induced lung epithelial cells to an initiating or promoting state of transformation. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms that drive the acquisition of metabolic and functional switching properties specific to this cell state still require further characterize in the context of precancerous lesions. Continued study into the interplays between S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro and other cellular compartments resided in TME that support tumor progression will be key to developing interventional strategies.</p>
<p>In this study, our results provided the unique patterns of cellular components during the initiation process of LUAD, and gave evidence of S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro enhances the function of angiogenesis by promoting fatty acid metabolism, thereby accelerating the process of precancerous lesions. Early intervention in solid cancers at the precancer stage may effectively prevent their progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Prieto et al., 2023</xref>). In the cascade of tumor initiation, AAH represented as a probable forerunner of LUAD, serving as a potential hub in carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mori, Rao, Popper, Cagle, &amp; Fraire, 2001</xref>). On the basis of the newly identified pro-tumor subpopulation and relevant metabolic and functional elements, the development of novel immunotherapies targeting the immunometabolism will provide alterative choice for interventions at AAH stage, paving the way for potential benefits for patients.</p>

We employed PCA to process the metabolic genes, and use UMAP to do dimensional reduction for the top 20 components. After that, we employ the âFindClustersâ function of Seurat for clustering analysis. Next, we used the âFindAllMarkersâ function of Seurat to detect the specific expression of metabolic genes for each metabolic state and use Single-sample GSEA to explore the dynamic pattern of metabolic pathways by SingleSeqGset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cillo, 2021</xref>) (version 0.1.2.9) of R.</p>

<title>Pathway activity analysis</title>
<p>GSVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">HÃ¤nzelmann, Castelo, &amp; Guinney, 2013</xref>) is a widely used approach to assess pathway enrichment of samples for gene expression data. We used the GSVA package (version 1.51.0) to carry out enrichment analysis for the annotated KEGG and Gene Ontology_Biological Process (GOBP) gene sets in the msigdbr package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) (version 7.5.1), followed by differential pathway analysis using the limma package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) (version 3.54.2). We not only visualized such pathways that have significant differences (adj. p.val&lt;0.05), but also employed the scMetabolism package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu et al., 2022</xref>) (version 0.2.1) to do enrichment analysis and visualization for KEGG and Reactome metabolic pathways.</p>

<title>Cellâcell communication analysis</title>
<p>We employed CellChat (version 1.6.1) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jin et al., 2021</xref>) to analyze and quantify cell-cell communication between all major cell types. CellChat identifies differentially over-expressed ligands and receptors for each cell group, and models the probability of communication between cell groups by the law of mass action. Significant interactions are identified based on permutation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Good, 2013</xref>) which can randomly permutes the group labels of cells. We then used chord plots and circle plots to describe the number of cell-cell interactions and communication strength, and visualized significant interactions (ligand-receptor pairs) from some cell groups to other cell groups by the ânetVisual_bubbleâ function of CellChat.</p>

<sec id="s4j">
<title>InferCNV analysis</title>
<p>Malignant epithelial cells were identified using inferCNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tickle et al., 2019</xref>) (version 1.14.2). For mouse dataset, we used all epithelial cells, 300 fibroblasts, and 300 endothelial cells as inputs. And then, we used 500 fibroblasts and 500 endothelial cells as controls. For the human dataset, 1000 normal stage epithelial cells were used as controls and the remaining epithelial cells were used as inputs. We scored each cell for the extent of CNV signal and plotted the cells on a dendrogram, and then we cut the dendrogram into 6 clusters. We labeled all cells clustered with normal cells in the control group as ânon-magâ and the remaining clusters as âmagâ.</p>

<sec id="s4k">
<title>Correlation analysis between cell groups</title>
<p>We calculated the correlation between different cell groups based on the expression of each cell on the genes. First, the mean value of gene expression was taken as the representative value for each group of cells on each gene. Then, the top 1000 genes with the greatest standard deviation were extracted to calculate the correlation between groups by Spearmanâs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Spearman, 1987</xref>) method, and finally we used the corrplot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wei et al., 2013</xref>) (version 0.92) function to visualize the correlation matrix.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4l">
<title>Cellular metabolic activity modeling</title>
<p>We modeled the metabolic state of individual cells by Compass algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wagner et al., 2021</xref>). We extracted the normalized gene expression matrix as input, and then run Compass with default settings. The output of Compass is a reactions.tsv file, where the numbers correspond to penalties for each reaction per cell. We employ negative log to have scores. If the score is great, the reaction is more active.</p>

<sec id="s4m">
<title>Gene set module score</title>
<p>The AddMouduleScore function of Seurat can be used to score any gene set. Its workflow is to firstly calculate the average value of all genes in the target geneset on single cell level, secondly divide the expression matrix into several bins based on the average value, thirdly randomly select the control genes (genes outside the target geneset, default 100 genes) as the background value from each bin. Finally, we count all target and background genes as an average value, respectively. The score for the gene set is determined by subtracting the average background value from the average target gene value. Here we used this function to score gene sets of interest at the single-cell level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4n">
<title>Correlation analysis between gene sets</title>
<p>For correlation analysis between gene sets, score of each gene set was defined as above. Here, we used the Pearson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pearson, magazine, &amp; science, 1901</xref>) method for correlation analysis and employ ggpubr package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kassambara, 2020</xref>) (version 0.6.0) to plot scatter plots.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence staining</title>
<p>The sections of mouse lung tissue were first blocked with normal goat serum (10%). Primary antibodies were diluted and incubated with the sections at 4 Â°C overnight: anti-Ki67 (Abcam, Cambridge, USA), anti-Ldha (Proteintech, Wuhan, China). The slides were then washed three times with PBS, and incubated with Alexa conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. The nuclei were finally counterstained with DAPI (4â, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and the sections were mounted. Images were captured by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The pictures presented represent the results of three sections, each of which was collected for nine fields.</p>

<title>Multiplex immunohistochemistry staining</title>
<p>Multiplex immunohistochemistry staining is a tyramine amplification-based method for in situ labelling of tissue proteins. Combined with spectroscopic imaging technology, the rich protein information contained in the tissue can be obtained. The New Opal Polaris 7-color Manual IHC Kit (Akoya Biosciences, Massachusetts, USA) was used for multiple staining. The Opal multi-labeling method used indirect fluorescent labeling in which tissues were incubated with primary antibody and then labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary antibody and fluorescence amplification working solution. The non-covalently bound antibody was then washed by thermal repair, then replaced with another primary antibody and fluorescein substrate, and so on to achieve multiple labeling, followed by DAPI staining and anti-fluorescence quencher sealing. Detailed experimental procedures were described in the kit instructions. The multispectral tissue imaging system (PerkinElmer VectraÂ®) and analysis software (Phenochart 1.0) were used for image processing. The following antibodies were used in the staining: F4/80 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, USA), Cd11c (Abcam), S100a4 (Abcam), Cpt1a (Abcam), Anxa2 (Abcam), CD68 (Abcam).</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study demonstrating the importance of S100A4+ alveolar macrophages in the earlier stages of tumour development and suggesting a role in angiogenesis. As such this <bold>solid</bold> study is of interest to cancer biologists focused on early tumour development and those interested in the development of therapeutics that may specifically target early cancers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors have leveraged Single-cell RNA sequencing of the various stages of the evolution of lung adenocarcinoma to identify the population of macrophages that contribute to tumor progression. They show that S100a4+ alveolar macrophages, active in fatty acid metabolic activity, such as palmitic acid metabolism, seem to drive the atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) stage. These macrophages also seem to induce angiogenesis promoting tumor growth. Similar types of macrophage infiltration were demonstrated in the progression of the human lung adenocarcinomas.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Identification of the metabolic pathways that promote angiogenesis-dependent progression of lung adenocarcinomas from early atypical changes to aggressive invasive phenotype could lead to the development of strategies to abort tumor progression.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Can the authors demonstrate what are the functional specialization of the S100a4+ alveolar macrophages that promote the progression of the AAH to the more aggressive phenotype? What are the factors produced by these unique macrophages that induce tumor progression and invasiveness?</p>
<p>(2) Angiogenic factors are not only produced by the S100a4+ cells but also by pericytes and potentially by the tumor cells themselves. Then, how do these factors aberrantly trigger tumor angiogenesis that drives tumor growth?</p>
<p>(3) It is not clear how abnormal fatty acid uptake by the macrophages drives the progression of tumors.</p>
<p>(4) Does infusion or introduction of S100a4+ polarized macrophages promote the progression of AAH to a more aggressive phenotype?</p>
<p>(5) How does Anxa and Ramp1 induction in inflammatory cells induce angiogenesis and tumor progression?</p>
<p>(6) For the in vitro studies the authors might consider using primary tumor cells and not cell lines.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The work aims to further understand the role of macrophages in lung precancer/lung cancer evolution</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The use of single-cell RNA seq to provide comprehensive characterisation.</p>
<p>(2) Characterisation of cross-talk between macrophages and the lung precancerous cells.</p>
<p>(3) Functional validation of the effects of S100a4+ cells on lung precancerous cells using in vitro assays.</p>
<p>(4) Validation in human tissue samples of lung precancer / invasive lesions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors need to provide clarification of several points in the text.</p>
<p>(2) The authors need to carefully assess their assumptions regarding the role of macrophages in angiogenesis in precancerous lesions.</p>
<p>(3) The authors should discuss more broadly the current state of anti-macrophage therapies in the clinic.</p>
