<title>Abstract</title><p>Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins are frequently overexpressed in various cancers, contributing to the initiation and development of cancer, as well as intrinsic or acquired resistance to therapy. Although BCL-2 family protein inhibitors, such as Venetoclax, have demonstrated efficacy in hematological neoplasms, their effectiveness as single agents in solid tumors is limited. Identifying alternative molecular targets that can overcome intrinsic resistance to BCL-2 family protein inhibitors is of great clinical importance. Here, we present evidence of strong synthetic lethal interactions between WSB2, a relatively unexplored substrate-binding receptor of the Cullin 5-RBX2-Elongin B/C (CRL5) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and multiple anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. Mechanistically, an assembled CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex targets NOXA, a pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein, for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Ablation of WSB2 leads to a remarkable accumulation of NOXA proteins in cultured cell lines and knockout mouse organs. While WSB2 deficiency alone has a minimal effect on spontaneous apoptosis, it renders cancer cells more susceptible to apoptosis when anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins are genetically depleted or pharmacologically inhibited. These findings establish WSB2 as a critical regulator of mitochondrial apoptosis and highlight the dysregulation of the WSB2-NOXA regulatory axis as a contributing factor to apoptosis resistance in cancer cells. Synergistically targeting WSB2 and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins holds promising clinical potential in the treatment of human cancers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the major hallmarks of human cancers is their inherent or developed resistance to apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. This evasive mechanism contributes significantly to both tumor initiation and progression, as well as the resistance observed in many cancer treatments. Importantly, most anticancer therapies available—including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, molecularly targeted therapy, and immunotherapy—work primarily by initiating cell death pathways like apoptosis in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Apoptosis is primarily regulated at the mitochondrial level by the B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (BCL-2) family of proteins. This family is bifurcated into two primary categories: anti-apoptotic proteins and pro-apoptotic proteins. Anti-apoptotic proteins, such as BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, and MCL-1, harbor between one to four BH domains and play essential roles in maintaining outer mitochondrial membrane integrity by inhibiting their pro-apoptotic counterparts. Pro-apoptotic proteins further segregate into multidomain effector proteins (e.g., BAK, BAX, and BOK) that contain multiple BH domains, and an array of “BH3-only” proteins, named for their single conserved BH3 domain (e.g., BIM, PUMA, NOXA, BAD, and BID). Various cell death stimuli can activate or induce these proapoptotic entities, driving mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization followed by apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family have restrainer BH3-binding grooves that help to regulate the activity of “BH3-only” and multidomain effector proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Notably, tumors often acquire resistance to apoptosis through overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins or downregulation/mutation of pro-apoptotic ones, underscoring the need for therapeutic strategies targeted at this critical cellular balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A unique class of small molecule BH3-mimetics has been developed, which specifically target and block the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. Among these inhibitors, ABT-199 (Venetoclax) has been approved for clinical use against BCL-2 dependent tumors, especially in patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have undergone at least one prior therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Venetoclax can be combined with other drugs to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Despite major breakthroughs in hematological neoplasms, the effectiveness of these drugs in solid tumors is limited, possibly due to their reduced dependence on BCL-2 compared to hematological neoplasms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Searching for new actionable targets to sensitize solid tumor cells to BCL-2 inhibitor-mediated cytotoxicity is a promising avenue for investigation.</p>
<p>Cullin 5 (CUL5), a member of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase family, is a core component of multisubunit E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes which catalyze the conjugation of ubiquitin moieties onto specific protein substrates. CUL5 interacts with RBX2, Elongin B/C, and a SOCS Box-containing substrate-binding receptor to assembly a CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase protein complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. WD Repeat and SOCS Box Containing 2 (WSB2), has been classified as a substate receptor for the CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. WSB2 has been shown to be overexpressed in several cancers (lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma) and promote malignant biological behavior, such as proliferation, cycle progression, and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, a lack of reported physiological substrates for the CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex impedes recognizing WSB2 as a potentially targetable oncoprotein for therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>By analyzing the gene co-dependency dataset deposited in the DepMap Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/">https://depmap.org/</ext-link>), we have unveiled a potential functional interplay between WSB2 and multiple BCL-2 family proteins. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that WSB2 acts as a substrate-binding receptor of CRL5 E3 to promote NOXA turnover. A series of functional analyses were performed in cell lines, xenograft tumor models, and knockout mice models to explore the biological significance and clinical relevance of WSB2-mediated regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis. These findings highlight the clinical potential of targeting WSB2 for synthetic lethality with BCL-2 family inhibitor treatment in human cancers.</p>

<title>Multiple BCL-2 family proteins were identified as interactors of WSB2</title>
<p>To elucidate the unidentified molecular functions of WSB2, we analyzed the genetic co-dependency between WSB2 and other proteins using Broad’s 21Q2 DepMap dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. This dataset, derived from large-scale loss-of-function sgRNA screens for vulnerabilities in 990 cancer cell lines, allows the identification of genes with similar functions or pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Gene ontology analysis of the top 100 co-dependent genes of WSB2 revealed a significant enrichment in multiple apoptosis-related processes (<bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 1A, <bold>Supplementary Table. 1, 2</bold>). Among the top four correlated genes, WSB2 showed a positive correlation with anti-apoptotic BCL2L2 (BCL-W) and MCL-1, but a negative correlation with pro-apoptotic BAX and PMAIP1 (NOXA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, WSB2, along with BCL-2, BCL-W, BAX, MCL-1, NOXA, and BAK1, formed a co-essential module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> that also includes UBE2J2/MARCH5, an E2-E3 ligase complex responsible for MCL1/NOXA turnover (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Through utilizing a web server, DepLink<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, to identify genetic and pharmacological perturbations that produce similar impacts on cell viability, as determined by DepMap and drug sensitivity datasets obtained from two high-throughput pharmacological screenings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we observed that WSB2 knockout exhibited the highest correlations with two BH3-mimetics (ABT-737, ABT-263), out of hundreds of drugs tested (<bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 1B<bold>, C, Supplementary Table 3</bold>). These molecular links prompted us to investigate whether WSB2 has any impact on mitochondrial apoptosis through the regulation of BCL-2 family proteins. To test this hypothesis, we initially examined the potential interaction between WSB2 and BCL-2 family proteins. Exogenous co-IP assay results indicated that among the eight tested BCL-2 family proteins, WSB2 interacted with MCL-1, NOXA, BAD, BCL-W, and BCL-2, but not with BAX, BCL-W, and BAK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). These interactions were further confirmed by semi-endogenous or endogenous co-IP assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref><bold>, F-J</bold>). In comparison, WSB1, a closely related paralog of WSB2, did not interact with these BCL-2 family proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Considering that BCL-2 family proteins are located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, we investigated whether WSB2 was also located on the mitochondria. Immunofluorescent analysis revealed that WSB2 is localized throughout the cytoplasm, with a fraction of it colocalizing with the mitochondrial marker HSP60 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>). We further separated the nuclear, mitochondrial, and cytoplasmic fractions of HeLa cells using density-gradient centrifugation methods. WSB2 predominantly localizes in the cytoplasm, with a moderate fraction in the mitochondria, while its presence in the nucleus is minor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1L</xref>). To determine the submitochondrial localization of WSB2, we purified mitochondria from HeLa cells and performed Protease K digestion experiments with different mitochondrial preparations. Cleavage by Protease K only occurred in intact mitochondria and targeted outer membrane proteins exposed to the cytosol, such as TOM70. Swelling the mitochondria with a hypotonic buffer disrupted the outer mitochondrial membrane but left the inner membrane intact, resulting in the cleavage of intermembrane space proteins like SMAC. Lysis with Triton X-100 caused the cleavage of all mitochondrial proteins including matrix proteins like HSP60. Similar to TOM70, WSB2 was cleaved by Protease K digestion in intact mitochondria preparation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M</xref>), supporting its classification as a mitochondrial outer membrane protein.</p>

<title>CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex mediates the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of NOXA</title>
<p>WSB2 was co-purified with CRL5 complex components (RBX2, CUL5, ELOB, and ELOC), confirming that WSB2 is a potential CRL5 adaptor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We next investigated whether WSB2 controls the protein stability of its interacting BCL-2 family proteins. Overexpression of WSB2 markedly reduced the levels of co-expressed NOXA in a dose-dependent manner, while other examined BCL-2 family proteins showed minimal or no impact (<bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 1D). Furthermore, depletion of WSB2 through shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) in prostate cancer C4-2B cells or liver cancer Huh-7 cells led to a marked increase in the steady-state levels of endogenous NOXA, without affecting other BCL-2 family proteins examined (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref><bold>, Supplementary</bold> Figure 2A<bold>, B</bold>). Therefore, our main focus in this study was to investigate the impact of WSB2 on the stability of NOXA. We demonstrated that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 completely reversed the effect of WSB2 on NOXA protein levels, while WSB1 had no effect on NOXA expression levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). WSB2 contains a C-terminal SOCS box consisting of the BC box and the Cullin 5 (CUL5) box, which interact with Elongin B/C and CUL5, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. To investigate the roles of these domains, we generated two WSB2 mutants in which the BC box or CUL5 box was deleted, respectively (<bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 1E). Strikingly, WSB2-BCM or CULM mutant failed to decrease NOXA protein levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, reintroduction of the WSB2 mutant (BCM, CULM) into WSB2-KO cells was unable to reverse the accumulation of NOXA protein caused by WSB2 deficiency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Depletion of CRL5 complex components (RBX2, CUL5, ELOB, or ELOC) by siRNAs in C4-2B cells also resulted in a marked increase in NOXA protein levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating that the assembly of the CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex is necessary for NOXA degradation. The half-life of NOXA was notably prolonged in WSB2-KO cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, <bold>I</bold>). Additionally, the mRNA levels of NOXA were even reduced in WSB2-KO cells compared to parental cells, likely to counteract the accumulation of NOXA protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). We also found that WSB2-WT, but not the BCM or CULM mutant, could promote polyubiquitination of NOXA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>, <bold>L</bold>). By employing linkage-specific K48/K63-Ub mutants, we found that ubiquitinated NOXA primarily consisted of K48-Ub linkages, which is consistent with the expectation that K48-Ub linkage serves as the canonical signal for proteasomal degradation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>). Conversely, the levels of endogenous ubiquitinated NOXA were diminished in WSB2-KO cells compared to parental cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N</xref>).</p>

<title>The C-terminal region of NOXA is crucial for WSB2-mediated NOXA degradation</title>
<p>Along with the BC-box and CUL5 box, WSB2 contains five WD repeats that typically serve as protein-protein interaction modules. We generated deletion mutants to determine the region responsible for binding to NOXA, and surprisingly found that WSB’s SOCS box, rather than the WD repeats, is required for its interaction with NOXA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref><bold>, B</bold>). Deletion of this region abolished WSB2-mediated degradation and ubiquitination of NOXA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref><bold>, D</bold>). Reciprocally, we investigated the region in NOXA that is necessary for WSB2 binding. By generating a series of NOXA deletion mutants and conducting co-IP assays, we found that the C-terminal region (40-54 aa) of NOXA mediates its binding to WSB2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-G</xref>). This region contains a mitochondrial-targeting domain (MTD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Mutation of key residues in this domain (5A mutant) eliminated the interaction between NOXA and WSB2. In contrast, mutation of key residues in the BH3 domain (3E mutant) did not alter the interaction between NOXA and WSB2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). The NOXA-5A mutant was resistant to WSB2-mediated degradation and ubiquitination (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref><bold>, J</bold>), and had a longer half-life compared to NOXA-WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref><bold>, L</bold>). NOXA contains three lysine residues that can be attached by ubiquitin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. By mutating these lysine residues to arginine, we found that WSB2-mediated NOXA ubiquitination was completely abolished, although this mutant (KR) exhibits a comparable WSB2-binding capacity to NOXA-WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, <bold>J</bold>), indicating that these residues function as ubiquitin attachment sites targeted by the CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex. Furthermore, incubating cell lysates with a C-terminal NOXA peptide (40-54 aa) before conducting co-IP assays resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the WSB2-NOXA interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>). Based on this, we hypothesized that transduction of the C-terminal NOXA peptide into cells could competitively inhibit WSB2-mediated NOXA degradation. To efficiently deliver this peptide into cells, we synthesized a fusion peptide in which the C-terminal peptide was connected to the cell-penetrating poly-arginine (R8) sequence. Treatment of cells with this fusion peptide dose-dependently increased endogenous NOXA protein levels in C4-2B and Huh-7 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N</xref>).</p>

<title>Co-inhibition of WSB2 and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins causes synthetic lethality via apoptotic cell death</title>
<p>Despite the strong accumulation of NOXA protein in WSB2-deficient cells, we did not observe obvious spontaneous apoptosis during daily cell culture. This indicated that NOXA upregulation alone may not be sufficient to trigger spontaneous apoptosis. Consequently, we investigated whether co-depletion of an anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein would synergistically induce apoptosis in WSB2-deficient cells. Stable cell lines were generated in which BCL-XL or MCL-1 was depleted by shRNAs, followed by further depletion of WSB2 with siRNAs. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-D</xref>, co-depletion of BCL-XL/WSB2 or MCL-1/WSB2 pairs resulted in substantial apoptosis, as evidenced by Western blot (WB) analysis detecting caspase cleavage and flow cytometry detecting early apoptotic markers. The E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 co-exists with WSB2 in a functional module (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), and previous studies have shown that depletion of MARCH5 sensitizes cells to MCL-1 inhibitors or BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.

<p>Alternatively, we employed a pharmacological approach to inhibit anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. ABT-737 is a small molecule drug that inhibits BCL-2 and BCL-XL, while AZD5991 is a small molecule drug that inhibits MCL-1. Either ABT-737 or AZD5991 caused only moderate apoptosis in parental C4-2B or Huh-7 cells. However, these drugs induced substantial apoptosis in WSB2-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <bold>4G-J</bold></xref>, <bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 3A<bold>, B</bold>). In addition to direct inhibitors of the BCL-2 family proteins, inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) can indirectly target MCL-1 by suppressing the transcriptional activation of MCL-1 mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.

<title>Wsb2 knockout mice are more susceptible to apoptosis triggered by BCL-2 family protein inhibitors</title>
<p>To gain deeper insights into the physiological roles of WSB2 in apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic>, we established a Wsb2 knockout mouse model (<bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 4A). Homozygous Wsb2<sup>-/-</sup> knockout mice were observed to be born at Mendelian ratios and exhibited a normal lifespan with no apparent morphological or behavioral abnormalities (<bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 4B<bold>, C</bold>). Although some Wsb2<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed reduced body size after birth, their adult size generally matched that of wild-type mice. At week 4, we collected multiple mouse tissues, including heart, liver, lung, kidney, and brain. WB analyses demonstrated varying degrees of upregulation in NOXA proteins in the tissues of Wsb2<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to wild-type mice. A strong upregulation of NOXA proteins were observed in the liver and heart tissues of Wsb2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but not in lung, kidney, and brain tissues, indicating WSB2 modulate NOXA protein levels in a tissue-specific manner. However, the protein levels of caspase 3, 7, and 9 in these tissues were similar between Wsb2<sup>-/-</sup> mice and wild-type mice (<bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 4D). Immunofluorescence and WB analyses of heart and liver tissues revealed that cleaved caspases were nearly undetectable in both wild-type and Wsb2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-E</xref>). Consistent with the results from <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture, Wsb2 deletion alone was insufficient to induce significant apoptosis in mouse organs. We then examined whether pharmacological inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins in Wsb2<sup>-/-</sup> mice would induce substantial apoptosis at the organ level. To test this hypothesis, we utilized ABT-199 (Venetoclax), a highly specific BCL-2 inhibitor. Immunofluorescence and WB analyses of heart and liver tissues showed the presence of obvious cleaved caspases, cleaved PARP1, and TUNEL positive cells in ABT-199-treated Wsb2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but not in wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-E</xref><bold>, Supplementary</bold> Figure. 5A-I). Furthermore, we isolated primary mouse hepatocytes and exposed them to ABT-199.

To assess whether the cardiac injury was caused by ABT-199 treatment, we measured the levels of several cardiac enzyme markers, including CK (creatine kinase), CK-MB (creatine kinase isoenzyme MB), α-HBDH (α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase), and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) in serum. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, ABT-199 administration led to a significant elevation in the levels of these cardiac enzymes in Wsb2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas no such effect was observed in wild-type mice.

<title>WSB2 is overexpressed in several human cancer types</title>
<p>Given the intriguing anti-apoptotic role of WSB2, it is worthwhile to investigate whether WSB2 expression is altered in human cancers. To address this, we analyzed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from the TCGA cancer cohorts. Remarkably, WSB2 mRNA expression was found to be significantly elevated in the majority of cancer types, including prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD)and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Further analysis of the TCGA PRAD cohort revealed a positive correlation between WSB2 mRNA expression and several clinical parameters, including Gleason score (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), pathological stage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), and clinical stage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>), and nodal metastasis status (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The WSB2 protein has been identified in several large-scale proteome mapping analyses as being co-purified from the CUL5 scaffold complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. With the presence of a SOCS box in its protein sequence, WSB2 is believed to serve as a receptor for substrates, assisting in their recognition by the CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Its close paralog, WSB1, is induced by hypoxia and can form a CRL5<sup>WSB1</sup> complex that promotes cancer metastasis by inducing VHL degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Additionally, the CRL5<sup>WSB1</sup> complex overcomes oncogene-induced senescence by targeting ATM for degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. However, the physiological substrates of the CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex have not yet been reported. Nevertheless, prior to our current study, there are several pieces of evidence suggesting that this complex may play a role in regulating cell death, possibly involving BCL-2 family proteins. In a large-scale RNAi screening aimed at understanding cancer dependencies and synthetic lethal relationships, the top correlates of WSB2 co-essentiality were found to be MCL-1, BCL-2, and MARCH5, while the most strongly anti-correlated gene with WSB2 was BAX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Two CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens also showed strong synthetic relationships between WSB2 and MCL-1, BCL-2, or MARCH5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. A comprehensive phenotypic CRISPR-Cas9 screen of the ubiquitin pathway revealed that knockout of CUL5, RBX2, or WSB2 resulted in cells becoming hypersensitive to the CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a genome-wide CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) screen conducted in lung cancer cells demonstrated that knockout of CUL5, RBX2, or UBE2F (a specific E2 for CRL5 E3s) caused cells to become hypersensitive to a CDK9 inhibitor or MCL-1 inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. By connecting the dots from these studies, our findings provide a comprehensive scenario. We have shown that WSB2 can assemble an active CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex, which mediates the ubiquitination and proteasomal turnover of NOXA, maintaining its low-level expression under basal conditions. WSB2 deficiency leads to a remarkable accumulation of NOXA, but it alone is not sufficient to trigger spontaneous apoptosis. This is consistent with previous studies showing that enforced expression of NOXA alone is ineffective at triggering apoptosis in various cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Striking when combined with genetic or pharmacological inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, massive apoptosis occurs in WSB2-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). However, it is important to note that knockdown of NOXA expression in WSB2-deficient cells largely, but not completely, reverses the massive apoptosis induced by BCL-2 family protein inhibitors, implying that WSB2 may also modulate apoptosis through other unidentified targets. Indeed, WSB2 interacts with multiple BCL-2 family proteins (MCL-1, BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BAD) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-J</xref>). Although WSB2 does not alter their turnover, it is still possible that WSB2 modulates the apoptotic function of these proteins through direct binding. Further investigation is warranted to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying WSB2-mediated anti-apoptotic function. Lastly, it would also be interesting to explore whether there are any upstream signals capable of overriding WSB2-mediated NOXA destabilization under specific stress conditions.</p>

<p>In the current study, our focus was primarily on investigating the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-apoptotic function of WSB2. Thus, we did not extensively characterize the potential morphological and behavioral abnormalities in Wsb2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, recent large-scale mouse phenotype analyses conducted by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) have reported abnormalities in tooth morphology, locomotor activity, retina, heart, osmotic and electrolyte balance, as well as male infertility in Wsb2<sup>-/-</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. It remains unclear whether these abnormalities are a result of NOXA accumulation and subsequent dysregulated apoptosis. Generating Wsb2/NOXA double knockout mice would be beneficial in determining whether these abnormalities can be reversed by further ablating NOXA expression. Despite the fact that WSB2 is upregulated in various types of cancer and exhibits a strong anti-apoptotic function, which makes it a promising target for cancer therapy, it is crucial to comprehensively understand the downstream substrates regulated by the CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex. This understanding will help us evaluate the potential effects of pharmacological inhibition of WSB2, as it may lead to the dysregulation of other substrates and undesirable side effects.</p>
<p>Since its initial discovery as a novel phorbol-12-myristate13-acetate (PMA) responsive gene in T cells, and subsequently as a transcriptional target of the genotoxic response regulator p53, NOXA has emerged as a critical player in regulating cell death pathways in various cell types under stressed conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Notably, NOXA is implicated in fine-tuning apoptosis induction in cancer cells treated with genotoxic anticancer drugs, including paclitaxel (a microtubule targeting agent), bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor), and MLN4924 (a CRL E3 ligase inhibitor)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. These different agents engage distinct mechanisms, such as transcriptional activation or protein stabilization, to upregulate NOXA protein levels and initiate apoptotic cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The half-life of NOXA protein was very short, as it undergoes ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation mediated by the addition of ubiquitin to specific lysine residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines, despite high NOXA transcript levels, low NOXA protein expression is observed due to rapid protein degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Similarly, paradoxical downregulation of NOXA protein is observed in Cushing’s disease (CD) adenomas, despite transcriptional upregulation caused by recurrent promoter hypomethylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that certain tumor cells may exploit pathways to accelerate NOXA degradation, thus suppressing apoptosis. The elevated NOXA mRNA levels observed in tumor cells may potentially serve as a compensatory mechanism to counteract the reduction in NOXA protein levels. Previous studies have only partially characterized the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of NOXA, showing that UBE2F, in conjunction with RBX2, induces CUL5 neddylation, leading to CRL5 E3 activation and subsequent NOXA degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In lung cancer tissues, high levels of UBE2F and CUL5 correlate with reduced NOXA levels and poorer survival in patients. However, the specific CRL5 substrate receptor responsible for NOXA destabilization has yet to be identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. In our study, we identified WSB2 as the substrate receptor for NOXA, thereby shedding light on its role in regulating NOXA turnover. Further investigation is needed to determine whether WSB2 dysregulation is responsible for the accelerated protein turnover observed in various cancer types, such as MCL and CD adenomas. It should also be noted that WSB2 only facilitates NOXA destabilization in certain tissues/organs, such as heart, and liver, in mouse models. It is not surprising that a specific substrate can be targeted by multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases. A previous study has indicated that treatment with a proteasome inhibitor could further increase NOXA protein levels in CUL5 knockout cells, suggesting that the turnover of NOXA can be regulated by additional ubiquitin ligases apart from the CRL5 E3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In fact, the RING domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligases MARCH5 have been reported to mediate NOXA degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Further investigation is needed to determine which E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) play the predominant roles in specific tissues/organs or types of cancer.</p>
<p>Although bortezomib and MLN4924 have proven effective in stabilizing the NOXA protein and promoting NOXA-dependent apoptosis, their broad inhibition of the proteasome or all CRL E3 ligases, respectively, inevitably leads to side effects. In this study, we have conducted preliminary investigations on the use of a competitive peptide to effectively inhibit the binding of WSB2 and NOXA, resulting in the accumulation of NOXA proteins and increased sensitivity to ABT-737. In the future, other potential therapeutic strategies can be explored, such as designing PROTAC molecules specifically for degrading WSB2 or developing small molecules to disrupt the interaction between WSB2 and NOXA. Extensive research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these approaches in preclinical cancer models.</p>

<p>This study reports a <bold>fundamental</bold> observation concerning cell death regulation by the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family NOXA. The authors <bold>convincingly</bold> demonstrate that NOXA is destabilized through the interaction with WSB2, a substrate receptor in CRL5 ubiquitin ligase complex, sensitizing the cells to treatments.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Jiao D et al reported the induction of synthetic lethal by combined inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins and WSB2, a substrate receptor in CRL5 ubiquitin ligase complex. Mechanistically, WSB2 interacts with NOXA to promote its ubiquitylation and degradation. Cancer cells deficient in WSB2, as well as heart and liver tissues from Wsb2-/- mice exhibit high susceptibility to apoptosis induced by inhibitors of BCL-2 family proteins. The anti-apoptotic activity of WSB2 is partially dependent on NOXA.</p>
<p>Overall, the finding, that WSB2 disruption triggers synthetic lethality to BCL-2 family protein inhibitors by destabilizing NOXA, is rather novel. The manuscript is largely hypothesis-driven, with experiments that are adequately designed and executed. However, there are quite a few issues for the authors to address, including those listed below.</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) At the beginning of the Results section, a clear statement is needed as to why the authors are interested in WSB2 and what brought them to analyze &quot;the genetic co-dependency between WSB2 and other proteins&quot;.</p>
<p>(2) In general, the biochemical evidence supporting the role of WSB2 as a SOCS box-containing substrate-binding receptor of CRL5 E3 in promoting NOXA ubiquitylation and degradation is relatively weak. First, since NOXA2 binds to WSB2 on its SOCS box, which consists of a BC box for Elongin B/C binding and a CUL5 box for CUL5 binding, it is crucial to determine whether the binding of NOXA on the SOCS box affects the formation of CRL5WSB2 complex. The authors should demonstrate the endogenous binding between NOXA and the CRL5WSB2 complex. Additionally, the authors may also consider manipulating CUL5, SAG, or ElonginB/C to assess if it would affect NOXA protein turnover in two independent cell lines. Second, in all the experiments designed to detect NOXA ubiquitylation in cells, the authors utilized immunoprecipitation (IP) with FLAG-NOXA/NOXA, followed by immunoblotting (IB) with HA-Ub. However, it is possible that the observed poly-Ub bands could be partly attributed to the ubiquitylation of other NOXA binding proteins. Therefore, the authors need to consider performing IP with HA-Ub and subsequently IB with NOXA. Alternatively, they could use Ni-beads to pull down all His-Ub-tagged proteins under denaturing conditions, followed by the detection of FLAG-tagged NOXA using anti-FLAG Ab. The authors are encouraged to perform one of these suggested experiments to exclude the possibility of this concern. Furthermore, an in vitro ubiquitylation assay is crucial to conclusively demonstrate that the polyubiquitylation of NOXA is indeed mediated by the CRL5WSB2 complex.</p>
<p>(3) In their attempt to map the binding regions between NOXA and WSB2, the authors utilized exogenous proteins of both WSB2 and NOXA. To strengthen their findings, it would be more convincing to perform IP with exogenous wt/mutant WSB2 or NOXA and subsequently perform IB to detect endogenous NOXA or WSB2, respectively. Additionally, an in vitro binding assay using purified proteins would provide further evidence of a direct binding between NOXA and WSB2.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Exploring the DEP-MAP database and two drug-screen databases, the authors identify WSB2 as an interactor of several BCL2 proteins. In follow-up experiments, they show that CRL5/WSB2 controls NOXA protein levels via K48 ubiquitination following direct protein-protein interaction, and cell death sensitivity in the context of BH3 mimetic treatment, where WSB2 depletion synergizes with drug treatment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a set of orthogonal methods across different model cell lines and a new WSB2 KO mouse model to confirm their findings. They also manage to correlate WSB2 expression with poor prognosis in prostate and liver cancer, supporting the idea that targeting WSB2 may sensitize cancers for treatment with BH3 mimetics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions drawn based on the findings in cancer patients are very speculative, as regulation of NOXA cannot be the sole function of CRL5/WSB2 and it is hence unclear what causes correlation with patient survival. Moreover, the authors do not provide a clear mechanistic explanation of how exactly higher levels of NOXA promote apoptosis in the absence of WSB2. This would be important knowledge, as usually high NOXA levels correlate with high MCL1, as they are turned over together, but in situations like this, or loss of other E3 ligases, such as MARCH, the buffering capacity of MCL1 is outrun, allowing excess NOXA to kill (likely by neutralizing other BCL2 proteins it usually does not bind to, such as BCLX). Moreover, a necroptosis-inducing role of NOXA has been postulated. Neither of these options is interrogated here.</p>
