<title>Abstract</title><p>We established a volumetric trans-scale imaging system with an ultra-large field-of-view (FOV) that enables simultaneous observation of millions of cellular dynamics in centimeter-wide three-dimensional (3D) tissues and embryos. Using a custom-made giant lens system with a magnification of 2× and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.25, and a CMOS camera with more than 100 megapixels, we built a trans-scale scope AMATERAS-2, and realized fluorescence imaging with a lateral spatial resolution of approximately 1.2 µm across an FOV of approximately 1.5 × 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>. The 3D resolving capability was realized through a combination of optical and computational sectioning techniques tailored for our low-power imaging system. We applied the imaging technique to 1.2 cm-wide section of mouse brain, and successfully observed various regions of the brain with sub-cellular resolution in a single FOV. We also performed time-lapse imaging of a 1-cm-wide vascular network during quail embryo development for over 24 hours, visualizing the movement of over 4.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> vascular endothelial cells and quantitatively analyzing their dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential of this technique in accelerating production of comprehensive reference maps of all cells in organisms and tissues, which contributes to understanding developmental processes, brain functions, and pathogenesis of disease, as well as high-throughput quality check of tissues used for transplantation medicine.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recently, life sciences have focused on comprehending the working principles of multicellular systems, spanning from basic biology to medical applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Multicellular systems are generally complex, comprising heterogeneous cells rather than homogeneous assemblies. To understand the mechanism by which numerous cells cooperate to express the function of the entire system, it is ideal to observe all individual components within the system simultaneously during the time span of a whole phenomenon. In particular, in scenarios where a small fraction of cells in a large multicellular system may influence the fate of the population, or when distant cells and tissues operate synchronously, deducing the entire system from observations of sub-populations becomes challenging. Therefore, the trans-scale measurement of collective dynamics of all individual cells that constitute the system of interest is desired.</p>
<p>In response to this demand, researchers have recently reported the development of imaging methods with large field-of-view (FOV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Whereas most of these methods are focused on observing brain activity in neuroscience using two-photon excited fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), our efforts have been dedicated to developing techniques as versatile tools for studying multicellular systems science and developmental biology. In our previous work, we proposed a fluorescence imaging system for the visible wavelength region, capable of spatially resolving individual cells within a centimeter FOV, which we named AMATERAS1.0 (A Multi-scale/modal Analytical Tool for Every Rare Activity in Singularity), enabling simultaneous observation of dynamics in the range of 10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Additionally, we successfully detected less than 1% of cells with unique roles in multicellular systems and revealed how these rare cells trigger a drastic transition from unicellular to multicellular behavior in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). However, the imaging system had a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.12, which is insufficient for realizing volumetric observation owing to its broad depth of field (DOF). Overcoming this limitation and enabling volumetric imaging for diverse three dimensional (3D) tissues and small organisms has been a significant challenge.</p>
<p>In this study, we developed AMATERAS-2, a volumetric optical imaging system with approximately 15 × 10 mm<sup>2</sup> FOV, equivalent to that of AMATERAS1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). The key component for the enhancement is the giant 2× lens system with an NA of 0.25, which offers improved 3D spatial resolution and higher sensitivity. By incorporating novel methodologies of optical sectioning and computational sectioning, we successfully added volumetric imaging capabilities. The effectiveness of these advancements was demonstrated in imaging 1.5-mm-thick brain section blocks and conducting a 25-h time-lapse observation of vascular endothelial cells during quail embryogenesis, allowing us to trace the spatiotemporal dynamics of approximately 4.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells in three dimensions.</p>

<title>Optical configuration and performance</title>
<p>AMATERAS1.0 utilized a telecentric macro lens with 2× magnification, thus allowing dynamic observation in the centimeter-FOV with subcellular resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Despite its efficacy in biological studies, its low NA (0.12) limits both its spatial resolution in the z-direction, and system brightness. To overcome these constraints and expand the possibilities for observing cell dynamics in tissues and embryos, we developed a giant lens system with an NA of 0.25, which is more than double that of AMATERAS1.0; thus, our system provides over two times higher spatial resolution in the transverse direction (<italic>xy</italic>), more than four times higher resolution in the longitudinal direction (<italic>z</italic>), and over four times increased brightness compared with AMATERAS1.0. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> shows the appearance of the huge lens system, consisting of an objective lens and tube lens, which constitutes the main part of AMATERAS-2. This lens system covers an image-sensor size of 44 mm diagonal and is aberration-corrected within the 44 mm large FOV in the visible wavelength region.</p>

</fig>
<p>We constructed a wide-field epi-illumination fluorescence imaging system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, Materials and Methods) using the lens systems, which we termed AMATERAS-2w. For this configuration, we utilized either a 120-megapixel CMOS camera or a 250-megapixel CMOS camera, depending on the research purpose. Both the cameras have an approximately 35 mm diagonal, thus providing an observation FOV of 17.8 mm and 17.4 mm diagonal at 2× magnification, respectively. The pixel sizes for these cameras are 2.2 and 1.5 µm, with sampling intervals of 1.1 and 0.75 µm at 2× magnification, respectively.</p>
<p>We installed a high-brightness LED light sources for fluorescence excitation, directing it into the objective lens through a custom-made long-pass dichroic mirror designed for GFP imaging with a cut-off wavelength of 497 nm. To ensure uniform illumination across the entire FOV, we employed a lens-let array pair. Additionally, we incorporated a 2-inch band-pass fluorescence filter between the tube lens and the camera.</p>
<p>We experimentally obtained the optical point spread function (PSF) using green fluorescent beads with a 0.2-µm diameter. Both the 120-megapixel CMOS camera (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) and the 250-megapixel CMOS camera (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) were employed. The left panels in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref> display the PSFs in the <italic>xy</italic> and <italic>xz</italic> planes, respectively. The spatial resolution was evaluated by measuring the full-width of half-maximum (FWHM) of the PSFs in the transverse direction (<italic>xy</italic>-direction), determined through Gaussian-function fit to the line profiles in the right panels. The resolutions obtained with the 120- and 250-megapixel cameras were comparable around 1.15 µm (<italic>xy</italic>). Essentially, both the CMOS cameras offered nearly the same resolution; however, owing to the coarse sampling interval in the 120-megapixel case, the apparent spatial resolution degrades when a bead is positioned on the boundary of two pixels (Figs. S1A and B).</p>
<p>Additional calculations and measured results are available in the Supplementary file (Fig. S1). The coarse sampling may also introduce uncertainty in the estimated position of the bead’s center coordinate, varying based on the relative position of the bead and the pixel (Fig. S1E). Although this may pose some challenges in quantitatively evaluating fine shapes in cells, it is not a practical issue in imaging at cell resolution. By contrast, the 250-megapixel camera provides a nearly constant resolution (Figs. S1C and D). Thus, the 250-megapixel camera is suitable when high-resolution images are required, whereas the 120-megapixel camera is suitable for other cases where increasing the number of photons per pixel or suppressing data size is necessary.</p>
<p>In the depth direction (<italic>z</italic>-direction), we evaluated the depth of field (DOF) by fitting Gaussian curves to the line profiles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>, right bottom). The DOF was measured as 15.1 and 14.0 µm for the 120- and 250-megapixel cameras, respectively. This difference in DOF is attributed to the distinct pixel sizes of the cameras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>).</p>
<p>The spatial resolution in the transverse direction has been significantly improved, approximately two times compared with that of AMATERAS1.0. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">F</xref> display fluorescence images of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) stained with Rhodamine phalloidin (E) across the entire FOV and (F) within a selected local region indicated by a white square in (E). These images were captured using the 250-megapixel camera, and the FOV size was 14.7 × 9.4 mm<sup>2</sup>. For comparison, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref> shows an image of the same area observed with AMATERAS1.0. Evidently, AMATERAS-2w delivers more detailed images with finer spatial structures. This is further confirmed by the line profiles depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>, where the filamentous actin stained with Rhodamine exhibits a sharper spatial resolution with AMATERAS-2w.</p>

<title>Spinning pinhole-array disk provides optical sectioning capability in wide-FOV</title>
<p>This imaging system utilizes wide-field illumination and detection, which currently lacks the capability to selectively acquire images of specific <italic>z</italic>-planes. To extend the system’s applicability, we developed two methods to enable 3D imaging, namely, optical sectioning and computational sectioning.</p>
<p>For optical sectioning, various options exist for achieving 3D fluorescence imaging in the visible wavelength region. These include scanning confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), light-sheet microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), light-field microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), and spatiotemporal focusing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Among these options, we selected the confocal imaging method for this study owing to the limitations of light-sheet method in uniformly illuminating areas larger than 1 cm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), and the trade-off between spatial resolution and the ability to resolve three dimensions in a single shot for the light-field method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>We considered the confocal method to be the most compatible with our imaging system. Considering the vast FOV, we adopted the multipoint-scanning confocal system. The commonly used method involving a combination of a microlens array and a pinhole array disk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) could not be employed in AMATERAS owing to the large NA of the tube lens (NA = 0.125) compared with that of a standard microscope. Matching the NA requires shortening the distance between the two disks or enlarging the microlenses. However, shortening the inter-disk distance leads to a loss of space for inserting a dichroic mirror, and enlarging the microlenses reduces the number of foci.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, we opted to use pinhole arrays without microlenses herein. Although this method is less light-efficient compared with the one using microlenses, it aligns well with our imaging system’s high NA and low magnification. Commercially available confocal systems using pinhole-array disks typically have large pinhole sizes (<italic>e.g.,</italic> 50 µm) and wide spacing between pinholes (<italic>e.g.,</italic> 200 µm), designed for general microscopes. For AMATERAS-2, with its 2× magnification and NA of 0.25, we required smaller pinhole sizes. As a prototype, we set the pinhole size to 6 µm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), slightly larger than the diameter of the Airy disk of the PSF at green wavelengths. The optimum pinhole spacing was chosen as 24 µm, striking a balance between throughput and crosstalk (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To implement this, we custom-made a pinhole-array disk and incorporated it into a rotary machine.</p>

</fig>
<p>We positioned the pinhole array disk at the image plane of the tube lens and constructed a relay lens system to transfer the plane to the camera. This particular configuration, termed AMATERAS-2c, is illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> (Materials and Methods). To split the light paths of fluorescence excitation light, we placed a short-pass dichroic mirror beneath the disk. For fluorescence excitation, we used a high-brightness LED with a center wavelength of 470 nm, the same as in the wide-field imaging system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The relay lens consisted of a telecentric macro lens with 1× magnification, and a 2-inch band-pass fluorescent filter was positioned at the entrance of the macro lens. If necessary, the relay lens can be replaced by a 2× magnification lens to switch the total magnification from 2× to 4×, based on resolution requirements.</p>
<p>Fluorescence images of 0.5 µm fluorescent beads were observed with and without the pinhole-array disk, where fluorescent beads were three-dimensionally dispersed in an agarose gel slab (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The presence of the pinhole-array disk dramatically suppressed background light from outside the focal plane. This verified that optical sectioning can be achieved by the pinhole-array disk. Typical 3D PSF was obtained with the fluorescence beads with the relay lens of (D) 1× and (E) 2× magnifications (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">E</xref>). As NA of the 1× relay lens (NA = 0.079) is lower than the that of the tube lens (NA = 0.125), the lateral spatial resolution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) is degraded compared with the one obtained without the relay lens (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>). By contrast, the 2× relay lens (NA = 0.12) almost matches with the tube lens, and the reduction in the lateral spatial resolution is relatively small (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Computational sectioning provides pseudo-depth-resolved imaging capability</title>
<p>In addition to optical sectioning, we developed a computational sectioning method to separate images of the focal plane and out-of-focal planes. During measurement, a <italic>z</italic>-stack is acquired in the wide-field imaging configuration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) by scanning the focal position in the <italic>z</italic>-direction and capturing images at each step. The raw image in a 3D volume results from the superposition of in-focus and out-of-focus plane images. We estimated the contribution from out-of-focus planes as the baseline by iteratively applying low-pass filtering under the assumption that the image’s spatial frequency in the focal plane is high.</p>
<p>To demonstrate computational sectioning, we observed myocardial organoids derived from hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). This 3D dome structure of a cavity chamber is extensively studied in developmental biology and regenerative medicine as a model for human myocardial tissue development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). We fabricated a large area of organoids across the entire FOV, chemically fixed and immunostained them for cardiac troponin T (cTnT) with Alexa488, and stained the nuclei with Hoechst33342 (Materials and Methods). The <italic>z</italic>-stack was obtained within a <italic>z</italic>-range involving the organoids (approximately 250 µm) with 4-µm intervals. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">B</xref> display two-color overlaid images of the island-formed organoids across the entire FOV, without and with computational sectioning, respectively (both are maximum-intensity projection (MIP) images of the <italic>z</italic>-stacks). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">D</xref> present images of six layers in the <italic>z</italic>-direction of the dashed square region of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">B</xref>, before and after computational sectioning, respectively.

<p>In principle, the signal component can be extracted as long as the signal intensity (in-focus component) is significantly higher than the statistical noise of the background intensity (out-of-focus component). This method is effective in cellular imaging when fluorescent molecules are localized within the cell, like in the nucleus, or when they exhibit a filament-like structure, thereby enabling cell recognition and dynamic tracking. It relies on the spatial frequency of the fluorescence image in the focal plane being clearly higher than that outside the focal plane.</p>

<title>Observing a 1.2-cm wide and 1.5-mm thick volume of mouse brain section</title>
<p>To demonstrate the potential for brain imaging, we performed imaging of a 1.5-mm thick mouse brain section in the coronal plane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we presented AMATERAS-2w, a large FOV fluorescence imaging system, along with its variant AMATERAS-2c. The system is built around a newly designed giant lens with an NA of 0.25, magnification of 2×, and field number of 44 mm. This innovative lens configuration allows for imaging with an impressive spatial resolution of approximately 1.2 μm within a centimeter-scale FOV (15 × 10 mm<sup>2</sup>). Notably, this FOV-to-spatial resolution ratio surpasses that of previously reported large-FOV imaging methods. The key metric “optical invariant”, derived from the product of NA and FOV, has a value of 2.75 (Materials and Methods, 33), thus indicating excellent performance of the lens system. Furthermore, the “space-bandwidth product”, which signifies the FOV to spatial resolution ratio achieved under real measurement conditions (considering image sensor size and wavelength), reaches 4.3 × 10<sup>8</sup> (Materials and Methods, 34). Both of these metrics significantly outperform those reported in earlier studies on large FOV imaging methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Although these metrics are essential indicators of our system’s performance, they do not solely determine its superiority over other large-FOV imaging systems. Variations in biological targets and additional optical performance measures (such as frame rate and imaging depth) must also be considered. Our primary focus in designing this system was to expand the FOV, i.e., maximize the number of observable cells at any instant, even at the cost of intracellular resolution. Thus, in this aspect, our system excels as an instrument for such purposes.</p>
<p>The spatial resolution (FWHM) of AMATERAS-2w and -2c was measured to be approximately 1.2–1.8 μm in the transverse direction (<italic>xy</italic>) and 13–18 μm in the longitudinal direction (<italic>z</italic>) through PSF measurements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C, 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). These values represent a significant enhancement compared with the previous AMATERAS version (2.3 and 64 µm, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). The improved transverse resolution enables clearer visualization of intracellular filamentous structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Moreover, the refinement in longitudinal resolution was more than four times greater, thus demonstrating that the expected effect was achieved with more than double NA. Depending on the object of observation, it may be debatable whether this anisotropic spatial resolution elongated along the optical axis qualifies “cellular resolution”. Although this may be insufficient to resolve dense cell populations, it proves adequate for cells with only stained nuclei or those sparsely distributed, as observed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4F, 4H</xref>, and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>. The next step in development involves further enhancing the NA of the lens system, including the relay lens, to further improve volumetric resolution and expand the range of observable biological objects.</p>
<p>We successfully achieved volumetric imaging of a 1.5-mm-thick mouse brain coronal section using the multipoint-scanning confocal imaging method, along with computational sectioning and tissue-clearing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This thickness corresponds to about one-tenth of the whole brain. The exposure time per image was 1 s, and data acquisition took less than 10 min. The ultimate goal is to apply this approach to enable whole-brain imaging. Unlike previous methods such as light-sheet imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and block-face serial microscopy tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), which require half a day or more for whole-brain data acquisition owing to tiling images from a narrow FOV, our method can significantly reduce the acquisition time when extended to the whole brain. Nevertheless, as the thickness increases, challenges such as increased background light and larger spherical aberration arise, thus resulting in weaker focal plane images. To address these issues and realize whole-brain imaging, we propose the incorporation of a mechanism for compensating spherical aberrations in the future. Additionally, we aim to improve the pinhole array pattern design and light source intensity to enhance transmittance and increase fluorescence intensity from samples, broadening the scope of applications.</p>
<p>We have shown that AMATERAS-2 can perform time-lapse observation of the centimeter-sized vascular networks in the quail embryo. It is a promising tool for understanding the multicellular behavior, especially the mechanisms of tissue formation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In regard to the quail embryo’s case, the data obtained here are the first demonstration of the dynamics of the extensive organization of the vascular network throughout the quail embryo at the single-cell level. Conventional methods of research employing traditional microscopy have selected a limited area for observation and thus had a difficulty in determining the distribution and synchronicity of cellular dynamics across the entire system. By analyzing such a huge four-dimensional data (<italic>xyz</italic> and <italic>t</italic>), we can gain insight into when and where each organ is formed, in what order, and in what interrelationships. In addition, employing this method allows us to break away from the conventional hypothesis-driven research manner and obtain new findings in a data-driven manner. This advantage can be realized not only for quail embryo but also for a variety of other species undergoing widespread and dynamic cellular events, making it a powerful tool in the study of multicellular organisms, especially in the study of tissue formation.</p>
<p>To further advance multicellular systems research, information on individual cell states is required in addition to cellular dynamics, therefore multiplex measurement is an essential technological challenge. Although most of the observations presented in this paper were made with monochromatic fluorescence imaging, multiplex imaging will lead to a more profound understanding if information on the distribution of cellular states can also be obtained by employing multiple fluorescent probes. This requires technological upgrades in optical filters and light sources for multicolor imaging. In addition, spatial transcriptomics has been rapidly developing in recent years and has become one of the most crucial tools for multicellular system study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). In the near future, dynamics imaging and spatial transcriptomics for the same sample will be a very important technological integration to advance an integrative understanding of self-organization in tissue formation. Rather than simply using AMATERAS sequentially with existing spatial transcriptomics, it could be employed as an optical detection system for spatial transcriptomics to achieve extremely high throughput in the same wide FOV of cellular dynamics imaging.</p>
<p>Finally, let us discuss a practical challenge we encountered with our instrument, primarily related to the handling of extensive image data. In our studies, the raw data for 3D imaging of the mouse brain section and time-lapse 3D imaging of the quail embryo amounted to approximately 100 and 500 GB, respectively. However, after multiple image processing and analysis steps, a single experimental measurement resulted in several terabyte of image data. Managing such vast data proves challenging for standard computers in terms of both software and hardware capabilities. To address software limitations, we opted not to employ commercial software for data analysis. Instead, we utilized our originally developed programs, implementing certain optimizations to reduce analysis time, minimize write/read cycles, and prevent memory overflows. As for hardware, we established a data server with petabyte storage, thereby enabling efficient data sharing among collaborators from diverse research institutions physically distant from one another. The existence of this infrastructure considerably facilitated the smooth progress of collaborative research within this study. Considering the increasing significance of handling image big data, we expect methodologies for image computation to become even more critical in the future. Ideally, a comprehensive system should be developed, encompassing not only data storage and sharing but also an integrated analysis solution in the cloud. We would like to actively promote the development of such a system, essentially encompassing advancements in imaging techniques and data-handling strategies.</p>

<title>Wide-field imaging system (AMATERAS-2w) configuration</title>
<p>We implemented our design concept by collaborating with OptoSigma Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) to manufacture a pair of giant objective and tube lenses. The objective lens is composed of 12 optical elements in 7 groups, whereas the tube lens is composed of 9 lenses in 6 groups. Both lenses are infinity-corrected, with NAs of 0.25 for the objective and 0.125 for the tube lens. They are effectively aberration-corrected within the wavelength range of 400–700 nm. By combining these lenses, we constructed an imaging system with a 2× magnification, NA of 0.25, and a 44 mm field number. To facilitate both water-immersion and dry observation, we incorporated a glass plate whose thickness can be adjusted at the lens tip. The objective lens has a focal length of 120 mm, whereas its working distance is 14 mm owing to the presence of the attachment at the tip.</p>
<p>For image acquisition, a 120-megapixel CMOS camera (VCC-120CXP1M, CIS, Tokyo, Japan) and a 250-megapixel CMOS camera (VCC-250CXP1M, CIS, Tokyo, Japan) were used, out of which we selected one depending on research purpose. Both the cameras have a chip size of 35 mm (diagonal). The pixel sizes of these two cameras are 2.2 µm and 1.5 µm, respectively. The sampling intervals are 1.1 µm and 0.75 µm at 2× magnification. Image data captured by the CMOS cameras are loaded into a workstation via a CoaXpress frame grabber board (APX-3664G3, Aval Data, Tokyo, Japan). After the imaging experiments, they were transferred to a network server with large storage capacity for long-term storage and data sharing among project members.</p>
<p>By use of the lens system and CMOS cameras, a wide-field epi-illumination fluorescence imaging system was constructed. The imaging system chassis was designed to accommodate both inverted and upright microscope geometries. For this study, all experiments were conducted using the inverted microscope arrangement. Epi-illumination was achieved using a high-brightness LED sources (SOLIS-470C and SOLIS-385C, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ), with an excitation filter (#87-800, Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ) placed immediately after it. The illumination light was homogenized using a pair of lenslet arrays and projected onto the sample surface. Additionally, a similar LED light source (SOLIS-525C, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) with an illumination homogenizer was also mounted as transmitted illumination light for bright-field observation. To split the light path, we used a custom-made long-pass dichroic mirror measuring 158 mm × 120 mm × 10 mm (BK7), which was designed for fluorescence imaging of GFP with a cut-off wavelength of 497 nm. A fluorescent filter (#86-992, Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ) was positioned in front of the camera, which was firmly attached to the imaging lens using an F-mount.</p>
<p>The sample stage comprises a three-axis translational movable stage and a two-axis tilt stage. Only the <italic>z</italic>-axis stage is motorized, utilizing an electric actuator (SOM-C13E, OptoSigma, Tokyo, Japan). For time-lapse observation under controlled conditions, we mounted a stage-top incubator (SV-141A, BLAST, Kawasaki, Japan) on the five-axis stage, providing a stable environment at 37 °C with CO<sub>2</sub> control. To ensure precise measurements, we enclosed the entire sample space within a dark box, shielding it from external light and temperature fluctuations.</p>

<title>Multipoint confocal system (AMATERAS-2c) configuration</title>
<p>In the multipoint confocal imaging system, we utilized a custom-made pinhole array disk with specific dimensions (pinhole size: 6 µm, spacing: 24 µm). This disk was mounted on a high-speed rotating machine (CrestOptics, Rome, Italy) and placed precisely on the image plane of the imaging lens. Alignment throughout the FOV was ensured using a translation stage (XR25P/M, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) and tilt stage (AIS-1016B, OptoSigma, Tokyo, Japan) to adjust height and tilt. Beneath the disk, we positioned a short-pass dichroic mirror (DMSP490L, Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ) to allow excitation light to be incident from below. The excitation light source included a high-brightness LED (SOLIS-470C, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ), an excitation filter (#87-800, Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ), and a pair of lenslet arrays (#63-231, Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ), together with a 75-mm lens (f = 200 mm, LA1353-A, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) to ensure uniform illumination onto the disk. The fluorescent image was reflected by the dichroic mirror, transmitted through a fluorescent filter (#86-992, Edmund Optics), and projected onto a 120-megapixel camera using either a 1× or 2× relay lens (LSTL10H-F and LSTL20H-F, Myutron, Tokyo, Japan). The relay lens and camera were attached with an F-mount and secured on a three-axis translational stage (PT3/M, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ). To adjust the focus, the stage for the optical axis direction was motorized using an electric actuator (SOM-C25E, OptoSigma, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<title>Computational sectioning</title>
<p>In wide-field fluorescence imaging of a 3D volume, the superimposition of a fluorescent image from the focal plane and background light from outside the focal plane is a fundamental issue. This problem is not limited to wide-field imaging but also arises in multipoint confocal imaging of thick or high-density samples. To overcome this challenge, we employed computational sectioning, an image processing technique aimed at removing the background light component. Various algorithms have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), and Leica microscopes’ standard software includes this functionality. In this study, we developed an original algorithm as a simple and robust method for data analysis.</p>
<p>The critical step in our approach involves estimating the background light component at each layer of the <italic>z</italic>-stack data. To achieve this, we leverage the assumption that the background light exhibits a low spatial frequency, whereas the focal plane image demonstrates a high spatial frequency. Consequently, we employ an iterative low-pass filtering technique to estimate the background light component. Specifically, as shown in Figs. S2A and B, a two-dimensional (2D) low-pass filter is applied to the raw data (<italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>)) to obtain a smooth surface (<italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>)). To obtain <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>), <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>) and <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>) are compared and the smaller one is chosen to <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>) at every position (<italic>x,y</italic>), as expressed by Eq. (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>).
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="553997v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where min(<italic>a</italic>,<italic>b</italic>) returns the smaller value of <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>. Next, the low-pass filter is applied to <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>) to obtain <italic>L</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>); this process is repeated to make <italic>L<sub>j</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>) closer to the baseline of the original image. The iteration stops when the standard deviation of the difference of <italic>f<sub>j</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>) and <italic>L<sub>j</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>) reaches a preset value (ε).

</disp-formula>
Among various methods available as 2D low-pass filters, we sequentially applied one-dimensional (1D) infinite impulse response (IIR) filter in two directions (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>). This method is faster than other methods such as a 2D Fourier transform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). This speed difference is especially significant when the number of pixels in an image is massive, as in the present case. We adopted Butterworth filter for spectral transmittance of IIR low-pass filter.</p>

<title>Preparation of mouse brain section</title>
<p>All animal care and handling procedures were conducted with approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee of Osaka University (approval numbers R02-8-7). Our utmost efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used. Experiments involved adult male C57BL/6J mice (SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) aged between 2 and 3 mo. To ensure proper anesthesia, mice were deeply anesthetized through intraperitoneal injection of an anesthetic cocktail containing 0.3 mg/kg medetomidine (Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo, Fukushima, Japan), 4 mg/kg midazolam (Sandoz Pharma, Basel, Switzerland), and 5 mg/kg butorphanol (Meiji Seika Pharma, Tokyo, Japan). Subsequently, anesthetized mice underwent transcardial perfusion with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Brain tissues were then excised and immersed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution until further use. For tissue preparation, brain tissue blocks were sliced into 1.5-mm thick coronal sections using a vibrating microtome (LinearSlicer Pro7N, Dosaka EM, Kyoto, Japan). Subsequent staining and tissue clearing involved immersion of sections in CUBIC-L (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) for delipidation, SYTOX Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) solution (1:5,000) diluted in 20% (vol/vol) DMSO in PBS for nuclear staining, and CUBIC-R+(M) (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) for refractive index matching, following previously established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>).

<title>Autofocus in time-lapse imaging</title>
<p>To address <italic>z</italic>-directional drift in the time-lapse observation of quail, we developed an original autofocus method. During the intervals between fluorescence z-images, we acquired bright-field <italic>z</italic>-stacks and analyzed the images to identify the most in-focus position. To achieve this, we used a black ink marker located on the substrate edge as the autofocus target instead of the variable sample itself. For evaluating the degree of in-focus, we applied a total variation (TV) filter to the marker image and used the kurtosis of the filtered image as the focus score. The <italic>z</italic>-position with the maximum focus score was identified as the in-focus location, thus signifying the sharpest image of the marker edge. Although other filter types and statistical moments are available options for the focus score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), our preliminary experiments demonstrated the suitability of the kurtosis of TV for the marker image. In the actual experiment, we acquired 15 images in 15 µm steps and plotted the focus scores against <italic>z</italic>-positions. Through quadratic function fitting of the focus scores at three z-positions (including the <italic>z</italic>-position with the maximum value and adjacent positions), we estimated the best in-focus position with an accuracy of 1 µm.</p>

<title>Cell segmentation and tracking</title>
<p>Cell location detection and tracking were conducted in this study using <italic>z</italic>-stack observations covering a thickness of 240 µm. An issue encountered was the overlap of multiple cells in the <italic>z</italic>-direction, thus potentially resulting in the loss of less intense cells when detected solely on a 2D projected image. To overcome this, 3D cell detection was considered; however, owing to the substantial data size, it proved impractical, especially with commercially available software that requires restricting the region of interest to a small size. To strike a balance between computational cost and detection accuracy, we proposed a method of dividing the <italic>z</italic>-stack into three blocks in the <italic>z</italic>-direction. Within each block, cell detection was performed on the MIP images, and the resulting cell lists were compared to identify identical cells detected across multiple blocks. By recognizing double-detected cell pairs as identical, we updated the cell list accordingly. This iterative process was applied to all double-detected cells, thus achieving effective cell detection and enabling cell tracking throughout the observation period.</p>

<title>Evaluation of optical system with optical invariant and space-bandwidth product</title>
<p>We employed two indices to evaluate the lens system’s scale range and compare it with previous research. The first index, the optical invariant, measures the lens system’s performance and is obtained by multiplying the FOV radius and NA. The second index, the space-bandwidth product, considers the image sensor and wavelength while quantifying the ratio of actual resolution to FOV. These indices are calculated using the following simplified formulas, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors are trying to develop a microscopy system that generates data output exceeding the previous systems based on huge objectives.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
They have accomplished building such a system, with a field of view of 1.5x1.0 cm2 and a resolution of up to 1.2 um. They have also demonstrated their system performance on samples such as organoids, brain sections, and embryos.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
To be used as a volumetric imaging technique, the authors only showcase the implementation of multi-focal confocal sectioning. On the other hand, most of the real biological samples were acquired under wide-field illumination, and processed with so-called computational sectioning. Despite the claim that it improves the contrast, sometimes I felt that the images were oversharpened and the quantitative nature of these fluorescence images may be perturbed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript introduced a volumetric trans-scale imaging system with an ultra-large field-of-view (FOV) that enables simultaneous observation of millions of cellular dynamics in centimeter-wide 3D tissues and embryos. In terms of technique, this paper is just a minor improvement of the authors' previous work, which is a fluorescence imaging system working at visible wavelength region (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95930-7">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95930-7</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
In this study, the authors enhanced the system's resolution and sensitivity by increasing the numerical aperture (NA) of the lens. Furthermore, they achieved volumetric imaging by integrating optical sectioning and computational sectioning. This study encompasses a broad range of biological applications, including imaging and analysis of organoids, mouse brains, and quail embryos, respectively. Overall, this method is useful and versatile.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The unique application that only can be done by this high-throughput system remains vague. Meanwhile, there are also several outstanding issues in this paper, such as the lack of technical advances, unclear method details, and non-standardized figures.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the editors and reviewers who took their valuable time to evaluate the manuscript from various perspectives. We are delighted that our technique was found appealing to biologists and imaging technologists. However, we received several comments that the principles and effectiveness of our techniques are often vague and difficult to understand. They also pointed out that the explanations and representations for several figures were not appropriate. We will revise the manuscript to address these issues and make the manuscript more clear and rigorous.</p>
