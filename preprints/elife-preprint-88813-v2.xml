<title>Abstract</title><p>Stimulation of pancreatic beta cell regeneration could be a therapeutic lead to treat diabetes. Unlike humans, the zebrafish can efficiently regenerate beta cells, notably from ductal pancreatic progenitors. To gain insight into the molecular pathways involved in this process, we established the transcriptomic profile of the ductal cells after beta cell ablation in the adult zebrafish. These data highlighted the protein phosphatase calcineurin as a new potential modulator of beta cell regeneration. We showed that calcineurin overexpression abolished the regenerative response, leading to glycemia dysregulation. On the opposite, calcineurin inhibition increased ductal cell proliferation and subsequent beta cell regeneration. Interestingly, the enhanced proliferation of the progenitors was paradoxically coupled with their exhaustion. This suggests that the proliferating progenitors are next entering in differentiation. Calcineurin appears as a guardian which prevents an excessive progenitor proliferation to preserve the pool of progenitors. Altogether, our findings reveal calcineurin as a key player in the balance between proliferation and differentiation to enable a proper beta cell regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Blood glucose homeostasis is tightly controlled by pancreatic endocrine cells. Insulin-producing beta cells work in close association with alpha cells, which secrete glucagon, and delta cells secreting somatostatin, to maintain normal glycemia. The insulin plays a critical role in this process as it is the only hormone able to lower the glycemia. Beta cell loss is a hallmark of type 1 and of late stages of type 2 diabetes, leading to chronic hyperglycemia. Beta cell destruction is largely irreversible in human and in mammals, making the disease incurable nowadays. Nevertheless, studies in diabetic mice models uncovered promising evidences of slight recovery of beta cells via regeneration. For example, new beta cells can arise from the replication of remaining beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Different models of pancreas injuries revealed the plasticity of mammalian pancreatic cells. Actually, differentiated endocrine cells such as alpha cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] and delta cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] can reprogram and convert into insulin-producing cells, a process that is age dependent. Another possible source of beta cells could be de <italic>novo</italic> formation from pancreatic progenitors residing in the ductal compartment of the adult pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Lineage tracing experiments could not clearly highlight new beta cells arising from the ductal cells in the adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. However, expression of the pro-endocrine marker Neurog3 was detected in the ducts in different mouse models of pancreas regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In addition, a rare population of ductal cells expressing Neurog3 has been reported to contribute to beta cell neogenesis during diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. A recent study of single cell RNA sequencing reveal a sub-population of human ductal cells which are able to give rise to all the pancreatic cell types, including beta cells, following implantation in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Altogether, these findings suggest that mammalian pancreatic ducts possess the intrinsic capacity to (re)generate beta cells even though this process is poorly efficient and slow, especially in adults. In contrast to mammals, zebrafish possess remarkable capacity of regeneration, independently of its age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. This model can therefore be exploited to identify and characterize regenerative mechanisms and ultimately induce regeneration in mammals. Based on regenerative mechanisms identified in zebrafish, several studies succeed to improve regeneration in mammals, underlying the possibility of translation from zebrafish to mammals ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], for review).</p>
<p>In zebrafish, the nitroreductase (NTR)/nitroaromatic prodrug system is widely used. In this technique, the combination of cell type-specific NTR expression and nitroaromatic prodrug exposure allow for controlled and targeted cell ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. When NTR is expressed under the control of the <italic>insulin</italic> (<italic>ins</italic>) promoter (<italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>ins:NTR-mCherry</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]), beta cell destruction is complete within 3 days following the treatment in adult fish, which correlate with a peak of hyperglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. The regeneration of beta cells upon ablation is spontaneous and fast and the glycemia is normalized within two weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Similar to mice, new beta cells can arise through proliferation of surviving beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] as well as through the contribution of alpha cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] and delta cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], underscoring the overall conservation of these processes from zebrafish to mammals. Nevertheless, unlike mammals, the presence of pancreatic progenitors in the ducts is well established in both larval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and adult zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Lineage tracing experiments pointed out that ductal cells and centroacinar cells (CACs) give rise to new beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In adults, duct-derived beta cells start to be detected between 7 and 10 days following beta cell ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Notch signaling is a key player regulating the differentiation of duct-associated progenitors into endocrine cells. Larval duct cells as well as adult CACs display strong Notch activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. This signaling pathway has a central role in beta cell genesis during both development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] and regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] by repressing endocrine differentiation. In zebrafish, different levels of Notch activity determine the behavior of the pancreatic progenitors. While a high level of Notch activity maintains cells in quiescence, a moderate level induces the entry in the cell cycle and proliferation whereas a low level drives endocrine differentiation of the progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. A steep decrease of Notch activity pushes the progenitors to differentiate prematurely, bypassing the amplification step and leading to their depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Repression of the Notch signaling by mTor, activated by glucose and nutrients, hence promotes beta cell formation and regeneration from ductal progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. While Notch and mTor signaling are crucial for this process, there is still a need to establish a global view of the molecular mechanisms regulating beta cell regeneration.</p>
<p>To identify early events regulating ductal-derived beta cell regeneration, we determined the transcriptomic signature of ductal cells from adult zebrafish following beta cell destruction. Our data highlighted an upregulation of the Calcineurin (CaN) pathway. To elucidate CaN function in beta cell regeneration, we both repressed and activated CaN pathway. We showed that CaN regulates beta cell neogenesis in the ducts during regeneration, by acting on progenitor proliferation. Together, our findings underline that CaN fine tunes the balance between progenitor proliferation and beta cell differentiation to guarantee proper regeneration.</p>

<title>Transcriptomic profiling of ductal cells after beta cell destruction highlights regulation of calcineurin pathway</title>
<p>To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the regeneration of beta cells from the ducts, we determined the transcriptional landscape of ductal cells by RNA-sequencing after beta cell ablation in the adult zebrafish. To selectively ablate the beta cells, we used the <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>ins:NTR-mCherry</italic>) transgenic fish. The ductal cells were labelled thanks to the <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>nkx6.1:GFP</italic>) reporter line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] in which GFP marks the ductal tree and associated multipotent pancreatic progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. More precisely, 3 to 4 fishes were treated with the pro-drug MTZ at 10mM overnight, to induce ablation of beta cells or with DMSO for the non-ablated controls. Ablation was confirmed by blood glucose measurement before collection of the pancreas. To capture the early events triggered by the destruction of beta cells, we generated the transcriptome of the ducts 3 days post ablation treatment (dpt), <italic>i.e.</italic> before beta cell neogenesis (<bold>Figure 1A supplemental</bold>). Differential gene expression analysis revealed that 1866 genes are up-regulated and 1515 genes down-regulated in the ductal cell of fish treated with MTZ compared to control (pAdj &lt; 0.05). According to Gene Ontology analysis, the most enriched pathways among the up-regulated genes were DNA replication and cell cycle (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). This further corroborates our previous findings and those of others, regarding the activation of duct-associated progenitors’ proliferation in response to beta cell ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. As expected, the Notch pathway was enriched in the down-regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). On a contrasting note, in a context marked by a robust proliferative response, we found it intriguing to observe an enrichment in the cellular senescence signature (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Subsequently, we investigated deeper into the genes associated with this specific signature. We found among them several components of the calcineurin signaling pathway such as <italic>nfatc3b</italic>, <italic>ppp3ccb</italic> (the catalytic subunit of Calcineurin<italic>), itpr2</italic> and <italic>calm3b</italic> <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>)</bold>. In addition to these genes related to the cellular senescence signature, our transcriptomic studies revealed the modulation of other genes from the CaN canonical pathway (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>), underlying its potential role in beta cell regeneration. Calcineurin (CaN) is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin dependent Ser/Thr phosphatase, involved in numerous biological process including fin regeneration and beta cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. This prompted us to investigate the role of CaN in beta cell regeneration.</p>
<p>Previous RNAseq data performed in our laboratory indicate that CaN (<italic>ppp3cca/b</italic>) and NFATc3 (<italic>nfatc3a/b</italic>) are mainly express in endocrine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] (<bold>Figure 1B supplemental</bold>), which is in accordance with the role of CaN/NFAT signalling in beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. CaN genes (<italic>ppp3cca/b</italic>) as well as <italic>nfatc3b,</italic> are express at lower levels in the ducts at basal state but their expression is induced in response to beta cell destruction (<bold>Figure 1C supplemental</bold>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Calcineurin activity regulates the ductal regenerative response</title>
<p>To evaluate the role of CaN in beta cell regeneration, more specifically derived from ductal progenitors, we have chosen to use young larvae, where regenerated beta cells in the pancreatic tail arise exclusively from the ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In response to beta cells ablation, the intrapancreatic ducts undergo a ductal regenerative response whereby differentiation toward the endocrine fate is increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. We first determined the rate of beta cell neogenesis from the ducts in response to a single acute ablation of beta cells as we performed in adults. We treated <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>ins:NTR-P2A-mCherry</italic>); <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>nkx6.1:GFP</italic>) larvae with nifurpirinol (NFP) from 3 to 4 dpf and mCherry+ beta cells were quantified in the GFP+ ducts in the pancreatic tail at several time points: 4, 7, 10 and 14 dpt (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). Duct-associated beta cells started to be detected in non-ablated larvae between 7 and 10 dpt (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>) and the number of beta cells slowly increased until 14 dpt (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, 1G</bold>). In ablated larvae, the increase became more pronounced from 10 dpt onwards (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, 1G</bold>), indicating faster endocrine differentiation. This experiment establishes that the ductal regenerative response is detectable between 10 and 14 days after the beta cell ablation, performed at 3 dpf. We next wanted to determine if ductal cell proliferation is activated in response to beta cell destruction in larvae as in adult fish. We exposed <italic>Tg(ins:NTR-P2A-mCherry); Tg(nkx6.1:GFP)</italic> larvae to EdU the second day following ablation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref></bold>). In the ablated larvae, the proportion of GFP+ ductal cells EdU+ (in S-phase) was higher compared to non-ablated larvae (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>, 1J</bold>). This result shows that acute beta cell ablation in larvae rapidly activates ductal cell proliferation, as previously reported in adult zebrafish.</p>
<p>As our transcriptomic data from adult zebrafish revealed modulation of the CaN pathway at 3 dpt (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>), we treated <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>ins:NTR-P2A-mCherry</italic>); <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>nkx6.1:GFP</italic>) larvae from 1 to 3 dpt after beta cell ablation, with a CaN inhibitor, the Cyclosporin A (CsA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). The number of newly formed beta cells in the tail was monitored from 4 to 14 dpt. CsA enhanced beta cell formation at 10 dpt (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-D</xref>)</bold>. However, this effect appears to be transient since no discernible difference was observed between the control and CsA-treated larvae in regeneration at the latest time point (14dpt), suggesting an acceleration of the regenerative response (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>, <bold>Figure 2A supplemental</bold>). Interestingly, CsA did not affect beta cell differentiation in non-ablated larvae, indicating that CsA only acts in a regenerative context (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-D</xref>)</bold>. Of note, CsA increased as well the number of regenerated beta cells in the principal islet (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, 2C supplemental</bold>). We and others, previously showed that the other major source of beta cell regeneration, besides the ducts, are the bi-hormonal sst1.1+/ins+ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. However, CsA did not affect bi-hormonal cell formation <bold>(Figure 2D supplemental</bold>), suggesting that the additional cells in the principal islet could also originate from the ducts.</p>

<p>We next tested the effect of CsA on endocrine progenitors in a regenerative context. We induced regeneration in Tg(<italic>neurod1:GFP</italic>) larvae where the GFP is expressed in both endocrine progenitors and mature endocrine cells. We first assessed generation of GFP cells at different time points (<bold>Figure 2E supplemental)</bold> and showed that CsA induced an increase of neurod1+ cells from 4 dpt. The increase was still detectable at least until 10dpt (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>, <bold>Figure 2F supplemental</bold>). To determine if these additional cells result from their own proliferation, we performed a pulse of EdU just before analysis (<bold>Figure 2E supplemental</bold>). We observed that CsA did not affect the neurod1+ cell proliferation rate, which is very low at these stages (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></bold>). As a consequence, the effect of CsA cannot be explained by endocrine cell proliferation but rather by neogenesis from progenitors. As CsA affects pro-endocrine cells formation, we next wondered if the increased cell formation induced by CsA is specific to beta cells. Treatment with CsA was performed as previously and delta1.1 and alpha cells were detected by immunofluorescence. Interestingly, CsA did not affect alpha nor delta1.1 cells neogenesis in response to beta cell ablation (<bold>Figure 2G-H supplemental</bold>). Overall, these experiments showed that CsA affects specifically the beta cells and their endocrine progenitors.</p>

<title>CaN regulates beta cell differentiation induced by Notch inhibition in absence of regeneration</title>
<p>Our transcriptomic data showed that the Notch pathway is downregulated in ductal cells during beta cell regeneration (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). As the level of Notch activity determines the behavior of ductal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] from quiescence to proliferation and subsequently to beta cell differentiation, we tested whether calcineurin acts together with the Notch pathway on a common pool of ductal progenitors. To inhibit the Notch pathway, we treated larvae with several concentrations of the gamma-secretase inhibitor LY411575 from 3 to 4dpf in absence of regeneration. The activity of CaN was inhibited by CsA during the same timeframe (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). As previously, we used reporter lines for beta and ductal cells <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>ins:NTR-P2A-mCherry</italic>); <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>nkx6.1:GFP</italic>) and the number of secondary beta cells was analyzed at 6dpf (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). As expected, the number of beta cells progressively rose as the concentration of the Notch inhibitor increased (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). Combined treatment with CsA fostered the differentiation of beta cells between 1 and 10 µM LY411575 but did not result in further increase at 15 µM LY411575 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>), suggesting that CaN is important within a permissive window of Notch activity. Since we overserved the highest synergistic effect at 5µM of LY411575, we used this concentration for the following experiments (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref></bold>). It is worth noting that combined treatment of LY411575 (5uM) and another CaN inhibitor, FK506, resulted in the same synergistic increase of beta cell differentiation (<bold>Figure 4A-B supplemental</bold>), confirming that the effect is due to CaN inhibition. The combined effect of Notch and CaN inhibition is transient as it is not observed at 7dpf anymore (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). Therefore, as observed in regenerative conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>), CaN inhibition accelerates beta cell neogenesis induced by Notch repression.</p>

<p>To determine to which extent CaN pathway can modulate Notch induced beta cell neogenesis, we activated CaN<sup>CA</sup> overexpression in <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>hsp70:GFP-P2A-ppp3cc</italic><sup>CA</sup><italic>); Tg</italic>(<italic>ins:NTR-P2A-mCherry</italic>) larvae by an heat-shock at 3 dpf and treated them with LY411575 (<bold>Figure 4C supplemental)</bold>. CaN<sup>CA</sup> overexpression resulted in a lowered beta cell formation induced by Notch inhibition (<bold>Figure 4D supplemental</bold>), revealing that CaN activation counterbalanced the effects of Notch inhibition. Using our previous settings of Notch and CaN inhibition, we next wondered if the canonical pathway downstream of CaN was involved in the enhancement of beta cell differentiation. To activate NFAT, a well-known target of CaN, we used CHIR99021 allowing a stabilization of the active form of NFAT (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). We found that CHIR99021 rescued the effect of CsA (<bold>Figure 4E supplemental</bold>), suggesting that CaN inhibition increases beta cell neogenesis at least partially by the regulation of NFAT. Overall, these results reveal that CaN impacts beta cell formation in pro-endocrinogenic context, such as induced by a low level of Notch activity. Moreover, it suggests that both CaN and Notch pathways act on a common pool of ductal progenitors to govern beta cell neogenesis.</p>

<title>CaN controls the proliferation of duct-associated progenitors induced by Notch inhibition</title>
<p>Given that we observed the most significant increase in beta cell formation with CsA when Notch activity was mildly repressed (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-D</xref></bold>), and since mild Notch activity has been shown to promote progenitor amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], it suggests that CaN acts at this level.

<p>Incidentally, at 4dpf, while the proliferation is increased (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>), the number of ductal cells remained the same in all conditions (<bold>Figure 5B supplemental</bold>), suggesting that ductal cells have not yet left the cell cycle to differentiate.

In these conditions, CsA could therefore not enhance ductal progenitor proliferation and thus beta cell formation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>).

<title>CaN prevents exhaustion of Notch responsive progenitors during beta cell regeneration</title>
<p>Taken together, our results indicate that CaN plays a role in the proliferation of ductal progenitors in contexts that are permissive for beta cell differentiation. To demonstrate that CaN acts on ductal progenitor proliferation in a similar manner to Notch inhibition but during regeneration, we exposed <italic>Tg(ins:NTR-P2A-mCherry</italic>); <italic>Tg(nkx6.1:GFP</italic>) larvae after ablation and CsA treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>). CaN inhibition enhanced the proliferation of ductal cells in ablated larvae (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-G</xref></bold>). To next determine if CaN acts on the Notch-responsive progenitors in beta cell regeneration, we then used <italic>Tg(tp1:VenusPest)</italic> Notch reporter line. At larval stages the vast majority of ductal cells are Notch responsive and the reporter line marks all the progenitors within the ductal tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. We treated <italic>Tg(ins:NTR-P2A-mCherry</italic>); <italic>Tg(tp1:VenusPest)</italic> as described above (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>). In ablated-larvae, CsA increased tp1+ ductal cell proliferation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H-I</xref></bold>). Moreover, CsA induced a reduction of tp1+ ductal cells in ablated larvae (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 H-J</xref></bold>), suggesting an exhaustion of the Notch responsive progenitors, in accordance with premature beta cell differentiation we observed (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref></bold>). Lastly, CsA does not affect tp1+ cells in non-ablated larvae showing that CaN inhibition did not directly affect Notch signaling (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref></bold>). Those results suggest that CaN fine tunes the balance between proliferation of the progenitors and their differentiation to prevent their exhaustion during beta cell regeneration.</p>

<p>Next, we determined the functional impact of CaN overexpression or inhibition by assessing the glycemia at 7, 10 and 14 after beta cell ablation. Overexpression of CaN<sup>CA</sup> using either <italic>Tg(hsp70:GFP-P2A-ppp3cc</italic><sup>CA</sup><italic>)</italic> or <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>cftr:gal4</italic>); <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>UAS:GFP-P2A-ppp3cc</italic><sup>CA</sup><italic>),</italic> led to an increased glycemia at both 7 and 10dpt (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-E</xref>)</bold>, before recovery at 14 dpt (<bold>Figure 6A supplemental</bold>). This indicates that the overexpression of CaN delayed glycemia recovery induced by beta cell regeneration. However, CaN inhibition did not seem to further improve the glycemia (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-E</xref></bold>) probably because the glycemia was already low at 7dpt (77 mg/dL on average) compared to non-ablated control (50 mg/dl on average) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-E</xref></bold>). Altogether, these results show that in adult zebrafish also, CaN regulation is necessary to enable beta cell regeneration and for proper recovery of the glycemia after beta cell loss.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study reveals the importance of the protein phosphatase CaN as a new player in beta cell regeneration in zebrafish. We demonstrate that CaN acts on ductal-associated progenitor cells by balancing proliferation and endocrine differentiation. In addition, we show the interplay between CaN and Notch signalling, a master regulator of beta cell regeneration.</p>
<p>Previous drug and genetic screening using zebrafish larvae enabled the identification of several regulators of beta cell regeneration from different pancreatic cellular sources. For example, adenosine has been shown to stimulate beta cell replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], igfbp1a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] and TGFb suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] promote alpha-to-beta cell transdifferentiation. As for cdk5 inhibition and folinic acid/Folr1, they promote beta cell regeneration from the pancreatic ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Here, to identify novel regulators of beta cell regeneration specifically from pancreatic ducts, we carried out a transcriptomic profiling of duct cells following beta cell ablation in the adult zebrafish. Transcriptomic analyses show that the regulated genes encompass most of the genes and pathways identified in previous studies (igfbp1, mTor, Notch, etc.), underlying the importance of those actors in beta cell regeneration. Our data reveal also that DNA replication is the most enriched signature attesting that duct cells undergo a potent proliferative response after the destruction of beta cells.</p>
<p>Besides these expected signatures, our transcriptomic data uncover the unanticipated upregulation of numerous genes implicated in DNA repair and cell cycle arrest. These signatures might indicate that highly proliferating ductal cells activate counteracting mechanisms. Among the genes regulated in those signatures, we focused on CaN and determined its role in beta cell regeneration. Pharmacological inhibition of CaN increases the proliferation of duct cells induced by beta cell ablation, resulting in an acceleration of beta cell regeneration in the ducts. Consistently, transgene-mediated CaN overactivation abolishes the regenerative response. Importantly, the inhibition of regeneration is observed when CaN is overexpressed either ubiquitously or selectively in <italic>cftr</italic>-expressing ductal cells indicating that the role of CaN in beta cell regeneration is intrinsic to the ducts. Based on functional assays in larvae, we not only confirm the activation of the proliferation of ductal cells soon after beta cell ablation, but also that the rate of progenitor proliferation is carefully controlled by CaN in order to achieve proper and timely regeneration of beta cells. Our data are consistent with earlier studies reporting a role of CaN in proliferation dynamics during fin regeneration. In the regenerating fin, low CaN activity is found in the proximal region of the blastema characterized by a high rate of proliferation and regeneration and its activity increases distally where lower proliferation is observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. It was suggested that CaN control blastemal cell progeny divisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. In human, the importance of CaN in proliferation is also highlighted in organ transplanted patients. When patients are treated with Cyclosporin A (<italic>i.e.</italic> the CaN inhibitor we used in this study) as immunosuppressive drug they indeed present an increased risk of skin cancer, notably due to keratinocyte senescence inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].</p>
<p>It has been shown that Notch inhibitory treatments switch progenitors from proliferative self-renewing to premature differentiation, leading to progenitor depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Our study reveals that this phenomenon is further exacerbated by CaN inhibition. Importantly, during normal larval development in absence of Notch inhibitory treatment, CaN does not affect basal ductal proliferation nor beta cell differentiation. Hence, Notch signalling has to be repressed to detect the effect of CaN on the progenitors, suggesting that CaN acts downstream of Notch pathway. In differentiating keratinocytes, CaN cooperates with Notch signalling to regulate p21/<italic>cdkn1a</italic> (which is upregulated in the ducts at 3 dpt), cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. These studies show that CaN acts in association with Notch signalling on progenitors proliferation and on their differentiation.</p>
<p>Based on our data, we build the model depicted in <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>. Our study suggests that CaN acts in competent progenitor cells and that this competence is determined by Notch signalling. When Notch is repressed to a mild level, the progenitor enter into the cell cycle and acquire a pro-endocrinogenic competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. CaN acts on these progenitors to tone down an excessive proliferation and avoid the exhaustion of these progenitors. CaN is therefore a guardian of the progenitor population. CaN inhibition both increases progenitor proliferation and induces their depletion, suggesting a switch to a symmetric division resulting in two daughter cells entering in endocrine differentiation.</p>

<caption><title>Model of CaN action on ductal progenitors to regenerate beta cells</title><p><bold>A)</bold> Under physiological conditions, the behavior of the ductal progenitors is determined by Notch signaling. Calcineurin is active in these progenitors and enable a proper control between proliferation and differentiation. When CaN in repressed, more ductal progenitors enter in the cell cycle (2dpt) and switch to a mode of proliferation leading to differentiation of the two daughter cells (4dpt), as more pro-endocrine cells are formed. The result is a exhaustion of the progenitors and a premature beta cell differentiation (10dpt).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>More precisely, a previous study in mice uncover the existence of three division modes of the pancreatic progenitors during embryonic development, <italic>i.e.</italic> symmetric self-renewing resulting in two progenitors cells; asymmetric resulting in a progenitor and a endocrine cell and symmetric differentiative resulting in two differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. The authors actually show that the type of division is defined by the timing of induction of endocrine program by NEUROG3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Interestingly, NEUROG3 seems to be the link between proliferation and differentiation, and its expression is regulated by Notch signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. In zebrafish, endocrine differentiation is not induced by <italic>Neurog3</italic> but by <italic>Ascl1b</italic> and <italic>Neurod1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Concerning that subject, CaN inhibition accelerates the formation of neurod1+ cells. Hence CaN could possibly act via the determination of the type of division <italic>i.e.</italic> symmetric vs asymmetric. This model is supported by previous observation in others systems. In stem cells and neuronal and hematopoietic progenitors, premature differentiation results from a switch in the mode of cellular division, from symmetric amplifying division to asymmetric differentiating division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Notch determines the choice between both types of divisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>].</p>
<p>Calcineurin is known to be implicated in cellular senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Usually thought as negative regulators of development and cellular growth, DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>] and cellular senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>] appear to be required in both developmental and regenerative processes. Our transcriptomic data suggest that these mechanisms are required for beta cell regeneration. Therefore, it would be interesting to determine the contribution of these cellular processes in the ductal progenitors and determine if CaN acts via cellular senescence in this case.</p>
<p>Overall, this study brings new insights on beta cell regeneration and highlights the ductal progenitor cell cycle as a cornerstone in the process. Some studies report an increase of proliferation of some ductal cell population in diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>], implying a regenerative response. However, these ductal cells cannot efficiently reform the beta cell mass, suggesting a dormant mechanism of regeneration. As such, the balance between proliferation and induction of endocrine differentiation could be a key to improve beta cell neogenesis. However, as CaN is also important for beta cell function, this approach would require to be transient to induce neogenesis. Therefore, it should be combined with methods to induce beta cell proliferation to ultimately reconstitute the beta cell mass. Overall, this study brings a better understanding on the regulation of the balance between ductal progenitors proliferation and endocrine differentiation. These results should provide new hints to help improve regenerative competences in mammals.</p>

<p>This work presents some <bold>valuable</bold> information regarding the molecular mechanisms controlling the regeneration of pancreatic beta cells following induced cell ablation. However, the study lacks the critical lineage tracing result to support the conclusion about the origin of the regenerated beta cells. The results of the pharmacological manipulation of CaN signaling are also <bold>incomplete</bold>. In particular, these manipulation are not cell-specific, making it difficult to interpret and thus a genetic approach is recommended.</p>

<p>Induction of beta cell regeneration is a promising approach for the treatment of diabetes. In this study, Massoz et.al., identified calcineurin (CaN) as a new potential modulator of beta cell regeneration by using zebrafish as model. They also showed that calcineurin (CaN) works together with Notch signaling to promote the beta cell regeneration. Overall, the paper is well organized, and technically sound. However, some evidences seem weak to get the conclusion.</p>

<p>This work started with transcriptomic profiling of ductal cells to identify the upregulation of calcineurin in the zebrafish after beta-cell ablation. By suppressing calcineurin with its chemical inhibitor cyclosporin A and expressing a constitutively active form of calcineurin ubiquitously or specifically in ductal cells, the authors found that inhibited calcineurin activity promoted beta-cell regeneration transiently while ectopic calcineurin activity hindered beta-cell regeneration in the pancreatic tail. They also showed similar effects in the basal state but only when it was within a particular permissive window of Notch activity. To further investigate the roles of calcineurin in the ductal cells, the authors demonstrated that calcineurin inhibition additionally induced the proliferation of the ductal cells in the regenerative context or under a limited level of Notch activity. Interestingly, the enhanced proliferation was followed by a depletion of ductal cells, suggesting that calcineurin inhibition would exhaust the ductal cells. Based on the data, the authors proposed a very attractive and intriguing model of the role of calcineurin in maintaining the balance of the progenitor proliferation and the endocrine differentiation. However, the conclusions of this paper are only partially supported by the data as some evidence of the lineage between ductal cells and beta cells remains suggestive.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This work presents some valuable information regarding the molecular mechanisms controlling the regeneration of pancreatic beta cells following induced cell ablation. However, the study lacks the critical lineage tracing result to support the conclusion about the origin of the regenerated beta cells. The results of the pharmacological manipulation of CaN signaling are also incomplete. In particular, these manipulation are not cell-specific, making it difficult to interpret and thus genetic approach is recommended.</p>
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Induction of beta cell regeneration is a promising approach for the treatment of diabetes. In this study, Massoz et.al., identified calcineurin (CaN) as a new potential modulator of beta cell regeneration by using zebrafish as model. They also showed that calcineurin (CaN) works together with Notch signaling calcineurin (CaN) to promote the beta cell regeneration. Overall, the paper is well organized, and technically sound. However, some evidence seems weak to get the conclusion.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This work started with transcriptomic profiling of ductal cells to identify the upregulation of calcineurin in the zebrafish after beta-cell ablation. By suppressing calcineurin with its chemical inhibitor cyclosporin A and expressing a constitutively active form of calcineurin ubiquitously or specifically in ductal cells, the authors found that inhibited calcineurin activity promoted beta-cell regeneration transiently while ectopic calcineurin activity hindered beta-cell regeneration in the pancreatic tail. They also showed similar effects in the basal state but only when it was within a particular permissive window of Notch activity. To further investigate the roles of calcineurin in the ductal cells, the authors demonstrated that calcineurin inhibition additionally induced the proliferation of the ductal cells in the regenerative context or under a limited level of Notch activity. Interestingly, the enhanced proliferation was followed by a depletion of ductal cells, suggesting that calcineurin inhibition would exhaust the ductal cells. Based on the data, the authors proposed a very attractive and intriguing model of the role of calcineurin in maintaining the balance of the progenitor proliferation and the endocrine differentiation. However, the conclusions of this paper are only partially supported by the data as some evidence from the data remains suggestive.</p>
<p>(1) In the transcriptomic profiling, genes differentially regulated in the ablated adults could be solely due to the chemical effects of metronidazole instead of the beta-cell ablation. A control group without ins:NTR-mCherry but treated with metronidazole is necessary to exclude the side effects of metronidazole.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that it is unlikely that the differential regulation observed is due to metronidazole rather than the beta cell loss. This experimental strategy as proven successful in well-published studies to identify regulators of beta cell regeneration in the zebrafish larvae. Importantly, the candidates identified in these studies were subsequently functionally validated in mammalian models (Lu et al. 2016, Karampelias 2021). Moreover, in our study, we also used another chemical compound, the nifurpirinol (Bergemann et al., 2018), to ablate the beta cells. Regardless of whether we employed metronidazole or nifurpirinol for beta cell ablation, our results consistently indicate a notable involvement of calcineurin. Of note, the nifurpirinol molecule is commonly used in fishkeeping without toxicity reported on the global health of the fish.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Although it has been shown that the pancreatic duct is a major source of the secondary islets in the pancreatic tail in previous studies, there is no direct evidence showing the cyclosporin A-induced cells share the source in this manuscript. Without any proper lineage tracing work, the origin of those cyclosporin A-induced cells cannot be concluded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our experimental setting is similar to the one described in Ninov et al. 2013, where lineage tracing experiments demonstrate an increase of beta cell formation in the pancreatic tail that originate from the pancreatic ducts. In our study, we performed the same experiment with the addition of CsA and showed more ductal cell proliferation (Figure 5G) followed by a 19% increase of beta cell regeneration compared to nonregenerative conditions (Figure 2B). It is unlikely that the additional 19% of regenerated beta cells under CaN inhibition come from another source than the 68% first.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the acinar cells cannot be consider as another source of regenerated beta cell as they are not able to form beta cells unless they are artificially reprogrammed (Maddison et al., 2012). Therefore the only other potential source of regenerated beta cell is the endocrine compartment. However at the stage where we performed beta cell ablation, there are no endocrine cell in the pancreatic tail. Moreover, there are no evidence that secondary islets could come from the principal islet, they are tightly associated with the ducts and differentiate form ductal cell (Mi et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Importantly, we demonstrated that overexpression of CaN specifically in the pancreatic ducts prevents beta cell regeneration. CaN effect is therefore intrinsic to the ducts. Moreover, we showed that CsA increase beta cells formation when Notch signalling is repressed. Given that Notch signalling is known to act on the ductal cell population, this strongly suggests again that CsA exacerbate beta cells formation from the ducts.</p>
<p>All of these compelling evidences strongly support the notion that the cyclosporininduced beta cells originate from the ductal cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It is interesting to see an increase of beta cells in the primary islet after cyclosporin A treatment (Supplemental Fig 2B). However, it remains unclear if their formation shares the same mechanism with the newly formed beta cells in the pancreatic tail.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are indeed several source of beta cell regeneration in the primary islet. However, a recent study showed that the contribution of alpha cell to regeneration is minor and the main contributors are ductal and sst1.1 cells (Mi et al., 2023). In our previous publication, we indeed showed that a major source of beta cell in the principal islet is the delta 1.1 cell population. Those sst1.1 cells begin to express insulin and therefore are named ‘bihormonal’ (Carril et al., 2022). We tested if this population is impacted by CsA treatment and we showed below that CsA does not affect bi-hormonal cell formation (Figure 2D supplemental). These new results suggest that the CsA mediated increase of beta cells in the principal islet arise from the ductal cells as observed in the tail. These results were added in the manuscript as Figure 2D supplemental.</p>

<p>(4) The conclusion of the effect of cyclosporin A on the endocrine progenitors (Line 175) is not convincing because the data cannot distinguish the endocrine progenitors from the insulin-expressing cells. Indeed, Figure 2E shows that neurod1+ cells are fewer than ins+ cells (Figure 2D) in the pancreatic tail at 10 dpt, suggesting that all or at least the majority of neurod1+ cells are already ins+.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The neurod1+ cells population indeed included both endocrine progenitor cells and differentiated endocrine cells. However, we would like to point out that the timing of the analysis is essential to reach our conclusion. When we treat with CsA, we show an increase of neurod1+ cells  already at 4dpt. At this time point,  no hormone- producing cell can yet be detected (Figure 2E). Those additional neurod1+ cell are therefore endocrine progenitors and not beta cells. This result shows that CaN inhibition induces pro-endocrine cell formation in regenerative conditions.</p>
<p>At 10dpt, the neurod1+ cells population includes beta cells as well as endocrine progenitor cell. We agree that the way the data are presented in figure 2D and 2E can be confusing. Those 2 figures come form 2 separated experiments, the number of beta cell in figure 2D can therefore not be compared to the number of Neurod1+ cell in figure 2E. Indeed, from one experiment to another the efficiency and  rate of regeneration can vary, independently of calcineurin.  To clarify, we added the number of beta cells regenerated in the experiment of figure 2E (see Author response image 2 in red). As you can see in this experiment, regeneration was a bit slower than usual.</p>

<p>(5) Figure 5D shows a significant loss of nkx6.1+ cells in the combined treatment group but there is no direct evidence showing this was a result of differentiation as the authors suggested. This cell loss also outnumbered the increase in ins+ cells (Figure 4D). The cell fates of these lost cells are still undetermined, and the authors did not demonstrate if apoptosis could be a reason of the cell loss.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Firstly, as you can notice on the graphs, we encountered a very high variability between individuals within the same condition. We decided to show this variability by presenting the raw data. This high variability could partially explain the differences that you underline. Moreover, we would like to point out that independently of CaN inhibition the progenitor loss (nkx6.1+ cell) outnumber the gain of beta cells. Indeed, in average there is a loss of 29% (41 GFP+) of the nkx6.1+ cells and a gain of only 6 beta cells after Notch inhibitory treatment. The other progenitors cells being differentiated into other endocrine cell types (pro-endocrine, alpha, delta). In the combined treatment (Notch and CaN inhibitors), we decreased the number of progenitors cell by 50%, i.e 21% (20 cells) more than without CaN inhibitor. However, we increased the number of regenerated beta cells by two fold (6 cell to 12 cells). In brief, the important progenitors cell loss could be explained by precocious differentiation in the pro-endocrine and endocrine cells type. It is therefore normal than the number of beta cells regenerated do not match the progenitors cell number loss and this in presence or absence of CaN inhibition.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The evidence to indicate the proliferating ductal cell differentiate into beta cell is weak. They should use linkage tracing, or other marker genes immunostaining to confirm that.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The experiment from the Figure 5 A-D is a short term tracing experiment and should have been presented as such in the manuscript. After LY411575 (Notch inhibitor) and CsA treatments at 3dpf, we exposed the larvae to EdU at 4dpf during 8 hours (Figure 5A). We showed that EdU is incorporated in dividing ductal cells at 4dpf (Figure 5C) ant that 2 days later there are newly form beta cells that are EdU+.(see Author response image 3) To reinforce our conclusion, the image below will be added to the manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) To inhibition of CaN and Notch pathway, they just used the pharmacological approaches, genetical approaches should be used to get stronger evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We employed two distinct inhibitors specifically targeting calcineurin (CsA and FK506) for CaN inhibition. While these inhibitors have distinct chemical structures and potential non-specific effects, they both yield the same result of increased beta cell formation under Notch repression (see Figure 4D and Figure 4B in the supplementary data). This convergence of outcomes strongly suggests that the observed effect is primarily attributable to the specific inhibition of calcineurin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we complemented our inhibitor-based approach with a genetic strategy involving CaN overexpression (see Figure 3). Notably, the overactivation of CaN resulted in a reduction of beta cell regeneration. Given that this genetic approach generated an effect contrary to that achieved with the inhibitors, it provides robust support for our model, which postulates that calcineurin plays a critical role in the regulation of beta cell regeneration (see Figure 3, panels C-E).</p>
<p>As for Notch inhibition, previous published data from our laboratory compared the effects of Notch inhibitor (LY411575) and genetic approaches (mib mutant and transgenic line) on pro-endocrine cell (ascl1b+) and ductal cell (nkx6.1+) formation. This study showed that both Notch inhibitor (LY411575) and Notch repression using genetic approaches recapitulate the same effect: an induction of  pro-endocrine cells formation. The specificity of this inhibitor being validated (Ghaye et al., 2015), we did not consider the need of a genetic approach.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The most enriched pathways among the up-regulated genes were DNA replication and cell cycle, which suggested that these genes are more important for the duct cell proliferation, how is Calcineurin related to these pathways, such as regulating the genes important for proliferation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The transcriptomic data presented in this manuscript suggest that the ductal cells undergo a strong proliferative response after beta cell ablation. This is in accordance with our experimental data showing activation of ductal proliferation after beta cell ablation (Ghaye at al., 2015) and data from this manuscript (Figure 1 I-J).</p>
<p>Calcineurin is a well-known regulator of the cell cycle, and can either promote or repress the cell cycle depending on the cell type. For example, stressing the cell provokes an entry of calcium and subsequently a CaN activation which result in cell cycle arrest (Leech et al. 2020). Nevertheless, depending the cell type, CaN can be either necessary or deleterious to cell proliferation (Goshima et al. 2019; Masaki and Shimada 2022). The intriguing dual role of CaN in cell cycle is well illustrated in β cell regeneration. While CaN should be repressed to enable ductal progenitor amplification and subsequent endocrine differentiation, CaN is then necessary for β cell function and for their replication (Dai et al. 2017; Heit et al. 2006). Moreover, CaN is related to cellular senescence and CaN function is important for proper fin regeneration in zebrafish.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It is hard to understand why they pick up the pathway of cellular senescence signature for the duct cell progenitor neogenesis? Moreover, among these senescence genes, many genes are cell cycle regulators.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to beta cell ablation, the ductal cells undergo a strong proliferative response, as shown in our previous data (Ghaye 2015). It was therefore not surprising that many differentially expressed genes are cell cycle regulators. On the other hand, the cellular senescence signature was surprising. Indeed, senescence is usually associated with cell cycle arrest and aging. However, recent studies showed that cellular senescence is required for proper development and regeneration. We therefore wanted to investigate this pathway and more particularly the function of calcineurin, which can either promote or repress the cell cycle in different cell types (see comment above).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The RNA-seq data obtained from adult fish, while the authors use larvae to explore the CaN functions, it may have different conclusion using adult fish. Moreover, it is unclear whether the CaN increased when the beta cell ablated in young larvae.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We decided to first perform functional experiment in the larvae as this model unable the quantification of beta cell regeneration from the ducts in the pancreatic tail. However, to validate our results in non-developmental stages, we perform experiments in juveniles (2 months old) and adults. CsA treatments in juveniles zebrafish recapitulated the same results that in larvae (Figure 2B and Figure 6A-C). Moreover, we showed that CaN overactivation delayed glycemia recovery after ablation adults (Figure 6D-E), which is in accordance with an impaired regeneration. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that CaN act as regulator of beta cell regeneration both in the juvenile/adult and larval stages.</p>
<p>Concerning the expression of CaN in the zebrafish larvae, we tried to detect the level of CaN in the different experimental conditions by in situ hybridization. However, we were not able to detect it using this technique. We also tried immunostaining with antiphospho-nfact3 ser165 polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen) but this antibody does not seem to  work in zebrafish. Finally, we tried to sort ductal cell at larval stage to perform a transcriptomic analysis but we were unable to collect enough ductal cells to proceed further. Indeed our staining experiment showed that there are only around 150 ductal cells (nkx6.1+, Figure 5D) at this stage.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The beta cell regeneration in the young larvae usually recovers within ~ 5 days in principle islet. Please also show the beta cell number (PI) during the beta cell recovery after ablation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did show beta cell regeneration in the principal islet in Figure 2A-B supplemental.  While new beta cells appears quickly in this islet (Carril, Massoz, Dupont et al., 2023), the  principal islet has not yet fully recover at 5dpt.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Since the studies did not show the CaN level in Fig.3, it is hard to know that the CaN is exactly expressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the figure 3B, using Tg(hsp70:GFP-CaNCA), it is indeed not possible to see CaN expression at 10 dpt as the heat shocks induce only transiently CaNCA overexpression. However, the transient expression was detected in live shortly after the heat shocks. On the other hand, with the transgenic line Tg(UAS:GFP-CaNCA); Tg(cftr:Gal4), in which GFPCaNCA is continuously expressed allowing us to show CaNCA expression in the pancreatic ducts (Figure 3).</p>

<p>(11) The role of calcineurin seems transient (e.g. Figure 2B and 4E) and does not play a significant role in long term. It would be interesting to see if long-term/repeated treatments of calcineurin inhibitors and overexpression/knockout of important members of calcineurin signaling would affect the pool of progenitors in long term.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We were also interested in the consequences of CaN overexpression on the long term. Our overexpression tool Tg(UAS:CaNCA) allow to address this question, as CaN is overexpress permanently. We assessed the structure of the ducts and the number of beta cells in transgenic larvae and did not see any defects of the ducts whether in regenerative context or not. On the other hand, we showed in this manuscript that CaN effect is specific to regenerative conditions. As a consequence, it is not likely that repeated treatments long after the ablation would continue to affect beta cell formation and the progenitors pool.</p>
