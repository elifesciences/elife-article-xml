<title>Abstract</title><p>Opioid use disorder is marked by a progressive change in the motivation to administer the drug even in the presence of negative consequences. After long periods of abstinence, the urge to return to taking the drug intensifies over time, known as incubation of craving. Conditioned responses to drug-related stimuli, can acquire motivational properties and exert control over motivated behaviors leading to relapse. Although, preclinical data suggest that the behavioral expression of opioid use is similar between male and female rodents, we do not have conclusive results on sex differences on craving and relapse across abstinence periods. Here, we investigated the effects of abstinence from oxycodone self-administration on neurotransmission in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) pathway in male and female rats. Using optogenetics and <italic>ex vivo</italic> electrophysiology, we assessed synaptic strength and glutamate release probability in this pathway, as well as NAcSh medium spiny neurons (MSN) intrinsic excitability, in slices from rats which were subjected to either 1 (acute) or 14 (prolonged) days of forced abstinence after self-administration. Our results revealed no sex differences in oxycodone self-administration or somatic withdrawal symptoms following acute abstinence. However, we found a sex-specific enhancement in cue-induced relapse after prolonged, but not acute, abstinence from oxycodone self-administration, with females exhibiting higher relapse rates. Notably, prolonged abstinence led to similar increases in synaptic strength at PVT-NAcSh inputs compared to saline controls in both sexes, which was not observed after acute abstinence. Thus, prolonged abstinence results in a time-dependent increase in PVT-NAcSh synaptic strength and sex-specific effects on cue-induced relapse rates. These findings suggest that prolonged abstinence leads to significant synaptic changes, contributing to heightened relapse vulnerability, highlighting the need for targeted therapeutic strategies in opioid use disorder.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Relapse is a hallmark of substance use disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Relapse-inducing triggers include cues previously associated with the drug, stressful events and/or environments, and taking the drug itself (i.e., drug priming). These triggers can result in resumption of drug-taking (relapse), despite negative consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Several preclinical models of relapse have been developed, and the model most closely mimicking the human conditions involves drug self-administration, an operant behavior in which the animal is required to press a lever to obtain drug and can therefore regulate its drug intake. To specifically assess relapse-like behavior, animals undergo a period of “forced abstinence” after several weeks of drug self-administration.</p>
<p>During forced abstinence, the animals are returned to their home cage without access to the drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. When animals are re-introduced to the self-administration behavioral chambers after forced abstinence, they engage in rapid lever pressing - even though no drug is delivered in response. This time-dependent increase in motivation to seek out drug is referred to as ‘incubation of craving’ that leads to relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Following extended periods of abstinence, incubated craving generally remains elevated before gradually stabilizing and declining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The use of extinction training is also a common approach to study relapse after self-administration. In contrast to forced abstinence, extinction training prompts animals to learn that the drug is no longer available based on their actions (instrumental responding, e.g. lever presses or nose pokes), leading to a gradual reduction in drug-seeking behavior. Both models can trigger relapse when animals are reintroduced to drug-associated cues, but the neural pathways involved and the behavioral outcomes differ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In these models, extinction training teaches animals that lever pressing no longer results in drug delivery. However, the drug-paired cues (contextual or discrete) are not extinguished. When presented during relapse, the cues elicit increased lever pressing based on the prior drug association formed during self-administration.</p>
<p>Recent studies have suggested that glutamatergic projections from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) are necessary for the expression of opioid withdrawal signs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and cue-induced relapse after abstinence but not extinction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is an important node involved in cue-driven reward-seeking behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Multiple factors including synaptic plasticity contribute to changes in behavior over time. For example, increased synaptic strength in projections from the PVT to D2R-expressing NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs) contributes to naloxone-induced withdrawal behaviors following morphine administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, which are evident in the first few days of abstinence and then dissipate. In addition, increased synaptic strength in projections from the PVT to D1R-expressing NAc MSNs is associated with relapse to heroin-seeking after 14 days of abstinence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Although it is clear that changes in glutamatergic inputs onto MSNs may contribute to opioid withdrawal and reinstatement of drug-seeking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, the relationships between NAcSh MSN circuitry functions, length of abstinence from oxycodone self-administration, level of drug-seeking, and sex specificity remain unclear.</p>
<p>Our goal here was to test the hypothesis that increased synaptic strength in PVT-NAcSh projections may be necessary for cue-induced relapse and drug-seeking. Additionally, we aimed to determine if there are sex-specific differences in either cue-induced relapse or PVT-NAcSh synaptic transmission after either 1 (acute) or 14 (prolonged) days of forced abstinence. Finally, in this study we also tested the hypothesis that increased synaptic strength in PVT-NAcSh projections may be necessary for cue-induced relapse and drug-seeking. Our results demonstrate that sex-specific enhancement in cue-induced relapse emerges after prolonged abstinence and not during acute abstinence from oxycodone self-administration. Although, males and females have an increase in cue-induced relapse after prolonged abstinence, females exhibited a greater relapse rate compared to males. Additionally, both males and females had similar increases in PVT-NAcSh synaptic strength after prolonged abstinence. However, PVT-NAcSh synaptic strength was not altered after acute abstinence compared to saline controls. Thus, we found a time-dependent increase in synaptic strength in PVT-NAcSh projections and a sex-specific effect of prolonged abstinence on cue-induced relapse rates after oxycodone self-administration in rats, whereas synaptic enhancements in PVT-NAcSh projections after prolonged abstinence were not sex-specific.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Adult male (250-275g; Total N = 42) and female (200-225g; Total N = 45) Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA) were used in this study. Upon arrival, rats were group housed (4 rats per cage) and were habituated for 1 week to the animal colony kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on 7:00AM) with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Following surgeries, rats were singly-housed for the rest of the experiment. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Mclean Hospital and the National Institutes of Health for the care and use of laboratory animals’ guidelines were followed.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Surgeries</title>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>Stereotaxic surgery and viral injections</title>
<p>All surgeries were performed according to AAALAC guidelines. Rats were first anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (80 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg, respectively,I.P.). A craniotomy was made to target the PVT using the following stereotaxic coordinates, based on Paxinos and Watson 6th edition rat brain atlas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>: AP: -2.6mm from Bregma, ML: +2.0mm from Bregma (20° angle ML), and DV: -6.3mm from skull surface at injection site. A total of 1μL of the AAV5 vector carrying CaMKIIα-ChR2(H143R)-eYFP was injected unilaterally into PVT at a rate of 125 nl/min using a 10μl Hamilton syringe with a 29-gauge needle under the control of a micro-syringe pump (Harvard Instruments). Viral vectors (titers, ∼10.0 x 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> particles/ml) were purchased from the University of North Carolina viral vector facility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b2">
<title>Intravenous catheter implantation surgery</title>
<p>After recovery from stereotaxic surgery (∼7 days), rats were implanted with indwelling silastic intravenous jugular catheters (SAI infusions; RSB-SA-7.5CF and RSB-SA-7.5CM), as described in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Rats were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (80 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg, respectively, I.P.), and catheters were implanted into the right jugular vein, secured to the vein with non-absorbable suture thread and passed subcutaneously through the rat’s back. All rats received an injection of ketofen (5mg/kg; S.C.) and gentamicin (0.1ml; 10mg/ml, I.V.) during catheter implantation. Catheters were flushed daily with 0.2ml of heparinized saline (30 units/ml; I.V.) and once a week with 0.2ml of gentamicin (10 mg/ml I.V.). Catheter patency was checked once per week using methoexital (Brevital; 0.1 ml females; 0.2 males of 10 mg/ml I.V.).</p>

<title>Oxycodone self-administration</title>
<p>Med Associates operant conditioning chambers (30.5 (<italic>l</italic>) × 24.1 (<italic>w</italic>) × 29.2 (<italic>h</italic>) cm), kept within soundproofed outer chambers with ventilation fans, were equipped with two retractable levers, each with a cue light above them, a house light, a counterbalance swivel and tether, and an infusion pump. Rats (males: n = 15 saline, 27 oxycodone; females: n= 22, saline, 23 oxycodone) underwent 8 days of short access (ShA) oxycodone self-administration training (0.06mg/kg/infusion; 1h/day) followed by 14 days of long access (LgA) regimen (0.06 mg/kg/infusion; 6h/day), similar to Mavrikaki et al 2019). Self-administration sessions were run 7 days/week, at approximately 9:00 am each day. All self-administration was conducted during the light phase of a 12:12 light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00am; lights off at 7:00pm). A fixed-ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement was used such that a press on the active lever resulted in a 4-s oxycodone infusion (100 µl) followed by a 6-s time out period where a press on the active lever produced no consequences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c2">
<title>Assessing oxycodone dependence</title>
<p>To demonstrate that our oxycodone self-administration protocol induced dependence in both male and female rats, we measured spontaneous somatic withdrawal signs 24-h after the last oxycodone self-administration session. After removal from self-administration chambers and catheter flushing, rats were placed back in their home cages and brought to a quiet, temperature-maintained (20°C) room and allowed to habituate for ∼15-min. Rats were then individually placed into clear, 65-cm-high by 25-cm-diameter Plexiglas cylinders that contained a small amount of bedding. Rats were allowed to habituate to the cylinders for ∼15 min. At this point, a digital video system (Swann Communications, Sante Fe, CA) was used to record the rats in the cylinders for 20 minutes. Upon completion of recording, somatic withdrawal behaviors were scored for the first 15 min of the recording by a researcher who was unaware of the treatments. Every 15 seconds, the following behaviors were marked as either present or absent: diarrhea, ptosis, jumping, walking, rearing, digging, flat posture, “wet dog shakes,” grooming and teeth chattering <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The number of occurrences of each behavior was summed. In addition, a Total Withdrawal Score was calculated by summing weighted frequencies of those behaviors most commonly and specifically observed in opioid withdrawal: Total Withdrawal = Grooming (x1.0) + Wet Dog Shakes (x1.5) + Ptosis (x1.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Wet Dog Shakes and Ptosis were multiplied by previously determined weighting factors to account for their high importance, but low prevalence, to withdrawal signs.</p>

<p>The number of active and inactive lever presses were recorded during incubation/ cue-induced oxycodone-seeking testing following acute and prolonged abstinence periods. Active lever presses were compared between saline and oxycodone groups for cue-induced oxycodone-seeking. Rat brains were extracted thirty minutes to one hour after cue-induced oxycodone-seeking, and electrophysiological recordings of MSNs of the NAcSh were conducted from brain slices containing the PVT and NAcSh.</p>

<title>Ex-vivo electrophysiology and optogenetic stimulation</title>
<p>Coronal slices (300 µm in thickness) containing the NAc were obtained using a vibratome in cold cutting solution containing the following in mM: 252.0 sucrose, 1.0 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26.0 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 10.0 glucose and equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices were then incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the following in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.0 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26.0 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 10.0 glucose at room temperature for at least 1 hr before recordings started. Whole-cell recordings were obtained from the NAcSh neurons with patch electrodes (3-5 MΩ resistance) containing the following in mM: 135.0 Cs-methane-sulfonate, 5.0 NaCl, 1.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10.0 BAPTA, 10.0 HEPES, 2.0 ATP and 0.20 GTP adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH.

<p>To assess whether our LgA oxycodone self-administration protocol produced similar levels of dependence in male and female rats, we measured spontaneous somatic withdrawal 1 day after the last LgA oxycodone SA session in female (n = 7 saline, 7 oxycodone) and male (n = 5 saline, 10 oxycodone) rats. Since opioid dependence is characterized by somatic withdrawal signs upon withdrawal, we predicted an increase in somatic withdrawal signs in both sexes.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological characterization of PVT-NAcSh projections</title>
<p>To test whether PVT-arising inputs to NAcSh contribute to cue-induced relapse and drug-seeking, we targeted PVT-NAcSh projections optogenetically by expressing ChR2 in the PVT via stereotaxic injections of AAV5-CaMKIIα-ChR2-eYFP viral construct in rats from all experimental groups. 7-8 weeks after viral transfection, eYFP-tagged ChR2 was expressed at the injection site (PVT) and ChR2-eYFP-expressing PVT-arising projections were found in the NAcSh (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), we confirmed that PVT projections form functional synapses on the NAcSh neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Photostimulation-induced (470 nm. 5 ms-long pulses of blue light) excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded under voltage clamp recording conditions at a holding potential of –70 mV. EPSCs at the PVT-NAcSh synapses are glutamatergic, as demonstrated by their sensitivity to NBQX (10µM), an AMPA/Kainate receptor antagonist, and D-AP5, an NMDA receptor antagonist (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>).

<p>In analogously designed experiments, we assayed the effects of prolonged abstinence on synaptic transmission in PVT-NAcSh projections. As above, input-output curves for PVT-NAcSh EPSCs were obtained by recording photostimulation-induced EPSCs in MSNs at a holding potential of –80 mV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) (male saline group: 5 rats, 16 cells; male oxycodone group: 7 rats, 20 cells; female saline group: 7 rats; 21 cells; female oxycodone group: 5 rats, 21 cells).

Thus, the observed synaptic potentiation in PVT-NAcSh projections after longer abstinence periods was at least in part due to increased glutamate release probability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the efficiency of feed-forward inhibition in the studied pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) was unaffected in both male and female rats following prolonged abstinence from oxycodone self-administration as we did not observe differences in synaptic input-output curves for light-induced IPSCs between the experimental groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). As excitatory synaptic transmission was strengthened in PVT-NAcSh projections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), the lack of changes in PVT-driven GABAergic inputs to MSNs indicates that the balance between excitation and inhibition in this pathway was shifted towards a greater functional efficiency of excitation, thus possibly facilitating the synaptically-triggered output of MSNs to other components of the relapse circuitry and contributing to the observed behavioral effects in our study.</p>

Thus, synaptic potentiation in PVT-NAcSh projections, observed after 14-days abstinence (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), was unlikely due to increased GluR1 trafficking at studied synapses.</p>
<p>Consistent with the latter notion, the AMPAR/NMDAR EPSC amplitude ratio was not affected by acute abstinence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>: Two-way ANOVA: no effect of sex: F<sub>(1,76)</sub> = 0.06, p = 0.8; no effect of treatment: F<sub>(1,76)</sub> = 0.008, p = 0.9; n = male saline: 5 rats, 14 cells; male oxycodone: 8 rats, 24 cells; female saline: 7 rats, 24 cells; female oxycodone: 6 rats, 18 cells). The AMPAR/NMDAR EPSC ratio was assessed by measuring the amplitude of the NMDAR-mediated EPSC at a holding potential of +40mV, 40ms after the peak of AMPAR-mediated EPSC at -70mV. Similarly, the AMPAR/NMDAR EPSC amplitude ratio was also unaffected after prolonged (14-days) abstinence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>: Two-way ANOVA: no effect of sex: F<sub>(1,45)</sub> = 0.4, p = 0.5; no effect of treatment: F<sub>(1,45)</sub> = 0.3, p = 0.6; (n = male saline: 5 rats, 12 cells; male oxycodone: 5 rats, 12 cells; female saline: 5 rats, 15 cells; female oxycodone: 5 rats, 15 cells), suggesting that acute or prolonged abstinence from oxycodone self-administration might have no detectable postsynaptic effects in PVT-NAcSh projections.</p>

<p>Notably, acute abstinence from oxycodone self-administration does not affect intrinsic excitability in males (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>: Two-way ANOVA: F<sub>(1,320)</sub> = 0.2, p = 0.7) or females (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>: Two-way ANOVA: F<sub>(1,192)</sub> = 2.8, p = 0.1).

Thus, acting in concert with synaptic enhancements in the PVT to NAcSh projections (shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), the observed increases in MSN’s excitability could facilitate the signal flow in PVT-NAcSh circuits after prolonged abstinence, possibly contributing to the enhanced drug-seeking.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated sex differences in withdrawal symptoms, cue-induced oxycodone-seeking (relapse), and changes in PVT-NAcSh synaptic transmission following short and long periods of abstinence from oxycodone self-administration. Our results indicate that acute abstinence increased withdrawal symptoms and cue-induced oxycodone-seeking without affecting PVT-NAcSh glutamatergic transmission, and no significant sex differences were observed. In contrast, prolonged abstinence increased cue-induced oxycodone-seeking and the efficacy of synaptic transmission in PVT-NAcSh projections in both male and female rats, with a stronger effect on cue-induced oxycodone-seeking in females.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Oxycodone self-administration is similar between male and female rats</title>
<p>Escalation of drug taking in rats is defined as an increase in the amount and frequency of drug intake over time during self-administration protocols. It is used as a model of addiction, specifically to study tolerance to drugs taken and dependence on them. Our findings revealed that escalation of intravenous oxycodone self-administration under long access conditions was similar between female and male rats, indicating that sex does not significantly affect the development of oxycodone addiction using this protocol of self-administration. This is consistent with our previous observations when long-access self-administration was used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. However, it contrasts with other studies that have found that female rats orally self-administered more oxycodone than males in short access (1-hr) FR-1 schedule self-administration paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, whereas other studies from our lab have shown that males intravenously self-administered more oxycodone compared to females in the first three trials of an FR-1 schedule of reinforcement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. These results suggest that specific behavioral measurements and routes of administration may reveal differences in the development and maintenance of oxycodone use in male and female subjects.</p>

<title>Increased spontaneous withdrawal symptoms after acute abstinence in males and females</title>
<p>Spontaneous withdrawal symptoms from opioids use refer to the symptoms that occur when an individual who has been taking opioids regularly suddenly stops using them or reduces their dose. These symptoms occur as a result of the body’s physical dependence on the drug.</p>
<p>Here we found that both male and female rats exhibited increased spontaneous withdrawal signs after acute abstinence from oxycodone self-administration. These findings are consistent with the results of previous experiments with non-contingent morphine administration, which showed a similar increase in withdrawal symptoms after 1-day of abstinence in both males and females, with males showing a stronger effect <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, we did not find a significant difference in the magnitude of spontaneous withdrawal signs between sexes following oxycodone self-administration in rats, highlighting the importance of considering the drug’s mechanism of action and administration routes when assessing its potential to affect males and females differently.</p>

<title>Sex differences in cue-induced oxycodone-seeking after prolonged abstinence</title>
<p>In rats, abstinence periods from drug use have been shown to lead to the development of drug-seeking behaviors, which can intensify over time and lead to relapse. It has been shown that the longer abstinence periods result in a greater intensity of drug-seeking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. During this period, there are changes in the brain that can lead to the development of drug cravings, including alterations in synaptic function and changes in the expression of neurotransmitters and their receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition, a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> found that male rats that underwent a longer abstinence period (30 days) following oxycodone self-administration showed significantly higher levels of drug-seeking behavior compared to rats that underwent a shorter abstinence period (1-day). This suggests that the incubation of oxycodone craving occurs in a time-dependent manner, with longer abstinence periods leading to increased drug-seeking behavior. Here we found that females but not males have an increased in cue-induced oxycodone-seeking after prolonged abstinence (14-days) compared to acute (1-day) abstinence. Females also exhibited increased drug-seeking during the prolonged abstinence period compared to males. This suggests that cue-induced cravings for oxycodone may develop faster and they are stronger in females compared to males.</p>

<title>PVT-NAcSh synaptic strength increases after prolonged abstinence in both male and female rats</title>
<p>Furthermore, we investigated the effects of abstinence on glutamatergic synaptic transmission in PVT-NAcSh projections. Both the PVT and the NAc are highly heterogeneous nuclei with distinctive anatomical subregions (anterior/posterior PVT; core/shell NAc) that contain different types of cells (Type I and Type II in the PVT; dopamine receptor 1 (D1)- and dopamine receptor 2 (D2)-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs; D1-MSN or D2-MSN) in the NAc). Recent studies have highlighted the role of the PVT in modulating reward-seeking behaviors, particularly in response to drugs of abuse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Several studies have shown that the PVT is involved in retrieving and consolidating drug-associated memories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. For example, one study found that optogenetic activation of PVT inputs to the NAc was sufficient to reinstate drug-seeking behavior in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Another study showed that silencing PVT neurons during the retrieval of opiate-associated memories impaired the expression of drug-seeking behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. The PVT has also been implicated in the regulation of drug-seeking behavior more broadly. For example, transient inactivation of the posterior PVT can block cocaine-seeking behavior in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, which seems to be dependent on the type of reinstatement model and individual differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Additionally, the PVT has been shown to play a key role in cue-induced drug-seeking after abstinence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, suggesting that it serves an important function in the neural circuitry underlying relapse.</p>
<p>Here, we found that acute abstinence from oxycodone self-administration did not appear to affect neurotransmission in the PVT-NAcSh projections, as assessed by the EPSC amplitude input-output curves and paired-pulse ratio. Furthermore, the rectification index for the AMPAR-mediated EPSCs and AMPAR/NMDAR EPSC amplitude ratio at the PVT-NAcSh synapses were not significantly different between treatment groups or sexes, indicating that subunit composition of postsynaptic AMPA receptors or their sensitivity to glutamate were not affected by acute abstinence from oxycodone self-administration. These results suggest that a brief period of abstinence may not be sufficient to induce significant changes in synaptic properties of the PVT-NAcSh circuit.</p>
<p>In contrast, prolonged abstinence from oxycodone self-administration resulted in significant changes in glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the PVT-NAcSh circuits, as measured by EPSC input-output curves and paired-pulse ratio. Specifically, prolonged abstinence resulted in an increase in EPSC amplitude and a decrease in the paired-pulse ratio, suggesting that there is an increase in the probability of neurotransmitter release and/or alterations in presynaptic release mechanisms in the studied pathway. However, prolonged abstinence did not change the rectification index of the EPSCs or the AMPAR/NMDAR EPSC amplitude ratio, indicating that there is no change in the subunit composition of AMPA receptors at the PVT-NAcSh glutamatergic synapses. These results suggest that long-term abstinence from oxycodone self-administration is associated with significant changes in synaptic properties of the PVT-NAcSh circuit—presynaptically-expressed synaptic potentiation, specifically— potentially contributing to the persistent changes in reward processing and relapse vulnerability that are often observed in individuals with opioid use disorder.</p>

<title>NAcSh MSN intrinsic excitability increases after prolonged abstinence in male and female rats</title>
<p>The NAc plays an important role in regulating motivated behaviors such as reward-seeking and cravings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Within the NAc, MSN intrinsic excitability regulates NAc responses to afferent inputs and controls the NAc outputs to other components of reward system in the brain. In our study, we investigated changes in NAcSh MSN intrinsic excitability following acute or prolonged abstinence from oxycodone self-administration.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that while acute abstinence does not significantly alter NAcSh MSN intrinsic excitability, prolonged abstinence heightened excitability in both males and females.</p>
<p>This is consistent with our PVT-NAcSh increase in synaptic strength data. One goal of this study was to look at the interplay between PVT-NAcSh glutamatergic transmission and NAcSh MSN changes in intrinsic excitability after acute or prolonged abstinence. While the standing theory is that MSN excitability decreases to compensate for an increase in glutamatergic input (in males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, our results suggest that prolonged abstinence may lead to compensatory neuroadaptations that enhance intrinsic excitability, potentially acting in concert with the increases in synaptic strength observed at inputs from the PVT, thus potentially facilitating the signal flow in the PVT-NAcSh circuits and modifying the output of MSNs to the downstream targets, thus contributing to relapse mechanisms.</p>
<sec id="s4e1">
<title>Implications of anatomical and functional distinctions in PVT-NAcSh circuits for relapse</title>
<p>Our study was designed to target posterior PVT-NAcSh projections, based on previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. The anterior/posterior PVT have been shown to have different subcortical targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> and increasing evidence demonstrates substantial functional differences in anterior vs posterior PVT outputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Posterior projections to the NAc are selectively tuned to aversive stimuli, while the anterior PVT is more involved in reward-seeking behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our goal was to determine the overall effects of acute versus prolonged abstinence on synaptic and neuronal properties in PVT-NAcSh circuits in male and female rats, as opposed to differentiating between the contributions of D1 and D2 receptor-expressing MSNs. However, recent studies demonstrated differences in the roles of PVT-to-D1 and PVT-to-D2 MSN projections in mediating drug-seeking or withdrawal after either acute or prolonged abstinence from opioid self-administration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Thus, it would it be interesting to explore the effects of our oxycodone administration regiments on neurotransmission in PVT projections to D1- or D2-MSNs selectively in future studies, performing <italic>ex vivo</italic> optogenetic studies analogous to those described in the present work.</p>
<p>In addition, stimulation of PVT terminals in the NAcSh can increase opioid-seeking before but not after extinction of drug availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Given the complex and heterogeneous functions of PVT-NAc projections and their targets, conclusions about the role of these circuits cannot be generalized across studies that differ in anatomical-, projection-, cell type-, or molecular-specific targeting of the PVT-NAc pathway. Together, these studies suggest that the anatomical distinction of the PVT and its inputs to the NAcSh D1 or D2 MSNs play a key role in mediating behaviors that lead to relapse during acute abstinence (primarily through negative affective states driven by the D2 pathway) or prolonged abstinence (through incubation of craving driven by the D1 pathway).</p>
<p>Overall, our findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying oxycodone relapse and indicate potential sex-specific differences in the long-term effects of abstinence on cue-induced oxycodone-seeking behaviors. Future studies may focus on differentiating the roles of anterior and posterior PVT innervation to D1 and D2 MSNs in the NAcSh and how manipulating these specific projections influences relapse behaviors based on abstinence duration and type of relapse (drug-, cue-, or stress-induced). Moreover, the differential contributions and interactions between cortical and thalamic projections into ventral striatal regions in abstinence and relapse remain an open direction of investigation.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>valuable</bold> evidence of sex differences in oxycodone relapse-related behavior in rats and provides insight into associated synaptic plasticity in the paraventricular thalamus to the nucleus accumbens shell (PVT-NAcSh) circuit. The report reveals that females show heightened cue-induced oxycodone seeking compared to males after 14 days – but not 1 day – of abstinence; however, an increase in synaptic strength from the PVT inputs to the NAcSh was observed in both males and females at 14 days of abstinence. Therefore, whereas the behavioral data and much of the electrophysiology data are <bold>solid</bold>, the link between them is <bold>incomplete</bold>. Further investigation of the functional role of the PVT-NAcSh pathway in the observed sex differences in oxycodone relapse and examination of input and cell-type specificity of synaptic alterations would greatly strengthen this study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Alonso-Caraballo et al, is a novel piece of work that examines the impact of oxycodone self-administration on neural plasticity within the paraventricular thalamic (PVT) to nucleus accumbens shell (Shell) pathway - two regions shown to play a key role in cue-induced drug seeking on their own, and whether this plasticity varies based on abstinence period and biological sex.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors show using a clinically relevant long-access model of opioid self-administration promotes dependence and acute withdrawal in both male and female rats. During subsequent cue-induced relapse tests at 1 or 14 days following the conclusion of self-administration, data show that while both males and females demonstrate drug-seeking behavior at both time points, females show a further elevation in responding on day 14 versus day 1 which is not observed in the males. When accounting for past work showing elevations in drug-seeking in males after 30 days, these data indicate that craving-induced relapse for opioids may develop faster and may be more pronounced in females compared to males.</p>
<p>These behavioral findings were paralleled by the use of ex vivo acute slice electrophysiology and circuit-specific ex vivo optogenetics to examine the impact of oxycodone self-administration on synaptic strength within the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) pathway(s). Data support a time-dependent but sex-independent strengthening of glutamatergic signaling at PVT-to-NAcSh medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that is only present following a relapse test at 14 days post abstinence in males versus females, providing the first evidence that opioid self-administration and/or cue-induced drug-seeking augments this pathway. Using an extensive set of physiological measures, the authors show that this increased synaptic strength reflects an upregulation of presynaptic release probability. Further, this upregulation of excitatory signaling aligned temporally with an increase in MSN excitability, as assessed by increases in action potential firing frequency. Finally, the authors provide the first evidence that similar to other inputs to the NAcSh, PVT projections innervate both MSN as well as local interneurons, promoting a GABA-A-specific feedforward inhibitory circuit. Interestingly, unlike direct excitatory inputs to MSNs, no changes were observed ostensibly within this feedforward circuit, highlighting a selective enhancement of excitatory drive and output of MSNs with protracted abstinence.</p>
<p>Overall, these data highlight a potential role for heightened synaptic strength within the PVT-NAcSh pathway in cue-induced relapse behavior during protracted abstinence and identify a potential therapeutic target during abstinence to reduce relapse risk in abstaining individuals.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the experimental approach and data provided appear rigorous and support their overall conclusions and achieve their goal of understanding how opioid self-administration impacts synaptic strength within the PVT-NAcSh pathway. Although not undermining these data, there are a few potential weaknesses that reduce the impact of the work. For example, the inability to directly assess whether cue-induced drug-seeking is in fact augmented compared to daily intake during self-administration in the maintenance face only permits the authors to denote that reexposure to cues and the context is sufficient to promote active lever pressing without demonstrating whether seeking behavior is in fact elevated further during a cue test. This is notably understandable as drug available sessions were 6-hours versus a 1-hour relapse test. Importantly, it is clearly demonstrated that drug seeking is higher on average in female mice after 14 days versus 1 day.</p>
<p>With regard to the interpretation of electrophysiology findings, the lack of inclusion of an abstinence-only group does not permit interpretations to parse out whether observed increases in synaptic strength (or the lack of) reflect abstinence or an interaction between abstinence period and re-exposure to the operant chamber, as slices were taken 30-45 min post relapse test. While much literature has shown that drug-induced adaptations in the NAc require a post-drug period for plasticity to measurably emerge, studies have also shown that re-exposure to heroin-associated cues following abstinence seemingly &quot;reverses&quot; increases in cell excitability in prelimbic-NAc pyramidal neurons (Kokane et al., 2023) and that depotentiation of morphine-induced increases in synaptic strength in the NAc shell can be depotentiated by drug re-exposure - an effect also observed with cocaine re-exposure (Madayag et al., 2019). Notably, the lack of effect at 14 but not 1 day supports the likelihood that the relapse test does not in fact influence the plasticity within the PVT-NAcSh circuit.</p>
<p>While the lack of effect on AMPAR:NMDAR ratio and rectification indices do support the notion that enhanced EPSC amplitudes in input-output curves do not reflect a change in AMPAR subunit expression (i.e., increased GluA2-lacking receptors that exhibit inward rectification at depolarized potential) nor a change in postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate, without direct assessment of AMPAR-specific and NMDAR-specific input-output curves, it doesn't definitively exclude the possibility that both AMPA and NMDA receptor currents are being upregulated, thus negating an observable change in postsynaptic strength.</p>
<p>Overall, these findings provide novel insight into how the PVT-NAcSh pathway is altered by opioid self-administration and whether this is unique based on abstinence period and sex. Importantly, these were the primary objectives stated by the author. Data highlight a potential role for the observed adaptations in relapse behavior and identify a potential therapeutic target during abstinence to reduce relapse risk in abstaining individuals. However, it should be noted that no causal link is demonstrated without experiments to reduce/prevent relapse.</p>

<p>This is an interesting paper from Alonso-Caraballo and colleagues that examines the influence of opioid use, abstinence, and sex on paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) medium spiny neurons circuit physiology. The authors first find that prolonged abstinence from extended access to oxycodone self-administration leads to profoundly increased cue-induced reinstatement in females. Next, they found that prolonged abstinence increased PVT-NAcSh MSN synaptic strength, an effect that was likely due to presynaptic adaptation (paired-pulse ratio was decreased in both sexes).</p>
<p>While this paper is certainly interesting, and well-written, and the experiments seem to be well performed, the behavioral and physiological effects observed are somewhat divorced. Specifically, what accounts for the heightened relapse in females? Since no opioid-related sex differences were observed in PVT-NAcSh neurophysiology, it is unclear how the behavioral and neurophysiological data fit together. Furthermore, the lack of functional manipulation of PVT-NAcSh circuitry leaves one to wonder if this circuit is even important for the behavior that the authors are measuring. I would be more positive about this study if the authors were able to resolve either of the two issues noted above.</p>
<p>I also noted more moderate weaknesses that the authors should consider:</p>
<p>(1) There are insufficient animals in some cases. For example, in Figure 4, the Male Saline 14-day abstinence group (n = 3 rats) has less than half of the excitability as compared to the Male Saline 1-day abstinence group (n = 7 rats). This is likely due to variance between animals and, possibly, oversampling. Thus, more rats need to be added to the 14-day abstinence group. Additionally, the range of n neurons/rat should be reported for each experiment to ensure readers that oversampling from single animals is not occurring.</p>
<p>(2) The IPSC data, for example in Figure 4, is one of the more novel experiments in the manuscript. However, it is quite challenging to see the difference between males and females, saline and oxycodone, at low stimulation intensities within the graph. Authors should expand this so that reviewers/readers can see those data, especially considering other work suggesting that PVT synaptic input onto select NAc interneurons is disrupted following opioid self-administration. Additional comment: It's also interesting that the IPSC amplitude seems to be maximal at ~2mW of light, whereas ~11 mW is required to evoke maximal EPSC amplitude. It would be interesting to know the authors' thoughts on why this may be.</p>
<p>(3) There is an inadequate description of what has been done to date on the PVT-NAc projection regarding opioid withdrawal, seeking, disinhibition, and the effects on synaptic physiology therein. For example, a critical paper, Keyes et al., 2020 Neuron, is not cited. Additionally, Paniccia et al., 2024 Neuron is inaccurately cited and insufficiently described. Both manuscripts should be described in some detail within the introduction, and the findings should be accurately contextualized within the broader circuit within the discussion.</p>
<p>(4) Related to the above, the authors should provide a more comprehensive description of how PVT synapses onto cell-type specific neurons in the NAc which expands beyond MSNs, especially considering that PVT has been shown to influence drug/opioid seeking through the innervation of NAc neurons that are not MSNs. For example, see PMIDs 33947849, 36369508, 28973852, 38141605.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Alonso-Caraballo et al. investigate sex-specific differences in oxycodone self-administration, withdrawal, and relapse behaviors in rats, as well as associated synaptic plasticity in the paraventricular thalamus to nucleus accumbens shell (PVT-NAcSh) circuit. The authors employ a combination of behavioral paradigms and ex vivo electrophysiology to examine how acute (1-day) and prolonged (14-day) abstinence from oxycodone self-administration affect cue-induced drug-seeking and synaptic transmission in male and female rats. Their findings reveal that while both sexes show similar oxycodone self-administration and acute withdrawal symptoms, females exhibit enhanced cue-induced relapse after prolonged abstinence. Furthermore, they show that prolonged abstinence is associated with increased synaptic strength in the PVT-NAcSh circuit (reduced paired-pulse ratio) and enhanced intrinsic excitability of NAcSh medium spiny neurons in both sexes. This study provides important insights into the sex-specific neural adaptations that may underlie vulnerability to opioid relapse and highlights the PVT-NAcSh circuit as a potential target for therapeutic interventions. However, although this study is well designed, no sex differences were observed in the synaptic activity within this pathway that could explain increased oxycodone seeking in females versus male rats. Additional experiments could strengthen the results and help clarify synaptic mechanisms underpinning behavioral sex differences.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study exhibits several strengths. It provides a comprehensive behavioral analysis of oxycodone self-administration, withdrawal, and cue-induced relapse in both male and female rats at different time points (acute vs. protracted withdrawal) offering valuable insights into sex-specific differences (i.e., increased oxycodone seeking in females over time but not males). The authors examine synaptic plasticity in the PVT-NAcSh circuit at different abstinence time points, integrating behavioral and electrophysiological data to link circuit adaptations with relapse behaviors, although no sex differences in the electrophysiological parameters examined were evident. The investigation of intrinsic excitability changes in NAcSh medium spiny neurons further enhances the study's depth. Overall, the well-designed experiments provide important insights into the neural adaptations that may underlie vulnerability to opioid relapse, highlighting the PVT-NAcSh circuit as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in opioid use disorder.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite its strengths, the study has several notable limitations. A key weakness is the lack of observed sex differences in synaptic activity within the PVT-NAcSh pathway that could explain the behavioral results. The authors' failure to differentiate between D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens represents a missed opportunity to identify potential sex-specific differences at the cellular level, although they do discuss reasons for this omission. The only significant synaptic change observed - reduced paired-pulse ratio indicating increased synaptic strength - occurs in both males and females, failing to explain the sex-specific behavioral differences. Furthermore, the investigation of intrinsic excitability in NAc MSNs adds complexity to data interpretation, as the authors neither differentiate between D1 and D2 MSNs nor confirm that recorded neurons receive direct inputs from the PVT. This assumption potentially confounds the results. Overall, while the study provides valuable insights, additional experiments targeting specific cell populations and more detailed synaptic analyses are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed behavioral sex differences in opioid relapse vulnerability.</p>
