<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are mesenchymal cells in the liver that are critical for normal liver physiology and injury response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In their normal state within the liver, HSCs are quiescent and help maintain liver structure, regulate extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, and store vitamin A. However, in response to liver injury, HSCs transition to an activated state through myofibroblast transdifferentiation. This activation triggers HSC proliferation and increased ECM secretion, resulting in scar formation at the injury site(s) and the production of cytokines and growth factors that promote the proliferation of other liver cell types. Prolonged HSC activation can lead to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Identifying mechanisms that impact HSC development can offer valuable insights into pathways involved in liver development, pathophysiology, and regeneration.</p>
<p>We and others previously identified <italic>podocalyxin-like</italic> (<italic>podxl</italic>) as a gene whose expression is highly enriched in adult HSCs in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In humans, <italic>PODXL</italic> belongs to the CD34 gene family that is comprised of <italic>PODXL, CD34</italic>, and <italic>ENDOGLYCAN</italic> (<italic>PODXL2</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). It is a transmembrane protein recognized for its role in enhancing cell proliferation, invasion, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). <italic>Podxl</italic> null mice demonstrate severe defects in renal development accompanied by 100% perinatal mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), and morpholino knockdown of <italic>podxl</italic> in zebrafish leads to disruption of the characteristic kidney podocyte architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), supporting a conserved role for <italic>podxl</italic> in kidney development. However, the role of <italic>podxl</italic> in liver development has not been explored.</p>
<p>In the present study, we sought to define the role of <italic>podxl</italic> in zebrafish liver development using a combination of genetic approaches. This manuscript is based in part upon A.N.R.’s dissertation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). We found that <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown using CRISPR/Cas9 or an ATG morpholino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) resulted in a significant decrease in HSCs at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf). In contrast, <italic>podxl</italic> deletion mutants showed either no significant change in HSC number (three mutants) or a significant increase in HSC number (two mutants). <italic>Podxl</italic> mutants injected with <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown, unlike wildtype control siblings, did not show a decrease in HSC number, supporting the hypothesis that decreased HSC number in <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPants is due to disruption of the <italic>podxl</italic> gene rather than to non-specific or off-target effects. Quantitative PCR analysis of <italic>podxl</italic> transcripts in adult mutant livers revealed mRNA and pre-mRNA levels similar to those of wildtype control siblings. CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown of the only other zebrafish <italic>podxl</italic> family member, <italic>endoglycan (endo),</italic> did not affect HSC number in wildtype zebrafish or <italic>podxl</italic> mutants. qPCR of <italic>endoglycan</italic> show similar expression levels between <italic>podxl</italic> mutants and wildtype control siblings. RNA sequencing of <italic>podxl</italic> mutants and wildtype control siblings showed no significant change in transcript levels of genes with sequence similarity to <italic>podxl</italic>, but it demonstrated upregulation of a complex network of ECM-related genes in response to <italic>podxl</italic> loss. Together, these data support a role for <italic>podxl</italic> in zebrafish HSC development and suggest that multiple genes are upregulated to compensate for genomic <italic>podxl</italic> loss.</p>

<title>Knockdown of <italic>podxl</italic> in zebrafish results in fewer HSCs</title>
<p>As a first step to explore the role of <italic>podxl</italic> in zebrafish liver development, we knocked down <italic>podxl</italic> using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, injecting Cas9 protein and guide RNA targeting the first exon of <italic>podxl</italic> (sgRNA #1, S1 Table) into single-cell embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Knocking down genes in this manner using CRISPR/Cas9 (“CRISPant” larvae) typically results in mosaic animals with diverse indel mutations; mutagenesis rates of 75-99% have been reported in CRISPants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), but some cells will have monoallelic and/or in-frame mutations that may not affect gene function. To visualize HSCs, we performed the knockdown in <italic>Tg(wt1b:eGFP)</italic> transgenic zebrafish that express eGFP in HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). As a control, we knocked down tyrosinase (<italic>tyr</italic>) in age-matched siblings. The <italic>tyr</italic> gene encodes an important enzyme in the melanin production pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), and <italic>tyr</italic> knockdown is not predicted to impact liver development.</p>

<p>We analyzed HSC number at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) by performing confocal microscopy and manually counting all HSCs in each liver. We found that knockdown of <italic>podxl</italic> using CRISPR/Cas9 (CRISPant larvae) decreased the number of HSCs from 63 ± 19 (mean ± standard deviation) HSCs per liver in uninjected control siblings to 44 ± 11 HSCs per liver in <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPants (31% decrease; p &lt; 0.05; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, C, D). Knockdown of <italic>tyr</italic> had no significant impact on the number of HSCs (73 ± 20 HSCs per liver; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, D). Knocking down <italic>podxl</italic> in a similar manner but targeting a different exon (exon #2, sgRNA #2, <italic>podxl</italic> KD #2) (S1 Table) decreased the number of HSCs by 30% (60 ± 20 HSCs per liver in uninjected control siblings versus 42 ± 7 HSCs per liver in <italic>podxl</italic> KD#2; p &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). Successful mutagenesis of <italic>podxl</italic> was confirmed using high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) (S1 Fig), and <italic>tyr</italic> knockdown was confirmed by identifying decreased pigmentation using brightfield microscopy (S2 Fig).</p>
<p>To determine mutagenesis efficiency in our CRISPant larvae, we examined the <italic>podxl</italic> locus in DNA extracted from larvae that were injected with <italic>podxl</italic> sgRNA #1 and from uninjected control siblings. Using fluorescein-labeled primers and capillary electrophoresis, we determined the percent of allele mutation by calculating the fraction of mutant amplicon product that did not migrate like wildtype amplicon product, suggesting insertions, substitutions, and/or deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). We found that 62% of <italic>podxl</italic> alleles in injected larvae showed mutations compared to 0% of uninjected controls (S3 Fig).</p>
<p>As a complementary approach to determine the effect of <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown on HSC development, we knocked down <italic>podxl</italic> using an ATG morpholino targeting <italic>podxl</italic> (S1 Table) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). We injected each zebrafish embryo with 4.93 ng of morpholino, as using greater than 5 ng has been reported to decrease the specificity of this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). We saw that <italic>podxl</italic> morphants had 47 ± 22 HSCs per liver, compared to 77 ± 21 HSCs per liver in siblings injected with control morpholino (56% decrease; p &lt; 0.001; S4 Fig). The finding that multiple methods of <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown produced a similar decrease in HSC number supports the hypothesis that <italic>podxl</italic> is required for normal HSC development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>The <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown phenotype is not due to a developmental delay</title>
<p>We used two approaches to test the possibility that <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown decreased HSC number by delaying development. First, as liver size increases rapidly from 3 dpf to 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), a developmental delay could significantly decrease liver size at 6 dpf. We found that liver size was not significantly impacted by <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPant knockdown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) even when HSC count was significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">

<graphic xlink:href="647300v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Second, we examined HSC number in <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPant knockdown larvae at different time points. Some genetic manipulations that decrease liver size during larval development result, at least partially, from a transient developmental delay, such that mutant liver size “catches up” to wildtype liver size after hours or days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). An example of this phenomenon is observed in <italic>wnt2bb</italic> mutant zebrafish, which have very small or absent livers at 50 hours post-fertilization; some animals developing normal functioning livers at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>As HSC numbers steadily increase from 3 to 8 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), a general developmental delay would be expected to decrease the number of HSCs at 6 dpf, rendering it similar to what is seen at earlier time points. If “catch-up” occurs, then differences in HSC number would be less pronounced at later time points. We knocked down <italic>podxl</italic> using sgRNA #1 and examined HSC number at 5 and 7 dpf in age-matched siblings. At 5 dpf we noted 67 ± 21 HSCs per liver in uninjected control larvae and 50 ± 16 HSCs per liver in <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown larvae (25% decrease; p &lt; 0.05; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). At 7 dpf we noted 78 ± 15 HSCs per liver in uninjected control larvae and 53 ± 18 HSCs per liver in <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown larvae (32% decrease; p &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>The finding that there was not a more pronounced phenotype at 5 dpf than at 7 dpf suggests that <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown does not transiently delay development. This hypothesis is further supported by our finding that 7 dpf <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown larvae still tended to have fewer HSCs than 5 dpf uninjected larvae (p = 0.0502, ANOVA). Taken together, these results argue that there is not a significant developmental delay in the <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPant larvae.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>The <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown phenotype is not specific to the <italic>Tg(wt1b:eGFP) reporter line</italic></title>
<p>The <italic>Tg(wt1b:eGFP)</italic> transgenic reporter line used to visualize HSCs in the above-mentioned experiments expresses eGFP in HSCs and a few other cell types, including kidney cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The transgenic reporter line <italic>Tg(hand2:eGFP)</italic> can also be used to visualize HSCs, along with lateral plate mesoderm and neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). To test the possibility that the effects of <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown are specific to the <italic>Tg(wt1b:eGFP)</italic> transgenic line, we knocked down <italic>podxl</italic> using <italic>podxl</italic> sgRNA #1 in <italic>Tg(hand2:eGFP)</italic> zebrafish. We found that HSC number at 6 dpf decreased from 84 ± 31 HSCs per liver in uninjected control siblings to 63 ± 26 HSCs per liver in <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPants (25% decrease; p&lt;0.05; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D-F</xref>). This result indicates that <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown decreases HSC number independently of the reporter line used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Generation of <italic>podxl</italic> mutants</title>
<p>To further understand the role of <italic>podxl</italic> in the developing zebrafish liver, we generated a series of <italic>podxl</italic> mutants, exploiting the <italic>Tg(wt1b:eGFP)</italic> reporter line to facilitate HSC visualization. Using CRISPR/Cas9 techniques, we made a mutant with a five base pair deletion, resulting in a predicted premature termination codon in the second exon (<italic>podxl <sup>Ex1,-5bpΔ</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, B and S5 Fig). We next made a mutant lacking the entire region between exon 1 and intron 7, leading to a predicted premature stop codon after 18 amino acids (<italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex1(p)_Ex7Δ</sup>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, S6 Fig and S7 Fig).</p>

</fig>
<p>Previous experiments examining genetic compensation in mutant zebrafish have shown that premature stop codons can trigger nonsense mediated decay (NMD), which produces degradation products that promote upregulation of gene(s) with similar sequence that compensate for the loss of the gene of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). This form of genetic compensation, termed transcriptional adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), requires the degradation of mutant mRNA containing a premature termination codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). To circumvent the possibility of genetic compensation induced by transcriptional adaptation, we made three additional <italic>podxl</italic> mutants. First, we made an in-frame mutant removing the region between introns 4 and 7 (<italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex5_Ex7Δ</sup>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref> and S8 Fig), corresponding to the transmembrane domain, which is critical for <italic>podxl</italic> localization and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The <italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex5_Ex7Δ</sup> mRNA lacks a premature stop codon, so it is not predicted to trigger NMD and transcriptional adaptation. We also made two <italic>podxl</italic> mutants lacking the major transcriptional start site marked by H3K4me3 in several tissues including the liver (S9 Fig): <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-</sup> <sup>194_Ex7Δ</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>, S10 Fig) and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-319_Ex1(p)Δ</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>, S11 Fig). We predicted little <italic>podxl</italic> mRNA would be transcribed in these mutants, making NMD and transcriptional adaptation unlikely.</p>

<title>Analysis of HSC number in <italic>podxl</italic> mutants</title>
<p>We analyzed HSC number in <italic>podxl</italic> mutants by incrossing <italic>podxl<sup>+/-</sup></italic>heterozygotes and examining HSC number in <italic>podxl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants and wild-type control siblings at 6 dpf. We observed no significant difference in HSC number between <italic>podxl <sup>Ex1,-5bpΔ</sup></italic> mutants (68 ± 20) and wildtype siblings (62 ± 19) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>), <italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex1(p)_Ex7Δ</sup> mutants (82 ± 12) and wildtype siblings (76 ± 21) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>), and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex5_Ex7Δ</sup> mutants (56 ± 21) and wildtype siblings (56 ± 19) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3I</xref>)</p>
<p>Conversely, in the two promoter mutants, we observed a significant increase in the number of HSCs per liver.

<title><italic>Podxl</italic> mutants are resistant to <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPant knockdown</title>
<p>The discrepant phenotypes in <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown larvae and <italic>podxl</italic> mutants raise two sets of possibilities. First, <italic>podxl</italic> is not important for HSC development, and the <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown phenotype is due to effects on another gene(s). Alternatively, <italic>podxl</italic> is important for HSC development, so acute <italic>podxl</italic> loss causes a decrease in HSCs, but other gene(s) compensate in the case of constitutive/germline <italic>podxl</italic> loss. We would expect that in the first scenario <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown would decrease HSC number even in the absence of wildtype <italic>podxl,</italic> while in the second scenario <italic>podxl</italic> mutants would be resistant to <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown.</p>
<p>We distinguished between these two possibilities by knocking down <italic>podxl</italic> in a <italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex1(p)_Ex7Δ</sup> heterozygous incross in the <italic>Tg(wt1b:eGFP)</italic> background. We chose this mutant for these experiments because it lacks the complete cut site for <italic>podxl</italic> sgRNA #1 (S12 Fig). We analyzed HSC number in <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>+/+</sup> 6-dpf larvae with and without <italic>podxl</italic> sgRNA #1 injection.</p>
<p>Consistent with our prior findings, the HSC numbers of <italic>podxl</italic><sup>+/+</sup> larvae were significantly decreased in the group injected with <italic>podxl</italic> sgRNA compared to the uninjected controls. In contrast, we found no significant change in HSC number between the <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-/-</sup> groups with and without <italic>podxl</italic> KD injection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3L</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown requires an intact <italic>podxl</italic> gene to exert its effects on HSC development.</p>

<title>Maternal deposition of <italic>podxl</italic> does not compensate for <italic>podxl</italic> loss</title>
<p>Maternal expression and mRNA deposition of certain genes is sufficient to compensate for zygotic loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). To address the possibility that maternally deposited mRNAs might compensate for <italic>podxl</italic> loss in mutants, we examined the mRNA-Seq models in the zebrafish ensemble database looking at both pre-zygotic and post-zygotic tracks. We found that <italic>podxl</italic> is not maternally expressed and expression is first detected at 75% epiboly. Additionally, we examined progeny from a <italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex1(p)_Ex7Δ</sup> mutant incross.

Homozygous mutant progeny from the <italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex1(p)_Ex7Δ</sup> mutant incross survived to adulthood and were fertile.

<title>Analysis of <italic>podxl</italic> transcript levels in <italic>podxl</italic> mutants</title>
<p>In some zebrafish mutants, transcriptional adaptation leads to upregulation of related genes, compensating for loss of the gene of interest and blunting the loss-of-function phenotype observed with transient gene knockdown adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). When transcriptional adaptation occurs, pre-mRNA levels of the gene are close to normal, but mRNA levels are low.</p>
<p>To determine if transcriptional adaptation could be happening in <italic>podxl</italic> mutants, we performed qPCR to examine <italic>podxl</italic> mRNA and pre-mRNA in <italic>podxl</italic> mutant livers alongside wildtype control siblings. We assessed three different parts of the <italic>podxl</italic> mRNA: 5’ UTR, exon 7 to exon 8, and exon 8 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Additionally, we performed a qPCR on the following sections of <italic>podxl</italic> pre-mRNA: exon 2 to intron 2, intron 2 to exon 3, and intron 7 to exon 8 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Since some mutants lacked large portions of the <italic>podxl</italic> gene, using three different primer sets for each gene insured that at least one of the sets was predicted to have intact binding sites within each <italic>podxl</italic> mutant transcript (S2 table).</p>

<p>We found that <italic>podxl</italic> mRNA levels were not significantly different in <italic>podxl <sup>Ex1,-5bpΔ</sup></italic> and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex5_Ex7Δ</sup> mutants compared to wildtype sibling controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). <italic>Podxl</italic> pre-mRNA levels were also not significantly different in these two mutants compared to controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). These data suggest that <italic>podxl <sup>Ex1,-5bpΔ</sup></italic>and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex5_Ex7Δ</sup> mutant pre-mRNA is transcribed normally and <italic>podxl <sup>Ex1,-5bpΔ</sup></italic>and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex5_Ex7Δ</sup> mutant mRNA is not unstable.

<p>The promoter mutants <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-194_Ex7Δ</sup> and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-319_Ex1(p)Δ</sup> showed very little <italic>podxl</italic> mRNA expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>), including the exon 8 region where the qPCR promoters are present in the mutants. The pre-mRNA levels of both promoter mutants were also significantly lower than those observed in wildtype control siblings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). This result supports the hypothesis that <italic>podxl</italic> transcription is reduced in <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-194_Ex7Δ</sup> and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-319_Ex1(p)Δ</sup> mutants; <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-194_Ex7Δ</sup> and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-319_Ex1(p)Δ</sup> mRNA may also be unstable.</p>
<p>Although at least two <italic>podxl</italic> mutants (<italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex1(p)_Ex7Δ</sup> and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-194_Ex7Δ</sup>) showed a significant reduction in <italic>podxl</italic> mRNA levels, at least some of this decrease might be related to decreased <italic>podxl</italic> transcription, given the decreased <italic>podxl</italic> pre-mRNA levels in <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-194_Ex7Δ</sup> and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-319_Ex1(p)Δ</sup> .

<title>A network of extracellular matrix genes is upregulated in response to <italic>podxl</italic> loss</title>

By performing GO Enrichment Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), we found that the upregulated genes were enriched for extracellular matrix, extracellular region, and peptidase activity genes (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we report that <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPant knockdown in zebrafish significantly and robustly decreases HSC number, supporting a role for <italic>podxl</italic> in zebrafish liver development. We found that the decrease in HSC number seen in <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPant zebrafish was not due to a transient developmental delay or to an artifact of the transgenic reporter line. As <italic>podxl</italic> promotes migration and proliferation in colorectal cancer and spermatogonial stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), it is possible that loss of <italic>podxl</italic> leads to decreased HSC migration into the liver and/or decreased proliferation of HSCs and/or HSC precursors.</p>
<p>We generated and characterized a series of <italic>podxl</italic> deletion mutants and found they had either no change in HSC number or a significant increase in HSC number, in sharp contrast to what we observed with acute <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown. Several lines of evidence argue that the discrepant phenotypes in <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPant knockdown zebrafish compared to <italic>podxl</italic> mutants are due to genetic compensation in <italic>podxl</italic> mutants rather than to an off-target effect of <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown. First, we noted a similar decrease in HSCs with <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown in eight independent CRISPant experiments using two different sgRNAs and performed by two different lab members. Second, <italic>podxl</italic> ATG-morpholino injection, which is expected to decrease Podxl levels by a distinct mechanism involving disruption of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), also decreased HSC number. Third, <italic>podxl</italic> mutants were resistant to <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown.</p>
<p>Genetic compensation represents a highly conserved process that enables organisms such as fly, yeast, mice, and zebrafish to maintain their fitness despite losing an important gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Three major categories of genetic compensation have been described: redundant genes, protein feedback loops, and transcriptional adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Redundant genes are expressed in the same tissues and have overlapping functions with the gene of interest, while protein feedback loops lead to the upregulation of genes in the same pathway in response to decreased protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). The finding that <italic>endo</italic> knockdown in <italic>podxl</italic> mutants did not impact HSC number argues against genetic compensation through redundant genes. The finding that HSC numbers were decreased in <italic>podxl</italic> knockdown zebrafish, which likely have decreased Podxl levels, suggests that protein feedback loops are not sufficient to compensate for <italic>podxl</italic> loss.</p>
<p>Transcriptional adaptation was first described in zebrafish, where Rossi <italic>et al.</italic> found that loss of the epidermal growth factor-like domain multiple 7 (<italic>egfl7</italic>) gene leads to severe vascular phenotypes in morphants though <italic>egfl7</italic> mutants show no apparent phenotype. Further investigation revealed that this compensation is likely due to the upregulation of members of the <italic>emilin</italic> gene family, which share significant sequence similarity with <italic>egfl7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Like Rossi <italic>et al.,</italic> we found that <italic>podxl</italic> mutants were resistant to <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPant knockdown, and three <italic>podxl</italic> mutants showed decreased mRNA levels, compatible with mRNA degradation. On the other hand, two <italic>podxl</italic> mutants showed mRNA levels that were not significantly decreased, suggesting that mRNA degradation is not necessary for genetic compensation in at least some types of <italic>podxl</italic> mutants. Additionally, while Rossi <italic>et al</italic>. found differential expression of only one gene in <italic>egfl7</italic> mutants, our RNA sequencing data showed a plethora of differentially expressed genes in <italic>podxl</italic> mutants. Thus, it seems like genetic compensation in <italic>podxl</italic> mutants occurs through a mechanism that is distinct from the transcription adaptation that occurs in <italic>egfl7</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>We observed an increase in HSC number in two <italic>podxl</italic> mutants, <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-194_Ex7Δ</sup> and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-</sup> <sup>319_Ex1(p)Δ</sup>, both of which disrupt exon 1 and the canonical promoter region of <italic>podxl</italic>. Genetic overcompensation has been reported in zebrafish with frameshift mutations in exon 1 of the BMP signaling-promoting gene <italic>marcksb</italic>: compared to wild-type control embryos, <italic>marcksb<sup>ihb199</sup></italic> embryos exhibit increased Bmp2b fluorescence and increased p-Smad1/5/9 intensity, likely due to upregulation of MARCKS-family members and MARCKS-interacting protein Hsp70.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). It is possible that disruption of the canonical promoter region in <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-194_Ex7Δ</sup>, <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-319_Ex1(p)Δ</sup>, and/or <italic>marcksb<sup>ihb199</sup></italic> mutants leads to creation of an orphan enhancer that promotes transcription of nearby compensatory genes. In the human and mouse β-globin family, competition between promoters for a common enhancer, termed the locus control region (LCR), determines the developmental order and compensatory expression of related globin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). To further investigate the possibility that an orphan enhancer mediates the increase in HSC numbers observed in <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-</sup> <sup>194_Ex7Δ</sup> and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-319_Ex1(p)Δ</sup> mutants, it would be interesting to examine the long-range chromatin interactions of the residual promoter proximal DNA in the mutants by Hi-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) and/or by using a targeted approach such as 3C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) aimed at the dysregulated genes we uncovered.</p>
<p><italic>Egfl7</italic> morphants display severe, highly penetrant vascular phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). In contrast, the decrease in HSC number observed in <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPant zebrafish is not binary and instead falls on a spectrum, making statistical analysis necessary to define the phenotype(s) for each experimental group. Thus, although the <italic>podxl</italic> CRISPant phenotype is reproducible, its penetrance is variable, making it challenging to define a compensatory mechanism.</p>
<p>In a recent study of genetic compensation in <italic>slc25a46</italic> mutant zebrafish, researchers found over a hundred dysregulated genes that did not have sequence similarity to <italic>slc25a46</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). They did not observe mRNA degradation in <italic>slc25a46<sup>238s</sup></italic> mutants and speculated that the compensatory mechanism in their model may involve a genetic modifier or an orchestrated interaction among multiple genes within relevant networks. It is possible that a similar mechanism is at play in <italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex1(p)_Ex7Δ</sup> mutants, as they also show dysregulation of hundreds of genes. Taken together, the findings in <italic>podxl</italic> and <italic>slc25a46</italic> mutants provide support for a mechanism of genetic compensation that is distinct from redundant genes, protein feedback loops, and transcriptional adaptation.</p>

<title>SgRNA design and morpholino</title>
<p>Small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were selected from the top targets identified by CHOPCHOP software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/">http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/</ext-link>) with NGG PAM sites and no predicted off-targets. gRNAs were then ordered from IDT and annealed with tracerRNAs at a concentration of 3μM (S1 Table). Morpholino injections were performed consistent with published guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) with a well-characterized and validated ATG morpholino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The morpholino used was ordered from Gene Tools and each embryo was injected with approximately 4.93 ng of either standard control or <italic>podxl</italic> morpholino at the single-cell stage.</p>

<title>CRISPant knockdown experiments</title>
<p>To knockdown <italic>podxl</italic>, <italic>tyr</italic>, and <italic>endo</italic>, we injected single cell embryos with an injection mix that contained 0.25 µg/µL of Cas9 protein, 18 ng/µL <italic>podxl, tyr</italic> or <italic>endo</italic> crRNA, and 33.5 ng/µL tracrRNA. We assessed <italic>podxl</italic> and <italic>endo</italic> knockdown using high resolution melt analysis (HRMA). For <italic>podxl</italic> we used forward primer 5′–GACTGAACGCGGAGAATCTG–3′ and reverse primer 5′– CGTCGTATATGAAGGTAAACTCACC–3′. <italic>Podxl</italic> knockdown experiments were performed by two different lab members to validate the results. For <italic>endo</italic> we used forward primer 5′– GTGCCACGGGATCGAAA–3′ and reverse primer 5′– CCGTCCTCGCTGTCTTC–3′. For <italic>tyr,</italic> gene disruption was assessed by visually inspecting zebrafish larvae for loss of pigmentation.</p>

<title>Zebrafish embryo genomic DNA extraction</title>
<p>For initial screening and founder screening to check for the presence of <italic>podxl</italic> mutations, ten 2-day old embryos were pooled into a single well. They were digested for 2 hrs at 55 °C in 100 µl DNA digestion buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 0.3% IGEPAL, 0.3% Tween20, 0.5 µg/μl Proteinase K). Proteinase K was then inactivated at 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 2 minutes; 1 µl was used in 12.5 µl PCR reactions.</p>

<title>Generating <italic>podxl</italic> mutants</title>
<p>We generated five <italic>podxl</italic> mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The putative <italic>podxl</italic> promoter region and major transcriptional start site were identified by epigenetic feature annotation (Supplementary Methods). We injected single-cell embryos with 0.25 µg/µL of Cas9 protein and 18 ng/µL <italic>podxl</italic> crRNA + 33.5 ng/µL tracrRNA (S6 Table). The injected (F0) zebrafish were screened for germline transmission by crossing with wildtype zebrafish and screening the F1 progeny for mutations using PCR (S8 Table). Temperature cycles were as follows: 98°C for 5′; 35 cycles of 95°C for 30′′, 58-68.3°C (S8 Table) for 30′′, 72°C for 35′′; 72°C for 5′; and 10°C hold. PCR samples were loaded into a 2% agarose gel in TAE.</p>

<title>Whole-mount Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Larvae were fixed overnight in cold 4% PFA. After fixation, larvae were rinsed in cold PBS and the skin was removed to reveal the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). To better visualize the eGFP expression in the <italic>Tg(wt1b:eGFP)</italic> and <italic>Tg(hand2:eGFP)</italic> zebrafish, larvae were blocked for at least 1 h with PBS+4% BSA+0.3% Triton X-100 (PBT) and then incubated with chick anti-GFP primary antibody (1:500, Aves Cat #GFP-1020, Lot #0511FP12) for at least 12 h followed by AlexaFluor goat anti-chick 488 secondary antibody (1:200, A11039, Lot #1937504) for at least 12 additional hours.</p>

<title>Confocal imaging and analysis of hepatic stellate cells</title>
<p>Larvae for all confocal imaging experiments were mounted on their back in 1% low-melt agarose plus SlowFade Diamond Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen) and cover-slipped. Image acquisition for all samples was done using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope using the same parameters (HV, gain, offset, etc.) for all zebrafish within an experiment. A 20x lens was used and 3.5-μm thick z stacks were collected imaging the entire liver. Images were blinded and randomized using R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) and the number of hepatic stellate cells was counted manually from Z-projections of all liver images using Fiji software (ImageJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>).</p>

<title>Larval ethanol exposure and hepatocyte ablation</title>
<p>Two <italic>podxl</italic> mutants were selected for liver injury experiments; <italic>podxl</italic><sup>-194_Ex7Δ</sup> and <italic>podxl</italic><sup>Ex1(p)_Ex7Δ</sup>. Ethanol exposure was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) on progeny of a <italic>podxl</italic><sup>+/-</sup> incross. Larvae were exposed to ethanol at 4 dpf by transferring them to 2% ethanol diluted in egg water. After 24 hours of incubating in ethanol, larvae were moved to fresh egg water at 5 dpf. Larvae were euthanized and fixed in PFA at 6 dpf. After genotyping, wildtype and mutant larvae were dissected to expose the liver and imaged by confocal microscopy.</p>
<p>Hepatocyte ablation was performed with a metronidazole (MTZ)-nitroreductase (NTR) ablation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Larvae from an incross of <italic>podxl</italic><sup>+/-</sup> expressing <italic>Tg(wt1b:egfp)</italic>, with one parent expressing <italic>Tg(fabp10:CFP-NTR),</italic> were exposed to either 10mM MTZ or DMSO from 3.5 dpf to 5 dpf.

<title>RNA extraction</title>
<p>Total and pre-mRNA was isolated from adult zebrafish livers using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit. We euthanized adult zebrafish by ice-water immersion, dissected out their livers, added Qiagen RLT buffer, ground with a pestle, vortexed on ice for 20 minutes, and then followed the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit protocol. DNAse I was used to remove all traces of DNA from the samples. RNA concentration and purity were quantified using NanoDrop.</p>

<title>Real-time quantitative PCR</title>
<p>cDNA was synthesized using SS3 Vilo Synthesis kit with OligoDt (Invitrogen) or Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermofisher). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using PerfeCTa Sybr Green FastMix (QuantaBio, Cat # 95072-012) with the primers listed in S8 Table. The PCR conditions were: 95°C for 3′; 45 cycles of 95°C for 15′′, 60°C for 45′′; melt curve analysis. The fold changes were calculated relative to <italic>Rpl13a</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>).</p>
<p>Three technical replicates (three wells) were performed for each sample and were used to generate standard deviations. Melt curves were examined for all wells, and only Ct values with distinct Tm peaks (valid melt curves) were included in the analysis. If one well lacked a valid melt curve, the other two wells were used for the analysis. If two or three wells lacked valid melt curves, that sample was considered not detected. P-values were derived using Welch’s t-test on the normalized mean expression for wildtype and mutant.</p>

<title>Identifying <italic>podxl</italic> homologs, genes with sequence similarity to <italic>podxl,</italic> and HSC-enriched genes</title>
<p>To identify <italic>podxl</italic> homologs, we searched ensembl genome browser and UCSC genome browser for <italic>cd34</italic> and <italic>endoglycan</italic> (<italic>podxl2</italic>). To look for genes that had sequence similarity to <italic>podxl</italic>, we used NCBI BLAS to query <italic>Danio rerio</italic> Reference RNA Sequences and either highly similar sequences or somewhat similar sequences. We examined all genes with a 5% query cover or higher.</p>
<p>We examined genes that were significantly upregulated in <italic>podxl</italic> mutants (log2fold change&gt; 2, padj&lt;0.05) alongside three publicly available datasets for HSC-enriched genes. Genes meeting criteria for HSC enrichment and/or upregulation in at least two of these four datasets were included in S4 Table. “Mutant” column indicates that the gene was upregulated with a log2fold change&gt;2 and padj&lt;0.05 in adult zebrafish <italic>podxl</italic> mutant livers compared to <italic>podxl</italic> wildtype livers (RNA sequencing experiment reported in this manuscript; data to be deposited in GEO upon manuscript acceptance). “Yin” column indicates that the gene was among the top 500 most upregulated (greatest log2fold change) in FACS-sorted HSCs from adult zebrafish livers compared to non-fluorescing other liver cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). “Morrison” column indicates that the gene was upregulated with a log2fold change&gt;2 and padj&lt;0.05 in endothelial/HSC clusters upon single-cell RNA sequencing of wildtype zebrafish livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). “Spanjaard” column indicates that the gene was one of 50 genes denoted as characteristically expressed in HSCs in adult zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Ross, Miscik, and others describes an intriguing series of observations made when investigating the requirement for podxl during hepatic development in zebrafish. Podxl morphants and CRISPants display a reduced number of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), while mutants are either phenotypically wild type or display an increased number of HSCs.</p>
<p>The absence of observable phenotypes in genetic mutants could indeed be attributed to genetic compensation, as the authors postulate. However, in my opinion, the evidence provided in the manuscript at this point is insufficient to draw a firm conclusion. Furthermore, the opposite phenotype observed in the two deletion mutants is not readily explainable by genetic compensation and invokes additional mechanisms.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Considering discrepancies in phenotypes, the phenotypes observed in podxl morphants and CRISPants need to be more thoroughly validated. To generate morphants, authors use &quot;well characterized and validated ATG Morpholino&quot; (lines 373-374). However, published morphants, in addition to kidney malformations, display gross developmental defects including pericardial edema, yolk sack extension abnormalities, and body curvature at 2-3 dpf (reference 7 / PMID: 24224085). Were these gross developmental defects observed in the knockdown experiments performed in this paper? If yes, is it possible that the liver phenotype observed at 5 dpf is, to some extent, secondary to these preceding abnormalities? If not, why were they not observed? Did kidney malformations reproduce? On the CRISPant side, were these gross developmental defects also observed in sgRNA#1 and sgRNA#2 CRISPants? Considering that morphants and CRISPants show very similar effects on HSC development and assuming other phenotypes are specific as well, they would be expected to occur at similar frequencies. It would be helpful if full-size images of all relevant morphant and CRISPant embryos were displayed, as is done for tyr CRISPant in Figure S2. Finally, it is very important to thoroughly quantify the efficacy of podxl sgRNA#1 and sgRNA#2 in CRISPants. The HRMA data provided in Figure S1 is not quantitative in terms of the fraction of alleles with indels. Figure S3 indicates a very broad range of efficacies, averaging out at ~62% (line 100). Assuming random distribution of indels among cells and that even in-frame indels result in complete loss of function (possible for sgRNA#1 due to targeting the signal sequence), only ~38% (.62*.62) of all cells will be mutated bi-allelically. That does not seem sufficient to reliably induce loss-of-function phenotypes. My guess is that the capillary electrophoresis method used in Figure S3 underestimates the efficiency of mutagenesis, and that much higher mutagenesis rates would be observed if mutagenesis were assessed by amplicon sequencing (ideally NGS but Sanger followed by deconvolution analysis would suffice). This would strengthen the claim that CRISPant phenotypes are specific.</p>
<p>(2) In addition to confidence in morphant and CRISPant phenotypes, the authors' claim of genetic compensation rests on the observation that podxl (Ex1(p)_Ex7Δ) mutants are resistant to CRISPant effect when injected with sgRNA#1 (Figure 3L). Considering the issues raised in the paragraph above, this is insufficient. There is a very straightforward way to address both concerns, though. The described podxl(-194_Ex7Δ) and podxl(-319_ex1(p)Δ) deletions remove the binding site for the ATG morpholino. Therefore, deletion mutants should be refractive to the Morpholino (specificity assessment recommended in PMID: 29049395, see also PMID: 32958829). Furthermore, both deletion mutants should be refractive to sgRNA#1 CRISPant phenotypes, with the first being refractive to sgRNA#2 as well.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Ross and Miscik et. al described the phenotypic discrepancies between F0 zebrafish mosaic mutant (&quot;CRISPants&quot;) and morpholino knockdown (Morphant) embryos versus a set of 5 different loss-of-function (LOF) stable mutants in one particular gene involved in hepatic stellate cells development: podxl. While transient LOF and mosaic mutants induced a decrease of hepatic stellate cells number stable LOF zebrafish did not. The authors analyzed the molecular causes of these phenotypic differences and concluded that LOF mutants are genetically compensated through the upregulation of the expression of many genes. Additionally, they ruled out other better-known and described mechanisms such as the expression of redundant genes, protein feedback loops, or transcriptional adaptation.</p>
<p>While the manuscript is clearly written and conclusions are, in general, properly supported, there are some aspects that need to be further clarified and studied.</p>
<p>(1) It would be convenient to apply a method to better quantify potential loss-of-function mutations in the CRISPants. Doing this it can be known not only percentage of mutations in those embryos but also what fraction of them are actually generating an out-of-frame mutation likely driving gene loss of function (since deletions of 3-6 nucleotides removing 1-2 aminoacid/s will likely not have an impact in protein activity, unless that this/these 1-2 aminoacid/s is/are essential for the protein activity). With this, the authors can also correlate phenotype penetrance with the level of loss-of-function when quantifying embryo phenotypes that can help to support their conclusions.</p>
<p>(2) It is unclear that 4.93 ng of morpholino per embryo is totally safe. The amount of morpholino causing undesired effects can differ depending on the morpholino used. I would suggest performing some sanity check experiments to demonstrate that morpholino KD is not triggering other molecular outcomes, such as upregulation of p53 or innate immune response.</p>
<p>(3) Although the authors made a set of controls to demonstrate the specificity of the CRISPant phenotypes, I believe that a rescue experiment could be beneficial to support their conclusions. Injecting an mRNA with podxl ORF (ideally with a tag to follow protein levels up) together with the induction of CRISPants could be a robust manner to demonstrate the specificity of the approach. A rescue experiment with morphants would also be good to have, although these are a bit more complicated, to ultimately demonstrate the specificity of the approach.</p>
<p>(4) In lines 314-316, the authors speculate on a correlation between decreased HSC and Podxl levels. It would be interesting to actually test this hypothesis and perform RT-qPCR upon CRISPant induction or, even better and if antibodies are available, western blot analysis.</p>
<p>(5) Similarly, in lines 337-338 and 342-344, the authors discuss that it could be possible that genes near to podxl locus could be upregulated in the mutants. Since they already have a transcriptomic done, this seems an easy analysis to do that can address their own hypothesis.</p>
<p>(6) Figures 4 and 5 would be easier to follow if panels B-F included what mutants are (beyond having them in the figure legend). Moreover, would it be more accurate and appropriate if the authors group all three WT and mutant data per panel instead of showing individual fish? Representing technical replicates does not demonstrate in vivo variability, which is actually meaningful in this context. Then, statistical analysis can be done between WT and mutant per panel and per set of primers using these three independent 3-month-old zebrafish.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ross et al. show that knockdown of zebrafish podocalyxin-like (podxl) by CRISPR/Cas or morpholino injection decreased the number of hepatic stellate cells (HSC). The authors then generated 5 different mutant alleles representing a range of lesions, including premature stop codons, in-frame deletion of the transmembrane domain, and deletions of the promoter region encompassing the transcription start site. However, unlike their knockdown experiment, HSC numbers did not decrease in podxl mutants; in fact, for two of the mutant alleles, the number of HSCs increased compared to the control. Injection of podxl CRISPR/Cas constructs into these mutants had no effect on HSC number, suggesting that the knockdown phenotype is not due to off-target effects but instead that the mutants are somehow compensating for the loss of podxl. The authors then present multiple lines of evidence suggesting that compensation is not exclusively due to transcriptional adaptation - evidence of mRNA instability and nonsense-mediated decay was observed in some but all mutants; expression of the related gene endoglycan (endo) was unchanged in the mutants and endo knockdown had no effect on HSC numbers; and, expression profiling by RNA sequencing did not reveal changes in other genes that share sequence similarity with podxl. Instead, their RNA-seq data showed hundreds of differentially expressed genes, especially ECM-related genes, suggesting that compensation in podxl mutants is complex and multi-genic.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data presented is impressively thorough, especially in its characterization of the 5 different podxl alleles and exploration of whether these mutants exhibit transcriptional adaptation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>RNA sequencing expression profiling was done on adult livers. However, compensation of HSC numbers is apparent by 6 dpf, suggesting compensatory mechanisms would be active at larval or even embryonic stages. Although possible, it's not clear that any compensatory changes in gene expression would persist to adulthood.</p>

<p>The reviewer points out some excellent caveats regarding the morphant experiments. We agree that at least some of the effects of the podxl morpholino may be related to its effects on kidney development and/or gross developmental defects that impede liver development. Because of these limitations, we focused our experiments on analysis of CRISPant and mutant phenotypes, including showing that podxl (Ex1(p)_Ex7Δ) mutants are resistant to CRISPant effects on HSC number when injected with sgRNA#1. We did not observe any gross morphologic defects in podxl CRISPants. Liver size was not significantly altered in podxl CRISPants (Figure 2A). We will add brightfield images of podxl CRISPant larvae to the supplemental data for the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that HRMA is not quantitative with respect to the fraction of alleles with indels and that capillary electrophoresis likely underestimates mutagenesis efficiency. Nonetheless, even with 100% mutation efficiency, podxl CRISPant knockdown, like most CRISPR knockdowns, would not represent complete loss of function:  ~1/3 of alleles will contain in-frame mutations and likely retain at least some gene function, so ~1/3*1/3 = 1/9 of cells will have no out-of-frame indels and contain two copies of at least partially functional podxl and ~2/3*2/3 = 4/9 of cells will have one out-of-frame indel and one copy of at least partially functional podxl. Thus, the decreased HSCs we observe with podxl CRISPant likely represents a partial loss-of-function phenotype in any case.</p>

<p>The reviewer proposes elegant experiments to address the specificity of the morpholino. For the revision, we plan to perform additional morpholino studies, including morpholino injections of podxl mutants and assessment of tp53 and other immune response/cellular stress pathway genes in podxl morphants.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Ross and Miscik et. al described the phenotypic discrepancies between F0 zebrafish mosaic mutant (&quot;CRISPants&quot;) and morpholino knockdown (Morphant) embryos versus a set of 5 different loss-of-function (LOF) stable mutants in one particular gene involved in hepatic stellate cells development: podxl. While transient LOF and mosaic mutants induced a decrease of hepatic stellate cells number stable LOF zebrafish did not. The authors analyzed the molecular causes of these phenotypic differences and concluded that LOF mutants are genetically compensated through the upregulation of the expression of many genes. Additionally, they ruled out other better-known and described mechanisms such as the expression of redundant genes, protein feedback loops, or transcriptional adaptation.</p>
<p>While the manuscript is clearly written and conclusions are, in general, properly supported, there are some aspects that need to be further clarified and studied.</p>
<p>(1) It would be convenient to apply a method to better quantify potential loss-of-function mutations in the CRISPants. Doing this it can be known not only percentage of mutations in those embryos but also what fraction of them are actually generating an out-of-frame mutation likely driving gene loss of function (since deletions of 3-6 nucleotides removing 1-2 aminoacid/s will likely not have an impact in protein activity, unless that this/these 1-2 aminoacid/s is/are essential for the protein activity). With this, the authors can also correlate phenotype penetrance with the level of loss-of-function when quantifying embryo phenotypes that can help to support their conclusions.</p>

<p>Reviewer #2 raises an excellent point that is similar to Reviewer #1’s first concern. Please see our response above. In general, we agree that correlating phenotype penetrance with level of loss-of-function is a very good way to support conclusions regarding specificity in knockdown experiments. Unfortunately, because the phenotype we are examining (HSC number) has a relatively large standard deviation even in control/wildtype larvae (for example, 63 ± 19 (mean ± standard deviation) HSCs per liver in uninjected control siblings in Figure 1) it would be technically very difficult to do this experiment for podxl.</p>

<p>(2) It is unclear that 4.93 ng of morpholino per embryo is totally safe. The amount of morpholino causing undesired effects can differ depending on the morpholino used. I would suggest performing some sanity check experiments to demonstrate that morpholino KD is not triggering other molecular outcomes, such as upregulation of p53 or innate immune response.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer #2 raises an excellent point that is similar to Reviewer #1’s second concern. Please see our response above. We acknowledge that some of the effects of the podxl morpholino may be non-specific. To address this concern in the revised manuscript, we plan to perform additional morpholino studies, including morpholino injections of podxl mutants and assessment of tp53 and other immune response/cellular stress pathway genes in podxl morphants.</p>

<p>(3) Although the authors made a set of controls to demonstrate the specificity of the CRISPant phenotypes, I believe that a rescue experiment could be beneficial to support their conclusions. Injecting an mRNA with podxl ORF (ideally with a tag to follow protein levels up) together with the induction of CRISPants could be a robust manner to demonstrate the specificity of the approach. A rescue experiment with morphants would also be good to have, although these are a bit more complicated, to ultimately demonstrate the specificity of the approach.</p>
<p>(4) In lines 314-316, the authors speculate on a correlation between decreased HSC and Podxl levels. It would be interesting to actually test this hypothesis and perform RT-qPCR upon CRISPant induction or, even better and if antibodies are available, western blot analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s acknowledgement of the controls we performed to demonstrate the specificity of the CRISPant phenotypes. The proposed experiments (rescue, assessment of Podxl levels) would help bolster our conclusions but are technically difficult due to the relatively large standard deviation for the HSC number phenotype even in wildtype larvae and the lack of well-characterized zebrafish antibodies against Podxl.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Similarly, in lines 337-338 and 342-344, the authors discuss that it could be possible that genes near to podxl locus could be upregulated in the mutants. Since they already have a transcriptomic done, this seems an easy analysis to do that can address their own hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We were referring in these sections to genes that are near the podxl locus with respect to three-dimensional chromatin structure; such genes would not necessarily be near the podxl locus on chromosome 4. We will clarify the text in this paragraph for the revised manuscript. At the same time, we will examine our transcriptomic data to check expression of mkln1, cyb5r3, and other nearby genes on chromosome 4 as suggested and include this analysis in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(6) Figures 4 and 5 would be easier to follow if panels B-F included what mutants are (beyond having them in the figure legend). Moreover, would it be more accurate and appropriate if the authors group all three WT and mutant data per panel instead of showing individual fish? Representing technical replicates does not demonstrate in vivo variability, which is actually meaningful in this context. Then, statistical analysis can be done between WT and mutant per panel and per set of primers using these three independent 3-month-old zebrafish.</p>

<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We will modify these figures to clarify our results.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ross et al. show that knockdown of zebrafish podocalyxin-like (podxl) by CRISPR/Cas or morpholino injection decreased the number of hepatic stellate cells (HSC). The authors then generated 5 different mutant alleles representing a range of lesions, including premature stop codons, in-frame deletion of the transmembrane domain, and deletions of the promoter region encompassing the transcription start site. However, unlike their knockdown experiment, HSC numbers did not decrease in podxl mutants; in fact, for two of the mutant alleles, the number of HSCs increased compared to the control. Injection of podxl CRISPR/Cas constructs into these mutants had no effect on HSC number, suggesting that the knockdown phenotype is not due to off-target effects but instead that the mutants are somehow compensating for the loss of podxl. The authors then present multiple lines of evidence suggesting that compensation is not exclusively due to transcriptional adaptation - evidence of mRNA instability and nonsense-mediated decay was observed in some but all mutants; expression of the related gene endoglycan (endo) was unchanged in the mutants and endo knockdown had no effect on HSC numbers; and, expression profiling by RNA sequencing did not reveal changes in other genes that share sequence similarity with podxl. Instead, their RNA-seq data showed hundreds of differentially expressed genes, especially ECM-related genes, suggesting that compensation in podxl mutants is complex and multi-genic.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data presented is impressively thorough, especially in its characterization of the 5 different podxl alleles and exploration of whether these mutants exhibit transcriptional adaptation.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for appreciating the hard work that went into this manuscript.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>RNA sequencing expression profiling was done on adult livers. However, compensation of HSC numbers is apparent by 6 dpf, suggesting compensatory mechanisms would be active at larval or even embryonic stages. Although possible, it's not clear that any compensatory changes in gene expression would persist to adulthood.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This reviewer makes an excellent point. Our finding that the largest changes in gene expression were in extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and ECM modulation is a major function of HSCs supports the hypothesis that genetic compensation is occurring in adults. Nonetheless, we agree that compensatory changes in adults may not fully reflect the compensatory changes during development, so it would bolster the conclusions of the paper to perform the RNA sequencing and qPCR experiments on zebrafish larval livers.</p>
<p>We tried very hard to do this experiment proposed by Reviewer #3. In our hands, obtaining sufficient high-quality RNA for robust gene expression analysis typically requires pooling of ~10-15 larval livers. These larvae need to be obtained from a heterozygous in-cross in order to have matched wildtype sibling controls. Livers must be dissected from freshly euthanized (not fixed) zebrafish. Thus, this experiment requires genotyping live, individual larvae from a small amount of tissue (without sacrificing the larvae) before dissecting and pooling the livers. Unfortunately we were unable to confidently and reproducibly genotype individual live podxl larvae with these small amounts of tissue despite trying multiple approaches. Therefore we were not able to perform gene expression analysis on podxl mutant larval livers.</p>
