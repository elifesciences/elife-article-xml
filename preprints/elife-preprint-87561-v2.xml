<title>Abstract</title><p>We studied lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> in inflammasome. LPS+palmitic acid (PA) decreased lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub>) and increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> through mitochondrial ROS, which was suppressed in <italic>Trpm2</italic>-KO macrophages. Inflammasome activation and metabolic inflammation in adipose tissue of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice were ameliorated by <italic>Trpm2</italic> KO. ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling occurred after lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release whose blockade attenuated LPS+PA-induced inflammasome. Subsequently, store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup>entry (SOCE) was activated whose inhibition suppressed inflammasome. SOCE was coupled with K<sup>+</sup> efflux whose inhibition reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>) and impaired [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> recovery. LPS+PA activated KCa3.1 channel, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel. Inhibitors of KCa3.1 channel or <italic>Kcnn4</italic> KO reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>, attenuated increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> or inflammasome activation by LPS+PA, and ameliorated HFD-induced inflammasome or metabolic inflammation. Lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release induced delayed JNK and ASC phosphorylation through CAMKII-ASK1. These results suggest a novel role of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sustained by ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling and K<sup>+</sup> efflux through KCa3.1 channel in inflammasome activation and metabolic inflammation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lysosomotropic agents are classical inflammasome activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hornung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Misawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xian et al., 2022</xref>). Detailed mechanism of inflammasome activation by lysosomal stress has been unclear, while roles of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release was suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Okada et al., 2014</xref>). K<sup>+</sup> efflux is crucial in most inflammasome activations, facilitating NLRP3-NEK7 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sharif et al., 2019</xref>). . Relationship between of K<sup>+</sup> efflux and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in inflammasome has hardly been studied, despite their potential link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yaron et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>We studied lysosomal events in inflammasome focusing on roles of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+palmitic acid (PA), an effector of metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nakamura et al., 2009</xref>) (LP). We found that LP induces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) that activates a lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux channel (TRPM2), leading to lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, delayed JNK activation, ASC phosphorylation and inflammasome activation. We also found occurrence of ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling sustaining lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux and subsequent store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) in inflammasome. Finally, we elucidated roles of K<sup>+</sup> efflux facilitating SOCE through hyperpolarization-accelerated extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guéguinou et al., 2014</xref>), and identified KCa3.1 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel as the K<sup>+</sup> efflux channel in LP-induced inflammasome and metabolic inflammation.</p>

<title>Lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by mitochondrial ROS in inflammasome</title>
<p>We investigated whether lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release occurs in inflammasome activation by LP, a combination activating inflammasome related to metabolic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wen et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>When we studied perilysosomal Ca<sup>2<bold>+</bold></sup> release in bone marrow-derived macrophages (Mφs) (BMDMs) transfected with <italic>GCaMP3-ML1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shen et al., 2012</xref>), lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release was not directly visualized by LP; however, perilysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by Gly-Phe β- naphthylamide, (GPN), a lysosomotropic agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shen et al., 2012</xref>) was significantly reduced (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting preemptying or release of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> by LP, similar to the results using other inducers of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Park et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). We next measured lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> content ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub>) that can be affected by lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> determined using Oregon Green BAPTA-1 Dextran (OGBD) was significantly lowered by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></italic></bold>), consistent with lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Likely due to lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> measured by Fluo-3-AM staining was significantly increased by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></italic></bold>). Ratiometric [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> measurement using Fura-2 to avoid uneven loading or quenching, validated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></italic></bold>). Functional roles of increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in inflammasome by LP was revealed by abrogation of IL-1β release or IL- 1β maturation by BAPTA-AM, a cell-permeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></italic></bold>). Immunoblotting (IB) demonstrated that pro-IL-1β level was not notably affected by BAPTA-AM, suggesting that effect of BAPTA-AM was unrelated to the potential inhibition of pro-IL-1β transcription or translation (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We next studied mechanism of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by LP. Since several (lysosomal) ion channels can be activated by ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) and ROS can be produced by PA due to mitochondrial complex inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nakamura et al., 2009</xref>), we studied ROS accumulation. LP effectively induced CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence indicating ROS accumulation, while PA alone or LPS alone induced only a little ROS accumulation (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting synergistic effect of LPS and PA. When we studied roles of ROS in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase using <italic>N</italic>-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tardiolo et al., 2018</xref>), release and maturation of IL-1β by LP were significantly reduced (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></italic></bold>). NAC abrogated LP-induced increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> as well (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref></italic></bold>), substantiating functional roles of ROS in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase and inflammasome activation. We also studied mitochondrial ROS because mitochondria is a well-known target of PA, an effector of metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nakamura et al., 2009</xref>) and critical in inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xian et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). Using MitoSOX, we observed significant mitochondrial ROS accumulation by LP. When we quenched mitochondrial ROS using MitoTEMPOL (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref></italic></bold>), IL-1β release by LP was significantly reduced (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting crucial roles of mitochondrial ROS in LP- induced inflammasome.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through lysosomal TRPM2 channel in inflammasome</title>
<p>We next studied which lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> exit channel is involved in lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by LP. Previous papers suggested roles of transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel on the plasma membrane, in inflammasome by other stimulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tseng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). We hypothesized that TRPM2 on lysosome could be involved in LP- induced inflammasome since TRPM2 has been reported to be expressed on lysosome as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sumoza-Toledo and Penner, 2010</xref>) and <italic>Trpm2</italic>-KO mice are resistant to diet-induced glucose intolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). We verified expression of TRPM2 on lysosome of BMDMs by colocalization of TRPM2 and LAMP2 (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref></italic></bold>). While physiological ligand of TRPM2 is ADP-ribose (ADPR), ROS can activate TRPM2 by increasing ADPR production from poly-ADPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). We thus studied effects of apigenin or quercetin inhibiting ADPR generation through CD38 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bock, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nam et al., 2020</xref>). Inflammasome by LP was significantly inhibited by apigenin or quercetin (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1B</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that TRPM2 participates in inflammasome by LP. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase by LP was also reduced by apigenin or quercetin (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1C</xref></italic></bold>), supporting that apigenin or quercetin suppresses inflammasome through inhibition of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels activated by ADPR such as TRPM2. Since apigenin or quercetin has effects other than CD38 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), we employed <italic>Trpm2</italic>-KO mice. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> decrease by LP were abrogated in <italic>Trpm2</italic>-KO Mφs (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A and B</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting roles of TRPM2 in lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by LP. However, ROS production by LP was not changed by <italic>Trpm2</italic> KO (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1D</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that TRPM2 is downstream of ROS. Importantly, inflammasome activation assessed by IL-1β ELISA of culture supernatant or IB of Mφ lysate after LP treatment was significantly reduced by <italic>Trpm2</italic> KO (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></italic></bold>), indicating roles of TRPM2, likely lysosomal TRPM2, in inflammasome by LP. ASC speck formation, a marker of inflammasome, by LP was also markedly reduced by <italic>Trpm2</italic> KO (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></italic></bold>). When we employed other activators, inflammasome activation by L-Leucyl-L-Leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) or monosodium urate (MSU), lysosomotropic agents, was significantly inhibited by <italic>Trpm2</italic> KO. However, inflammasome by nigericin, an ionophore exchanging K<sup>+</sup> for H<sup>+</sup> or ATP acting on P2X7 ion channel on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Campden and Zhang, 2019</xref>), was not significantly affected (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1E</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that TRPM2 channel is crucial in inflammasome involving lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>

<p>Despite its crucial role in inflammasome by LP, TRPM2 exists on both plasma membrane and lysosome. We thus studied whether plasma membrane TRPM2 current can be activated by LP employing <italic>N</italic>-(<italic>p</italic>-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA), an inhibitor of TRPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kraft et al., 2006</xref>). ACA could inhibit IL-1β release by LP as expected (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref></italic></bold>). Intracellular dialysis using cyclic ADPR induced slow inward current on the plasma membrane, which was inhibited by ACA (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref></italic></bold>). Amplitude of cyclic ADPR-induced inward current was not affected by PA and/or LPS (b-c in <bold><italic><xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref> and C</italic></bold>). Basal inward current inhibited by ACA, i.e., unstimulated TRPM2 activity, was also not changed by PA and/or LPS (a-c in <bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></italic>- <italic>figure supplement 1B and C</italic></bold>), suggesting that LP neither affects nor induces plasma membrane TRPM2 current and that lysosomal TRPM2 is likely important in LP-induced inflammasome. To further study roles of lysosomal TRPM2 in inflammasome activation by LP, we employed bafilomycin A1 emptying lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> reservoir through lysosomal v- ATPase inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kinnear et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lange et al., 2009</xref>).

<title>ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling in inflammasome</title>
<p>After confirming roles of lysosomal TRPM2 in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase by LP, we studied changes of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>) as ER, the largest intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> reservoir, interacts with other organelles in cellular processes requiring intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. While [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> is comparable to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Raffaello et al., 2016</xref>), lysosome alone might not be a major Ca<sup>2+</sup> source because of small volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Penny et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we studied whether ER to lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux which has been observed after lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Garrity et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Park et al., 2022</xref>), occurs during inflammasome activation to sustain lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. When we measured [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> in <italic>GEM-CEPIA1er</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>)-transfected BMDMs treated with LP without extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to abolish SOCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Derler et al., 2016</xref>), [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> became significantly lower (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux from ER to lysosome likely to replenish reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> during inflammasome. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> determined using a FRET-based <italic>D1ER</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Park et al., 2009</xref>) also demonstrated a significantly reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> by LP in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free KRB buffer (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></italic></bold>). To study dynamic changes of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> and its temporal relationship with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub>, we simultaneously traced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> in <italic>GEM- CEPIA1er</italic>-transfected cells loaded with OGBD. When [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was monitored in cells that have reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> after LP treatment and then were incubated without LP in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium, recovery of decreased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> was noted (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></italic></bold>).

<p>We next studied which ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> exit channels are involved in ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling. When LP was removed after treatment, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> recovery was observed in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- replete medium (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></italic></bold>). Here, Xestospongin C, an IP<sub>3</sub> receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) channel antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Garrity et al., 2016</xref>), inhibited recovery of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> after LP removal (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling through IP<sub>3</sub>R channel. Dantrolene, an antagonist of ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel, another ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> exit channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Garrity et al., 2016</xref>), did not significantly affect recovery of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></italic></bold>). When we chelated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> with a membrane-permeant metal chelator <italic>N,N,N’,N’</italic>-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylene diamine (TPEN) that has a low Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity and can chelate ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> but not cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hofer et al., 1998</xref>), recovery of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> after LP removal was markedly inhibited (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></italic></bold>), again supporting ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling during lysosomal Ca<sup>2</sup> recovery. When functional impact of ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling was studied, Xestospongin C significantly suppressed IL-1β release by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling contributes to inflammasome by LP. Since ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling could be facilitated by membrane contact between organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), we studied apposition of ER and lysosome proteins. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) demonstrated multiple contact between VAPA on ER and ORP1L on lysosome by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting facilitation of ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling by organelle contact.</p>
<p>As extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is likely to enter cells through SOCE channel after ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Derler et al., 2016</xref>), we next studied extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. When extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was chelated by 3 mM EGTA reducing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in RPMI medium to 99 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schoenmakers et al., 1992</xref>) below [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Maggi et al., 1989</xref>), IL-1β release by LP was significantly reduced (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A</xref></italic></bold>), demonstrating roles of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in inflammasome by LP. 2-APB, a SOCE inhibitor, also significantly reduced IL-1β release by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref></italic></bold>), supporting roles of SOCE in inflammasome. Since 2-APB can inhibit ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel as well, we next employed another SOCE inhibitor. BTP2, a SOCE inhibitor that does not affect ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zitt et al., 2004</xref>), significantly reduced IL-1β release by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1C</xref></italic></bold>), substantiating roles of SOCE in inflammasome. We also studied whether BTP2 can affect [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> in LP-induced inflammasome through SOCE inhibition. We determined [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> without extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal because BTP2 effect on SOCE cannot be seen after extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal abrogating SOCE. In the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> was not decreased by LP, likely due to SOCE (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1D</xref></italic></bold>). Here, BTP2 significantly reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> of LP-treated BMDMs (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1D</xref></italic></bold>) likely due to SOCE inhibition, suggesting that SOCE is activated in inflammasome by LP to replenish reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store. We also studied aggregation of STIM1, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor in ER, which can be observed in SOCE activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Derler et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, STIM1 aggregation was clearly observed after LP treatment (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1E</xref></italic></bold>), which was colocalized with ORAI1, an SOCE channel on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vaca, 2010</xref>), strongly indicating SOCE through ORAI1 channel in LP-induced inflammasome.</p>

<title>Coupling of K<sup>+</sup> efflux and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in inflammasome</title>
<p>K<sup>+</sup> efflux is one of the most common and critical events in inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Muñoz-Planillo et al., 2013</xref>), although a couple of inflammasomes without K<sup>+</sup> efflux have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Groß et al., 2016</xref>). In excitable cells, K<sup>+</sup> efflux leads to hyperpolarization, which negatively modulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activated by depolarization. In nonexcitable cells, contrarily, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx though voltage-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel such as SOCE channel can be positively modulated by K<sup>+</sup> efflux, due to increased electrical Ca<sup>2+</sup> driving force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guéguinou et al., 2014</xref>). Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from extracellular space into cytosol might be positively modulated by K<sup>+</sup> efflux in nonexcitable cells such as Mφs, we studied whether K<sup>+</sup> efflux is coupled to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Intracellular K<sup>+</sup> content ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) determined using Potassium Green-2-AM was decreased by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref></italic></bold>), likely due to K<sup>+</sup> efflux. High extracellular K<sup>+</sup> content ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>) (60 mM) inhibited inflammasome activation by LP likely by inhibiting K<sup>+</sup> efflux (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1B</xref></italic></bold>). We then studied effects of high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> that would be affected by high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> if K<sup>+</sup> efflux and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through SOCE are coupled. We determined [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> again without extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal since possible effects of high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> on SOCE cannot be seen after extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal. At [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> of 5.4 mM ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> in RPMI), [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> was not decreased by LP. However, at high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, LP significantly reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></italic></bold>) likely due to SOCE inhibition by high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, suggesting that K<sup>+</sup> efflux is coupled to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through SOCE. We next studied whether [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> recovery which is seen after LP removal due to ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling is affected by high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> recovery after LP removal became significantly lower by high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> dampens [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> recovery after LP removal likely through SOCE inhibition.

<p>We next investigated which K<sup>+</sup> efflux channel is involved in inflammasome, focusing on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels that can positively modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx after initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guéguinou et al., 2014</xref>). When Mφs were incubated with various K<sup>+</sup> efflux channel inhibitors, charybdotoxin (CTX) inhibiting all 3 types of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels [BK, IKCa1 (KCa3.1) and SK] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen and Chung, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">González et al., 2012</xref>), significantly suppressed IL-1β release by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref></italic></bold>), supporting roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup>- activated K<sup>+</sup> channels in inflammasome. In contrast, inhibitors of K<sup>+</sup> efflux channels unrelated to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced activation such as quinine (a 2-pore K<sup>+</sup> channel inhibitor), barium sulfate (Kir channel inhibitor) or 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, a Kv channel inhibitor) did not significantly inhibit IL-1β release by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1D</xref></italic></bold>). We next studied which channels among Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels are involved. Paxillin, a BK channel inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">González et al., 2012</xref>) and UCL 1684 or apamin, SK channel inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Strøbæk et al., 2000</xref>) did not significantly affect IL-1β release by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1D</xref></italic></bold>). In contrast, TRAM-34, a specific IKCa1 (KCa3.1) channel inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wulff et al., 2000</xref>), significantly decreased IL-1β release by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref> and D</italic></bold>), suggesting involvement of KCa3.1. We next studied effects of TRAM-34 on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>. While [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> decrease by LP was not seen without extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal likely due to SOCE, it was clearly observed when TRAM-34 was added (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1E</xref></italic></bold>), consistent with positive roles of KCa3.1 in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx after ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> emptying. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase by LP was also inhibited by TRAM-34 (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></italic></bold>), demonstrating contribution of KCa3.1 channel in the increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Further, TRAM-34 abrogated decrease of [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></italic></bold>), indicating roles of KCa3.1 in K<sup>+</sup> efflux during inflammasome activation. BTP2 also suppressed increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and decrease of [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D and E</xref></italic></bold>), likely by inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that can activate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel such as KCa3.1.</p>

If Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel coupled to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx mediates K<sup>+</sup> efflux in inflammasome activation, conventional whole-cell patch clamp using Ca<sup>2+</sup>-clamped solution would nullify effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, rendering study of increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx impossible. Hence, we employed nystatin-perforated patch clamp technique that leaves elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> intact, as nystatin pores are permeable to monovalent but not to divalent ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akaike and Harata, 1994</xref>). When ramp-like voltage clamp was applied to induce brief current-voltage (I/V) curves and TRAM-34-inhibitable current was obtained by digital subtraction, slope of I/V curves sensitive to TRAM-34 was increased by LP but not by LPS alone (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A and B</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting increased KCa3.1 activity by LP. Expression of <italic>Kcnn4</italic> was not significantly affected by LPS and/or PA (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1A</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that increased KCa3.1 activity by LP is not due to <italic>Kcnn4</italic> induction.

<p>We next studied functional roles of <italic>Kcnn4</italic> in inflammasome.

Further, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> recovery by LP removal, was inhibited by TRAM-34 (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref></italic></bold>), indicating that K<sup>+</sup> efflux contributes to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> recovery, likely through facilitation of SOCE and subsequent ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling. We also studied physical coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and K<sup>+</sup> efflux channels, in addition to their functional coupling. PLA demonstrated physical association between KCNN4 and ORAI1 channel by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1D</xref></italic></bold>), which might facilitate functional coupling between K<sup>+</sup> efflux and SOCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ferreira and Schlichter, 2013</xref>).

<p>We also studied roles of KCa3.1 channel in inflammasome by other stimulators. Inflammasome by LLOMe or MSU, lysosomotropic agents, was significantly inhibited by <italic>Kcnn4</italic> KO, however, that by nigericin directly promoting K<sup>+</sup> efflux or ATP inducing K<sup>+</sup> efflux through pannexin-1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Xu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) was not significantly affected (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1E</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that KCa3.1 channel is crucial in K<sup>+</sup> efflux associated with lysosomotropic agents or lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Since K<sup>+</sup> efflux is crucial in NLRP3 binding to NEK7 and oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">He et al., 2016</xref>), we studied roles of KCa3.1 channel in NLRP3 oligomerization.

NLRP3 binding to NEK7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">He et al., 2016</xref>), which was observed in control Mφs treated with LP by immunoprecipitation, was also abrogated by <italic>Kcnn4</italic> KO or TRAM-34 (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1F</xref> and G</italic></bold>), suggesting roles of KCa3.1 channel in NLRP3 interaction with NEK7 and oligomerization.</p>

<title>Mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced inflammasome activation</title>
<p>We next investigated mechanism of inflammasome by increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. We studied whether TAK1-JNK activation observed in inflammasome by lysosomal rupture releasing lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Okada et al., 2014</xref>), participates in inflammasome by LP. JNK was activated by LP treatment for 21 h (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Since JNK activation occurs after LPS treatment alone for a short time and then wanes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">An et al., 2018</xref>), we studied time sequence of JNK activation by LP. JNK activation by LPS alone occurred 30 min after treatment, subsided since 2 h and never occurred again (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></italic></bold>). In contrast, JNK activation occurred again after LP treatment for 21 h (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting different mechanism and time scale of JNK activation depending on additional events such as lysosomal ones. While we determined [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> after LP treatment for a total 4 h including LPS pretreatment for 3 h (actual LP treatment time is 1 h) throughout the study as Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux is expected to occur since early time, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> further increased 21 h after LP treatment (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs7a" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1A</xref></italic></bold>), which could be high enough to act as signal 2 of inflammasome. [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decrease was also observed not 4 but 21 h after LP treatment (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs7a" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1A</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx supported by K<sup>+</sup> efflux is pronounced at later time. Additionally, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> was reduced not 4 but 21 h after LP treatment without extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs7a" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1A</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting full alteration of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> distribution at later time of LP treatment. Since JNK contributes to inflammasome through ASC phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hara et al., 2013</xref>), we studied relationship between JNK and ASC phosphorylation/oligomerization. Intriguingly, ASC phosphorylation and oligomerization occurred 21 h after LP treatment but not 30 min after LPS treatment despite similar JNK activation (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B and C</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that JNK activation 21 h after LP treatment leads to ASC phosphorylation and oligomerization likely due to signal 2 such as lysosomal events. Indeed, JNK activation by LP treatment for 21 h was markedly suppressed by <italic>Kcnn4</italic> or <italic>Trpm2</italic> KO (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs7a" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1B</xref></italic></bold>), supporting that events such as lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and/or K<sup>+</sup> efflux are necessary for delayed JNK activation. SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, suppressed ASC phosphorylation and oligomerization by LP (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>; <xref rid="figs7a" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1C</xref></italic></bold>), indicating that JNK activation is necessary but not sufficient for ASC phosphorylation/oligomerization, as shown by no ASC phosphorylation/oligomerization 0.5 h after LPS treatment despite strong JNK activation. Consistent with roles of JNK in inflammasome activation by LP, IL-1β release by LP was inhibited by JNK inhibitor (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>When we studied roles of TAK1 as JNK upstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Okada et al., 2014</xref>), IL-1β release by LP was not inhibited by 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, a TAK1 inhibitor (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs7a" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1D</xref></italic></bold>), in contrast to inflammasome activation by lysosomal rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Okada et al., 2014</xref>). We thus studied roles of ASK1 participating in inflammasome activation by diverse inflammasome activators such as bacteria or virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Immanuel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Place et al., 2018</xref>). IL-1β release by LP was significantly inhibited by selonsertib, an ASK1 inhibitor (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting roles of ASK1 in inflammasome activation by LP. Consistently, JNK activation by LP was inhibited by selonsertib (<bold><italic><xref rid="figs7a" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1E</xref></italic></bold>). Further, ASK1 activation was observed at later time of LP treatment (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting that LP induces ASK1 activation likely through additional mechanisms such as lysosomal events at JNK upstream. Consistent with roles of ASK1 in JNK activation, ASK1 inhibitor blocked ASC phosphorylation/oligomerization as efficiently as JNK inhibitor (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></italic>- <italic>figure supplement 1C</italic></bold>), supporting that activated ASK1 induces JNK activation and subsequent ASC phosphorylation/oligomerization.</p>
<p>When we studied mechanism of ASK1 activation by LP, ASK1 activation by LP was attenuated by KN-93, a CaMKII inhibitor, but not by KN-92, a KN-93 congener without CaMKII inhibitory activity (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref></italic></bold>), which supports roles of increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and subsequent CAMKII in ASK1 activation by LP, similar to inhibition of lysosomal rupture- induced inflammasome by KN-93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Okada et al., 2014</xref>).

These results indicate that increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> due to lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release facilitated by ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling and K<sup>+</sup> efflux through KCa3.1 channel induces delayed activation of ASK1 and JNK, leading to ASC oligomerization or NLRP3 inflammasome by LP and metabolic inflammation.</p>

<caption><p>Graphic summary. LP, an effector combination activating inflammasome related to metabolic inflammation, induces generation of mitochondrial ROS, which activates TRPM2 channel on lysosome and releases lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>. ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling facilitated by ER-lysosome tethering replenishes diminished lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> content and supports sustained lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. ER emptying due to ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling activates SOCE. SOCE, in turn, is positively modulated by K<sup>+</sup> efflux through KCa3.1, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> efflux channel, mediating hyperpolarization-induced acceleration of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from lysosome activates CaMKII, which induces delayed activation of ASK1 and JNK. Delayed JNK activation leads to ASC phosphorylation and oligomerization, leading to formation of inflammasome complex together with NLRP3 and NEK7. K<sup>+</sup> efflux changes intracellular milieu and induces structural changes of NLRP3 or NLRP3 binding to PI(4)P on dispersed Golgi network, facilitating inflammasome activation. Golgi complex and microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) are not shown for clarity. (CASP1, caspase 1)</p></caption>

<p>Among diverse inflammasome activators, LP is a representative effector combination responsible for metabolic inflammation related to metabolic syndrome. However, mechanism of inflammasome activation by LP has been unclear. It is well known that PA induces stresses of organelle such as ER and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bachar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Korge et al., 2003</xref>). We observed that mitochondrial ROS accumulate by LP and activate lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through TRPM2. Roles of mitochondrial ROS in inflammasome activation has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Weber and Schilling, 2014</xref>), however, causal relationship between mitochondrial ROS and lysosomal events has not been addressed. Roles of TRPM2 in diabetes or β-cell function have been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Uchida and Tominaga, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). However, roles of TRPM2 in metabolic inflammation was not studied.</p>
<p>While we have shown roles of TRPM2 in inflammasome and metabolic inflammation, TRPM2 exists on both plasma membrane and lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Roles of plasma membrane TRPM2 in inflammasome by high glucose or particulate materials have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tseng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhong et al., 2013</xref>), while the role of TMRP2 in inflammation activation by lipid stimulators related to metabolic inflammation has not been addressed. However, we observed no activation of TRPM2 current on the plasma membrane of Mφs treated with LP, arguing against roles of plasma membrane TRPM2 in inflammasome by LP.</p>
<p>Further, dissipation of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> reservoir by bafilomycin A1 abrogated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase by LP, strongly supporting roles of lysosomal TRPM2 rather than plasma membrane TRPM2 in inflammation by LP.</p>
<p>We observed decreased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> in inflammasome activation by LP, which was due to ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling through IP<sub>3</sub>R to replenish diminished [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> after lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Previous papers have shown roles of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> in inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), however, role of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> replenishing reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> in inflammasome has not been addressed. Direct Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux from ER to cytoplasm which was reported in inflammasome activation by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee et al., 2012</xref>) cannot explain ER→lysosome refilling or abrogation of LP-induced increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by bafilomycin A1 which would not decrease but increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> after ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release into cytoplasm due to abrogated lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sanurjo et al., 2014</xref>). Likely due to ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release to replenish reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub>, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> was reduced, which in turn induced SOCE. Then, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx appears to replenish ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> after ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> loss due to ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling. Roles of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in inflammasome have been suggested, while extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was unrelated to ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tseng et al., 2017</xref>). STIM1 aggregation and its colocalization with ORAI1 strongly support SOCE in inflammasome by LP to replenish ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vaca, 2010</xref>), which is different from activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>- sensing receptor by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> reported in ATP-induced inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). We have observed that BTP2 inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through ORAI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bogeski et al., 2010</xref>) suppressed LP-induced inflammasome, suggesting that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is a process of SOCE through STIM1/ORAI1 channel activated by ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion rather than a direct extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into cytoplasm through TRPM2 on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhong et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, these results additionally support roles of lysosomal TRPM2 but not plasma membrane TRPM2 in LP-induced inflammasome.</p>
<p>We observed that K<sup>+</sup> efflux occurs in inflammasome by LP, similar to that by other activators. K<sup>+</sup> efflux through KCa3.1 channel appears to induce NLRP3 binding to NEK7 and oligomerization which was inhibited by TRAM-34 or <italic>Kcnn4</italic> KO. Previous papers suggested roles of KCa3.1 channel in SOCE, while such relationship was unrelated to inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Duffy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gao et al., 2010</xref>). A KCa3.1 channel activator together with LPS has been reported to induce IL-1β release; however, roles of KCa3.1 channel in authentic inflammasome have not been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Schroeder et al., 2017</xref>). Although we observed significant roles of KCa3.1 channel in inflammasome activation, contribution of other Ca<sup>2+</sup>- activated K<sup>+</sup> channels such as BK channels cannot be eliminated since iberitoxin, a BK channel inhibitor, has been reported to inhibit ATP-induced inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Schroeder et al., 2017</xref>). However, relationship between BK channel and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux was not studied. Previous papers also reported roles of TWIK2 channel, a two-pore K<sup>+</sup> channel, in K<sup>+</sup> efflux in ATP- induced inflammasome, which was inhibited by quinine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Di et al., 2017</xref>). Role of THIK-1, another two-pore K<sup>+</sup> channel in IL-1β release from microglia by ATP has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Madry et al., 2018</xref>). However, inflammasome by LP was not inhibited by quinine. Further, relationship between K<sup>+</sup> efflux through two-pore K<sup>+</sup> channels and SOCE was not studied. Relationship between ATP-induced P2X7 activation and K<sup>+</sup> efflux could be distinct from coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and K<sup>+</sup> efflux by lysosomotropic agents or other events primarily affecting lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Di et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Muñoz-Planillo et al., 2013</xref>). Such differences could explain no effect of quinine on LP-induced inflammasome or undiminished lysosomotropic agents-induced inflammasome in <italic>THIK-1</italic>-KO Mφs or microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Drinkall et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, we have shown the sequential events from mitochondrial ROS-induced lysosomal TRPM2 channel activation to ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling and SOCE coupled with KCa3.1 K<sup>+</sup> efflux channel activation in inflammasome by LP and metabolic inflammation (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref></italic></bold>), which could also be applied to that by other lysosomotropic agents. These results suggest mitochondrial ROS-lysosomal TRPM2 axis as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of metabolic inflammation. Elucidation of KCa3.1 channel as the K<sup>+</sup> efflux channel in inflammasome and its role in facilitation of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through SOCE would provide another target for modulation of inflammasome that is activated in a variety of diseases or conditions in addition to metabolic syndrome. ER→lysosome refilling might have implication in diverse conditions or diseases associated with lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes such as autophagy, vaccination or inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Park et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tahtinen et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>This manuscript proposes a complex incoherent model involving Ca2+ signaling in inflammasome activation. The experimental approaches used to study the calcium dynamics are highly problematic and the results shown are of very poor quality.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The analysis of lysosomal Ca2+release is being carried out after many hours of treatment. Such evidence is not meaningful to claim that PA activates Ca2+ efflux from lysosome and even if this phenomenon was robust, it is not doubtful that such kinetics are meaningful for the regulation of inflammasome activation. Furthermore, the evidence for lysosomal Ca2+ release is indirect and relies on a convoluted process that doesn't make any conceptual sense to me. In addition to these major shortcomings, the indirect evidence of perilysosomal Ca2+ elevation is also of very poor quality and from the standpoint of my expertise in calcium signaling, the data are incredulous. The use of GCaMP3-ML1, *transiently transfected* into BMDMs is highly problematic. The efficiency of transfection in BMDMs is always extremely low and overexpression of the sensor in a few rare cells can lead to erroneous observations. The overexpression also results in gross mislocalization of such membrane-bound sensors. The accumulation of GCaMP3-ML1 in the ER of these cells would prevent any credible measurements of perilysosomal Ca2+ signals. A meaningful investigation of this process in primary macrophages requires the generation of a mouse line wherein the sensor is expressed at low levels in myeloid cells, and shown to be localized almost exclusively in the lysosomal membrane. The mechanistic framework built around these major conceptual and technical flaws is not especially meaningful and since these are foundational results, I cannot take the main claims of this study seriously.</p>
<p>A few transfected cells may overexpress the protein through a strong promoter but this is not ideal. For reliable Ca2+ measurements, one needs low expression of the sensor in a substantially high percentage of cells. This can only be demonstrated by showing the time lapse of Ca2+ responses in the macrophages. More generally, I have nearly 2 decades of experience working with primary BMDMs and it is widely known that primary BMDMs are incredibly difficult to transfect - it is the nature of these cells. The claim that they get high efficiency of transfection is frankly too incredulous to take seriously.</p>
<p>(2) The cytosolic Ca2+ imaging shown in figure 1C doesn't make any sense. It looks like a snapshot of basal Ca2+ many hours after PA treatment - calcium elevations are highly dynamic. Snapshot measurements are not helpful and analyses of Calcium dynamics requires a recording over a certain timespan. Unfortunately, this technical approach has been used throughout the manuscript. Also, BAPTA-AM abrogates IL-1b secretion because IL-1b transcription is Ca2+ dependent - the result shown in figure 1D does not shed light on anything to do with inflammasome activation and it is misleading to suggest that.</p>
<p>(3) Trpm2-/- macrophages are known to be hyporesponsive to inflammatory stimuli - the reduced secretion of IL-1b by these macrophages is not novel. From a mechanistic perspective, this study does not add much to that observation and the proposed role of TRPM2 as a lysosomal Ca2+ release channel is not substantiated by good quality Ca2+ imaging data (see point 3 above). Furthermore, the study assumes that TRPM2 is a lysosomal ion channel. One paper reported TRPM2 in the lysosomes but this is a controversial claim, with no replication or further development in the last 14 years. This core assumption can be highly misleading to readers unfamiliar with TRPM2 biology and it is necessary to present credible evidence that TRPM2 is functional in the lysosomal membrane of macrophages. Ideally, this line of investigation should rest on robust demonstration of TRPM2 currents in patch-clamp electrophysiology of lysosomes. If this is not technically feasible for the authors, they should at least investigate TRPM2 localization on lysosomal membranes of macrophages.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, authors showed TRPM2 localization but these results are problematic. The authors provide no information on what TRPM2 antibody they used for this study and whether it has been validated by use of knockouts. The staining shows very high amounts of TRPM2 all across the cell - even more than LAMP2. In reality, TRPM2 expression in macrophages is very low. Are the authors overexpressing TRPM2? These data only add to my concerns about this manuscript.</p>
<p>(4) Apigenin and Quercetin are highly non-specific and their effects cannot be attributed to CD38 inhibition alone. Such conclusions need strong loss of function studies using genetic knockouts of CD38 - or at least siRNA knockdown. Importantly, if indeed TRPM2 is being activated downstream of CD38, this should be easily evident in whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology. TRPM2 currents can be resolved using this technique and authors have Trpm2-/- cells for proper controls. Authors attempted these experiments but the results are of very poor quality. If the TRPM2 current is being activated through ADPR generated by CD38 (in response to PA stimulation), then it is very odd that authors need to include 200 uM cADPR to see TRPM2 current (Fig. 3A). Oddly, even these data cast great doubt on the technical quality of the electrophysiology experiments. Even with such high concentrations of cADPr, the TRPM2 current is tiny and Trpm2-/- controls are missing. The current-voltage relationship is not shown, and I feel that the results are merely reporting leak currents seen in measurements with substandard seals. Also 20 uM ACA is not a selective inhibitor of TRPM2 - relying on ACA as the conclusive diagnostic is problematic.</p>
<p>(5) TRPM2 is expressed in many different cell lines. The broad metabolic differences observed by the authors in the Trpm2-/- mice cannot be attributed to macrophage-mediated inflammation. Such a conclusion requires the study of mice wherein Trpm2 is deleted selectively in macrophages or at least in the cells of the myeloid lineage.</p>
<p>(6) The ER-Lysosome Ca2+ refilling experiments rely on transient transfection of organelle-targeted sensors into BMDMs. See point #1 to understand why I find this approach to be highly problematic. Furthermore the data procured are also not convincing and lack critical controls (localization of sensors has not been demonstrated and their response to acute mobilization of Ca2+ has not been shown inspire any confidence in these results).</p>
<p>(7) Authors claim that SCOE is coupled to K+ efflux. But there is no credible evidence that SOCE is activated in PA stimulated macrophages. The data shown in Fig 4 supp 1 do not investigate SOCE in a reliable manner - the conclusion is again based on snapshot measurements and crude non-selective inhibitors. The correct way to evaluate SOCE is to record cytosolic Ca2+ elevations over a period of time in absence and presence of extracellular Ca2+. However, even such recordings can be unreliable since the phenomenon is being investigated hours after PA stimulation. So, the only definitive way to demonstrate that Orai channels are indeed active during this process is through patch clamp electrophysiology of PA stimulated cells.</p>
<p>Authors failed to respond to these concerns in a credible manner and simply tried to obfuscate the matters with extraneous arguments and wild claims. The revised manuscript was not a significant improvement. I have major concerns with this manuscript and let it be on record that this is very poor-quality science.</p>

<p>In this manuscript by Kang et. al., the authors investigated the mechanisms of K+-efflux-coupled SOCE in NLRP3 inflammasome activation by LP（LPS+PA, and identified an essential role of TRPM2-mediated lysosomal Ca2+ release and subsequent IP3Rs-mediated ER Ca2+ release and store depletion in the process. K+ efflux is shown to be mediated by a Ca2+-activated K+ channel (KCa3.1). LP-induced cytosolic Ca2+ elevation also induced a delayed activation of ASK1 and JNK, leading to ASC oligomerization and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Overall, this is an interesting and comprehensive study that has identified several novel molecular players in metabolic inflammation. The manuscript can benefit if the following concerns could be addressed.</p>
<p>(1) The expression of TRPM2 in the lysosomes of macrophages needs to more definitively established. For instance, the cADPR-induced TRPM2 currents should be abolished in the TRPM2 KO macrophages. Can you show the lysosomal expression of TRPM2, either with an antibody if available or with a fluorescently-tagged TRPM2 overexpression construct?</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, the authors did not perform the KO control experiment to support that cADPR-induced currents were indeed mediated by TRPM2. Additonally, the co-localization analyses failed to convincingly establish the lysosomal perimeter membrane residence of TRPM2.</p>
<p>(2) Can you use your TRPM2 inhibitor ACA to pharmacologically phenocopy some results, e.g., about [Ca2+]ER, [Ca2+]LY, and [Ca2+]i from the TRPM2 knockout?</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, most suggested experiments were not performed. In the only experiment that was conducted, Figure 3-figure supplement 1A, the effect of ACA was marginal.</p>
<p>(3) In Fig. S4A, bathing the cells in zero Ca2+ for three hours might not be ideal. Can you use a SOCE inhibitor, e.g, YM-58483, to make the point?</p>
<p>The specific suggested experiment was not performed.</p>
<p>(4) In Fig. 1A, you need a positive control, e.g., ionomycin, to show that the GPN response was selectively reduced upon LP treatment.</p>
<p>Results in a previous study cannot be used to substitute the missing control experiments in the current study.</p>

<p>Ans) We agree with the reviewer’s concern that transfection efficiency could be low in BMDMs together with possible mislocalization of GCAMP3-ML1. However, in our experiment, transfection of BMDM with test plasmids resulted in good expression of test proteins. Below, we present our data showing good transfection efficiency of BMDM cells, while a different plasmid was employed.</p>

<p>Ans) We agree with the reviewer’s concern that snapshot could lead to false conclusion. We have not traced cytosolic Ca2+ content after treatment with LPS + PA. However, we have traced
lysosomal Ca2+ and ER Ca2+ for more than 15 min, which was presented in Figure 4B. We also agree with the comment that BAPTA-AM might affect transcription of pro-IL-1β. We have conducted immunoblot analysis after treatment with LPS+PA in the presence of BAPTA-AM. Protein band of pro-IL-1β was not affected by BAPTA-AM treatment suggesting no effect of BAPTA-AM on transcription or translation of pro-IL-1β, which was added to Figure 1D, as suggested.</p>

<p>Ans) We agree with the reviewer’s comment that TRPM2. However, we have shown that TRPM2 current was not activated in the plasma membrane of BMDMs after treatment with LPS+PA. We also agree with the reviewer’s comment that inflammatory cytokine release from TRPM2 KO cells or inflammasome response of TRPM2 KO macrophages to ROS or nanoparticles has been reported to be reduced; however, the role of TRPM2 in metabolic inflammation or inflammasome activation in response to lipid stimulators has not been shown, as discussed in the new lines 9-10 from the bottom of page 18. Regarding the role of lysosomal TRPM2 in inflammation, we have shown that bafilomycin A1 treatment abrogated increase of cytosolic Ca2+ by LPS+PA (Figure 3-figure supplement 1D), supporting the role of lysosome and lysosomal Ca2+ in inflammasome activation by LPS+PA.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment that TRPM2 expression on lysosome needs to be tested. We conducted confocal microscopy after immunofluorescence staining using anti-TRMP2 and -LAMP2 antibodies, which showed a certain portion of TRPM2 was colocalized with LAMP-2. This result substantiating TRPM2 expression on lysosome of macrophages was incorporated as Figure 2-figure supplement 1A.</p>

<p>Ans) We agree with the reviewer’s comment that effects of apigenin and quercetin could be due to mechanisms other than inhibition of CD38-mediated inflammasome activation. Indeed, that is the reason we have used TRPM2 KO mice and cells. Small TRPM2 current after treatment with high concentrations of cADPr might suggest the minor role of plasma membrane of TRPM2 in macrophage. Regarding concern about ACA, we added data showing inhibition of IL-1β release in response to LPS+PA by ACA as a new Figure 3-figure supplement 1A.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Ans) We agree with the reviewer’s comment that TRPM2 in cells other than macrophage might have affected the results. Thus, we have conducted in vitro stimulation of TRPM2-KO primary peritoneal macrophages with LPS+PA. We have observed that IL-1β release of TRPM2-KO macrophages in response in vitro treatment with LPS+PA was significantly lower than that from wild-type macrophages (Figure 2C &amp; D), showing the role of TRPM2 in macrophages in inflammasome activation by LPS+PA, which could be independent of TRPM2 in tissues or cells other than macrophages.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Ans) We agree with the reviewer’s comment that transfection or ER-targeted Ca2+ sensor could have artifactual effects. However, we have studied ER-Lysosome Ca2+ experiment using not only GEM-CEPIAer but also using D1ER, a FRET-based ER Ca2+ sensor which has an advantage of short distance of molecular interaction. Thus, we believe that changes of ER Ca2+ after treatment with LPS+PA is not due to an artifactual effect. Multiple contact between VAPA and ORP1L (Figure 4E) also supports ER-lysosome contact, likely facilitating ER-lysosome Ca2+ flux.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Ans) We agree with the reviewer’s comment that the final proof of SOCE activation is activation of Orai channel evidenced by electrophysiology. However, we have shown STIM1 aggregation colocalized with Ora1, which is another strong evidence of SOCE channel activation (Vaca L. Cell Calcium 47:199, 2010). Such a paper showing the role of SOCE aggregation in SOCE activation was incorporated in the text (line 4 from the bottom of page 10) and References.</p>

<p>In this manuscript by Kang et. al., the authors investigated the mechanisms of K+-efflux-coupled SOCE in NLRP3 inflammasome activation by LP（LPS+PA, and identified an essential role of TRPM2-mediated lysosomal Ca2+ release and subsequent IP3Rs-mediated ER Ca2+ release and store depletion in the process. K+ efflux is shown to be mediated by a Ca2+-activated K+ channel (KCa3.1). LP-induced cytosolic Ca2+ elevation also induced a delayed activation of ASK1 and JNK, leading to ASC oligomerization and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Overall, this is an interesting and comprehensive study that has identified several novel molecular players in metabolic inflammation. The manuscript can benefit if the following concerns could be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) The expression of TRPM2 in the lysosomes of macrophages needs to be more definitively established. For instance, the cADPR-induced TRPM2 currents should be abolished in the TRPM2 KO macrophages. Can you show the lysosomal expression of TRPM2, either with an antibody if available or with a fluorescently-tagged TRPM2 overexpression construct?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ans) We agree with the reviewer’s comment that TRPM2 expression on lysosome needs to be tested. We conducted confocal microscopy after immunofluorescent staining using anti-TRMP2 and -LAMP2 antibodies, which showed a certain portion of TRPM2 was colocalized with LAMP2. This result was incorporated as Figure 2-figure supplement 1A.</p>

<p>(2) Can you use your TRPM2 inhibitor ACA to pharmacologically phenocopy some results, e.g., about [Ca2+]ER, [Ca2+]LY, and [Ca2+]i from the TRPM2 knockout?
Ans) We agree with the reviewer’s comment that the effect of ACA on other experimental results needs to be shown. We did not study the effect of ACA on Ca2+ flux; however, we have observed that ACA inhibited IL-1β release in response to LPS+PA. This data was incorporated as Figure 3-figure supplement 1A.</p>

<p>(3) In Fig. S4A, bathing the cells in zero Ca2+ for three hours might not be ideal. Can you use a SOCE inhibitor, e.g, YM-58483, to make the point?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ans) We agree with the reviewer’s comment that SOCE inhibitor experiment would be necessary in addition to the experiment employing zero Ca2+. In fact, we have already used two SOCE inhibitors (2-APB and BTP2) (Figure 4-fig. supplement 1 B-D. Particularly, BTP2 experiment could eliminate possible role of ER Ca2+ inhibition that might occur when 2-APB was employed.</p>

<p>(4) In Fig. 1A, you need a positive control, e.g., ionomycin, to show that the GPN response was selectively reduced upon LP treatment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ans) We did not employ ionomycin as a control in this study. In our previous study using other agents inducing lysosomal Ca2+ efflux, we have observed lysosomal Ca2+ efflux with intact subsequent ionomycin response. While we did not include ionomycin in the current paper, we are positive that ionomycin response would be preserved.</p>

<p>(5) In Fig. 4B, the red label should read &quot;BAPTA-1 Dextran&quot;, but not &quot;GAPTA-1 Dextran&quot;.</p>
<p>(6) Writing should be improved in many sections.</p>
