<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>In most bacteria, division depends on a cytoskeletal structure, the Z ring, which serves as a scaffold for recruiting additional proteins, with which it forms the machinery responsible for division, the divisome. The detailed architecture of the ring, in particular the mechanisms of assembly, stabilization, and disassembly, are still largely unknown. Here, we highlight the role of FtsZ-associated proteins (Zaps) in stabilizing the Z ring by crosslinking the filaments. Among Zap proteins, ZapD binds the C-terminal domain of FtsZ, which serves as a hub for its regulation. We demonstrate that ZapD crosslinks FtsZ filaments in solution into toroidal structures formed by an arrangement of short, curved filaments. Using cryo-electron tomography combined with biochemical analysis, we reveal the three-dimensional organization of FtsZ within the toroids, shedding light on the crosslinking mechanism by ZapD. In spite of the compositional simplicity of our reconstituted system, the structural organization of the FtsZ polymers by ZapD appears to be compatible with the current model of the Z ring in the bacterial cell.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bacterial cell division is mediated by a multiprotein complex known as the divisome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The components of the divisome interact reversibly to form a division ring that drives cytokinesis. The FtsZ protein, a structural homolog of eukaryotic tubulin with which it shares its GTPase and polymerization activities, is central to this process in most bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. FtsZ is the main component of the Z ring, a structure formed at mid-cell during cell division, which provides a scaffold for recruiting other division proteins and is supposed to be essential for constricting the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Z ring formation requires FtsZ polymerization to form single-stranded filaments, which depends on the GTPase activity of FtsZ. GTP binding and hydrolysis induce a conformational change in each monomer that modifies its binding potential, enabling them to follow a treadmilling behavior, similar to that of actin filaments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In response to environmental conditions, FtsZ filaments can further assemble into various structures such as bundles, sheets, toroids, or spirals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The molecular components involved in cell division must be in the right place at the right time during the cell cycle. Several factors in this spatiotemporal regulation modulate FtsZ assembly. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, FtsA and ZipA tether FtsZ to the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and, together with a set of FtsZ-associated proteins (Zaps), stabilize the ring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Conversely, negative modulators inhibit FtsZ assembly at other sites, namely Min proteins at the polar regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and SlmA on the nucleoid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Most of these modulators interact with FtsZ through its carboxy-terminal end, which acts as a central hub that modulates division assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To date, a high-resolution structure of the Z ring is still missing. Most data support an arrangement of short FtsZ filaments distributed in patches along the equatorial circle, and held together by their lateral interactions and interactions with Zap proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Cross-linking of filaments by Zaps is critical to maintain the juxtaposed organization of filaments into a ring structure, which may also be relevant to the functionality of the divisome and to the mechanism of force generation in cytokinesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Zap proteins have overlapping functions in stabilizing the Z ring within dividing cells. Individually, they are dispensable for division, though resulting in less compact Z rings in the absence of individual genes, while co-knock-out of two or more Zaps leads to cell elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The different Zap proteins share no sequence homology, and their structure and mechanism of filament crosslinking differ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Zap proteins may also participate in the active removal of FtsZ from the septum at the final stage of constriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and in guiding the Z ring to the replication terminus region of the chromosome, through interaction with MatP to form the scaffolding anchor called Ter-linkage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>ZapD is the only Zap protein known to crosslink FtsZ by binding its C-terminal domain, suggesting a key stabilizing function of the Z ring structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). ZapD is a symmetrical dimer consisting of an α-helical domain and a β-sheet domain containing a positively charged binding pocket required for crosslinking and bundling FtsZ filaments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. ZapD binds to the C-terminal region of FtsZ through electrostatic interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. ZapD crosslinks FtsZ filaments, promoting bundling and significantly reducing the GTPase activity of FtsZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The mechanism underlying the bundling of FtsZ filaments is still unknown, although a model of how ZapD crosslinks adjacent FtsZ filaments has been proposed based on the structural analysis of ZapD-FtsZ interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. In this model, the ZapD dimer connects two FtsZ filaments through the C-terminal domain, which could organize them in a parallel or antiparallel orientation due to the flexibility provided by the flexible linker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). However, the experimental validation of this model is still missing. Characterizing how ZapD crosslinks FtsZ filaments can shed light on the molecular mechanism behind Z ring assembly.</p>

<p><bold>a</bold> Scheme of the FtsZ protein and its interaction with ZapD. E. coli FtsZ (blue) monomers in solution oligomerize depending on the buffer conditions. Upon GTP binding, FtsZ homopolymerizes directionally, assembling single stranded filaments. ZapD is a robust dimer (magenta) that interacts directly with FtsZ, crosslinking filaments by promoting lateral interactions between them. Although the molecular mechanism is still unclear, the current hypothesis of interaction assumes dimers of ZapD crosslinking two FtsZ filaments through the C-terminal region of FtsZ, expecting at around 2:1 (FtsZ:ZapD) molar ratio in an homogeneous bundle. According to this model, the orientation of the FtsZ filaments could be parallel or antiparallel, allowing the growth and treadmilling of the filaments. However, the mechanism of assembly of dynamic high-order structures is still unknown. <bold>b</bold> Turbidity assays measuring the absorbance at 350 nm of samples containing 5 µM FtsZ and increasing concentrations of ZapD.

<p>Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) combined with biochemical and biophysical assays to study the structural organization of FtsZ polymers in the presence of ZapD. This integrated approach revealed that ZapD promotes the assembly of FtsZ filaments into toroidal polymers in solution, which is consistent with the low resolution structure of the Z ring visualized <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Our findings allowed us to propose a molecular mechanism that leads to toroid formation, providing valuable information for understanding Z ring stabilization driven by crosslinking of division proteins.</p>

<title>ZapD dimer interacts with FtsZ-GDP oligomers</title>
<p>Previous structural studies identified a direct interaction of ZapD through the C-terminal domain or central hub of FtsZ, finding charged residues involved in the interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. To independently confirm these results, we studied the interaction between FtsZ-GDP and ZapD by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) (Supplementary Fig. 1). First, we confirmed that ZapD forms stable dimers (Supplementary Fig. 1a (I) and b), in agreement with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. On the other hand, unpolymerized FtsZ-GDP self-assembled from monomers into dimers and other oligomeric species in small proportion, as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. 1a (II)). When the two proteins were mixed, they formed hetero-complexes with a binding stoichiometry of 2 molecules of ZapD per FtsZ (Supplementary Fig. 1a (III-IV) consistent with the proposed interaction model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. In addition, we also confirmed the interaction of both proteins by fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (Supplementary Fig. 2a and b). In these experiments, an increase in fluorescence anisotropy or diffusion time, respectively, suggests the formation of larger particles as a result of protein-protein interactions.</p>

<title>ZapD binding promotes the bundling of FtsZ-GTP polymers</title>
<p>ZapD acts as a crosslinker of FtsZ filaments promoting bundling in solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, although the molecular mechanism of how ZapD crosslinks filaments remains elusive. To decipher the biochemical features underlying the bundling process, we analyzed the dependence of the formation of large FtsZ bundles or high-order FtsZ polymer structures on ZapD concentration using turbidity measurements at 350 nm. GTP-FtsZ (5 or 10 µM) filaments had negligible turbidity like ZapD alone (1 - 40 µM). However, upon the addition of ZapD, the turbidity of FtsZ polymers increased to reach a maximum signal at around 10 µM ZapD (ZapD-FtsZ molar ratio of around two), the level of which did not change significantly at higher ZapD concentrations assayed (40 - 80 µM, equivalent to a ZapD-FtsZ molar ratio from 8 to 16) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 3).</p>
<p>Additionally, ZapD-driven FtsZ filament crosslinking resulted in a significant decrease in the GTPase activity of FtsZ, reaching 20% at equimolar or higher ZapD concentrations in the sample (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 4), in agreement with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The formation of bundles at different buffer and protein conditions showed a dynamic behavior (Supplementary Fig. 3). These structures disassembled over time even before the exhaustion of GTP, which suggest a transient interaction with ZapD. However, recurrent replenishment of GTP allowed partial recovery of the turbidity signal, suggesting rapid reassembly of the FtsZ bundles (Supplementary Fig. 3e).</p>
<p>To determine the correspondence of the concentration dependence of the steady-state turbidity (linked to the formation of FtsZ bundles or high-order structures driven by ZapD; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>) to the amount of ZapD bound to the FtsZ binding sites, we employed the analytical centrifugation sedimentation velocity assays previously used to characterize the binding of ZapD to GDP-FtsZ. This assay allowed us to separate ZapD-FtsZ bundles from ZapD free in solution and calculate the concentration of the unbound ZapD from the interference signal of the slowly sedimenting protein, which is behind the rapid sedimentation of the heavy ZapD-FtsZ complexes. Using this value of free ZapD and the known input concentrations of ZapD and FtsZ, we can compute the concentration of bound ZapD and the binding density of ZapD in the bundle (moles of ZapD dimer bound per mole of FtsZ monomer) at a given ZapD total concentration. We found that the bundles formed in the 5 - 10 µM ZapD region contained an estimated ZapD binding density of around 0.2 (one ZapD dimer for every four-six FtsZ monomers), while the ZapD density at the bundle in the 30 - 40 µM ZapD region was 0.5 (one ZapD dimer for every two FtsZ monomers). These results are consistent with parallel co-sedimentation assays and further analysis by SDS-PAGE showing enrichment of ZapD in the pellet containing the FtsZ bundles at high ZapD concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 5).</p>
<p>These findings show that the ZapD binding density in the polymers increases with ZapD concentration. We next carry out cryo-EM and ET studies to determine if this feature may impact the structural organization of the bundles formed.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>ZapD facilitates the formation of FtsZ-GTP toroidal high-order structures</title>
<p>Previous studies have visualized bundles with similar features by negative-stain transmission electron microscopy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Here, cryo-EM enabled us to avoid any staining artifact or structure distortion due to adsorption or flattening upon drying of the grid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, as well as to resolve single filaments. In the presence of GTP, FtsZ polymerized into thin filaments of variable length and curvature (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Upon adding equimolar amounts of ZapD, corresponding to the subsaturating ZapD binding densities described in the previous section, FtsZ filaments assembled into bundles that predominantly form circular toroidal structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 6a), making them a compelling study target. A close-up view of the FtsZ toroid suggests a partially ordered arrangement of filaments in the toroidal structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>

By measuring the shortest and longest axes, we determined that the circularity of the structure was 0.92 ± 0.1 and 0.85 ± 0.1 for the outer and inner diameters, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 6c).

<p>Cryo-ET revealed the dense packing of the toroidal structures, with numerous densities connecting the FtsZ filaments in all directions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-c</xref>, Supplementary Figs. 7a and 8a). Zoomed-in views of the toroids in the XY plane showed that the toroid consists of rather short filament segments arranged almost parallel to each other (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 8a). However, cross-sectional views of the toroids revealed elongated structures rather than filament cross-sections along the Z-axis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> left, Supplementary Fig. 9a). We then extracted the toroid isosurface from the tomograms to precisely visualize its 3D structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> right-e, Supplementary Fig. 8b-e and Supplementary video 1). The isosurface confirmed the presence of extended structures along Z, with much greater elongation than expected from the missing wedge effect on single FtsZ filaments (for comparison, see Supplementary Fig. 10). The vertically extended structures appeared to correspond to filaments connected or decorated by additional densities along the Z-axis (Supplementary Fig. 9b). These densities were only observed in the presence of ZapD (Supplementary Fig. 10b), suggesting that they are ZapD connections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref> and supplementary Fig. 8e and 9b). Taken together, these results indicate that toroids are built and stabilized by ZapD-FtsZ interactions that can be established in all directions.</p>

<title>ZapD plasticity is essential for toroid shape and stabilization</title>
<p>Next, we manually labelled the connecting densities in the toroid isosurfaces to study their arrangement and connectivity with the FtsZ filaments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>; Supplementary Movie 2). We note that the high density of the toroids and the wide range of conformations of the densities in these structures prevented the use of subtomogram averaging to resolve their structure and spatial arrangement in the toroids. Most connections showed a characteristic bi-spherical shape between the filaments, reminiscent of ZapD dimers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 b-d</xref>). We found lateral linkages between two parallel FtsZ filaments at the same toroid height (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4. b</xref>). FtsZ filaments at different heights can connect diagonally through ZapD proteins as bridging units, forming a complex 3D mesh (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c, d</xref> and Supplementary Movie 2). We also identified the presence of putative ZapD proteins decorating a single FtsZ filament, which can be used to connect other nearby filaments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). In addition, more than one crosslink between two filaments occurs, allowing stronger attachment between the filaments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Estimation of the precise number of ZapD molecules per FtsZ or the number of bonds per filament is difficult due to their intrinsic heterogeneous organization. However, we could observe a high number of connections stabilizing the toroidal structure, which correlates with the increase in ZapD binding density at higher ZapD concentrations, as discussed in the next section.</p>

<p>Visualization of the filament organization in 3D showed that the toroid is formed by an arrangement of short, highly crosslinked filaments, forming a dense 3D mesh (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 8e, 9b and 11). The short filament length, resulting in gaps between concomitant filaments, does not correlate with a higher number of ZapD connections (Supplementary Fig. 11), indicating that ZapD is able to crosslink filaments in all directions through transient interactions without causing filament breakage. This could play an important mechanistic role in the fuctionality of the FtsZ macrostructures.</p>

<title>High concentrations of ZapD promote the structural reorganization of FtsZ polymers into straight bundles</title>
<p>Once we characterized the FtsZ high-order structures promoted at lower ZapD binding densities, we addressed the impact of increasing the ZapD density on the structural organization of the ZapD-FtsZ polymers. At high concentrations of ZapD (typically 40 - 60 µM representing a molar ratio of one to six to FtsZ), we observed the formation of straight bundles with striated patterns between the FtsZ filaments (Supplementary Fig. 12), as well as the presence of some toroidal structures (Supplementary Figs. 6a). Here, the high concentration of ZapD molecules increased the number of links between filaments and ultimately promoted the formation of straight bundles, indicating that the assembly of FtsZ-ZapD structures is a reversible process that strongly depends on the amount of ZapD proteins crosslinking the filaments. Toroids and curved bundles always coexist, but the predominance shifts from toroids to straight bundles at high ZapD concentrations, which implies that the number of transient crosslinks between filaments modulates the features of the assembled high-order structures, resulting in the reorganization of the toroidal structures to form straight bundles upon saturation of ZapD (Supplementary Fig. 12). We then explored how higher densities of ZapD lead to the formation of straight bundles using cryo-ET.</p>
<p>Using the same approach to visualize the toroids, we collected tomograms of the straight bundles and extracted their isosurfaces (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 7b, and Supplementary Movie 3). The straight bundles are formed at high ZapD concentrations and consist of a highly organized stack of well-aligned FtsZ filaments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). The connection of filaments by multiple putative ZapD proteins results in the straightening of the structure of the filaments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Interestingly, ZapD seems to crosslink FtsZ filaments from the top or the bottom, rather than laterally, forming a row of ZapD proteins interacting with both filaments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Here too, structural analysis by subtomogram averaging was not possible due to the crowding, preferential orientation, and heterogeneity of the connections. The distance between ZapD proteins provided a mean value of 4.5 ± 0.5 nm (Supplementary Fig. 13a), consistent with the size of FtsZ proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This observation suggests that most FtsZ proteins interact with the ZapD dimers that crosslink the filaments, in agreement with the ZapD enrichment in the bundles observed by sedimentation assays (Supplementary Fig. 5). On the other hand, we found that the presence of ZapD increased the distance between two FtsZ filaments connected by ZapD proteins compared with the spacing in the absence of ZapD, regardless of the amount of ZapD connections (from 5.9 ± 0.8 nm to 7.88 ± 2 nm in toroids and 7.6 ± 1.5 nm in straight bundles) (Supplementary Fig.13b). This indicates that ZapD not only connects FtsZ filaments laterally but spreads them apart, which could have important implications for the functionality of the Z ring.</p>

</fig>
<p>These results point out the relevant role of the number of connections between filaments (driven by ZapD binding) in the crosslinking mechanism (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The bundles formed at the high ZapD concentrations assayed (up to four molar excess of ZapD to FtsZ) correspond to a binding saturation regime in which one ZapD binds two FtsZ molecules connecting filaments, which straightens their structure and arranges them into large, highly organized straight bundles, while a lower number of connections provides freedom to form toroidal structures. This observation confirms that a certain number of ZapD-driven bonds are optimal for maintaining the preferential curvature of FtsZ filaments and enabling toroid assembly, establishing a structural dependence of assembled bundles on the number of ZapD-mediated bonds.</p>

FtsZ filaments can interact laterally with each other, forming single and double filaments upon GTP binding. At low concentrations of ZapD, only a few lateral connections are formed and thus no bundles can be assembled. However, at higher ZapD concentrations, more ZapD-mediated bonds are established, favouring the formation of bundles. Higher ZapD binding densty promotes the assembly of toroidal structures. A further increment in the number of ZapD connections, the bundle is enriched on ZapD binding density, which straightens up the filaments allowing the formation of straight bundles. The assembly of FtsZ high-order structures is dependent on the number of lateral crosslinking through ZapD dimers and some intermediate states are expected between the structures shown.

<title>Dimerization of ZapD is essential to form organized high-order FtsZ structures</title>
<p>Our results suggest that ZapD dimers connect two FtsZ filaments, although the role of dimerization has not yet been experimentally established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. We therefore investigated whether the dimerization of ZapD was essential for assembling straight bundles and toroidal structures. To this end, we produced a ZapD mutant (“mZapD”) by substituting three amino acids (R20, R116 and H140) involved in its dimerization by alanine, thus decreasing the stability of the dimerization interface (Supplementary Fig. 14a). mZapD can interact with unpolymerized FtsZ-GDP as evidenced by fluorescence anisotropy and FCS (Supplementary Fig. 14b and c). mZapD is still able to promote FtsZ bundle formation, showing a ~50% lower turbidity signal than for wild-type ZapD even at higher concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 14d). We also visualized these bundles by cryo-EM and observed the formation of thinner bundles (Supplementary Fig. 15b and c). However, toroidal structures and straight bundles were absent in these samples even at high concentrations of mZapD. This indicates that a stable dimerization interface is required to assemble complex ZapD-mediated structures (Supplementary Fig 15a).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we employed biochemical reconstitution and cryo-EM and cryo-ET to gain new insights into the structure and assembly of the bacterial divisome. In most bacteria, lateral crosslinking of filaments through the FtsZ-associated proteins (Zaps) is supposed to play a crucial role in assembling and stabilizing the Z ring, by however poorly understood mechanisms. To sight light on these, we studied the interaction between FtsZ and ZapD, one of the stabilizers of the division ring. We demonstrated that ZapD crosslinks FtsZ in solution into multilayered structures on a cellular scale. The three-dimensional architecture of this supramolecular structure consists of short, discontinuous FtsZ filaments connected laterally through ZapD molecules, as revealed by cryo-ET. In spite of the compositional simplicity of our reconstituted system, the structural organization of the FtsZ polymers by ZapD is compatible with the current model of the Z ring in the bacterial cell.</p>
<p>Our work demonstrates that ZapD can promote the assembly of FtsZ into higher-order toroidal structures in solution, formed by a meshwork of short, crosslinked filaments resembling those that form the division ring in bacterial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. These results are consistent with pre-curved FtsZ protofilaments, as suggested by the circular assemblies of FtsZ filaments flexibly attached to model membranes observed in several vitro reconstituted systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Besides, FtsZ can form ring-shaped structures with a 100-200 nm diameter on surfaces, as revealed by negative stain EM and AFM, which become even more prominent after FtsZ adsorption to lipid, carbon, or mica surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> or in the presence of molecular crowders such as methylcellulose or polyvinyl alcohol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Finally, cryo-EM of frozen-hydrated samples of highly concentrated (50 µM) FtsZ from B. subtilis with GMPCPP showed curved protofilaments that frequently coalesce into spirals or toroids, forming large aggregates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The formation of toroidal structures is compatible with the robust persistence length and preferential curvature of the FtsZ filaments adapted by nature to form bacterial-sized ring-like structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. ZapD helps to shape and stabilize the toroidal structure through crosslinking, spacing short FtsZ filaments further apart, from 5.9 ± 0.8 nm in the case of FtsZ-FtsZ interactions alone to 7.9 ± 2 nm in toroids and 7.6 ± 1.5 nm in straight bundles. Spacing filaments apart while crosslinking them by ZapD may facilitate a more dynamic organization, preventing rigid association and providing functional flexibility in bacterial cells.</p>
<p>We also demonstrated that ZapD-mediated FtsZ toroids recapitulate some of the structural features of the Z ring architecture <italic>in vivo.</italic> Based on super-resolution imaging and cryo-ET, the current model of the Z ring defines a somewhat discontinuous and heterogeneous structure composed of randomly overlapping filaments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. They arrange in a belt-like macromolecular entity containing nodes with a higher density of dispersed filaments confined to a toroidal zone around 80–100 nm wide (toroidal height) and a thickness of about 40–60 nm, located 13-16 nm below the inner membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. The toroidal structures promoted by ZapD showed dimensions in the same range (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 6b). However, the thickness and multilarity of the toroidal structures is significantly higher, likely due to the lack of other cellular components competing for the interaction with FtsZ. The Z ring model also suggests that FtsZ filaments are weakly associated with each other via protein factors such as Zaps and weak FtsZ-FtsZ interactions, which may play a crucial role in their functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Here we have shown that one of the Zap proteins can stabilize and promote associations between neighboring FtsZ filaments. Studying macrostructures stabilized by natural crosslinkers is crucial for understanding the molecular function of the division machinery.</p>
<p>Structural characterization of the toroids by cryo-ET enabled us to resolve the overall structure and identify putative ZapD dimers crosslinking the filaments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). However, we could not obtain structural details of the ZapD connectors due to the heterogeneity and density of the toroids, with significant variability in the conformations of the connections between the filaments, formed in all directions. These observations align with the fact that the interaction of ZapD with FtsZ occurs via the FtsZ’s central hub, which can offer additional spatial freedom to connect other filaments in various conformations, thus enabling different filament organizations and heterogeneity in the structure; moreover, they suggest that these crosslinkers act as modulators of ring structural dynamics, spacing filaments apart and allowing them to slide in an organized fashion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. The ability of FtsZ to treadmill directionally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, and the parallel or antiparallel organization of short, transiently crosslinked filaments, are considered essential for Z ring functionality and force constriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Thus, Zap proteins can ensure correct filament placement and stabilization, consistent with the toroidal structure assembled by ZapD.</p>
<p>We have found that the amount of ZapD bound to FtsZ filaments has a marked impact on the structural organization of the final higher-order polymer. In this regard, at the lower ZapD concentration regime required for bundling (corresponding to equimolar mixtures of ZapD and FtsZ), the toroids were the most prominent structures containing one ZapD dimer per four to six FtsZ molecules. Higher ZapD concentration increased the ZapD binding density in the polymers to one ZapD dimer per two FtsZ molecules, which led to a reorganization of the polymer bundles to form straight structures crosslinking the FtsZ filaments predominantly, structures never observed at lower ZapD concentrations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The increase in the number of ZapD-FtsZ contacts may reduce the flexibility required to form the toroidal structure, forcing filaments to adopt a large, straight bundle conformation. We observed slight differences in the spacing between filaments (Supplementary Fig. 13b) and a larger range of distances between filaments in the toroids than in the straight bundles. The latter is reasonable, as ZapD is the molecule linking filaments in both structures. Still, the amount of bound ZapD is different, allowing higher variability in the spacing in certain areas where the number of connections is lower.</p>
<p>We therefore hypothesize that the assembly of functional, curved FtsZ macrostructures only occurs within a stoichiometric range of ZapD-FtsZ interactions, and that an increase in crosslinking at higher ZapD concentrations causes the FtsZ polymer to form rigid, less dynamic straight bundles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Additionally, only a robust ZapD dimer can form FtsZ toroids and straight filaments, which indicates that certain binding strength is required to bundle the filaments and hold them in place. These observations, together with the high conformational variability found in ZapD connections, indicate that ZapD can modulate the behavior of the entire structure based on a concentration-dependent mechanism. This structural reorganization reflects the polymorphic nature of the assemblies formed by FtsZ, which would take a minor free energy perturbation to bring about significant changes in the geometry of the fibers due to modifications in environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the binding of ZapA (another member of the FtsZ-associated proteins family) to FtsZ in equimolar mixtures of ZapA and FtsZ resulted in the alignment and straightening of FtsZ filaments tethered to lipid bilayers by the proto-ring FtsA protein, as revealed by high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and quantitative image analysis (Caldas et al. 2019<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>). These structures corresponded to one ZapA tetramer per four FtsZ molecules in the polymer. Therefore, these straight parallel polymers, observed when ZapA is saturating the binding sites on the filament, resemble the straight bundles found in this study at the high ZapD concentration regime corresponding to ZapD binding saturation. How the state of association of ZapA and ZapD (tetramers and dimers, respectively) and membrane tethering determine the predominant structure formed in both systems remained to be analyzed under well-controlled conditions of protein compositions.</p>
<p>In summary, this work expands our current understanding of the structural organization and filament crosslinking of FtsZ polymers by the action of ZapD. The finding that ring morphology depends on the binding stoichiometry between FtsZ and the crosslinking ZapD provides valuable information to be combined with reconstitution assays in membrane systems currently underway to decipher how the FtsZ associated proteins are responsible for coordinating and maintaining the formation of the division ring. Moreover, our results will have implications for understanding the remodeling of other cytoskeletal polymer networks involved in essential cellular processes, such as cell motility or morphogenesis. Traditionally, the general assumption is that processes consuming chemical energy, such as the action of molecular motors, are the main drivers of dynamic filament remodeling of polymer networks. However, increasing evidence points to alternative cytoskeletal network remodeling mechanisms that do not rely on chemical energy consumption as those in which entropic forces act through diffusible crosslinkers, similar to ZapD and FtsZ polymers. These energy-independent mechanisms of polymer network remodeling via diffusible protein cross-linkers might also be relevant to optimize conditions for reverse engineering the division ring for improved force generation in minimal reconstituted systems for autonomous cell division.</p>

<title>Protein purification</title>
<p>ZapD protein has been overproduced and purified following the procedure previously described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> with some modifications. The bacterial strain was an <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) transformed with pET28b-h10-smt3-ZapD fusion plasmid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The cells were sonicated for 6-8 cycles of 20 secs and centrifuged at 40.000 rpm in MLA 80 rotor (Beckman coulter) for 45 min. The protein was eluted by chromatography in 5-ml HisTrap (GE Healthcare) and digested with Smt3-specific protease Ulp1 (SUMO protease encoded in Rosetta pTB145), at 1:1 molar relation. Digestion proceeded for two dialysis of 1 hour at 4°C to avoid protein precipitation. ZapD and His-Smt3 were separated by chromatography in 5-ml HisTrap (GE Healthcare), then the protein was eluted in a 5-ml HiTrap Desalting column (Healtcare) to eliminate completely possible traces of free phosphates in the buffer. Final concentration of ZapD was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient (ε) of 25230 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> and ZapD purity was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein fractions were frozen in buffer 50 mM KCL, 50 mM Tris-CL, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM DTT and 2% glycerol. ZapD mutant (mZapD) was purified following the same procedure using the corresponding plasmid. <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsZ was overproduced and purified following the calcium precipitation method described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Briefly, E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells were transformed with pET11b-FtsZ, grown in LB medium and selected with Ampicillin 100 μg/mL. After induction and growth, the pellet was resuspended in PEM buffer (50 mM PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA) and disrupted using a tip sonicator for 3-4 cycles. The lysate was then separated by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 x g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was mixed with 1 mM GTP, 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min to induce FtsZ polymerization and bundling. Subsequently, the FtsZ bundles were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 x g at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in PEM buffer and centrifuged again for 15 min at 20,000 x g, 4 °C, collecting the supernatant. Precipitation and resuspension steps were repeated to improve the purification. The buffer was then exchanged using an Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal filter unit 50 kDa (Merck KGaA). FtsZ purity was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient (ε) of 14000 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Protein solutions were aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further use.</p>

<title>Plasmid Design and Molecular Cloning</title>
<p>To generate the ZapD mutant (mZapD), seamless cloning method was used according to the provider’s protocol (ThermoFisher Scientific/Invitrogen GeneArt™ Seamless Cloning and Assembly Enzyme Mix (A14606)) using the plasmid pET28b-h10-smt3-ZapD and the primers listed in (Supplementary Table 1). All enzymes for cloning were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). Briefly, DNA fragments were amplified with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase andorigo primers (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Then, PCR products were treated with DpnI and combined using GeneArt Seamless Cloning and Assembly Enzyme Mix. The plasmid was propagated in E. coli OneShot TOP10 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and purified using NucleoBond Xtra Midi kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH, Duren, Germany). Directed site mutagenesis was made by substituting three amino acids in the ZapD sequence by Alanine (R20, R116, H140). The plasmid was then verified using Sanger Sequencing Service (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland).</p>

<title>Protein labelling</title>
<p>Covalent labelling of FtsZ with Alexa 488 the amino groups of N-terminal amino acid residue with Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester dye following the procedure previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. ZapD and mZapD were labelled with ATTO-647N carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester dye in the amino group. Before the reaction, ZapD was dialyzed in 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.5 and the probe was dissolved in Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 35-60 min at RT and stopped with 10 % Tris-HCl 1 M. The free dye was separated from labelled protein by a Hi-TRAP Desalting column (GE Healthcare). The final degree of labelling of FtsZ and ZapD was calculated from the molar absorption coefficients of the protein and the dye. It was around 0.5 moles of probe per mole of FtsZ and around 0.3/0.4 moles of dye per mole of ZapD.</p>

<title>Analytical ultracentrifugation; sedimentation velocity (SV) and sedimentation equilibrium (SE)</title>
<p>Sedimentation velocity assays were performed to detect the homogeneity and association state of individual proteins and the stoichiometry of the formed protein-protein complexes. In brief, the experiments were carried out at 43-48 Krpm in an Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge, equipped with UV–VIS absorbance and Raleigh interference detection systems. The sedimentation coefficient distributions were calculated by least-squares boundary modeling of sedimentation velocity data using the c(s) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> as implemented in the SEDFIT program. The s-values of the present species were corrected to standard conditions (pure water at 20°C, and extrapolated to infinite dilution) to obtain the corresponding standard s-values (s20,w) using the program SEDNTERP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>.

Sedimentation equilibrium of ZapD was carried out to confirm the association state of the protein in the same experimental conditions and concentration range tested by sedimentation velocity (2-30 µM). Short columns (100 µL) SE experiments were carried out at 14000 and 10000 rpm. Weight-average buoyant molecular weights were obtained by fitting a single-species model to the experimental data using the HeteroAnalysis program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, once corrected for temperature and buffer composition with the program SEDNTERP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Turbidity assay</title>
<p>Turbidity of protein samples was collected by measuring the absorbance at 350 nm in a TECAN plate reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Mannedorf, Switzerland). All samples reached a final volume of 50 μL in a 364-Well Flat-Bottom Microplate (UV-Star, Greiner Bio-One GmbH) before measuring the absorbance. Different concentrations of FtsZ and ZapD were premixed in the well-plate and measured before addition of GTP to extract subsequently the individual blank values. Concentrations of FtsZ and ZapD varied from 0 to 80 μM and buffer conditions are specified in each graph and the caption of the figures ranging from 50 to 500 mM KCl, 6 to 8 pH, always supplemented with 50 mM Tris-Cl and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Manual mixing was performed after addition of GTP and orbital oscillations for 5 sec in the TECAN were made prior to any measurement to avoid sedimentation of the samples. Time measurements were taken as specified in each condition. Reported values are the average of 3-12 independent measurements ± Standard deviation.</p>

<title>GTPase activity of FtsZ</title>
<p>GTPase activity of FtsZ was measured by quantification of the inorganic phosphate with a colorimetric assay (BIOMOL GREENÒ kit from ENZO life sciences) for two minutes. 5 μM FtsZ was used in our standard buffer (5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, pH 7) or buffers at higher KCl concentrations (50-500 mM KCl) and polymerization was triggered by 1 mM GTP. ZapD was added at different concentrations and premixed with FtsZ before addition of GTP. 13 μL fractions were added to a 96-Well Flat-Bottom Microplate (UV-Star, Greiner Bio-One GmbH) every 20 sec after addition of GTP and mixed with the Reaction buffer reaching 50 μL and 100 μL of BIOMOL GREEN reagent, to stop the reaction. After stopping the reaction, samples were incubated for 10 min at RT and the absorbance was measured at 620 nm in a Varioskan Flash plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Concentrations of inorganic Phosphate were calculated from a phosphate standard curve, while the GTPase activity reaction rate (V, mol P/mol FtsZ/ min) was determined from the slope of the linear part of phosphate accumulation curves.</p>

<title>FtsZ sedimentation assay</title>
<p>Purified ZapD (1-30 μM) was added to purified FtsZ (5 μM) in the working buffer (50 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), and GDP or GTP (1 mM) was added last to trigger FtsZ polymerization. The reaction mixtures with a final volume of 100 μl were processed at room temperature and centrifuged at low speed (10.000 rcf) using a table top centrifuge. At that point, 90 μl of supernatant was carefully collected and loaded in clean tubes with 1x loading dye. The rest of the supernatant was discarded and the pellets were resuspended in the original reaction volume buffer plus 1× loading dye (final concentration). The supernatants (10 μl) and pellets (10 μl) were resolved in a SDS-PAGE gel. The amount of ZapD and FtsZ were estimated by image analysis using ImageJ.</p>

<title>Preparation of EM grids</title>
<p>Cryo-EM grids were plunge frozen with a Vitrobot Mk.IV (Thermo Fischer Scientific) using 3 µL of the samples applied to previously glow discharged R 2/1 Holey Carbon Cu 200 mesh EM grids (Quantifoil). Samples were 10 µM FtsZ with or without ZapD or mZapD at different concentrations specified in each case (0 – 60 µM). Proteins were mixed in our working buffer containing 50 mM, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7. Samples were incubated for 2 minutes after the addition of 1 mM GTP to trigger polymerization. The Vitrobot was set to 4° C, 100% humidity, blot time 3 s, blot force 3. Whatman no. 1 filter paper was used for blotting and liquid ethane kept at liquid nitrogen temperatures was used as a cryogen for vitrification.</p>

<title>Tomogram reconstruction</title>
<p>Tilt series preprocessing was performed using the TOMOMAN package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/williamnwan/TOMOMAN">https://github.com/williamnwan/TOMOMAN</ext-link>). In brief, MotionCor2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> was used to align individual frames, followed by cumulative dose-weighting using an exposure-dependent attenuation function, as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. Dose-weighted tilt series were aligned using IMOD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> either by employing gold fiducials (if available) or by patch-tracking, and binned tomograms (pixel size 8.616 Å) were generated using weighted back-projection.

<title>Fluorescence anisotropy</title>
<p>Anisotropy measurements were performed using a TECAN plate reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Mannedorf, Switzerland). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 625 nm and 680 nm, respectively. ZapD or mZapD labelled with ATTO 647N were used as fluorescence tracer with a final concentration of 150 nM of ATTO-647N and supplemented with unlabeled ZapD reaching a concentration of 5 μM. FtsZ was added at increasing concentrations to analyze their interaction. Binding affinities (apparent K<sub>D</sub>) were determined by fitting the Hill equation to the normalized anisotropy data.

<title>Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)</title>
<p>FCS measurements were performed using a PicoQuant MicroTime200 system equipped with an Olympus 60x, NA1.2 UPlanApo water immersion objective. A pulsed 636 nm diode laser was used to excite fluorescence of Atto647N-labelled ZapD, mZapD or free Atto647N carboxylate (for calibration). Three measurements of 60 s each were performed per sample at room temperature (21°C), and three samples per condition were measured. The repetition rate of the pulsed laser was 26.7 MHz, and the average power was 1 µW at the objective back pupil. Fluorescence was collected through the same objective, spatially filtered through a 50 µm diameter pinhole, and spectrally filtered through a 690/70 nm bandpass filter before being split by a neutral beam splitter onto two avalanche photodiodes (Excelitas SPCM-AQRH-14-TR). Photon count events were digitized using a PicoQuant TimeHarp 260 Nano TCSPC card. Time-correlated single photon counting information was used for monitoring data quality during measurements, but not in further analysis. As especially in samples with FtsZ ZapD, and GTP present simultaneously we occasionally saw large, bright particles that are difficult to treat in FCS analysis, data was subjected to a burst removal algorithm similar to Margineanu et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> and only “non-burst” data was used in correlation analysis to obtain statistics representative of the large number of small oligomer particles, ignoring rare large ones. Cross-correlation functions of the two detectors were calculated and fitted with a standard model for three-dimensional diffusion in with rapid dye blinking:

<title>Image analysis</title>
<p>Electron microscopy images were processed and analyzed using IMOD and ImageJ. The dimensions of the toroidal structures, FtsZ bundles and distances between filaments were manually measured using ImageJ and IMOD. Distances were plotted as histograms using Origin (OriginPro, Version <italic>2019b</italic>. OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA.). For each toroid analyzed (n = 67) the inner and outer diameter were measured collecting the major and minor distance in each case. The circularity of the toroid was the result of the division between the minor diameter divided by major diameter for each toroid. The height of the FtsZ toroid was manually measured from the tomograms, collecting 4 measurements per toroid to assure a correct representation of the size (n = 17). For the distances between filaments, they were also manually measured by using IMOD. Each measurement represents only one FtsZ double filament or one FtsZ-ZapD double filament, however, the same bundle could be measured more than once as they are composed for multiple filaments. The measurements were collected from &gt;3 independent samples. The distances between ZapDs connecting two FtsZ filaments were measured following the same methodology. The mean value and standard deviation of different datasets were calculated and added to the figures together with the n used for each case.</p>

<p>The formation of the Z-ring at the time of bacterial cell division interests researchers working towards understanding cell division across all domains of life. The manuscript by Jasnin et al reports the cryoET structure of toroid assembly formation of FtsZ filaments driven by ZapD as the cross linker. The findings are <bold>important</bold> and have the potential to open a new dimension in the field, but the evidence to support these exciting claims is currently <bold>inadequate</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The major result in the manuscript is the observation of the higher order structures in a cryoET reconstruction that could be used for understanding the assembly of toroid structures. The cross-linking ability of ZapD dimers result in bending of FtsZ filaments to a constant curvature. Many such short filaments are stitched together to form a toroid like structure. The geometry of assembly of filaments - whether they form straight bundles or toroid like structures - depends on the relative concentrations of FtsZ and ZapD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In addition to a clear picture of the FtsZ assembly into ring-like structures, the authors have carried out basic biochemistry and biophysical techniques to assay the GTPase activity, the kinetics of assembly, and the ZapD to FtsZ ratio.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The discussion does not provide an overall perspective that correlates the cryoET structural organisation of filaments with the biophysical data.</p>
<p>The crosslinking nature of ZapD is already established in the field. The work carried out is important to understand the ring assembly of FtsZ. However, the availability of the cryoET observations can be further analysed in detail to derive many measurements that will help validate the model, and obtain new insights.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors set out to better understand the mechanism by which the FtsZ-associated protein ZapD crosslinks FtsZ filaments to assemble a large scale cytoskeletal assembly. For this aim, they use purified proteins in solution and a combination of biochemical, biophysical experiments and cryo-EM. The most significant finding of this study is the observation of FtsZ toroids that form at equimolar concentrations of the two proteins.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Many experiments in this paper confirm previous knowledge about ZapD. For example, it shows that ZapD promotes the assembly of FtsZ polymers, that ZapD bundles FtsZ filaments, that ZapD forms dimers and that it reduces FtsZ's GTPase activity.</p>
<p>The most novel discovery is the observation of different assemblies as a function of ZapD:FtsZ ratio. In addition, using CryoEM to describe the structure of toroids and bundles, the papers provides some information about the orientation of ZapD in relation to FtsZ filaments. For example, they found that the organization of ZapD in relation to FtsZ filaments is &quot;intrinsic heterogeneous&quot; and that FtsZ filaments were crosslinked by ZapD dimers pointing in all directions. The authors conclude that it is this plasticity that allows for the formation of toroids and its stabilization. Unfortunately, a high-resolution structure of the protein organization was not possible.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the data is convincing, their interpretation has some substantial weaknesses that the authors should address for the final version of this paper.</p>
<p>For example, as the authors are the first to describe FtsZ-ZapD toroids, a discussion why this has not been observed in previous studies would be very interesting, i.e. is it due to buffer conditions, sample preparation?</p>
<p>At parts of the manuscript, the authors try a bit too hard to argue for the physiological significance of these toroids. This, however, is at least very questionable, because:</p>
<p>
The typical diameter is in the range of 0.25-1.0 μm, which requires some flexibility of the filaments to be able to accommodate this. It's difficult to see how a FtsZ-ZapD toroid, which appears to be quite rigid with a narrow size distribution of 502 nm {plus minus} 55 nm could support cell division rather than stalling it at that cell diameter. which the authors say is similar to the E. coli cell.</p>
<p>For cell division, FtsZ filaments are recruited to the membrane surface via an interaction of FtsA or ZipA the C-terminal peptide of FtsZ. As ZapD also binds to this peptide, the question arises who wins this competition or where is ZapD when FtsZ is recruited to the membrane surface? Can such a toroidal structure of FtsZ filaments form on the membrane surface? Additional experiments would be helpful, but a more detailed discussion on how the authors think ZapD could act on membrane-bound filaments would be essential.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that the FtsZ filaments are dynamic, which is essential for cell division. But the evidence for dynamic FtsZ filaments within these toroids seems rather weak, as it is solely the partial reassembly after addition of GTP. As ZapD significantly slows down GTP hydrolysis, I am not sure it's obvious to make this conclusion.</p>
<p>On a similar note, on page 5 the authors claim that ZapD would transiently interact with FtsZ filaments. What is the evidence for this? They also say that this transient interaction could have a &quot;mechanistic role in the functionality of FtsZ macrostructures.&quot; Could they elaborate?</p>
<p>The author should also improve in putting their findings into the context of existing knowledge. For example:</p>
<p>The authors observe a straightening of filament bundles with increasing ZapD concentration. This seems consistent with what was found for ZapA, but this is not explicitly discussed (Caldas et al 2019)</p>
<p>A paragraph summarizing what is known about the properties of ZapD in vivo would be essential: i.e. what has been found regarding its intracellular copy number, location and dynamics?</p>
<p>In the introduction, the authors write that &quot;GTP binding and hydrolysis induce a conformational change in each monomer that modifies its binding potential, enabling them to follow a treadmilling behavior&quot;. This seems inaccurate, as shown by Wagstaff et al. 2022, the conformational change of FtsZ is not associated with the nucleotide state. In addition, they write that FtsZ polymerization depends on the GTPase activity. It would be more accurate to write that polymerization depends on GTP, and disassembly on GTPase activity.</p>
<p>On page 2 they also write that &quot;the mechanism underlying bundling of FtsZ filaments is unknown&quot;. I would disagree, the underlying mechanism is very well known (see for example Schumacher, MA JBC 2017), but how this relates to the large-scale organization of FtsZ filaments was not clear.</p>
<p>The authors describe the toroid as a dense 3D mesh, how would this be compatible with the Z-ring and its role for cell division? I don't think this corresponds to the current model of the Z-ring (McQuillen &amp; Xiao, 2020). Apart from the fact it's a ring, I don't think the organization of FtsZ obviously similar to the current of the Z-ring in the bacterial cell, in particular because it's not obvious how FtsZ filaments can bind ZapD and membrane anchors simultaneously.</p>
<p>The authors write that &quot;most of these modulators&quot; interact with FtsZ's CTP, but then later that ZapD is the only Zap protein that binds CTP. This seems to be inconsistent. Why not write that membrane anchors usually bind the CTP, most Zaps do not, but ZapD is the exception?</p>
<p>I also have some comments regarding the experiments and their analysis:</p>
<p>Regarding cryoET: the filaments appear like flat bands, even in the absence of ZapD, which further elongates these bands. Is this due to an anisotropic resolution? This distortion makes the conclusion that ZapD forms bi-spherical dimers unconvincing.</p>
<p>The authors say that the cryoET visualization provides crucial information on the length of the filaments within this toroid. How long are they? Could the authors measure it?</p>
<p>Regarding the dimerization mutant of ZapD: there is actually no direct confirmation that mZapD is monomeric. Did the authors try SEC MALS or AUC? Accordingly, the statement that dimerization is &quot;essential&quot; seems exaggerated (although likely true).</p>
<p>What do the authors mean that toroid formation is compatible with robust persistence length? I.e. What does robust mean? It was recently shown that FtsZ filaments are actually surprisingly flexible, which matches well the fact that the diameter of the Z-ring must continuously decrease during cell division (Dunajova et al Nature Physics 2023).</p>
<p>the authors claim that their observations suggest „that crosslinkers ... allows filament sliding in an organized fashion&quot;. As far as I know there is no evidence of filament sliding, as FtsZ monomers in living cells and in vitro are static.</p>
<p>What is the „proto-ring FtsA protein&quot;?</p>
<p>The authors refer to „increasing evidence&quot; for „alternative network remodling mechanisms that do not rely on chemical energy consumption as those in which entropic forces act through diffusible crosslinkers, similar to ZapD and FtsZ polymers.&quot; A reference should be given, I assume the authors refer to the study by Lansky et al 2015 of PRC on microtubules. However, I am not sure how the authors made the conclusion that this applies to FtsZ and ZapD, on which evidence is this assumption based?</p>
<p>Some inconsistencies in supplementary figure 3: The normalized absorbances in panel a do not seem to agree with the absolute absorbance shown in panel e, i.e. compare maximum intensity for ZapD = 20 µM and 5 µM in both panels.</p>
<p>It's not obvious to me why the structure formed by ZapD and FtsZ disassembles after some time even before GTP is exhausted, can the authors explain? As the structures disassemble, how is the &quot;steady-state turbidity&quot; defined? Do the structures also disassemble when they use a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP?</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Despite some weaknesses in the interpretation of their findings, I think this paper will likely motivate other structural studies on large scale assemblies of FtsZ filaments and its associated proteins. A systematic comparison of the effects of ZapA, ZapC and ZapD and how their different modes of filament crosslinking can result in different filament networks will be very useful to understand their individual roles and possible synergistic behavior.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors provide the first image analysis by cryoET of toroids assembled by FtsZ crosslinked by ZapD. Previously toroids of FtsZ alone have been imaged only in projection by negative stain EM. The authors attempt to distinguish ZapD crosslinks from the underlying FtsZ filaments. I did not find this distinction convincing, especially because it seems inconsistent with the 1:1 stoichiometry demonstrated by pelleting. I was intrigued by one image showing straight filament pairs, which may suggest a new model for how ZapD crosslinks FtsZ filaments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The first image analysis of FtsZ toroids by cryoET.</p>
<p>
(2) The images are accompanied by pelleting assays that convincingly establish a 1:1 stoichiometry of FtsZ:ZapD subunits.</p>
<p>
(3) Fig. 5 shows an image of a pair of FtsZ filaments crosslinked by ZapD. This seems to have higher resolution than the toroids. Importantly, it suggests a new model for the structure of FtsZ-ZapD that resolves previously unrecognized conflicts. (This is discussed below under weaknesses, because it is so far only supported by a single image.)</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This paper reports a study by cryoEM of polymers and bundles assembled from FtsZ plus ZapD. Although previous studies by other labs have focused on straight bundles of filaments, the present study found toroids mixed with these straight bundles, and they focused most of their study on the toroids. In the toroids they attempt to delineate FtsZ filaments and ZapD crosslinks. A major problem here is with the stoichiometry. Their pelleting assays convincingly established a stoichiometry of 1:1, while the mass densities identified as ZapD are sparse and apparently well below the number of FtsZ (FtsZ subunits are not resolved in the reconstructions, but the continuous sheets or belts seem to have a lot more mass than the identified crosslinks.) Apart from the stoichiometry I don't find the identification of crosslinks to be convincing. It is missing an important control - cryoET of toroids assembled from pure FtsZ, without ZapD.</p>
<p>However, if I ignore these and jump to Fig. 5, I think there is an important discovery that resolves controversies in the present study as well as previous ones, controversies that were not even recognized. The controversy is illustrated by the Schumacher 2017 model (their Fig. 7), which is repeated in a simplified version in Fig. 1a of the present mss. That model has a two FtsZ filaments in a plane facing ZapD dimers which bridge them. In this planar model the C-terminal linker, and the ctd of FtsZ that binds ZapD facing each other and the ZapD in the middle, with. The contradiction arises because the C-terminus needs to face the membrane in order to attach and generate a bending force. The two FtsZ filaments in the planar model are facing 90{degree sign} away from the membrane. A related contradiction is that Houseman et al 2016 showed that curved FtsZ filaments have the C terminus on the outside of the curve. In a toroid the C termini should all be facing the outside. If the paired filaments had the C termini facing each other, they could not form a toroid because the two FtsZ filaments would be bending in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Fig. 5 of the present mss seems to resolve this by showing that the two FtsZ filaments and ZapD are not planar, but stacked. The two FtsZ filaments have their C termini facing the same direction, let's say up, toward the membrane, and ZapD binds on top, bridging the two. The spacing of the ctd binding sites on the Zap D dimer is 6.5 nm, which would fit the ~8 nm width of the paired filament complex observed in the present cryoEM (Fig S13). In the Schumacher model the width would be about 20 nm. Importantly, the stack model has the ctd of each filament facing the same direction, so the paired filaments could attach to the membrane and bend together (using ctd's not bound by ZapD). Finally, the new arrangement would also provide an easy way for the complex to extend from a pair of filaments to a sheet of three or four or more.</p>
<p>A problem with this new model from Fig. 5 is that it is supported by only a single example of the paired FtsZ-ZapD complex. If this is to be the basis of the interpretation, more examples should be shown. Maybe examples could be found with three or four FtsZ filaments in a sheet.</p>
<p>What then should be done with the toroids? I am not convinced by the identification of ZapD as &quot;connectors.&quot; I think it is likely that the ZapD is part of the belts that I discuss below, although the relative location of ZapD in the belts is not resolved. It is likely that the resolution in the toroid reconstructions of Fig. 4, S8,9 is less than that of the isolated pf pair in Fig. 5c.</p>
<p>Importantly, If the authors want to pursue the location of ZapD in toroids, I suggest they need to compare their ZapD-containing toroids with toroids lacking ZapD. Popp et al 2009 have determined a variety of solution conditions that favor the assembly of toroids by FtsZ with no added protein crosslinker. It would be very interesting to investigate the structure of these toroids by the present cryoEM methods, and compare them to the FtsZ-ZapD toroids. I suspect that the belts seen in the ZapD toroids will not be found in the pure FtsZ toroids, confirming that their structure is generated by ZapD.</p>
