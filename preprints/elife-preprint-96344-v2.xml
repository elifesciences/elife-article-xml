<title>Abstract</title><p>Life histories of oviparous species dictate high metabolic investment in the process of gonadal development leading to ovulation. In vertebrates, these two distinct processes are controlled by the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), respectively. While it was suggested that a common secretagogue, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), oversees both functions, the generation of loss-of-function fish challenged this view. Here, we reveal that the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) is the primary regulator of this axis in zebrafish. We found that FSH cells express a CCK receptor, and our findings demonstrate that mutating this receptor results in a severe hindrance to ovarian development. Additionally, it causes a complete shutdown of both gonadotropins secretion. Using <italic>in-vivo</italic> and <italic>ex-vivo</italic> calcium imaging of gonadotrophs, we show that GnRH predominantly activates LH cells, whereas FSH cells respond to CCK stimulation, designating CCK as the bona fide FSH secretagogue. These findings indicate that the control of gametogenesis in fish was placed under different neural circuits, that are gated by CCK.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In vertebrates, the processes of folliculogenesis, ovulation and spermatogenesis are controlled by two gonadotropin hormones (GtHs), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). In fish, LH and FSH are secreted by distinct cell types in the pituitary. In recent years, different loss-of-function (LOF) studies revealed the stereotyped function of each gonadotropin: FSH signaling controls folliculogenesis, whereas the role of LH is restricted to the induction of ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). According to the existing dogma, the secretion of both GtHs by gonadotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland is controlled by the hypothalamic neuropeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is produced by a small population of neurons in the preoptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies conducted in mammals have shown that the differential control over gonadotropin secretion is attained via changes in frequencies and amplitude of GnRH pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), as well as by a variety of other endocrine and paracrine factors that dictate whether the cells will secrete LH or FSH. In fish, the TGF-β family members activin, inhibin, and follistatin, as well as PACAP signalling have been shown to exert a differential effect on FSH and LH synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). However, the hypothalamic mechanisms governing the differential release of FSH or LH in non-mammalian vertebrates remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>As in mammals, GnRH is considered the master regulator of gonadotropin secretion in fish. However, in recent years, its status as the sole neuropeptide regulating GtH secretion has been called into question, as other hypothalamic neuropeptides were shown to bypass GnRH and directly regulate gonadotropin secretion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Due to genome duplication events, fish brains express up to three forms of GnRH, of which one form (usually GnRH1) innervates the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). In some species, such as the zebrafish, that express only two forms of GnRH (GnRH2 and GnRH3), the gene encoding GnRH1 has been lost, and GnRH3 has become the dominant hypophysiotropic form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). For a yet unknown reason, in the zebrafish, even a complete absence of GnRH does not impair ovulation, as adult zebrafish with loss of function (LOF) of GnRH signaling are fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), suggesting that GnRH activity is either replaced by a compensation mechanism or it is dispensable for the control of gonadotropin release overall. In other species, such as medaka, the effects of GnRH are limited to the control of final oocyte maturation and ovulation via LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Since in both species the loss of GnRH does not affect gonadal development, the hypothalamic factor controlling FSH secretion in fish remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we addressed the question of the hypothalamic control of LH and FSH secretion in zebrafish. By mutating a previously identified CCK receptor highly expressed in FSH cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), we prove that CCK controls zebrafish reproduction by gating gonadotropin secretion. Using <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> calcium imaging in zebrafish gonadotrophs to identify LH- and FSH-specific secretagogues, we show that the two types of gonadotrophs vary significantly in their activity patterns and that GnRH controls LH cells whereas FSH cells are preferentially activated by the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), which is also produced in the fish hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and its receptor is highly expressed in FSH cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The results identify CCK as a novel crucial regulator of the reproductive axis and establish a neuroendocrine link between nutritional status and reproduction in fish.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>CCK and its receptor are vital regulators of the HPG axis</title>
<p>While in mammals, both LH and FSH are secreted by the same cell population,in fish these gonadotropins are produced by discrete cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We took advantage of this unique feature to search for the mechanism that regulates the differential secretion of LH and FSH in fish. We have previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) that FSH cells differ from LH cells by the expression of an FSH-specific type of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor. While three types of CCK receptors (CCKRs; CCKAR, CCKBR and CCKBR(A)) are reported in the genome of fish, only one type (CCKBR(A), XM_017357750.2) is expressed in the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-Figure supplement 1F). In tilapia, the expression of this receptor is ∼100 fold higher in FSH than in LH cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Nevertheless, LH cells also express the CCK receptor (CCKBR(A)) albeit at a lower level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We therefore first validated its expression on gonadotroph cells in zebrafish using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and found that the receptor is predominantly expressed in FSH cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). To identify the source of CCK inputs we used immunohistochemistry to label CCK-expressing cells using a specific antibody against the eight amino acids of the mature CCK peptide . We found hypophysiotropic CCK-secreting neuronal projections innervating the pituitary near FSH cells and adjacent to GnRH axons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating hypothalamic input of CCK into the pituitary gland.</p>

<p>To functionally validate the importance of CCK signalling, we used CRISPR-cas9 to generate loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the pituitary-specific CCK receptor gene (CCKBR(A)). Three different mutations were induced by guide RNAs designed to target the 4<sup>th</sup> transmembrane domain of the protein, thus affecting the binding site of the receptor to its ligand (Figure1-Figure supplement 1A-D). Three mutations were identified to generate a LOF: insertion of 12 nucleotides (CCKBR(A)<sup>+12</sup>), insertion of seven nucleotides (CCKBR(A)<sup>+7</sup>) and deletion of one nucleotide (CCKBR(A)<sup>-1</sup>). Modifications to the CCKBR(A) structure had significant implications for its function and ligand-binding capabilities, resulting in receptor inactivation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-Figure supplement 1E). An insertion of +12 nucleotides is particularly interesting because a four-amino acid insertion does not cause a frame-shift in the coding sequence. However, this insertion of a four- amino acid sequence (Asp-Asp-Ser-His) at the start of TM4 of the CCKBR(A) receptor, specifically between amino acids 188 and 192, led to receptor inactivation. A study by Foucaud et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) demonstrated that amino acid 192 is part of the binding site for the mammalian CCKR2. Our finding indicate that modifications in this region, significantly impact the receptor’s ligand-binding characteristics and overall functionality(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>- Figure supplement 1E). Analysis of the phenotype of F2 adult fish (5-6 months of age) revealed that while non-edited (wt/wt, n=15) and heterozygous fish (CCKBR(A)<sup>wt/+12</sup>, CCKBRB<sup>wt/+7</sup>, CCKBR(A)<sup>wt/-1</sup>, n=20) displayed typical sex ratios and functional adult gonads, all homozygous fish (CCKBR(A)<sup>+12/+12</sup>, CCKBR(A) <sup>+7/+7</sup>,CCKBR(A)<sup>-1/-1</sup>, n=12) were males with significantly small gonads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>; mean gonad area KO=3.8±0.48 mm^2, Heterozygous = 23.52± 10.6, WT= 78±7.4 mm^2). The testes of mutant males displayed an immature phenotype as they were populated mostly by early stages of testicular germ cells (mostly spermatogonia and spermatocytes) and contained low volumes of mature spermatozoa compared to their WT and heterozygous siblings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Heterozygous fish were also affected and displayed significantly lower amount of spermatozoa compared to the WT fish. Interestingly, the CCKBR(A) LOF fish do not phenocopy zebrafish with a loss of FSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Instead, the phenotype of the CCKBR(A) LOF closely resembles the condition reported for zebrafish that have LOF mutations in both gonadotropin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Indeed, our mutants show decreased expression levels of both <italic>lhβ</italic> and <italic>fshβ</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting that loss of CCK signaling affects both LH and FSH. Tissue distribution of the CCK receptors reveals the high expression of CCKBR(A) in the pituitary and in the hypothalamus (Figure1- Figure supplement 1F), which are both central areas of the HPG axis. CCK expression in the brain is directly connected to the metabolic status of the fish, as starved fish have a significant decrease in CCKB expression compared to fed fish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-Figure supplement 1G).We next sought to identify the exact effect of the two major HPG regulators GnRH and CCK on the activity of LH and FSH cells using calcium imaging.</p>

<label>2.</label><title>LH and FSH cells exhibit distinct calcium activity in vivo</title>
<p>The unique segregation of LH and FSH cells in fish provides an opportunity to identify genes and pathways that specifically regulate each gonadotroph. To that end, we generated transgenic zebrafish in which both LH- and FSH-producing cells express the red genetically-encoded calcium indicator RCaMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), whereas FSH cells also express GFP (<italic>Tg(FSH:RCaMP2, LH:RCaMP2, FSH:GFP)</italic>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These fish allow simultaneous monitoring of calcium activity in LH and FSH cells as a readout for cell activation, while distinguishing between the two cell types.</p>

<p>To follow the activity of LH and FSH gonadotrophs in live zebrafish, we developed a novel preparation for imaging the pituitary gland at single-cell resolution while maintaining the <italic>in vivo</italic> context. In this preparation, the pituitary gland was exposed from its ventral side. The immobilized zebrafish were placed under a two-photon microscope with a constant flow of water over the gills (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), ensuring sufficient oxygen supply to the gills and blood flow to the gland (Figur 2-supplement movie 1).</p>
<p>Imaging of the gonadotrophs <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed distinct types of calcium activity in the two cell types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-E</xref>, Figure2- Figure supplement 1A). In the basal state LH cells were mostly silent, whereas FSH cells exhibited short (mean of 10.08 sec half width) calcium bursts (mean of 0.6 ΔF/F; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref> (fish1) and D; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> - supplementary movie 2A).</p>
<p>These calcium events were sparse, i.e. between 1 and 7 transients in each cell in 10 min, and disorganized, as max cross-correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.3 to 0.9 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> fish1). In seven out of ten zebrafish, we observed an event in which LH cells exhibited a single long (mean of 75.55 sec half width) and strong (mean of 1.5 ΔF/F) calcium rise (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> (fish2) and D). This event was synchronized between LH cells (mean max cross-correlation coefficient values of 0.89 ± 0.003) and, in three out of seven fish, it was followed by a less synchronized (mean max cross-correlation coefficient values, 0.66 ± 0.011,) calcium rise in FSH cells (Figure2- C (fish2) and D, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>- supplementary movie 2B). On average, the max cross-correlation coefficient values of all active LH cells were significantly higher compared to FSH cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, Figure2 – Figure supplement 1B), which reflects the strong gap-junction mediated coupling between LH cells that does not exist in FSH cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We did not observe significant sexual dimorphism in correlation value distribution in either LH or FSH cells (5 males and 5 females). Since most FSH calcium transients were not associated with a rise in calcium in LH cells, we speculated that a cell type-specific regulatory mechanism drives the activity of the two cell types and GnRH and CCK are the primary candidates.</p>

<p>To functionally test the effect of CCK on gonadotroph activity, we applied the peptide (300 μl of 30 μg/ml CCK, 78.74µM) to our ex vivo preparation and monitored the calcium response of the cells. CCK elicited a strong calcium response (40.3 to 172 sec half- width, mean amplitude of 1.44 ΔF/F) in FSH cells, while in some of the fish, a lower response was observed in LH cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A and B</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>- Figure supplement 1B; Figure4- supplement Movie 1).

<p>The calcium response observed in LH and FSH cells upon GnRH and CCK stimulation indicates a preferential stimulatory effect of the neuropeptides on each cell type.

<p>Conversely, the application of CCK elicited a significant calcium rise in FSH cells followed by an elevation of FSH concentration in the medium (FSH concentration ranging from 0.5 to 5 ng/ml), whereas in LH cells, no significant effect was observed on calcium activity, and the slight increase in LH secretion was not significant (n=5; LH concentration ranging from 0.25 to 0.75 ng/ml <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These results were reproduced <italic>in vivo</italic>, as CCK injection significantly increased the expression and secretion of FSH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C and D</xref>) whereas the response to GnRH did not reach statistical significance (p=0.069).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>GnRH has long been considered the common stimulator of gonadotropin secretion in vertebrates. However, accumulating evidence for GnRH-independent FSH secretion in several mammalian species has questioned this regulatory role of GnRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, in fish, normal ovarian development in hypophysiotropic GnRH loss-of- function mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), together with the lack of FSH cells response to GnRH stimuli in pituitary cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), further highlights the existence of an unknown FSH regulator other than GnRH. Here, we reveal that in zebrafish, CCK, a satiety hormone, gates reproduction by directly regulating GtH secretion. We show that GnRH preferentially controls LH secretion and identify CCK as the long-sought hypothalamic FSH secretagogue. Our results indicate that while fish gonadotrophs were segregated into two different populations and placed under the control of two distinct neuropeptides during evolution, a common hypothalamic pathway gates the secretion of both gonadotropins. Interestingly, in contrast to GnRH, the novel CCK regulation identified under the current study has a more substantial effect on the gonadotrophic axis, as revealed in our mutants, while the disruption of GnRH and its receptors didn’t lead to any drastic effect on reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of CCK as a satiety hormone has been demonstrated in multiple species of mammals and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). From an evolutionary perspective, allocating a satiety hormone for gating reproduction serves the unique demands of the life history of oviparous species. Egg-laying and placental animals display a marked difference in their reproductive energy allocation strategies. In oviparous species, the pre-ovulatory processes of gonadal development involving vitellogenin synthesis and deposition into the developing oocyte, also known as folliculogenesis, constitutes the main nutritional challenge during the female reproductive cycle. Thus, in oviparous species, folliculogenesis is gated by the animal’s nutritional status. Since folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis are controlled by gonadotropin signaling from the pituitary, nutritional gating of gonadotrophs, may serve as an effective pathway to inhibit gonad development under limiting energetic balance. Our data suggest that, indeed, dedicated hypothalamic neurons have developed to integrate metabolic cues, such as food abundance and somatic condition, to induce the energetically costly process of reproduction in fish.</p>
<p>Since CCK is a regulator of satiety in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), this hypothalamic circuit directly links the metabolic status of the fish to its reproductive capacity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Considering the recent report of an FSH-regulating role for CCK in the distantly related species medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), our findings represent a highly conserved mechanism for controlling reproduction in fish.</p>

<p>In the CCKBR(A) LOF mutants, gonad development was disrupted and led to an all-male population with underdeveloped testes. Female gonad development in fish is directly linked to FSH signalling activity, as shown by genetic mutation of FSH receptors that leads to female gonad arrest and differentiation into male gonads as the fish mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The lack of females in our LOF mutant, together with the male’s infertility, suggests a direct disruption of both LH and FSH circuitry. We further show that CCK directly controls FSH cells by innervating the pituitary gland and binding to specific receptors that are particularly abundant in FSH gonadotrophs. However, our calcium imaging results and the LOF mutants demonstrate that CCK also activates LH cells to some extent. This activation may either be direct, as LH cells were also shown to express the CCK receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) albeit at a lower level, or indirectly, by affecting LH cells via activation of GnRH or other neurons. The latter pathway can be wired through the close apposition of GnRH3 and CCK terminals in the zebrafish pituitary, as shown in this work. Additional support is the evidence in mammals where GnRH neurons express CCK receptors and CCK directly affects the migratory pathway of GnRH during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>).</p>
<p>Our identification of CCK-producing axons innervating the zebrafish pituitary suggests a predominantly central CCK-dependent control of FSH release. While in mammals, hypothalamic regulation of the pituitary is gated by the median eminence, in fish, hypothalamic neurons directly innervate the pituitary and secrete their regulatory peptide close to the destination cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Similar innervation of CCK was observed in ancient jawless fish, such as lamprey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and modern teleosts, such as the goldfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>).</p>
<p>Modern oviparous tetrapods were also shown to express the CCK receptor in their pituitary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), indicating that this regulatory circuit may be evolutionarily conserved and common to oviparous vertebrates. However, since CCK is produced in the gut as well as in the central nervous system, we cannot rule out circulating CCK as a possible activator of GtH cells. Nevertheless, the direct innervation of CCK terminals into the pituitary gland and the concomitant increase of CCK in the gut and in the brain in response to feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>) suggest that the two sources of CCK are interconnected. In this context, the vagal nerve may serve as a possible gut-brain communication route, as it was shown to relay satiety signals to the hypothalamus via CCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), thus forming a parasympathetic regulatory loop onto the hypothalamo- pituitary-gonadal axis.</p>
<p>Unlike the situation in fish, CCK LOF mice can reproduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), reflecting that the main metabolic challenge in the reproductive cycle of mammals is controlled by placental gonadotropins rather than by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The identified functional overlap in the hypothalamic control of both gonadotropins in zebrafish efficiently serves to gate reproduction by a single neuropeptide. Importantly, similar functional overlap also exists in the potency of GnRH to activate FSH cells, corresponding to a previous finding where LH and FSH are co-secreted during the female spawning cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). However, since FSH cells express a different type of GnRH receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), their activation is less consistent and results in reduced gonadotropin secretion. Moreover, in the zebrafish, as well as in other species, the functional overlap in gonadotropin signaling pathways is not limited to the pituitary but is also present in the gonad, through the promiscuity of the two gonadotropin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). This multilevel overlap creates functional redundancy that grants the reproductive system a high level of robustness and ensure the species’ persistence .</p>
<p>Overall, our findings propose an updated view of the regulation of gonadal function in fish, in which metabolically driven hypothalamic circuits evolved to control gonad development. In addition to the novel insight into the evolution and function of the reproductive axis in oviparous animals, these findings are also of particular importance in the context of aquaculture, which has become the dominant supplier of fish for human consumption in the face of declining yields from wild fisheries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). With the identification of the CCK circuit as a regulator of folliculogenesis and the main gateway between metabolic state and reproduction, novel tools targeting this pathway can now be designed to manipulate gonadal development and overcome challenges in gamete production and the control of puberty onset in farmed fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>).</p>

Before and after each session, the tissue was imaged once for GFP (excitation, 488 nm and emission, 530 nm) and R-CaMP2 (540 nm and 590 nm) in two separate channels. Images were processed using the Fiji program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>) for resolution using the Gaussian Blur filter and motion correction using the moco plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>).</p>
<p>To measure hormone secretion in response to salmon GnRH analogue [(D-Ala6,Pro9- Net)-mammalian GnRH (Bachem Inc., Torrance, CA) or zebrafish CCK [D-Y-[SO3H]-L- G-W-M-D-F), synthesized by GL Biochem] stimulation, the medium was collected through the chamber outlet during the entire imaging session (10 ml per session in total). Each pituitary was imaged three times for 10 minutes: before, during and after stimulation. The stimulus was applied manually as a pulse of 300 μl of 30 μg/μl (78.74µM) peptide during the first 30 seconds of the imaging session. Hormones were measured in the fractions before and after stimulation using ELISA developed for common carp, which was established in the Levavi-Sivan lab using recombinant carp gonadotropins produced in yeast, and had been previously shown to be suitable for zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>Tissue viability was validated by monitoring the morphology and activity of the cells, looking at granulation and calcium changes. This specific preparation was also viable two hours after dissection, when all the cells responded to the different stimuli.</p>

<label>1.8.</label><title>Analysis of Ca2+ imaging data</title>
<p>A composite of GFP-positive and RCaMP-positive cells was created to distinguish between LH and FSH cells. Regions of interest corresponding to each cell in the imaged plane were manually drawn using Fiji. Two separated ROI sets were created, FSH cells (GFP-positive) and LH cells (R-CaMP2-positive and GFP-negative). Using the Fiji ROI manager, two datasets were created: a data sheet containing the mean grey values in each frame during the complete image sequence, and a data sheet containing the ROI centroids. Sheets and images were then processed using MATLAB R2017a.</p>
<p>Traces were normalized using the equation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="545454v4_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>F</italic>0 is the lowest value in the means calculated from every N frame in the complete trace (N= sampling frequency*5). When the sampling rate was higher than 4 Hz, we applied a low pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 2/ (sampling frequency /2).</p>

<label>1.9.</label><title>Analysis of correlations coefficients between cells</title>
<p>Cross-correlation coefficients represent the maximum coefficient value between all cells or relative to a chosen ROI. From each set of traces, we obtained cross-correlation sequence ranges from -maxlag to maxlag and the values were normalized such that autocorrelations at 0 lag equalled 1. For each set we demonstrate only the maximum correlation values. The values are represented in a dot plot superimposed on the cells according to their centroid values when compared to the chosen ROI (pink dot), or as a heatmap when correlation is between all the cells. For violin plots, the mean of the maximum cross-correlation coefficient values in each fish were further visualized and analysed for statistical significance using Prism 9 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).</p>

<p>Staining was performed on whole head slices, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Briefly, whole heads were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and then decalcified for 4–7 days in 0.5 M EDTA at 4°C. Subsequently, heads were cryoprotected in 30% (wt/vol) sucrose, frozen in an OCT embedding compound and cryosectioned at a thickness of 15 μm. For immunostaining, head sections from transgenic zebrafish <italic>tg(GnRH:GFP)</italic> and <italic>tg(FSH:GFP)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h to reduce non-specific reactions.

<p>Six-month-old zebrafish (5 males and 5 females) were injected intraperitoneally with the following: 1) fish CCK peptide [(D-Y[SO3H]-L-G-W-M-D-F-NH2), synthesized by GL Biochem] at a concentration of 10 ng/g or 100 ng/g body weight, 2) salmon GnRH analogue [(D-Ala6,Pro9-Net)-mammalian GnRH (Bachem Inc., Torrance, CA) at a concentration of 100 ng/g body weight, 3) similar volumes of saline. Two hours post- injection, the fish were sedated using MS-222, bled from the heart as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), and decapitated. Pituitaries were dissected under a stereomicroscope and placed in Total RNA Isolation Reagent (Trizol). From each fish, between 15 μl and 20 μl of blood was collected. The blood was centrifuged at 970 × g 30 min and the plasma was separated and stored at −20°C. LH and FSH expression in the pituitary was measured using real-time PCR (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>- Supplement Table 2 for primer list).

<p>CCKBR(A) LOF were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Three single guide RNAs (sgRNA, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>- Supplementary Table 1.) were designed using CHOPCHOP web tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>) to specifically target coding regions in the CCKBR(A) gene (NCBI: XM_017357750.2;). Synthetic sgRNA (Sigma-Aldrich Israel Ltd) were co injected with Cas9 into single-cell stage zebrafish embryos. Mature injected zebrafish were screened for gene mutation using high-resolution melt (HRM) curve analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>) and bred with WT zebrafish to generate F1 heterozygous zebrafish. Out of the three designed sgRNA, guide number 2 was identified as the most efficient, creating the highest amount of mutated zebrafish. Mutated F1 heterozygous zebrafish were bred again to create the F2 generation containing a mix of genotypes: WT, heterozygous and homozygous zebrafish.</p>
<p>Mixed genotype F2 siblings from the same spawning event were reared in the same tanks until sexual maturity was identified (5-6 months). Tissues for H&amp;E staining, RNA purification and genotyping were collected from three groups of siblings (n=47).</p>
<p>For the genotyping of the mutation, fin clips were collected, and DNA was extracted using HOTSHOT method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>), amplified by PCR and sequenced (sanger sequencing, Hylabs). Three types of mutations were identified and characterised for LOF: insertion of 12 nucleotides (CCKBR(A)<sup>+12</sup>), insertion of 7 nucleotides (CCKBR(A)<sup>+7</sup>) and depletion of one nucleotide (CCKBR(A)<sup>-1</sup>;). LOF fish had contained one of the mutation types in each allele.</p>

<p>Receptor transactivation assay was performed according to Biran et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) and Mizrahi et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). Briefly, the entire coding sequence of each CCK receptor variant was cloned from the DNA extracted from the different KO fish. Each coding sequence was inserted into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The constracts were transiently co-transfected with Cre-Luc reporter plasmid into COS7 cells (Three µg of each constract co-transfected with three µg of Cre-Luc). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with tilapia CCK peptide (10µM, eight dilutions of 1:3). The binding of the CCK peptide to the receptor elicits luciferase expression in a dose-dependent matter. The hormone treatment and the subsequent measurement of luciferase activities were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>).

<p>Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad). Whiskers on bar plots represent mean ± SEM. In violin plots, middle line represents the median, whereas the bottom and top lines represent the lower and upper quartiles, respectively. The datasets in all figures were tested for equal variances (using Bartlett’s test) and normality (using D’Agostino and Pearson’s test or Shapiro-Wilk test for smaller datasets). Dataset pairs that exhibited equal variances and normal distribution were compared using a two- tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test (for two sets). For datasets with more than two sets we used one- way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Tukey-Kramer test. Datasets with different variances and/or non-Gaussian distributions were tested using two-tailed Mann- Whitney’s test (for two sets) or Brown-Forsythe’s one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s T3 multiple comparisons test. To compare levels of secreted hormone in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> assay, the one-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test (Wilcoxon test) was performed, as the sample size was lower than 10. To compare the datasets of the <italic>in vivo</italic> assay of CCK and GnRH injections, and the gonadotrophs expression in the LOF fish, a nonparametric one-way ANOVA test (Kruskal-Wallis test) was used, as the datasets failed the Bartlett’s test of equal variance.

<p>This study presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings on the role of the satiety hormone cholecystokinin typically associated with feeding in the control of a pituitary hormone, FSH, which is a critical regulator of reproductive physiology. The authors provide <bold>solid</bold> pharmacological evidence that cholecystokinin is sufficient to regulate FSH and <bold>compelling</bold> genetic evidence that one of its receptors is required for gonadal development, with uncertainties remaining about the physiological regulation and necessity of the peptide.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript builds on previous work suggesting that the CCK peptide is the releasing hormone for FSH in fishes, which is different than that observed in mammals where both LH and FSH release are under the control of GnRH. Based on data using calcium imaging as a readout for stimulation of the gonadotrophs, the researchers present data supporting the hypothesis that CCK stimulates FSH-containing cells in the pituitary. In contrast LH containing cells show a weak and variable response to CCK, but are highly responsive to GnRH. Data are presented that support the role of CCK in release of FSH. Researchers also state the functional overlap exists in the potency of GnRH to activate FSH cells, thus the two signalling pathways are not separate.</p>
<p>
The results are of interest to the field because for many years the assumption has been that fishes use the same signalling mechanism. These data present an intriguing variation where a hormone involved in satiation acts in the control of reproduction.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the manuscript are that researchers have shed light on different pathways controlling reproduction in fishes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Weaknesses are that it is not clear if multiple ligand/receptors are involved (more than one CCK and more than one receptor?). The imaging of the CCK terminals and CCK receptors needs to be reinforced.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have responded to the comments with clarity and have made the important requested changes such as clarifying the CCK receptors (their expression and exactly which receptor was targeted), and emphasizing the interactions of CCK, namely that CCK induces LH secretion, but not to the same extent as FSH. All minor comments directed to the layout of the figures and text have been addressed. In summary, comments have been addressed satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The pituitary gonadotropins, FSH and LH, are critical regulators of reproduction. In mammals, synthesis and secretion of FSH and LH by gonadotrope cells are controlled by the hypothalamic peptide, GnRH. As FSH and LH are made in the same cells in mammals, variation in the nature of GnRH secretion is thought to contribute to the differential regulation of the two hormones. In contrast, in fish, FSH and LH are produced in distinct gonadotrope populations and may be less (or differently) dependent on GnRH than in mammals. In the present manuscript, the authors endeavored to determine whether FSH may be independently controlled by a distinct peptide, cholecystokinin (CCK), in zebrafish.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrated that the CCK receptor is enriched in FSH-producing relative to LH-producing gonadotropes, and that genetic deletion of the receptor leads to dramatic decreases in gonadotropin production and gonadal development in zebrafish. Also, using innovative in vivo and ex vivo calcium imaging approaches, they show that LH- and FSH-producing gonadotropes preferentially respond to GnRH and CCK, respectively. Exogenous CCK also preferentially stimulated FSH secretion ex vivo and in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The concept that there may be a distinct FSH-releasing hormone (FSHRH) has been debated for decades. As the authors suggest that CCK is the long-sought FSHRH (at least in fish), they must provide data that convincingly leads to such a conclusion. In my estimation, they have not yet met this burden. In particular, they show that CCK is sufficient to activate FSH-producing cells, but have not yet demonstrated its necessity. Their one attempt to do so was using fish in which they inactivated the CCK receptor using CRISPR-Cas9. While this manipulation led to a reduction in FSH, LH was affected to a similar extent. As a result, they have not shown that CCK is a selective regulator of FSH.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our conclusion regarding the necessity of CCK signaling for FSH secretion is based on the following evidence:</p>
<p>(1) CCK-like receptors are expressed in the pituitary gland predominantly on FSH cells.</p>
<p>(2) Application of CCK to pituitaries elicits FSH cell activation and to a much lesser degree activation of LH cells.  (calcium imaging assays)</p>
<p>(3) Application of CCK to pituitaries and by injections in-vivo significantly increased only FSH release.</p>
<p>(4) Mutating the FSH-specific CCK receptor in a different species of fish (medaka) also causes a complete shutdown of FSH production and phenocopies a fsh-mutant phenotype (Uehara, Nishiike et al. 2023).</p>
<p>Taken together, we believe that this data strongly supports the conclusion that CCK is necessary for FSH production and release from the fish pituitary. Admittedly, the overlapping effects of CCK on both FSH and LH cells in zebrafish (evident in both our calcium imaging experiments and especially in the KO phenotype) complicates the interpretation of the phenotype. We speculate that the effect of CCK on LH cells in zebrafish can be caused either by paracrine signaling within the gland or by the effects of CCK on GnRH neurons that were shown to express CCK receptors .</p>
<p>In the current version, we emphasize that CCK also induces LH secretion. Although it does not affect LH to the same extent as FSH, an overlap does exist. This is mentioned in the abstract and discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, they do not yet demonstrate that the effects observed reflect the loss of the receptor's function in gonadotropes, as opposed to other cell types.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although there is evidence for the expression of CCK receptor in other tissues, we do show a direct decrease of FSH and LH expression in the gonadotrophs of the pituitary of the mutant fish; taken together with its significant expression in FSH cells compared to the rest of the cells of the pituitary in the cell specific transcriptomic, it is the most reasonable explanation for the mutant phenotype.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unlike in mice, technologies for conditional knockout of genes in specific cell types are not yet available for our model and cell types. Additional tissue distribution of the three receptors types of CCK was added in supplementary figure 1, from this tissue distribution it can be appreciated how in the pituitary only CCKBRA (our identified CCK receptor) is expressed, while in other tissues it is either not expressed or expressed with the additional CCK receptors that can compensate its activity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It also is not clear whether the phenotypes of the fish reflect perturbations in pituitary development vs. a loss of CCK receptor function in the pituitary later in life. Ideally, the authors would attempt to block CCK signaling in adult fish that develop normally. For example, if CCK receptor antagonists are available, they could be used to treat fish and see whether and how this affects FSH vs. LH secretion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While the observed gonadal phenotype of the KO (sex inversed fish) should have a developmental origin since it requires a long time to manifest, the effect of the KO on FSH and LH cells is probably more acute. Unfortunately a specific antagonist that affect only CCKRBA and not the other CCK receptors wasn’t identified yet.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the Discussion, the authors suggest that CCK, as a satiety factor, may provide a link between metabolism and reproduction. This is an interesting idea, but it is not supported by the data presented. That is, none of the results shown link metabolic state to CCK regulation of FSH and fertility. Absent such data, the lengthy Discussion of the link is speculative and not fully merited.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we provided data to link cck with metabolic status in supplementary figure 1 and modified the discussion to tone down the link between metabolic status to and reproductive state.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also in the Discussion, the authors argue that &quot;CCK directly controls FSH cells by innervating the pituitary gland and binding to specific receptors that are particularly abundant in FSH gonadotrophs.&quot; However, their imaging does not demonstrate innervation of FSH cells by CCK terminals (e.g., at the EM level).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Innervation of the fish pituitary does not imply a synaptic-like connection between axon terminals and endocrine cells. In fact, such connections are extremely rare, and their functionality is unclear. Instead, the mode of regulation between hypothalamic terminals and endocrine cells in the fish pituitary is more similar to &quot;volume transmission&quot; in the CNS, i.e. peptides are released into the tissue and carried to their endocrine cell targets by the circulation or via diffusion. A short explanation was added in lines 395-398 in the discussion</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, they have not demonstrated the binding of CCK to these cells. Indeed, no CCK receptor protein data are shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our revised manuscript  includes detailed experiments showing the activation of the receptor by its homologous ligand, supplementary Figure 1 includes a transactivation  assay of CCK to its receptor and the effect of the different mutants on the activation of the receptor. Unfortunately, no antibody is available against this fish specific receptor (one of the caveats of working with fish models); therefore, we cannot present receptor protein data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The calcium responses of FSH cells to exogenous CCK certainly suggest the presence of functional CCK receptors therein; but, the nature of the preparations (with all pituitary cell types present) does not demonstrate that CCK is acting directly in these cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that there are some disadvantages in choosing to work with a whole-tissue preparation. However, we believe that the advantages of working in a more physiological context far outweigh the drawbacks as it reflects the natural dynamics more precisely. Since our transcriptome data, as well as our ISH staining, show that the CCK receptor is exclusively expressed in FSH cells, it is improbable that the observed calcium response is mediated via a different pituitary cell type.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Indeed, the asynchrony in responses of individual FSH cells to CCK (Figure 4) suggests that not all cells may be activated in the same way. Contrast the response of LH cells to GnRH, where the onset of calcium signaling is similar across cells (Figure 3).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The difference between the synchronization levels of LH and FSH cells activity stems from the gap-junction mediated coupling between LH cells that does not exist between FSH cells(Golan, Martin et al. 2016). Therefore, the onset of calcium response in FSH cells is dependent on the irregular diffusion rate of the peptide within the preparation, whereas the tight homotypic coupling between LH cells generates a strong and synchronized calcium rise that propagates quickly throughout the entire population</p>
<p>The differences in connectivity between LH and FSH cells is mentioned in lines 194-195</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, as the authors note in the Discussion, the data presented do not enable them to conclude that the endogenous CCK regulating FSH (assuming it does) is from the brain as opposed to other sources (e.g., the gut).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that, for now, we are unable to determine whether hypothalamic or peripheral CCK are the main drivers of FSH cells. While the strong innervation of the gland by CCK-secreting hypothalamic neurons strengthens the notion of a hypothalamic-releasing hormone and also fits with the dogma of the neural control of the pituitary gland in fish (Ball 1981), more experiments are required to resolve this question.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript builds on previous work suggesting that the CCK peptide is the releasing hormone for FSH in fishes, which is different than that observed in mammals where both LH and FSH release are under the control of GnRH. Based on data using calcium imaging as a readout for stimulation of the gonadotrophs, the researchers present data supporting the hypothesis that CCK stimulates FSH-containing cells in the pituitary. In contrast, LH-containing cells show a weak and variable response to CCK but are highly responsive to GnRH. Data are presented that support the role of CCK in the release of FSH. Researchers also state that functional overlap exists in the potency of GnRH to activate FSH cells, thus the two signalling pathways are not separate. The results are of interest to the field because for many years the assumption has been that fishes use the same signalling mechanism. These data present an intriguing variation where a hormone involved in satiation acts in the control of reproduction.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the manuscript are that researchers have shed light on different pathways controlling reproduction in fishes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Weaknesses are that it is not clear if multiple ligand/receptors are involved (more than one CCK and more than one receptor?). The imaging of the CCK terminals and CCK receptors needs to be reinforced.</p>
<p>Reviewer consultation summary:</p>
<p>The data presented establish sufficiency, but not necessity of CCK in FSH regulation. The paper did not show that CCK endogenously regulates FSH in fish. This has not been established yet.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very important comment, also raised by reviewer 1. To avoid repetition, please see our detailed response to the comment above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The paper presents the pharmacological effects of CCK on ex vivo preparations but does not establish the in vivo physiological function of the peptide. The current evidence for a novel physiological regulatory mechanism is incomplete and would require further physiological experiments. These could include the use of a CCK receptor antagonist in adult fish to see the effects on FSH and LH release, the generation of a CCK knockout, or cell-specific genetic manipulations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As detailed in the responses to the first reviewer, we cannot conduct conditional, cellspecific gene knockout in our model. However we did conducted KO and show the direct effect on FSH and LH secretion together with physiological characterisation of the mutant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Zebrafish have two CCK ligands: ccka, cckb and also multiple receptors: cckar, cckbra and cckbrb. There is ambiguity about which CCK receptor and ligand are expressed and which gene was knocked out.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we clarified which of the receptors are expressed (CCKRBA) and which receptor is targeted. We also provided data showing the specificity of the receptors (both WT and mutant) to the ligands. Supplementary 1 shows receptor cross-activation. The method also specifies the exact NCBI ID numbers of the targeted receptor and the antibody used for the immunostaining.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Blocking CCK action in fish (with receptor KO) affects FSH and LH. Therefore, the work did not demonstrate a selective role for CCK in FSH regulation in vivo and any claims to have discovered FSHRH need to be more conservative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the overlap in the effect of CCK measured in the calcium activation of cells and in the KO model does not allow us to conclude selectivity. In this context, it is crucial to highlight that CCKRBA exhibits high expression on FSH cells but not on LH cells. Therefore, the effect of CCK on LH cells is likely paracrine or through GnRH neurons that were shown to express CCK receptors. In the current version, we emphasize that CCK also induces LH secretion. Although it does not affect LH to the same extent as FSH, an overlap does exist. This is mentioned in the abstract and discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The labelling of the terminals with anti-CCK looks a lot like the background and the authors did not show a specificity control (e.g. anti-CCK antibody pre-absorbed with the peptide or anti-CCK in morphant/KO animals).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figures colours had been updated to better visualise the specific staining of the antibody. Also, The same antibody had been previously used to mark CCK-positive cells in the gut of the red drum fish(Webb, Khan et al. 2010) , where a control (pre-absorbed with the peptide) experiment had been conducted.</p>

<p>The authors have not yet established that CCK is the primary regulator of FSH in vivo.</p>

<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>The authors need to make clear earlier in the Introduction that fish have two types of gonadotropes. This information comes too late (last paragraph) currently.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Added in line 42</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>They should discuss relevant data on the differential regulation of FSH and LH in fish, as a rationale for looking for different releasing factors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This has been discussed in the first paragraph of the introduction</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the last sentence of the penultimate paragraph, the authors assume that it must be a hypothalamic factor that regulates FSH. Why is this necessarily the case? Are there data indicating that a hypothalamic factor is required for FSH production in fish?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This has been mentioned in the discussion, we do not deny that circulating CCK or CCK from other brain areas might affect FSH secretion in the pituitary (line 402-404). However, as the hypothalamus serves as the main gateway from the brain to the pituitary and contains hypophysiotropic CCK neurons it is the most reasonable assumption.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Results:</p>
<p>In the first paragraph, the authors reference three types of CCK receptors, only one of which is expressed in the pituitary. The specific receptor should be named here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The receptor name and NCBI id had been added in this paragraph.</p>

<p>Figure 1: What specificity controls were used for the ISH in Figure 1?</p>

<p>HCR- The method used to identify RNA expression and developed by Molecular Instruments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.molecularinstruments.com/hcr-rnafish-protocols">https://www.molecularinstruments.com/hcr-rnafish-protocols</ext-link>), do not require specific control as had been previously done with older ISH methods. The use of multiple short probes assure the specificity to the RNA.More over the expression is specific to the targeted cells.</p>

<p>In Figure 1D, the red square is missing in the KO fish (at low magnification).</p>

<p>This was fixed in the updated version.</p>

<p>In Figure 1G, the number of dots does not correspond to the number of animals described in the figure legend. Does each point represent an animal?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Each dot represent a fish. The order of the numbers in the legend didn’t match the order in the graph, this had been fixed in the last version</p>

<p>Figure 2A: It is not clear that all FSH (GFP) cells are double-labeled. Should all double-labeled cells appear white? Many appear as green. Some quantification of the proportion of co-labeling is needed. Also, the scale bars are too small to read. Perhaps add the size of the scale bars to the legend.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>They are all double-labeled, as can be seen by the single-color images, since GFP fluorescence is stronger than RCaMP fluorescence, the double-labelling might be seen a green cells; a scale bar was added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 2C: Is the synchronous activity of LH cells here dependent on endogenous GnRH? Can these events be blocked with a GnRH receptor antagonist?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We currently do not have enough data to support this hypothesis and the in vivo 2 photon system is not optimal to answer these questions since these are spontaneous events which are difficult to predict. This is the main reason we moved to an ex vivo system. The similar response we receive when applying GnRH in the ex vivo system support it is GnRH activation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 4C: As some LH cells respond to CCK, can the authors really claim that CCK is a selective regulator of FSH? What explains the heterogeneity in the response of LH cells to CCK?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this version, we highlight that CCK directly activates FSH but it is also affecting LH to some extent. However it is clear that the effect on FSH cells is more significant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figures 5A and B: With larger Ns, some of the trends might be significant (e.g., GnRH stimulated FSH release and CCK stimulated LH release).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Though there is a trend, the values in the Y axis reveal that the trend of response of FSH to GnRH and LH to CCK is lower then the distribution of the basal response (the before) in all of the graphs. Hence we do not believe a larger N will affect those results. We added the range of the secreted hormones concentrations in the result description to emphasize the difference in values,</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figures 5C and D: What explains the lack of an increase in LH secretion following GnRH treatment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not measure LH Secretion in the plasma as we didn’t have enough blood, we do see an increase in LH transcription (see supplementary figure 5 – figure supplement 1)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, as mRNA levels were measured (in C), reference should be made to expression rather than transcription.

<p>Important: Because the labelling of the terminals with anti-CCK looks a lot like the background, it is very important to show the control (anti-CCK antibody pre-absorbed with the peptide). The authors should have these data. The photo needs to have been taken at the same gain (contrast) and the photo showing the terminals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is  a commercial antibody that had been previously validated for CCK in fish. The co-localization pattern resembles GnRH innervation in the pituitary. In fish when hypothalamic neurons innervate the pituitary they do not innervate all the cells, as this is an endocrine system, the peptide can travel to neighbouring cells via diffusion or aided blood flow (Golan, Zelinger et al. 2015) ).

<p>Figure 4c, on right. The text seems to be stretched as if the photo was adjusted without locking the aspect ratio. Please check the original images.</p>

<p>Can the authors use different pseudo colours? Differentiating a double label of white versus yellow is very difficult, and thus the photo is not very convincing.</p>

<p>This had been changed to green and magenta</p>

<p>What is meant by &quot;CCK-AB&quot; antibody? Perhaps anti-CCK would be a better label</p>

<p>Figure 5A: increase the magnification of the insets; the structure of the gonads is very difficult to see with clarity in these low mag images. The most obvious way to improve this figure is to reduce or eliminate the pie graph (not really necessary) and show a high magnification (and larger) image of the gonadal structure.</p>

<p>This is figure 1 in the new version, with magnification of the gonad next to each body section.</p>

<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>&quot; Moreover, in the zebrafish, as well as in other species, the functional overlap in gonadotropin signalling pathways is not limited to the pituitary but is also present in the gonad, through the promiscuity of the two gonadotropin receptors&quot;</p>
<p>
The reasoning of this sentence is not clear: zebrafish do not use GnRH to control reproduction: they lack GnRH1 through genomic rearrangement (see Whitlock, Postlethwait and Ewer 2019) and KO of GnRH2/GnRH3 does not affect reproduction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While GnRH KO model indicate a redundancy of GnRH in this axis in zebrafish, there is also ample evidence for its importance in regulating reproduction such as its effect on gonadotropin (Golan, Martin et al. 2016) and its use in spawning inductions in fish (Mizrahi and Levavi-Sivan 2023). We believe it is currently too soon to conclude that GnRH signalling is completely non relevant to reproduction in cyprinids.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see calcium imaging experiments in the CCKR receptor mutants to establish a more direct connection between peptide action and activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a receptor assay that reflect the non-activation of the mutated receptors by CCK (supplementary figure 1) , and compared it to the wild type that is activated. This show that: 1) CCK directly activate our identified receptor in FSH cells. 2) the mutated receptors are non-active.</p>

<p>&quot;all homozygous fish (CCKR+12/+7/-1/ CCKR+12/+7/-1, n=12)&quot;</p>
<p>It may be better to write the genotype of fish separately as CCKR+12/+12, CCKR+7/+7 and CCKR-1/-1, n=12) otherwise it seems as if all alleles occurred together in the same fish.</p>

<p>The authors should endeavour to improve the presentation of the figures. They should use a sans-serif font and check that text is not cut at the edge of figure panels, that scale bars are uniform and clearly labelled and fonts are of similar size and clearly legible. E.g. labels of the fish brain of Fig3A are very small.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We modified all the figures to adapt the font and the scales, we increased the size of the image in Figure 3a to make the labels clearer.</p>
