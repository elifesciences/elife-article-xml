<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Regulatory T cells (Treg) are crucial immune modulators, yet the exact mechanism of thymic Treg development remains controversial. Here, we present the first direct evidence for H-2O, a peptide editing molecular chaperon for MHC class II antigen processing, on selection of thymic Tregs. We demonstrate that lack of H2-O in the thymic medulla promotes thymic Treg development and leads to an increased peripheral Treg frequency. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of splenic CD4 T cells revealed an enrichment of both effector-like Tregs and activated CD4 T cells in the absence of H2-O. H2-O has been shown to increase the presentation of high-affinity class II epitopes, thus leading to proper negative selection in the medullary thymus. In spite of this notion, our data support two concepts; a) lack of expression of H2-O in thymic medulla creates an environment permissive to Treg development and, b) that loss of H2-O drives increased basal auto-stimulation of CD4 T cells. These findings can help in better understanding of autoimmunity and design of therapeutics for treatment of autoimmune diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>T cells are key players in humoral immune responses. Upon infection with a pathogen, CD4 T cells utilize their T cell receptor (TCR) to survey peptides presented by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) on class II molecules (pMHCII) for recognition. Identification of a cognate pMHCII complex by the TCR leads to CD4 T cell activation and ultimately clearance of the foreign pathogen. Faulty activation, however, can lead to deleterious inflammation causing possible autoimmune diseases and cancer development. Therefore, multiple regulatory processes exist to ensure proper T cell activation.</p>
<p>Regulation of T cell activation begins during thymic development where immature thymocytes are screened for self-reactivity. Broadly divided into positive and negative selection, this process ensures that CD4 T cells expressing high avidity self-reactive TCRs are either eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), or become CD4 regulatory T cells (Tregs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Critical to the screening process for identifying auto-reactive T cells is the Class II antigen processing machinery expressed by medullary thymic epithelium cells (mTECs) and thymic antigen presenting cells (APCs). Two chaperone proteins, H2-M (murine; human, HLA-DM), and H2-O (murine; human, HLA-DO) are major components of the MHC II processing pathway. While H2-M is expressed in all APCs, H2-O is expressed mainly in thymic medulla and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). H2-M plays a critical role in MHC class II antigen processing by dissociating the Class II Invariant Chain peptide (CLIP) from the newly synthesized MHC II. Dissociation of CLIP promotes a peptide-receptive MHC II conformation that can readily scan for the best MHC II groove fitting epitopes of denatured antigens. However, a peptide-receptive MHC II conformation is highly transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). We have proposed that H2-O binds to H2-M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) and works cooperatively with H2-M by stabilizing the peptide-receptive MHC II conformation in order to optimize epitope selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Together, these two molecules ensure that the best MHC II groove fitting epitopes are presented to cognate CD4 T cells.</p>
<p>While the exact mechanism of Treg selection remains to be fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), two critical requirements have been identified as necessary for successful thymic Treg development. First, thymic Treg development requires relatively strong TCR signaling in the thymic medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), and second, Treg development relies on signaling by common γ chain (γC) cytokines, mainly IL-2, for driving Foxp3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Considering that strong TCR signaling during negative selection normally leads to CD4 T cell deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), when investigating Treg selection, both the nature and density of medulla presented self-peptides must be considered. If epitopes are in high abundance and more ubiquitously expressed, then cognate CD4 T cells will undergo clonal deletion. However, if epitopes are in lower abundance and have a sparser expression, leading to discontinuous TCR stimulation, then cognate CD4 T cells might undergo Treg selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). This model of Treg selection relies on the level of TCR signaling that medulla localized CD4 single-positive (SP) T cells receive. Indeed, loss of H2-O function has been shown to alter both the repertoire and density of peptides presented by naïve peripheral B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Thus, loss of H2-O could affect whether CD4 T cells are signaled for deletion, or survival during thymic deletion. Should a lower density of self pMHCII be presented by thymic epithelium, an increased number of self-reactive CD4 T cells might escape deletion leading to an increased frequency of auto-reactive T cell clones in the periphery. Or, alternatively, presentation of a lower density of self pMHCII could promote selection of regulatory T cells.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that loss of H2-O generates a more stimulatory <italic>in vivo</italic> environment impacting both the thymic development and peripheral activation of regulatory T cells.</p>

<title>Loss of H2-O increases the activation state of auditing medulla CD4 T cells</title>
<p>Previously, we demonstrated that loss of H2-O expression correlated with both an increased B cell presentation of low-affinity MHC II peptides, and an increased frequency of a MOG<sub>35-55</sub> specific, self-reactive CD4 T cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Because of H2-O expression in the medullary thymus we speculated that H2-O deficiency might lead to presentation of lower densities of high-affinity self-peptides in the medulla, thereby causing an altered clonal deletion process. Medulla CD4 T cells can be divided into two groups based upon expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>); “Auditing” CD4 T cells (CCR7+ CD4+ Caspase-3<sub>neg</sub>) that are still undergoing self-auditing, and “Clonally Deleted” CD4 T cells (CCR7+ CD4+ Caspase-3<sub>pos</sub>) that have been selected for thymic deletion.</p>
<p>We found that loss of H2-O significantly increased expression of the activation marker CD69 on auditing, but not CD4 T cells selected for clonal deletion (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref></bold>). CD69 in combination with MHC-I levels defines 3 medullary maturation stages: semi-mature (CD69+ MHC-I -), mature 1 (CD69+ MHC-I +), and mature 2 (CD69-MHC-I -) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Subdivision of auditing H2-O-KO CD4 T cells identified a significant increase in the Mature 1 stage (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>, middle</bold>). Conversely, both the semi-mature and mature 2 stages were decreased in H2-O KO mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref> left/right</bold>). H2-O deficiency, however, did not appear to alter the rate of CD4 T cells undergoing clonal deletion (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref></bold>). Importantly, no differences were observed in thymocytes undergoing positive selection (<bold>sFig1</bold>). These data suggest that loss of H2-O drives a more stimulatory thymic medulla environment, but with similar levels of clonal deletion. It is therefore likely that the increased peripheral frequencies of MOG-specific CD4 T cells previously identified is due to increased peripheral expansion of the MOG-reactive clone, not a general altered clonal deletion.</p>

<title>H2-O KO thymi have increased regulatory T cell development</title>
<p>The increase in the Mature 1 (M1) state was noteworthy as Treg development has been shown to begin in the M1 stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). With increased levels of peripheral Treg previously identified in H2-O KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), we wondered if H2-O deficiency was affecting Treg selection. In fact, one model of thymic Treg selection centers around the concept of antigen density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Within this “mosaic” model, sporadic MHC-TCR interactions with sparsely presented self-epitopes leads to Treg development. Having previously shown that peripheral loss of H2-O leads to increased presentation of lower affinity peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), we postulated that altering the level of self-epitopes present in the medulla could alter Treg selection. In support of this idea, we found an increased frequency of CD25+Foxp3+ T cells in the H2-O KO CD4 SP population (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref></bold>). Furthermore, H2-O KO thymic Tregs (tTregs) expressed higher levels of CD25, CD5 and the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref></bold>). As Nur77 has been associated with the level of TCR engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), increased Nur77 signal was particularly interesting since it indicates that absence of H2-O leads to increased TCR engagement suggesting an increased self-reactivity. We also found that H2-O KO tTregs were enriched in the M1 maturation stage (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref></bold>). This could mean two things; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) loss of H2-O leads to increased presentation of specific Treg epitopes thereby increasing the frequency of Treg selection, or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) lower antigen density allows an increased proportion of self-reactive CD4 T cells to engage their cognate ligands at suboptimal levels for clonal deletion but optimal ranges for Treg selection. Cumulatively, evaluation of H2-O KO thymi showed that only CD4 T cells undergoing the auditing process were affected by H2-O loss.</p>

<title>Loss of H2-O correlates with increased peripheral CD4 T cell activation</title>
<p>In light of the observation that lack of H2-O KO did not alter clonal deletion frequencies, we next evaluated whether peripheral loss of H2-O increased CD4 T cells activation. We found that H2-O KO spleens had a dramatic increase in the proportion of CD3+ CD4 T cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref></bold>). Critically, unimmunized H2-O KO spleens had increased levels of CD4 T cells co-expressing the key activation markers CD44+ and CD69+ (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref></bold>). We further assessed the levels of “non-activated” (CCR7+ CD62L+) versus “activated” (CCR7-CD62L-) CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), and found an overall decreased percentage of CCR7 expressing CD4 T cells in H2-O KO spleens (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref></bold>) and lower frequencies of non-activated CD4 T cells in H2-O KO mice (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3d</xref></bold>). Importantly, this correlated with an increase in percentage of activated CD4 T cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3d</xref></bold>). Collectively, these phenotypic analyses support the idea that loss of H2-O leads to increased basal levels of activated CD4 T cells in unimmunized H2-O KO mice.</p>

<p>As discussed above, H2-O KO thymi promoted Tregs selection. Consistent with these observations and our previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), H2-O KO spleens had an increased frequency of CD25+ Foxp3+ Tregs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref></bold>). Furthermore, H2-O KO Tregs showed decreased levels of CD62L expression indicating these cells are likely more activated and circulating through the periphery (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref></bold>). Evaluation of the intracellular levels of Nur77 expression again revealed an increase, suggesting a higher TCR stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>)</bold> further validating the observations that loss of H2-O is driving a more activated state in both conventional CD4 T cells and Treg cells.</p>

<title>Single cell RNA-Sequencing of H2-O KO splenic CD4 T cells confirms increased activation</title>
<p>Based upon the strong FACS data above exhibiting increased numbers of Tregs, and more activated CD4 T cells, we attempted single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to gain a more holistic unbiased characterization. CD3+ CD4+ NK1.1-CD19-cells were sorted from spleens of 3 unimmunized H2-O WT and 3 H2-O KO mice and subjected to 10x Genomics scRNA-seq analyses. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) of the normalized scRNA-seq data identified 11 distinct CD4 T cell clusters (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref> &amp; sFig 2</bold>). Separation of the clusters based upon H2-O WT or H2-O KO genotypes identified a dramatic increase in cluster 0, cluster 2 and cluster 3 in the H2-O KO samples.

Cluster 3 was found to have increased expression of the activation marker CD44, while Cluster 11 expressed high Ki67. Clusters 2 and 4 contained the known Treg genes Foxp3 and Il2ra (CD25) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref> &amp; Sup Table 1</bold>). Clusters 8, 9, and 10 were small populations of Macrophages and NKT cell (<bold>Sup Table 1</bold>). Condensing the cluster analysis further supported our initial FACS data that unimmunized H2-O-KO mice have a decreased frequency of “Non-activated” CD4 T cells (68.90% H2-O KO vs 74.17% H2-O WT with a coinciding increase in “Activated” (14.14% H2-O KO vs 8.53% H2-O WT) CD4 T cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref></bold>). To further test whether the higher activated state in H2-O KO T cells were due to the H2-O KO CD4 T cells themselves, or the environment, we performed an adoptive transfer experiment of dye labeled naïve (CD4+ CD44-CD25-) Thy1.1+ CD4 T cells from H2-O WT into either unimmunized Thy1.2+ H2-O WT, or Thy1.2+ H2-O KO hosts. As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5d</xref></bold>, H2-O KO hosts induced significantly more <italic>in vivo</italic> proliferation of the WT cells than the H2-O WT hosts. These data additionally confirms that loss of H2-O creates a more activating CD4 T cell environment by presenting a wider range of self-epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>

<title>H2-O KO Tregs have a more activated phenotype</title>
<p>Analyses of the two Treg clusters revealed that the frequency of Clusters 2 and 4 were roughly equal in H2-O WT samples, whereas H2-O KO samples had an overrepresentation of Cluster 2 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>, left</bold>). Both cluster 2 and 4 expressed the classic Treg genes Foxp3, IL2ra [CD25], CTLA4, and Pdcd1 [PD-1] (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>, right</bold>; <bold>Sup Table 1</bold>). Also identified was the transcription factor Ikzf2 [Helios], a marker of stable Treg lineage commitment in inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and debated marker of thymic Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Supporting our scRNA-Seq analysis, Helios protein expression was found in both H2-O WT and H2-O KO CD4 Tregs (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b</xref></bold>). The data also showed significant Helios expression in H2-O KO Foxp3-CD4 T cells supporting that loss of H2-O increases CD4 T cell activation. Interestingly, comparison of the cluster 2 genetic signature with a published Treg data set indicated that these cells are likely effector-like Tregs. Furthermore, breaking down Cluster 2 by genotype showed that H2-O KO Tregs had a larger fold change in expression of the core effector genes signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6c</xref></bold>). We hypothesize that this activated Treg state is likely driven by the increased basal CD4 T cell activation. Expansion of this Treg population could certainly be a mechanism controlling spontaneous autoimmunity in H2-O KO mice.</p>

<p>In summary, both scRNA-seq and FACs analyses showed that H2-O KO mice have an increased frequency of both conventional and regulatory CD4 T cells in the spleens of unimmunized mice. Loss of thymic H2-O expression correlated with an increased tTreg population that have received increased TCR stimulation which suggests increased autoreactivity. Furthermore, increased activation of conventional splenic CD4 T cells is likely a driving factor for the increased effector-like Treg status that was identified by scRNA-seq analyses of H2-O-KO CD4 cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have refined our understanding of how loss of H2-O alters CD4 T cell activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thymic analysis of medulla localized CD4 T cells pointed to a novel role for H2-O on CD4 T cells undergoing self-auditing. Importantly, lack of H2-O expression led to an increased frequency of both thymic and peripheral Tregs.</p>
<p>Tregs play a fundamental role in maintenance of homeostasis, hence a better understanding of the mechanism of their development is highly desirable and the subject of numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Our studies here are the first attempt in demonstrating that H2-O is a critical player in Treg development. While the exact mechanism by which thymic Treg cells are selected remains somewhat uncertain, recent studies support the idea that intermittent TCR signaling along with cytokine signaling drive Treg development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). These findings and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) support a more avidity based model of Treg selection, in which alterations to the density of self-ligands present in the medulla will have differential effects on CD4 T cell selection. Intermittent TCR signaling as the driving force in Treg selection is very relevant to our understanding of how HLA-DO contributes to epitope selection during antigen processing. HLA-DO in complex with HLA-DM leads to better refinement of the epitopes from denatured antigens, promoting selection of the best fitting epitopes in the groove of MHC II molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). As such, when DO is present, higher affinity peptides are more likely to be presented. Conversely, in the absence of DO a larger percent of lower affinity epitopes are selected. Indeed, we have recently reported that peptides eluted from H2-O KO mice expressing either murine I-A<sup>b</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) or human HLA-DR1 (Welsh et al, unpublished data) were of a lower general affinity. Accordingly, presentation of a larger portion of lower affinity peptides in the thymic medulla of H2-O KO mice is expected. Intermittent TCR signaling is typically generated by either pMHC II that are less stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), or TCR/pMHC of lower affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Our findings here support the former. We associate increased Treg development as a consequence of the presentation of lower affinity peptides to self-auditing CD4 T cells.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous egress of mature CD4 T cells from the thymus, we also analyzed splenic CD4 T cells from unimmunized H2-O WT and H2-O KO mice. H2-O KO splenic CD4 T cells in unimmunized mice revealed an increased frequency of CD44hiCD69+ antigen experienced CD4 T cells, which suggests an increased level of antigen-specific TCR signaling in H2-O KO mice. As previously implied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), a simple explanation for this activated state is incomplete thymic deletion in H2-O KO mice. While we were able to show that H2-O KO mice failed to delete specific CD4 clonal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), detection of differences at the global levels did not show significant changes between the two genotypes. Nonetheless, we suggest that presentations of different arrays of self-antigens as well as their lower densities on thymic medulla leads to a less than optimal thymic deletion of self-reactive CD4 T cells and their routing to the periphery. Similar to activated CD4 T cells in periphery, H2-O KO Treg cells also had a more effector-like phenotype, indicating enhanced Treg activation in unimmunized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our studies add a new dimension to our understanding of the role of H2-O in both CD4 T cell selection and activation. For the first time, we report on thymic negative selection in H2-O KO mice and demonstrate that loss of H2-O enhances thymic selection of regulatory T cells. Once in the periphery, an increased proportion of H2-O KO Tregs appear to be activated in a TCR dependent manner. These effector-like Tregs will likely help control increased basal CD4 T cell activation. However, the exact mechanism by which increased Treg cells are selected in the H2-O KO thymus remains to be determined. While we propose that alterations in medulla pMHCII-TCR avidity interactions could lead to enhanced Treg selection, increased presentation of self-antigens in a more tissue restricted antigenic (TRA) manner could also be possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>).</p>

<p>Analyses of T-cell scRNA-seq were performed with the package Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), as follows. Data was filtered to remove cells with low gene count (&lt;200), large number of UMIs (&gt;12,000) and high (&gt;5%) fraction of mitochondrial reads. Expression levels of genes were log-normalized, and the most variable 2000 genes were selected for linear dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The first 15 principal components were then used to performed unsupervised clustering using the Seurat SNN clustering package, with a resolution of 0.2. To identify cell types, potential markers for each cluster were calculated as the set of genes significantly differentially expressed in each cluster compared to all others, using the function FindAllMarkers, and by searching existing literature and marker databases. Lastly, differentially expressed genes for each cell type between conditions were determined using the function FindMarkers with the default function (bimod).</p>

<p>This paper seeks to understand how the presentation of peptides by medullary thymic epithelial cells may be regulated by the MHCII peptide loading modulator, H2-O, and how this may affect the selection of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Further work is needed to ensure that the findings are robust: currently the analysis of data is <bold>inadequate</bold> and inconsistencies in the reported findings are not placed in context with results from other groups. The current version does not provide sufficient support for the claims regarding the effects on Treg cell selection.</p>

<p>The non-classical MHCII-like protein H2-M is essential for the loading of peptides on MHCII. The discovery that DM was partnered with a second MHCII-like protein, H2-O, which squelched or modified its activity was confounding. It was immediately speculated that H2-O was likely diminished self-peptide presentation. This led to the hypothesis that H2-O was involved in preventing unwanted CD4 T cell activation, thereby making autoimmunity less likely. 25 years of analysis of H2-O deficient mice have, indeed, shown that the self-peptide repertoire in the absence of H2-O is modestly altered. Demonstrating that autoimmunity results from this altered peptide repertoire has been decidedly less convincing. Old mice are reported to have increased serum anti-nuclear antibody titers, but mice prone to type 1 diabetes (T1D) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were not impacted by the loss of H2-O (Lee et al, 2021). Induction of the multiple sclerosis-like disease, EAE, in mice, was also shown to not be impacted by Lee et al 2021, although in a previous paper (Welsh et al 2020), the authors of this current manuscript suggest otherwise. Unfortunately, these discrepancies are not acknowledged by the authors, and the papers are, for the most part, not referenced.</p>
<p>In addition to antigen-presenting cells, H2-O is also found in MHCII-expressing medullary epithelial cells, suggesting it might play a role in T-cell selection. Direct data to support this idea, however, has, at most, shown a minimal impact. In this manuscript, the authors follow up on their previous paper (Welsh et al, 2020) to further evaluate changes to T cell development. The conclusions are that H2-O impacts Treg development and changes the frequency and homeostasis of CD4 T cells. Although these would be interesting results, the data analysis is flawed, the presentation is incomplete, and the conclusions are exaggerated.</p>
<p>T-cell development analysis shown in Figs. 1 and 2 use the discovery from the Hogquist lab (Breed et all 2019) that thymocytes destined for clonal deletion can be differentiated from those still &quot;auditioning&quot; for selection by FACS for expression of cleaved caspase 3. Detection relies on complex FACS analysis that requires the exclusion of multiple populations, followed by accurate gating on CD5+TCRb+ cells (see Hogquist Fig. 1A). The authors apparently neglected to use the essential gating steps, but rather only used CD4 and CCR7 expression (Fig. 1A). This deviation from the Hogquist approach makes interpretation of Figs 1 and 2 meaningless. Even if this is an oversight in the description of the experiments, key conclusions are drawn from minimal changes to CD69 expression. CD69 is expressed as a continuum in the thymus (a &quot;shoulder&quot;) making gating somewhat subjective and prone to variation from experiment to experiment. At the minimum, FACS data should be shown to indicate how these changes were measured, plus variations from mouse to mouse should be plotted, with statistics. FACS data needs to be shown to define how the complex semi-mature, M1, and M2 populations were defined (see Hogquist Fig. 2) from which key conclusions are drawn.</p>
<p>To make the data more robust, 1) cell numbers must be included for all experiments;</p>
<p>1. rather than normalizing results to &quot;the average H2-O WT levels&quot;, the actual data should be included;</p>
<p>2. figures should be more completely labeled/described;</p>
<p>3. FACS gating strategies should be clearly laid out (again, see Hogquist for examples). Furthermore, efforts must be made to explain why results are so different from analyses of H2-O deficient mice that have been published by many other groups. For example, the reported &quot;dramatic increase in the proportion of CD3+CD4+ T cells&quot; is not consistent with previous reports starting with Lars Karlsson's initial report (Liljedahl et al 1998). Extensive spontaneous activation of CD4 T cells has also not been reported in other papers that have studied these mice. Again, the paper is not placed in the context of the long, very thorough analysis of both the H2-O deficient mice and the study of H2-O/DO and H2-M/DM in general.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript's main claim is that the absence of H2-O, a component of the MHC II presentation pathway, promotes regulatory T cell development and function.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the submitted material is not sufficient for proper evaluation of the manuscript, both in terms of the significance of the findings and the strength of the supporting evidence.</p>
<p>Major issues include:</p>
<p>- the scRNAseq (shown in Fig. 5) is too rudimentary to allow any conclusion. Statements in the text (eg &quot;Principle Component Analysis (PCA) of the normalized scRNA-seq data identified 11 distinct CD4 T cell clusters&quot;, line 166) suggest that additional expertise should be leveraged for these analyses.</p>
<p>- Most flow cytometry data (Figs. 1 and 2) shows marginal (at best) differences on y-axis truncated bar graphs, with no original data plot, gating strategies, etc., severely challenging conclusions drawn from this data.</p>

<p>We are sorry that both eLife and the Reviewers feel that our submitted studies are currently insufficient to support our hypothesis that loss of H2-O function affects thymic Treg selection. As this is the first study directly evaluating loss of H2-O in the thymus we do not feel that we overstated our finding as suggested by Reviewer 1. We hope that a revised version of the manuscript can satisfy the reviewers’ criticisms.</p>
<p>-Reviewer 1 is asking us to address the presumed discrepancies between our previous work (Welsh et al 2020, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000590">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000590</ext-link>) and data from Lee et al. 2021 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2100650">https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2100650</ext-link>) in this current manuscript, which does not report on the development of EAE in DO-KO and DO-WT mice. All experiments here are on naïve mice. As such, we wish to justify our lack of discussion of Lee et al (2021) findings.</p>
<p>Lee et al (2021) reported the effects of DO on both EAE and SLE development, they used mainly H2-Oβ KO mice. As we have never used these CRISPR generated mice, we cannot have a direct in-house comparison. However, we did note that reported disease curve for female H2-Oβ KO mice had a similar trend indicating increased EAE disease development, similar to what we have reported back in our 2020 paper (Welsh et al PLoS Biology). In the single experiment that utilized H2-Oβ KO mice for EAE development, Lee et al found a different disease trend than ours. However, Lee et al (2021)’s tested only 4-5 mice per group in the single experiment and their measurement of the disease development solely relied on visual assessment of the limbs and tail functionality. Our study verified EAE disease development by multiple approached including analyses of MOG-specific tetramer staining of the CNS CD4 lymphocyte infiltrate, and in vivo NIRF whole-body imaging on diseased DO-WT and DO-KO mice using an antibody probe specific to MBP. We had repeated our experiments on the disease development greater than 15 times using 5-8 mice per group. Below is an excerpt from our Results Section of Welsh et al PLoS Biology, clearly explaining how many experiments were performed and the number of mice per group per experiment:</p>
<p>“From these studies, we found that DO-KO mice had an accelerated onset of disease compared to DO-WT mice (Fig 7A). Disease symptoms (Score 1) appeared around Day 8–10 and quickly progressed to advanced disease (Score 3–4) by Day 14–16 in DO-KO. In contrast, DO-WT mice started showing symptoms around Day 12 and progressed to advanced disease scores by Day 20. Total cell infiltration into the CNS tissue was slightly higher in DO-KO mice, but no change in total brain weight was observed (S5 Fig). To further correlate the state of disease with CD4 infiltration, we performed in vivo NIRF whole-body imaging on diseased DO-WT and DO-KO mice using an antibody (Ab) probe specific to myelin basic protein (MBP). The Ab reacts with MBP only when the myelinated glia cells are damaged during disease development [56]. Thus, by detecting demyelination, whole-body imaging allowed us to fully visualize the co-localization of CD4 T cells at the sites of demyelination occurring in diseased mice. Interestingly, when mice of various disease scores were imaged, we found increased co-localization of infiltrating CD4 T cells with anti-MBP staining in DO-KO mice, but not in DO-WT mice (Fig 7B). These data not only confirmed the flow cytometric findings that diseased DO-KO mice have a greater influx of lymphocytes into their CNS tissue (S5 Fig), it also verified the massive demyelination that occurs during the disease”</p>
<p>And again in the Legend to Figure 7;</p>
<p>“Representative curves showing the time course of disease development in DO-KO (red) and DO-WT mice (white). N = 5 mice per group, representative of &gt;15 repeat experiments. Score system: 0 = no symptoms, 1 = limp tail, 2 = limp tail + partial hind limb paralysis, 3 = limp tail + total hind limb paralysis, 4 = limp tail + total hind limb paralysis + partial forelimb paralysis. Data represented as mean ± SEM.”</p>
<p>Despite clarity of the description of our experiments, Lee et al have publicly slandered us and grossly misrepresented our work by stating the following:</p>
<p>“A recent study (11-Welsh et al) found that B6.Oa−/− mice were more susceptible to EAE than control B6J animals. However, that conclusion was based on a single experiment, in which control B6J mice developed very mild EAE disease with an average score of 1, which is far lower than the disease scores published by other groups (30–32) and also observed in our study. Thus, in this inducible model of autoimmunity, H2-O deficiency does not contribute to either disease development or severity.”</p>
<p>-Another important variable between our studies and Lee et al (Lee et al 2021) was the use of a commercially available disease induction kit versus our immunization solutions that followed the established protocols by Nancy Ruddle et al (J Exp Med. 1997 Oct 20; 186(8): 1233–1240. doi: 10.1084/jem.186.8.1233). Notoriously, EAE disease development could vary widely based upon the quantities and purity of, a) MOG peptide, b) amount of tuberculosis antigen in the CFA, c) quantity of pertussis toxin and injection strategies, as well as many other uncontrollable factors. While a comparison these two results are irrelevant to our current study, we will be more than happy to compare our results from the previously published work with Lee et al. in the discussion.</p>
<p>-We want to emphasize that we did follow Hogquists et al’s gating strategy for detecting auditing vs deleted thymocytes by subdividing total thymocytes into “Non-signaled” (TCR-β-, CD5-/inter) and “Signaled” (TCR-β+ CD5+/hi) populations before further gating on only medulla localized CD4 T cells. The “CCR7+ CD4+” label in Figure 1 was meant to orient the reader without overwhelming the figure with numerous flow plots. To address this concern, we will be including (1) updated Supplemental figures showing the complete gating strategy, (2) updated figure legends and text to emphasize the fact that auditing/deletion gating came from CD4 T cells which passed positive selection (i.e. TCR-β+ CD5+/hi), and (3) including representative flow plots for all Figure 1 panels to the revise manuscript.</p>
<p>-Also, regarding “discrepancies between our data and Liljedahl et al 1998”;</p>
<p>H2-O KO mice used by Liljedahl et al were on a 129/Ola genomic background. The H2-O KO mice used for both of our papers have been completely backcrossed to C57BL/6J. Clearly, non-MHC genes contribute to the impacts of MHC proteins, yet how the 129/Ola genomic background could affect the H2-O genes remains to be discovered. And (B), no data was shown supporting their published statement below:</p>
<p>“The proportions of B cells as well as of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lymph node, spleen, and thymus were similar in H2-Oa–deficient and wild-type mice (data not shown)”. (Liljedahl et al 1998).</p>
<p>Reviewer 2:</p>
<p>scRNA-Seq analysis was performed by the Computational Biology Computing Core at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. We missed including this acknowledgement as our core facility does not request authorship or acknowledgements. The sentence has been edited for the correct terminology.</p>
<p>-About truncated bar graph, in the entire paper we have only two bar graphs, neither of which is truncated. So, we are puzzled by the reviewer’s comment as to what figure he/she is referring to.
-We would like to remind the Reviewer 2 that since DO works together with DM and functions differently on peptide of different sequences, the reported data on cumulative effects of DO in vivo have notoriously been rather minor. Especially, since our current study focuses on the naïve mice, major changes were not expected.</p>
<p>-Regarding leaving out gating strategies, we missed out on providing the gating strategies for all the figure in the original version. However, full FACS gating strategies have now been provided in the new supplemental figures and representative FACS plots have been added to ALL main figures.</p>
