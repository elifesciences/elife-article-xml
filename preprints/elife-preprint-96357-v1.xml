<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system orchestrates 24-hour rhythms in physiology and behavior by governing rhythmic transcription within cells. Astrocyte, the most abundant glial cell type, play crucial roles in central nervous system functions. However, a detailed understanding of how the circadian clock impacts functions of astrocyte remains largely unexplored. In this study, utilizing circadian clock-synchronized mouse cultured cortical astrocytes and RNA sequencing, we identified 412 circadian rhythmic transcripts with a distinct astrocyte-specific expression pattern. A Gene Ontology analysis of these rhythmic transcripts highlighted genes implicated in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis as being under circadian control. Notably, Herpud1 (Herp) exhibited robust circadian rhythmicity at both mRNA and protein levels, a rhythm disrupted in astrocytes lacking the circadian transcription factor, BMAL1. HERP regulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by modulating the degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (ITPRs). Intriguingly, ATP-stimulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release varied with the circadian cycle, being more pronounced at subjective night, likely owing to the rhythmic expression of ITPR2. Furthermore, this rhythmic ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response led to day/night variations in the phosphorylation of Cx43 (Ser368) and the gap junctional communication. Given the role of gap junction channel (GJC) in propagating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we suggest that this circadian regulation of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses could markedly affect astrocytic modulation of synaptic activity according to the time of day. Overall, our study enhances the understanding of how circadian clock influences astrocyte function in the CNS, shedding light on their potential role in daily variations of brain activity and health.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The circadian clock orchestrates a range of behaviors, physiological processes, and cellular and biochemical activities in organisms with approximately 24-hour rhythms, facilitating adaptation to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005</xref>). In mammals, the master clock localized in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus, synchronizes peripheral tissue clocks throughout the body to the light/dark cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mohawk et al., 2012</xref>). The circadian clock’s molecular mechanism is driven by a transcriptional translational feedback loop (TTFL). CLOCK and BMAL1 form a heterodimer that triggers expression of the repressor genes, <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per</italic>) and <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>Cry)</italic>, in addition to other clock-controlled output genes. PER and CRY proteins then translocate to the nucleus, where they interact with CLOCK/BMAL1, halting further transcriptional activation. A secondary feedback loop involving the interplay between transcriptional activation by ROR and repression by REV-ERB finely regulates the rhythmic transcription of <italic>Bmal1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Takahashi, 2017</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that the circadian clock controls the rhythmic transcription of a large number of genes, displaying notable tissue specificity. This characteristic underscores the time-of-day-specific functional specialization of diverse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mure et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, circadian clock-controlled genes significantly influence various physiological processes including development, metabolism, aging, and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lananna &amp; Musiek, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Reinke &amp; Asher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schultz &amp; Kay, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Astrocytes, a type of glial cell and the most abundant cell type in the CNS play vital roles in CNS function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sofroniew &amp; Vinters, 2010</xref>). They maintain the homeostasis of extracellular fluids, ions, and neurotransmitters; provide energy substrates to neurons ; modulate local blood flow ; assist in interstitial fluid drainage. Beyond these roles, astrocytes interact functionally with brain cells including neurons and astrocytes, contributing actively to brain circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). Though not electrically excitable, astrocytes exhibit complex intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, both spatially and temporally, within individual astrocytes and across astrocytic networks, thereby influencing synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Semyanov et al., 2020</xref>). Activation of Gq-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) by external stimuli initiates the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) signaling cascade, causing a release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER that substantially increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Guerra-Gomes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). Astrocytes express various types of Gq-coupled receptors activated by neurotransmitters such as ATP, epinephrine, glutamate, and dopamine etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). Increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in astrocytes lead to alterations in cell-to-cell communication and/or induce gliotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Giaume et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). Recent studies have shown that astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling can regulate organism-level behaviors, such as circadian rhythms and sleep patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bojarskaite et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brancaccio et al., 2019</xref>) as well.</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence underscores the importance of the circadian clock in astrocytes function. First of all, cultured murine cortical astrocytes expressing a PER-luciferase reporter (PER::LUC) exhibit circadian oscillations per expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Prolo et al., 2005</xref>). These astrocytes can be entrained by various cues, including temperature cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Prolo et al., 2005</xref>) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), which is the neuropeptide synchronizing SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Marpegan et al., 2009</xref>). These findings provide strong evidence that a molecular clock operates in astrocytes. In addition, disruption of clock genes specific to astrocytes has been linked to a range of deleterious effects, including excessive astrocyte activation, disruptions in daily activity patterns, impaired learning, metabolic imbalances, and a shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barca-Mayo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barca-Mayo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Griffin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lananna et al., 2018</xref>). Remarkably, these phenotypic changes closely resemble those observed in astrocytes during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brandebura et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Phatnani &amp; Maniatis, 2015</xref>). Moreover, the rhythmic metabolic activity of astrocytes, including intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations and neurotransmitter release, is critical for circadian timing in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brancaccio et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the emerging significance of circadian rhythms in astrocyte function in health and disease, our understanding of the link between the circadian clock and specific astrocytic functions is still limited.</p>
<p>In this study, we conducted a transcriptome analysis to investigate how the circadian clock regulates astrocyte function. Our research uncovered that <italic>Herp (</italic>homocysteine-inducible ER protein with ubiquitin like domain 1; Herp) exhibited a BMAL1-dependent rhythmic expression pattern, peaking at midday and reaching its nadir at mid-night. Herp1 was important for ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation in cultured astrocytes. ATP stimulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response varied according to circadian time (CT), a dependence that was absent in cultured astrocytes from <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. This response was mediated by HERP1-mediated degradation of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 2 (ITPR2) degradation. Furthermore, the pronounced release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the subjective night led to robust phosphorylation of the Ser368 residue of CONNEXIN 43 (CX43), likely diminishing cell-to-cell communication between astrocytes. Overall, our study demonstrates that the circadian clock orchestrates a variety of astrocytic processes including Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by controlling the rhythmic transcription of genes, highlighting its pivotal role in CNS function.</p>

<title>Defining circadian rhythmic transcripts in mouse cultured cortical astrocytes</title>
<p>To understand how the circadian clock regulates astrocyte physiology, we conducted a circadian transcriptome analysis in cultured mouse cortical astrocytes. Cultured astrocytes were subjected to serum shock (SS), which synchronizes the circadian clock, and then harvested at 4 hour intervals for 2 days beginning 12hrs after. A time series astrocyte transcriptome was determined RNA-seq (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The Gaussian mixture model was used to define the sets of expressed transcripts. We chose 0.577 transcripts per million (TPM) as a cut-off, corresponding to the 1% threshold in the distribution curve of highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A</xref>). A total of 17,671 transcripts, with the highest value among the 12 time points exceeding the TPM threshold 0.577, were considered to be expressed. To validate astrocyte enrichment in our cell culture system, we compared the expression of marker genes for nervous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Time-merged mean TPM values indicated that transcriptome data were replete with astrocyte markers but lacked markers for microglia, oligodendrocytes, neurons, and endothelial cell.</p>

</fig>
<p>To assess rhythmically oscillating genes in time-series transcriptome datasets, we applied BioCycle and MetaCycle packages, which have had been successfully used for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agostinelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), to the astrocyte transcriptome. BioCycle and MetaCycle analyses detected 321 and 311 periodic transcripts, respectively (FDR corrected, q-value &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Among those transcripts, 220 (53.4%) were detected by both methods, but many transcripts were not overlapping. For example, <italic>Plat</italic> and <italic>Il34</italic> were detected as rhythmic only in BioCycle and <italic>Mybph</italic> and <italic>Adora1</italic> were detected rhythmic only in MetaCycle. Despite these incongruences, these four genes clearly exhibited a circadian rhythmic expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Accordingly, we applied the union of two lists, identifying a total of 412 transcripts representing 2.3% of all transcripts as circadian rhythmic genes (Dataset S1). Oscillations of these 412 transcripts are illustrated in the heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1D</xref>.</p>
<p>Next, we compared rhythmic transcripts of astrocytes with those of 12 mouse tissues derived from CircaDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), a database of genes that exhibit circadian expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2A</xref>). Majority of rhythmic transcripts in astrocyte (265 of 412, 65.3%) was not rhythmic or rhythmic in one tissue. 14 transcripts were rhythmic in more than 10 tissues; most of these genes were core clock genes except <italic>Tspan4</italic>, <italic>Tsc22d3</italic>, <italic>Wee1</italic>. These results are consistent with previous reports that circadian rhythmic expression is controlled in a tissue specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mure et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). A comparison of the phases of these 14 common oscillating transcripts between CircaDB and our analysis showed that all 14 transcripts exhibited a consistent time difference between CircaDB and our analysis, where 8 hours after SS corresponded to CT0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2B</xref>). An additional comparison of phases of 82 transcripts that overlapped in only one tissue indicated a very robust phase correlation between astrocytes and the corresponding tissue (<italic>r</italic> = 0.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2C</xref>). Collectively, our analysis indicates that the identified oscillating transcripts were not false positive or noises but instead were clearly associated with the circadian clock. We then analyzed the phase distribution of oscillating transcripts by performing a hierarchical clustering analysis. For more intuitive and physiological interpretation, we transformed TASS phase in our data into CT phase by setting TASS 8 to CT0. Oscillating transcripts were divided into two clusters, with cluster 1 containing 185 transcripts and cluster 2 containing 227 transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3</xref>). A circular map of peak phases across all rhythmic genes revealed two major peaks; one early night peak (CT12 ∼ CT16) and one late night or dawn peak (CT21 ∼ CT1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Circadian transcriptome studies conducted in multiple animal tissues have indicated that the phases of each tissue are not randomly distributed but are predominantly clustered in one or two narrow temporal windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with these previous reports, mouse cultured astrocytes exhibited a high degree of temporal organization. Intriguingly, there was a relatively quiescent zone during subjective daytime, a finding different from that observed for diurnal animals, which showed a quiescent zone during subjective nighttime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mure et al., 2018</xref>). To understand the biological processes and pathways controlled by the circadian clock, we performed a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on each cluster using Metascape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://metascape.org">https://metascape.org</ext-link>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Given that the goal of our research was to investigate processes controlled by the circadian clock, we excluded 17 core clock transcripts-<italic>Arntl, Clock, Nfil3, Npas2, Bhlhe40, Bhlhe41, Cry1, Cry2, Dbp, Elf, Nr1d1, Nr1d2, Per1, Per2, Per3, Rorc,</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic> from our GO enrichment analysis. The analysis of the remaining transcripts showed that cluster 1, containing <italic>Rhoc, Bcar1, Gpld1, Hspa5,</italic> and <italic>mmp14</italic> etc. was enriched for the biological process “positive regulation of cell migration (GO:0030335). Time varying cell motility has been reported to be important for the circadian rhythms of wound-healing processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoyle et al., 2017</xref>). Although astrocytes in the adult brain are largely non-motile under normal physiological conditions, their migratory activity is enhanced during the process of astrogliosis in the context of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pekny &amp; Pekna, 2016</xref>). Given this robust circadian rhythmic expression of genes that regulate motility, the expectation is that wound repair activity of astrocytes might vary according to the time of insult and would presumably be higher toward the end of the active period. Consistent with this, the biological processes, “regulation of cell-cell junction organization” and “cell-substrate adhesion” which are important for wound repair, were also enriched in the cluster 1. One of the biological processes enriched in cluster 2, was “calcium ion homeostasis (GO:0055074)” a term that was intriguing because of the importance of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in numerous astrocyte functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agulhon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Guerra-Gomes et al., 2017</xref>). Identified Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis-related genes included <italic>Herp</italic>, <italic>Slc4a11</italic>, <italic>Sord</italic> and <italic>Kcnh1</italic> etc. with <italic>Herp</italic> being the most significant gene with large oscillation amplitude (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table. S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Circadian rhythmic expression of <italic>Herp</italic> in mouse astrocyte culture</title>
<p><italic>Herp</italic> was first identified as a novel gene that exhibited altered expression in response to homocysteine treatment in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as part of a study on hyperhomocysteinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kokame et al., 1996</xref>). Homocysteine induces ER stress and growth arrest in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Outinen et al., 1999</xref>). Subsequent studies have shown that Herp is strongly induced not only by homocysteine but also by drugs that cause ER stress, such as tunicamycin or thapsigargin. HERP, characterized by an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain and present in the ER membrane, facing cytoplasmic side, has emerged as a novel target protein in the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kokame et al., 2000</xref>). In particular, <italic>Herp</italic> is a member of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) complex, which participates in ubiquitination and relocation of ERAD substrates, as demonstrated in several cell types (e.g. HEK 293T, MEF, NIH3T3 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Leitman et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, a recent study reported that HERP is capable of modulating the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response through IP<sub>3</sub>R degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Paredes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Torrealba et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We first examined the expression patterns of core clock genes and <italic>Herp</italic> in our cultured astrocytes. <italic>Bmal1</italic>, the positive element of the TTFL, was rhythmically expressed with a peak at CT24. <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Rev-Erbα</italic>, clock genes downstream of CLOCK/BMAL1, were rhythmically expressed with peaks at CT12 and CT8, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). <italic>Herp</italic> showed a robust rhythmic expression pattern, with a peak at CT12, that was comparable to that of <italic>Per2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Then, in order to verify the circadian expression of <italic>Herp</italic>, we performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). mRNA levels of <italic>Bmal1</italic>, <italic>Rev-Erbα</italic> and <italic>Herp</italic> exhibited circadian rhythm with similar phase of RNAseq results. Next, because many genes were rhythmically transcribed but their protein levels do not exhibit rhythmic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Reddy et al., 2006</xref>), we examined whether the levels of HERP were rhythmic. We first validated the specificity of HERP antiserum by performing Western blot analysis of astrocytes treated with siRNA targeting <italic>Herp</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> - 2E). Herp siRNA greatly reduced both the levels of <italic>Herp</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and the intensities of specific bands in Western blot analyses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Circadian clock synchronized cultured astrocytes were sampled every 6 hours for 2days and processed for Western blot analysis of BMAL1 and HERP. The phosphorylation status of BMAL1 exhibits circadian variation, such that hyper-phosphorylated BMAL1 peaks at midday and hypo-phosphorylated BMAL1 peaks early or at the end of the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yoshitane et al., 2009</xref>). In our SS-synchronized cultured astrocytes, BMAL1 was hyperphosphorylated at mid-day (e.g. CT10, 16, 34, and 40) and hypo-phosphorylated early or at the end of day (e.g. CT4, 22, 28, and 46) throughout two daily cycles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>) indicating the strong circadian rhythm of cultured astrocytes. Importantly, the levels of HERP proteins oscillated peaking at midday (CT10, CT34) and reaching a minimum early in the day or late at night (CT4, CT22, CT36), a pattern similar to that of its mRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). Finally, to investigate whether the rhythmic expression of <italic>Herp</italic> is regulated by a circadian clock, we examined <italic>Herp</italic> mRNA and protein expression patterns in primary astrocyte cultured from <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. In <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> astrocyte cultures, the rhythmic expression patterns of <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Rev-Erbα</italic>, and <italic>Herp</italic> were abrogated and their expression was maintained at trough levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). HERP protein levels were constant throughout the daily cycles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). Collectively, these observations indicated that the expression of <italic>Herp</italic> exhibits a robust circadian rhythm that is controlled by BMAL1 in cultured mouse astrocytes. These results further suggest that HERP controlled cellular processes would vary according to CT.</p>

<title><italic>Herp</italic> knockdown alters ATP-induced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release</title>
<p>Next, we sought to investigate whether HERP-controlled processes are under circadian regulation. We examined HERP regulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in the astrocytes, which have previously been reported in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Paredes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Torrealba et al., 2017</xref>) employing the organelle-specific fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator G-CEPIA1er(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>) (ER specific), R-GECO1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wu et al., 2013</xref>) (cytosol specific), and mito-R-GECO1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>) (mitochondria specific). ATP serves not only as a fundamental energy source but also functions as an active intercellular messenger. In astrocytes, application of ATP induces an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Neary et al., 1988</xref>), a process mediated by ATP binding to the G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub> coupled P2Y receptor, which acts through activation of PLC-β and subsequent hydrolysis of PIP<sub>2</sub> to produce diacylglycerol (DAG) and IP<sub>3</sub>, the latter of which then mobilize Ca<sup>2+</sup> through IP<sub>3</sub>Rs on the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baryshnikov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">James &amp; Butt, 2001</xref>). We treated control and <italic>Herp</italic> siRNA treated astrocytes with 100μM ATP and monitored subcellular changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>. ATP treatment rapidly decreased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> in control astrocytes and this response was greater in <italic>Herp</italic> siRNA treated astrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> - 3C). The ER as the main Ca<sup>2+</sup> store in the cell releasesCa<sup>2+</sup> which is then rapidly transmitted to other organelles such as mitochondria and lysosomes and altered cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Although ATP treatment did not significantly alter cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in control astrocytes, it greatly increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in <italic>Herp-</italic>knockdown astrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> – 3F). Consistently, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> was greatly increased under <italic>Herp</italic> siRNA condition compared with control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref> – 3I). These results indicated that HERP controls ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in astrocytes thereby impacting diverse subcellular signaling processes. Next, we examined the mechanism by which HERP controls ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>.There are three subtypes of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs encoded by the genes <italic>Itpr1</italic>, <italic>Itpr2</italic>, and <italic>Itpr3</italic>. In our cultured astrocytes, transcriptome analysis indicated <italic>Itpr1</italic> as the most prevalent, followed by <italic>Itpr2</italic>, while <italic>Itpr3</italic> expression was minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref>). Notably, expression of <italic>Itpr</italic> subtypes was not rhythmic. We then assessed the ITPR1 and ITPR2 protein levels in control and <italic>Herp</italic>-knockdown astrocytes and found that the levels of both ITPR1 and ITPR2 were slightly but statistically significantly increased in in <italic>Herp</italic> siRNA-treated astrocytes compared with controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref> – 3M). This suggests that HERP regulates ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via IP<sub>3</sub>R degradation in astrocytes.</p>

<title>ATP-induced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release varies according to CT</title>
<p>Because the amount of HERP exhibited circadian variation and HERP regulates ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, we next investigated whether ATP-induced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses differ different depending on CT. After synchronizing cultured astrocytes, we measured ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> following ATP treatment at peak (CT34) and trough (CT22) HERP time points (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Because the levels of HERP were lower at CT22 resulting in higher IP<sub>3</sub>R levels it is conceivable that ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release might be greater at CT22 than at CT34. Consistent with this, ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> decreased to a greater extent at CT22 than at CT34 upon ATP treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> – 4D). Also, in keeping with this prediction, cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased to a greater extent at CT22 than at CT34 following ATP treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> - 4G). Although variations in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses exhibited a consistent circadian tendency as well, but this trend did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref> – 4J). Finally, we assessed whether the levels of ITPR1 and ITPR2 varied according to CT. The phosphorylation status of BMAL1 served as a proxy for CT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>). The levels of ITPR2 showed CT-dependent changes opposite those of HERP, whereas ITPR1 levels were constant at both CTs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4L</xref>). Because <italic>Itpr2</italic> mRNA levels did not show a rhythmic pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref>), we reasoned that the CT-dependent differences in ITPR2 levels were mainly driven by HERP-mediated ITPR2 degradation. The fact that ITPR1 levels were constant further support the conclusion that circadian rhythmic ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are mainly driven by oscillations in ITPR2.</p>

<p>Finally, we sought to confirm that ATP-induced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response is controlled by the circadian clock by analyzing this response in cultured astrocytes from <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.

<title>ATP-induced S368-phosphorylation of Cx43 and gap junctional communication shows circadian variation</title>
<p>Syncytial coupling achieved through gap junctions is the prominent feature of astrocytes. This coupling is critical for the homeostatic function of astrocytes through enhancing diffusion and equilibration of ions, metabolites, and signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Langer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). In addition, the astrocytic syncytium can propagate Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves that affect nearby and remote cells through release of “gliotransmitters”, by which astrocytes can modulate synaptic functions in a far-reaching network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pacholko et al., 2020</xref>). Connexin (Cx) family proteins are the molecular constituents of gap junction channels (GJCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Giaume et al., 2021</xref>). Cx43 (also known as Gja1) and Cx30 (also known as Gjb6) are the main connexins of astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kunzelmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nagy et al., 1999</xref>). In our cultured astrocytes, the most abundantly expressed connexin was Cx43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5</xref>). The phosphorylation of Cx43 at Ser368 by protein kinase C (PKC), activated in response to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, is known to decrease gap junction conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Enkvist &amp; McCarthy, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nimlamool et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Solan &amp; Lampe, 2014</xref>). Accordingly, we reasoned that the circadian variation in ATP-driven ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses might differentially impact Cx43 phosphorylation according to times of day. We first confirmed that treatment of cultured astrocytes with ATP induced rapid phosphorylation of Cx43 at Ser368 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>).

<p>Next, we examined whether circadian variations in Cx43 phosphorylation occurred <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, we entrained mice to a 12:12 hour light/dark (LD) cycle for two weeks and then maintained them in constant darkness (DD). Probing samples under constant darkness ensured that variations in Cx43 phosphorylation were due to the internal circadian clock and not external light stimuli. Prefrontal cortex tissues were dissected at CT58 and CT70 at third days of DD and Ser368-phosphorylated Cx43 (pCx43) was measured. Intriguingly, Cx43 phosphorylation was pronounced at subjective night, consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> results. Finally, we sought to assess whether gap junctional communication shows CT variation in cultured astrocytes by utilizing the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) method. Initially, we confirmed the role of gap junctions in intercellular communication in cultured astrocytes by observing the absence of fluorescent signal recovery after applying the gap junction channel blocker, carbenoxolone (CBX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6A</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6C</xref>), which was in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Santiquet et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequently, we investigated CT dependent variations in this communication. We observed a more rapid and pronounced recovery of fluorescence in photobleached astrocytes during subjective day (e.g., CT34) compared with subjective night (e.g., CT22) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref> – 6I). Interestingly, this variation was absent in astrocytes cultured from Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, indicating that the day and night variations in gap junctional communication is regulated by circadian clock (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>. – 6L).</p>
<p>In summary, we provide a model illustrating how circadian clock influences astrocyte function through the regulation of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. In astrocytes, the BMAL1/CLOCK-controlled oscillation of HERP regulates day and night variations in ITPR2 levels. These oscillations contribute to changes in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, which in turn associate with distinct differences between day and night in the phosphorylation of Cx43 at Ser368 and the conductance of the gap junction channel (GJC).</p>

Although there is ample evidence attesting to the importance of the circadian clock in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barca-Mayo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barca-Mayo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Griffin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lananna et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Prolo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tso et al., 2017</xref>), explorations of how the circadian clock precisely modulates astrocytic functions employing astrocyte-specific circadian transcriptome analyses have been limited. Our study conducted such an analysis on primary cultured cortical astrocytes and discovered that rhythmic expression of <italic>Herp</italic> underlies day/night variation in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, showing that HERP acts by altering IP<sub>3</sub>R levels. We also found that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cx43 phosphorylation varied in accordance with the daily rhythmic ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. Given that astrocytes function in a network in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagates through GJCs, we propose that the time-dependent control of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses could influence the synaptic activity modulating role of astrocytes (see below).</p>
<p>In this study, we discovered that 2.3 % of all transcripts showed circadian rhythmic expression with astrocyte specificity. Notably, numerous genes associated with key astrocyte functions such as “regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure”, “cell migration”, “metabolic processes”, “G protein coupled receptor signaling”, and “ion transport” etc. appeared to be controlled by the circadian clock. Of particular interest, <italic>Herp</italic> exhibited rhythmic expression in phase with <italic>Per2</italic> in primary cultured astrocytes. In <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> astrocyte cultures, <italic>Herp</italic> showed flattened expression at its nadir level, suggesting that its transcription is directly regulated by CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Although no canonical E box was found in the upstream 6 Kb region of the <italic>Herp</italic> gene, a previous ChIP-Atlas analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chip-atlas.org">https://chip-atlas.org</ext-link>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Oki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zou et al., 2022</xref>) demonstrated CLOCK binding to the <italic>Herp</italic> genomic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Annayev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hong et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the TTFL repressors E4BP4 (Adenovirus E4 promoter Binding Protein 4), also referred to as NFIL3 (Nuclear Factor Interleukin 3), as well as the activators TEF (Thyrotroph Embryonic Factor) and HLF (Hepatic Leukemia Factor) also bind to the <italic>Herp</italic> genomic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dunham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yoshitane et al., 2019</xref>). Oscillations in <italic>Herp</italic> expression have been previously documented in various mouse tissues including the lung, heart, liver, kidney, aorta, skeletal muscle, adrenal gland, pancreatic islet and SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Panda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rakshit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, this wealth of evidence strongly suggests that <italic>Herp</italic> is subject to direct regulation by the circadian clock. Our study further demonstrated that <italic>Herp</italic> oscillates at both mRNA and protein levels in cultured astrocytes. The significance of HERP in modulating circadian variations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the afore-mentioned tissues and cells is an intriguing avenue for future research. Interestingly, a recent study employing a circadian single-cell RNA seq analysis of SCN reported that <italic>Herp</italic> displays a circadian rhythm exclusively in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wen et al., 2020</xref>). Given that astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the SCN demonstrated a circadian rhythm, peaking during the subjective night and are crucial for circadian timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brancaccio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Patton et al., 2022</xref>), HERP’s circadian rhythmic expression in SCN astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wen et al., 2020</xref>) may be integral to the mechanisms of circadian timing.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that HERP regulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses by degrading IP<sub>3</sub>Rs in astrocytes, aligning with findings in other cell types (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref> – 3M). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Paredes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Torrealba et al., 2017</xref>). There are three subtypes of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs in astrocytes encoded by the genes <italic>Itpr1</italic>, <italic>Itpr2</italic>, and <italic>Itpr3.</italic> While all three subtypes are expressed in our cultured astrocytes, <italic>Itpr3</italic> was expressed in negligible amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref>). Traditionally, ITPR2 has been regarded as a major subtype closely associated with astrocyte function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Holtzclaw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sharp et al., 1999</xref>) and accumulating evidence has shown that not only ITPR2, but also ITPR1 and ITPR3 are important in astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, with each subtype eliciting distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sherwood et al., 2021</xref>). When <italic>Herp</italic> was downregulated, the levels of both ITPR1 and ITPR2 increased, but only the levels of ITPR2 exhibited day/night variation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref> – 3M, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref> – 4L). The min/max ratio of HERP expression throughout the day was 0.38 under normal conditions, but was 0.072 in <italic>Herp</italic>-KD conditions. Based on our study, we reasoned that the amplitude of HERP oscillations impacted the levels of ITPR2 under normal circumstances, while having a much lesser effect on the levels of ITPR1. Thus, we conclude that the circadian control of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in response to stimulation in cultured astrocytes is attributable to ITPR2.</p>
<p>Our study revealed distinct circadian variations in ER and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses following ATP treatment that were not reflected in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Upon ATP stimulation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released from the ER via IP<sub>3</sub>R, and subsequently enters both the cytosol and mitochondria. In the cytosol, direct Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer occurs through IP<sub>3</sub>R. For mitochondrial uptake, Ca<sup>2+</sup> first transits to the intermembrane space via IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) complex before entering the matrix through mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Giorgi et al., 2018</xref>). The Mito-R-GECO1 reporter used in our studies of changes in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> is confined within the mitochondrial matrix and thus cannot assess Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in in the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we think of several possibilities to account for the absence of significant circadian variations in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to ATP stimulation relative to cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> change. First, substantial changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels might occur in the intermembrane space, but the influx into the matrix via MCUs could remain constant across different CT, resulting in apparent lack of significant change. Second, the amount of VDAC or the VDAC:IP3R complex on the mitochondrial membrane might vary inversely with HERP levels, potentially maintaining a consistent flow of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the mitochondria irrespective of the CT. Additionally, the presence of several Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion mechanisms in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Giorgi et al., 2018</xref>) points to a more complex regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> compared with that in the cytosol. Although the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated, our data indicate that the circadian variation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, particularly in response to stimuli, predominantly impacts cytoplasmic signaling rather than mitochondrial signaling.</p>
<p>Importantly, we discovered that during the subjective night (active period for mice), ATP- stimulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release was pronounced compared with that during the subjective day (rest period for mice) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This finding aligns with recent studies that emphasized the role of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in sleep regulation. In mice, stimulus-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in astrocytes was found to be heightened during wakefulness and diminished as sleep progressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bojarskaite et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ingiosi et al., 2020</xref>). In flies, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in astrocytes is correlated with the duration of wakefulness, suggesting that astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a key factor in the homeostatic regulation of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blum et al., 2021</xref>). Collectively, these reports collectively underscore the role of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in sleep homeostasis. Our observations that ATP-stimulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is elevated during the subjective night compared with the subjective day provides a mechanistic explanation for the differential Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels observed between wake and sleep states. Notably, the circadian regulation of ITPR2 by HERP might be a fundamental factor in this process.</p>
<p>We also observed a marked increase in ATP-stimulated Cx43 (S368) phosphorylation during the subjective night compared with the subjective day (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>.). This observation was further supported by in <italic>vivo</italic> experiments, which demonstrated higher levels of pCx43(S368) in the frontal cortex during the subjective night than during the day (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). What are the implications of this day/night variation in Cx43 (S368) phosphorylation? Cx43 and Cx30 are the main connexins in astrocytes, where they constitute key components of gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kunzelmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nagy et al., 1999</xref>). Gap junctions mediate intercellular communication by providing ultrastructural cytoplasmic continuity and are thus integral to formation of the functional syncytium of astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Giaume et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kiyoshi &amp; Zhou, 2019</xref>). In our study, Cx43 was the main connexin and was most abundantly expressed, whereas Cx30 expression was almost negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5</xref>). Cx43 possesses a distinctive structural composition consisting of an extensive C-terminal tail, an N-terminal domain, and multiple transmembrane segments. The C-terminal tail contains sites for post-translational modifications. Specifically, Cx43 has more than 10 phosphorylation sites, and its phosphorylation is key to the control of its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pogoda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Solan &amp; Lampe, 2014</xref>). Among these sites Ser368 is a target for phosphorylation by PKC, which becomes activated in response to elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels; notably this phosphorylation event leads to the closure of Cx43 gap junction channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Enkvist &amp; McCarthy, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nimlamool et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pogoda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pun et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Solan &amp; Lampe, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">2016</xref>). We reasoned that the circadian variation in Cx43 phosphorylation could be significant in terms of astrocyte functionality within the syncytium. Indeed, in our cultured astrocytes, gap junctional communication exhibited day and night variation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6G</xref> – 6I). Astrocytes influence synaptic activity through the release of gliotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA, D-serine, and ATP, triggered by increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to the activity of adjacent neurons and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). Importantly, this increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> spreads to adjacent astrocytes through GJCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fujii et al., 2017</xref>), influencing a large area of the neuronal network. Considering that Cx43 Ser368 phosphorylation occurs to uncouple specific pathways in the astrocytic syncytium to focus local responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Enkvist &amp; McCarthy, 1992</xref>), our findings suggest that astrocytes better equipped for localized responses when presented with a stimulus during the active phase in mice. Conversely, during the rest period, characterized by more synchronous neuronal activity across broad brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Vyazovskiy et al., 2009</xref>) higher GJC conductance might allow astrocytes to exert control over a larger area. In support of this idea, recent study showed that synchronized astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity advances the slow wave activity (SWA) of the brain, a key feature of non-REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Szabó et al., 2017</xref>). Blocking GJC was found to reduce SWA, further supporting this interpretation. However, conflicting findings have also been reported. For instance, Ingiosi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ingiosi et al., 2020</xref>) found that astrocytic synchrony was higher during wakefulness than sleep in the mouse frontal cortex. Whether these differing results in astrocyte synchrony during resting and active periods are attributable to differences in experimental context (e.g., brain regions, sleep-inducing condition) remains unclear. Indeed, astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during wakefulness/sleep vary according to brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tsunematsu et al., 2021</xref>). While the extent of astrocyte synchrony might differ depending on brain region and/or stimulus, on our results suggest the conclusion that that the baseline state of astrocyte synchrony, which is affected by GJC conductance, varies with the day/night cycle.</p>
<p>The presence of various glial subpopulations, each with high expression of multiple connexins, contributes to the formation of a “panglial syncytium.” This allows gap junction channels to form between astrocytes and other glial or non-glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fróes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rash et al., 1997</xref>). Astrocytic GJCs connecting both oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells lining the ventricles have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rash et al., 1997</xref>). Recent studies in mice with cell type-specific deletion of connexins have demonstrated that removal of the astrocytic connexins (Cx30 and Cx47) results in the total disruption of panglial coupling. Moreover, this coupling can be maintained if at least one allele of either connexin is retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Griemsmann et al., 2015</xref>). Based on our experimental findings, we conclude that phosphorylation of Cx43 at Ser368 in response to a stimulus is contingent on CT and consequently influences the permeability of GJCs in a CT dependent manner. Drawing from previous research, this could have substantial implications not only for GJs between astrocytes, but also for those linking astrocytes with other cell types, such as oligodendrocytes, and other cell types.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings significantly enhance the understanding of the circadian regulation of astrocytic functions, particularly through the rhythmic expression of HERP and its impact on ER Ca²⁺ signaling and Cx43 phosphorylation. This study underscores the intricate interplay between the circadian clock and astrocyte physiology, highlighting the pivotal role of HERP in modulating key astrocytic processes such as sleep, gap junction communication and synaptic modulation. The day/night variations in ER Ca²⁺ response and Cx43 phosphorylation, and their implications for astrocytic network dynamics and neuronal interactions, open new avenues for exploring the broader implications of astrocytic circadian rhythms in brain function and health. Thus, this work not only contributes to our fundamental understanding of astrocyte biology, it also has potential implications for addressing neurological disorders where circadian and astrocytic dysfunctions intersect.</p>

<title>Circadian transcriptome analysis</title>
<p>The experimental scheme for synchronizing circadian clocks of cultured astrocyte is depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. In brief, astrocytes were grown in dishes (1.0 X 10<sup>6</sup>cells/60 mm dish) until reaching complete confluence and then incubated in serum-free MEM for 72 hours. Cells were then subjected to serum shock (SS), a well-established procedure for synchronizing the circadian clock of cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Balsalobre et al., 1998</xref>), by exchanging the medium for MEM containing 50% horse serum. Twelve hours after SS, astrocytes were harvested at 4-hour intervals for 2 days for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).</p>
<p>Total RNA was extracted and purified from harvested astrocytes using an RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen (Germany), 74034). RNA quality and quantity assessments, RNA-Seq library construction, and next-generation sequencing analysis were performed by Macrogen Inc. (Korea). Total RNA integrity and library size were analyzed using an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer. Paired-end raw reads, generated using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system, were aligned to the mm10 mouse genome using STAR aligner (v.2.5.2b)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Gene expression was subsequently quantified by calculating transcripts per million (TPM) using Ensemble gene (release 82) annotations. The threshold for defining expressed transcripts was set using a Gaussian mixture model in the R package ‘mixtools’</p>
<p>To detect circadian oscillating transcripts, we employed two circadian oscillation detection methods BioCycle(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agostinelli et al., 2016</xref>) and MetaCycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu et al., 2016</xref>).

<title>Gap-FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) analysis</title>
<p>Astrocyte communication was assessed using the gap-FRAP assay with slight modifications from a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Santiquet et al., 2012</xref>). This involved quantifying the transfer of the fluorescent dye calcein from cells to another cell that had been subjected to laser bleaching to remove calcein fluorescence. Thirty minutes prior to imaging, cells were loaded with 0.5uM Calcein-AM (Invitrogen (USA), C1430) and 0.05% Pluronic-127 (Invitrogen, P6866) at 37°C. A 30min incubation period allowed for the dye to diffused and be cleaved into fluorescent calcein, after which cells were rinsed twice with serum free MEM. In experiments involving CBX treatment, CBX (20μM) was applied for an additional 30 minutes after calcein incubation. Immediately before imaging, the medium was switched to HBSS without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Gibco, 14175095). Utilizing a Nikon A1R Confocal Microscope system equipped with a 488nm argon laser and a x60 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat objective (Nikon Instruments, Inc.), photobleaching was performed on ROI cell, and fluorescence was measured under 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Fluorescence intensity was captured in a confocal plane during the following intervals: five pre-bleach images, a 15-second 100% power laser pulse at a stimulation speed of 5.3 lines/sec in the ROI cell, and an image taken every 3 seconds for a 3-minute post-bleach period. Images were analyzed using NIS elements C program.

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 software. Differences between two groups were analyzed using independent t-tests. Differences among three or more groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc test. A repeated measures two-way ANOVA was employed for comparison of multiple groups and conditions. Differences were considered significant for p-values &lt; 0.05.</p>

<p>This is a <bold>useful</bold> study that identifies circadian changes in the gene expression profile of cultured mouse astrocytes. Mechanistic details linking circadian rhythmicity in HERP, a regulator of calcium signals in the endoplasmic reticulum, to altered phosphorylation of Connexin 43 remain currently <bold>incomplete</bold>. With improved manuscript clarity and statistical analysis, this work could be of interest to the field of astrocyte and circadian biology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In Ryu et al., the authors use a cortical mouse astrocyte culture system to address the functional contribution of astrocytes to circadian rhythms in the brain. The authors' starting point is transcriptional output from serum-shocked culture, comparative informatics with existing tools and existing datasets. After fairly routine pathway analyses, they focus on the calcium homeostasis machinery and one gene, Herp, in particular. They argue that Herp is rhythmic at both mRNA and protein levels in astrocytes. They then use a calcium reporter targeted to the ER, mitochondria, or cytosol and show that Herp modulates calcium signaling as a function of circadian time. They argue that this occurs through the regulation of inositol receptors. They claim that the signaling pathway is clock-controlled by a limited examination of Bmal1 knockout astrocytes. Finally, they switch to calcium-mediated phosphorylation of the gap junction protein Connexin 43 but do not directly connect HERP-mediated circadian signaling to these observations. While these experiments address very important questions related to the critical role of astrocytes in regulating circadian signaling, the mechanistic arguments for HERP function, its role in circadian signaling through inositol receptors, the connection to gap junctions, and ultimately, the functional relevance of these findings is only partially substantiated by experimental evidence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The paper provides useful datasets of astrocyte gene expression in circadian time.</p>
<p>- Identifies HERP as a rhythmic output of the circadian clock.</p>
<p>- Demonstrates the circadian-specific sensitivity of ATP -&gt; calcium signaling.</p>
<p>- Identifies possible rhythms in both Connexin 43 phosphorylation and rhythmic movement of calcium between cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- It is not immediately clear why the authors chose to focus on Ca2+ homeostasis or Herp from their initial screens as neither were the &quot;most rhythmic&quot; pathways in their primary analyses.</p>
<p>- It would have been interesting (and potentially important) to know whether various methods of cellular synchronization would also render HERP rhythmic (e.g., temperature, forskolin, etc). If Herp is indeed relatively astrocyte-specific and rhythmic, it should be easy to assess its rhythmicity in vivo.</p>
<p>- The authors show that Herp suppression reduces ATP-mediated suppression of calcium whereas it initially increases Ca2+ in the cytosol and mitochondria and then suppresses it. The dynamics of the mitochondrial and cytosolic responses are not discussed in any detail and it is unclear what their direct relationship is to Herp-mediated ER signaling. What is the explanation for Herp (which is thought to be ER-specific) to calcium signaling in other organelles?</p>
<p>- What is the functional significance of promoting ATP-mediated suppression of calcium in ER?</p>
<p>- The authors then nicely show that the effect of ATP is dependent on intrinsic circadian timing but do not explain why these effects are antiphase in cytosol or mitochondria. Moreover, the ∆F/F for calcium in mitochondria and cytosol both rise, cross the abscissa, and then diminish - strongly suggesting a biphasic signaling event. Therefore, one wonders whether measuring the area under the curve is the most functionally relevant measurement of the change.</p>
<p>- Why are mitochondrial and cytosolic calcium not also demonstrated for Bmal1 KO astrocytes?</p>
<p>- The authors claim that Herp acts by regulating the degradation of ITPRs but this hypothesis - rather central to the mechanisms proposed in this study - is not experimentally substantiated.</p>
<p>- There is no clear demonstration of the functional relevance of the circadian rhythms of ATP-mediated calcium signaling.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The article entitled &quot;Circadian regulation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium response in mouse cultured astrocytes&quot; submitted by Ryu and colleagues describes the circadian control of astrocytic intracellular calcium levels in vitro.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used a variety of technical approaches that are appropriate</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Statistical analysis is poor and could lead to a misinterpretation of the data</p>
<p>Several conceptual issues have been identified.</p>
<p>Overinterpretation of the data should be avoided. This is a mechanistic paper done completely in vitro, all references to the in vivo situation are speculative and should be avoided.</p>

<p>Astrocyte biology is an active area of research and this study is timely and adds to a growing body of literature in the field. The RNA-seq, Herp expression, and Ca2+ release data across wild-type, Bmal1 knockout, and Herp knockdown cellular models are robust and lend considerable support to the study's conclusions, highlighting their importance. Despite these strengths, the manuscript presents a gap in elucidating the dynamics of HERP and the involvement of ITPR1/2 in modulating Ca2+ release patterns and their circadian variations, which remains insufficiently supported and characterized. While the Connexin data underscore the importance of rhythmic Ca2+ release triggered by ATP, the relationship here appears correlational and the role of HERP and ITPR in Cx function remains to be characterized. Moreover, enhancing the manuscript's clarity and readability could significantly benefit the presentation and comprehension of the findings.</p>
