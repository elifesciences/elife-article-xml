<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Blood pressure variability (BPV) has emerged as a significant risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, independent of alterations in average blood pressure (BP). However, the impact of large BP fluctuations on neurovascular function remains poorly understood. In this study, we developed a novel murine model of BPV in middle-aged mice using intermittent Angiotensin II infusions. Radio telemetry confirmed that 24-hr BP averages in BPV mice remained comparable to controls, demonstrating BPV in the absence of hypertension. Chronic (20-25 days) BPV resulted in a blunted bradycardic response and cognitive deficits. Two-photon imaging revealed heightened pressure-evoked constrictions (myogenic response) in parenchymal arterioles of BPV mice. While sensory stimulus-evoked dilations (neurovascular coupling) were amplified at higher BP levels in control mice, this pressure-dependent effect was abolished in BPV mice. Our findings indicate that chronic BP fluctuations impair vascular function within the neurovascular complex and contribute to cognitive decline, emphasizing BPV as a critical factor in brain health.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dementia, the 7<sup>th</sup> leading global cause of mortality, presents as the predominant neurodegenerative complication in the elderly population. Notably, hypertension emerges as a primary risk factor for dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Blood pressure (BP) regulation involves a complex interplay of central and peripheral mechanisms, finely attuned to acute and chronic stressors in maintaining physiological ranges. Perturbations in vascular function and structure (e.g., reactivity, vascular stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>), alterations in baroreflex sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, and enhanced sympathetic activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> are recognized factors that disrupt BP balance. Blood pressure variability (BPV) (an index of BP <italic>fluctuation or variation</italic>), particularly in midlife, increases the risk for cognitive decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, end-organ damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and cardiovascular events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Increased BPV also serves as an early predictor of hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. BPV delineates fluctuations across various measurement periods from very short-term (beat-to-beat) to long-term (months or years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Given evidence that elevated BPV can precede hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, a modifiable risk factor in the setting of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia, understanding the drivers and cellular targets of BPV is essential. Unlike hypertension, BP fluctuations often elude detection in screening practices conducted in clinical settings, which rely on singular or averaged BP measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The absence of a gold standard for BPV indexing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and limited insights into the magnitude and frequencies of impactful BP fluctuations in disease conditions further compound this issue. Additionally, the absence of suitable animal models has limited the understanding of how this overlooked variable may impact brain health. In this study, we sought to establish an innovative murine model of BPV and to interrogate the impact of large BP fluctuations on cardiovascular and neurovascular outcomes.</p>
<p>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is tightly regulated by diverse signaling processes, including the interaction of cellular elements comprising the neurovascular complex, which include endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, pericytes, astrocytes, neurons, and microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Mechanisms governing CBF operate under both steady-state conditions (e.g., cerebral autoregulation (CA), humoral processes, chemoregulation) and in response to local neuronal activity (e.g., neurovascular coupling (NVC))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Evidence suggests that sustained hypertension adversely affects the functional integrity of the neurovascular complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, compromises cerebral perfusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and contributes to cognitive decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, the impact of large BP fluctuations on steady-state or activity-evoked CBF changes remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Chronic hypertension leads to adaptive processes (e.g., vascular remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>) and a rightward shift in the cerebral autoregulation (CA) curve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, heightening vulnerability to ischemia at low BP while shielding the brain from hyperperfusion at high pressure. In humans, hypertension and BPV have been associated with white matter hyperintensities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and microbleeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, the impact of BPV (prior to hypertension onset) on cerebrovascular function and neurovascular outputs has received little attention.</p>
<p>Using an innovative murine model of BPV, in the absence of overt hypertension, combined with <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon imaging, we show that chronic BP fluctuations lead to microvascular dysfunction (e.g., enhanced parenchymal arteriole myogenic responses) and a blunted NVC response. In addition, mice subjected to chronic BPV showed poor cognitive performance. These findings underscore the pivotal role of dysregulated BP events in brain health and function.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>All experiments were conducted in middle-aged (12-15-month-old) male C57BL6 mice (Jackson Laboratories) under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Augusta University (AU). Mice were housed at 20-22°C under a 12hr:12hr light-dark cycle with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water. Female mice were not included in the present study due to high post-surgery mortality observed in 12-14-month-old mice following complex procedures. To minimized confounding effects of differential survival and to establish foundational data for this model, we restricted the investigation to male mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Craniotomy surgery for chronic window</title>
<p>Surgeries were conducted using the aseptic technique. Animals were injected with dexamethasone and meloxicam 2-4 hours before surgery to prevent edema and/or inflammation. General anesthesia was induced with isoflurane (2%) and following loss of reflex, hair was removed from the scalp and the mouse was transferred to a sterile field. A single injection of ketamine/dexdomitor (60 mg/kg/0.5mg/kg) was administered to maintain anesthesia in the sterile field. The scalp was scrubbed with betadine/alcohol (3 times each, alternating). A scalp incision was made (∼1 cm). A small aluminum head holder (300 mg) was fixed to the skull using cyanoacrylate glue followed by dental cement and a small craniotomy opened over the cortex. The bone flap was removed. A glass coverslip (3 mm) was glued to a 4 mm coverslip and placed into the craniotomy with the inner glass touching the cortex. The edges of the coverslip were then sealed with cyanoacrylate glue followed by dental cement covering everything including the wound margins.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Telemetry and iPrecio pump implantation surgery</title>
<p>Following a 3-week recovery period after craniotomy surgery, mice were implanted with a programmable pump (iPrecio, SMP-310R) and a biotelemetry transmitter device (PA-C10, Data Science International). Mice underwent brief anesthesia in a small chamber using 5% isoflurane for induction, followed by maintenance of anesthesia via a nose mask with 1.5-2% isoflurane. The neck fur was carefully clipped on both the anterior and posterior sides. Subsequently, mice were placed in a sterile field in a ventrally recumbent position, and a 1.5 to 2 cm horizontal incision was made. The pump and biotelemetry transmitter device were then implanted subcutaneously. The pump catheter was trimmed to 0.5 cm for subcutaneous drug delivery, while the telemeter catheter was tunneled subcutaneously over the shoulder, with its tip positioned within the left carotid artery. Closure of incisions was performed using 5-0 sutures, after which the mice were gradually brought out of anesthesia. It is important to note that due to the complexity of the surgeries involved, mice used for behavioral studies were not implanted with a telemetry catheter or cranial window. However, these mice were individually housed to simulate the conditions of the telemetry cohort.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Blood pressure assessment and BPV induction</title>
<p>After recovery from surgery, mice were housed individually in standard mouse cages under the conditions described above and assigned to a control or experimental BPV group. During this recovery period (∼7 days), both groups were infused with saline to determine baseline cardiovascular parameters. Blood pressure signals encompassing mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), and pulse pressure (PP) (determined from the difference between the SBP and DBP) were continuously sampled at 250 Hz for 10 seconds and collected every 30 seconds, for 24 hours per day. Once a baseline MAP was established, the saline in the infusion pump (in the BPV group) was substituted with angiotensin II (Ang II, Sigma Aldrich, A9525) and administered intermittently at a calculated dose of 3.1 µg/hour (every 3-4 hours) for 25 days.</p>
<sec id="s2d1">
<title>Controls receiving Ang II</title>
<p>To facilitate between-group comparisons (control vs BPV), a cohort of control mice were subjected to the same pump infusion parameters as BPV mice but for shorter durations receiving Ang II infusions on days 3-5 and, then again, on days 21-25 of the experimental protocol. This paradigm was used for experiments assessing pressure-evoked responses, including bradycardic reflex, myogenic response, and functional hyperemia at high BP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d2">
<title>BPV induction with norepinephrine</title>
<p>To validate the intermittent infusion protocol as an effective method for inducing significant BPV and not limited to Ang II, a separate cohort of mice received norepinephrine (NE, 45 µg/kg/min) using the same subcutaneous delivery protocol (2 µL every 4 hours).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Two-photon imaging</title>
<p>On the day of two-photon imaging acquisition, a mouse was anesthetized with chlorprothixene (0.04 cc) and a low dose of isoflurane (≤0.8%); a protocol to mildly sedate mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. A retro-orbital injection of Texas red (70kDa dextran, 5% [wt/vol] in saline, 40 µl) was administered to label blood vessels. The mouse was head-fixed and a picospritzer (positioned on the contralateral hemisphere intended for imaging) was used to deliver a puff of air for whisker stimulation (WS) at a rate of 10 Hz for 20 seconds repeated six to eight times with ∼ 90-second delay between each WS during an imaging session. Imaging sessions were conducted 106 ± 3.6 µm below the brain’s surface while pump infusion was <italic>off</italic> (low BP period) and again during Ang II infusions (high BP period). Images were collected at a rate of 3.75 frames/second.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Behavioral studies</title>
<p>Behavioral tasks were performed by an experimenter at the AU small animal behavioral core (SABC), who was blinded to the experimental protocol. BPV mice were subjected to behavioral tests at two time points. First, during the saline infusion period, with observations considered as baseline, and second, 25-26 days post-Ang II infusions. About 30 minutes before training and testing, animals were brought to the testing room to acclimate. Animals remained in the laboratory for 15 minutes following study completion. To eliminate olfactory cues, animal droppings were removed, and the space and objects were cleaned (dilute 50% (vol/vol) ethanol solution) between sessions where appropriate.</p>
<sec id="s2f1">
<title>Novel object recognition (NOR) task</title>
<p>Animal behavior was assessed using the previously described NOR task procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Animals were acclimated and then familiarized with an opaque plastic chamber (78.7 cm x 39.4 cm x 31.7 cm) containing bedding for 10 minutes. The next day, a training session involved animals exploring two identical objects for 10 minutes before returning to their home cages. Object recognition was assessed one hour later by placing an animal in the NOR apparatus with a familiar object and a new or novel object for 10 minutes. The objects’ positions and roles (familiar or novel) were randomly assigned. Objects were positioned about 40 cm apart, 19.3 cm from the two short walls and 19.3 cm from the two long walls of the chamber. Exploration of an object was defined as direct interaction with nostrils or head position towards the object at a distance ≤ 2 cm. For data inclusion, a mouse had to explore an object for at least 4 seconds and spend a minimum of 10 seconds of total object exploration. Recognition index was calculated using the formula: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="619509v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The discrimination index was calculated as: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="619509v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The one-hour delay for testing was determined based on earlier NOR tests assessing the cohort’s recognition capacity at one, four, and 24-hour delays. The animals exhibited normal recognition capacity with a one-hour delay but failed at 4- and 24-hour delays. Hence, the one-hour delay was selected for subsequent tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f2">
<title>Y-maze</title>
<p>Y-maze tasks were performed twenty-four hours after NOR tasks. The Y-maze consisted of three arms (35.4 cm long, 9.9 cm wide with a height of 13.8 cm). Spontaneous alternation behavior was assessed by randomly placing mice in one of the three arms and allowed to explore for 10 minutes. Arm entries were visually scored into a series where a triplet set of arm entries constituted an alternation. An alternation was defined as successive consecutive entries into three different arms, and maximum alternations as the total number of arm entries minus 2. Percent alternation was calculated as the proportion of true alternations out of maximum alternations ((# of true alternations/# of maximum alternations) × 100).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Two-day averaged values of 24-hour or 12-hour (active and inactive period) BP variables were compared to a baseline phase corresponding to saline infusion (∼ 5 days). BPV was calculated using the average real variability (ARV) index <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="619509v2_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> where K is the order of measurements and N denotes the number of BP readings. Absolute BP values were extracted every 15 minutes and averaged for the hour. The coefficient of variation (CV) was also used to calculate BPV. CV was calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation of hourly BP averages to the 24-hour BP average <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="619509v2_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Similar to BP variables, two-day averages of 24-hour and 12-hour ARV and CV were compared to the average value of the last 5 days during the baseline phase. Parenchymal arteriole diameter responses to changes in MAP (myogenic responses) and whisker stimulation were analyzed using MatLab and ImageJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Simple linear regression determined from the relationship of SBP and HR assessed bradycardic responses; MAP and arteriole diameter changes assessed myogenic reactivity. For neurovascular coupling experiments, the baseline was defined as 30 frames before stimulus onset. The stimulus-response comprised 100 frames encompassing the 20-second stimulus and the first 6 seconds post-stimulus. Six to eight WS events were averaged for each run and responses were normalized to the baseline average.</p>

<title>Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Mice that died prematurely (before treatment onset) or exhibited abnormally elevated or low blood pressures following telemetry surgery, likely due to surgical complications, were excluded from the study.</p>
<p>During two-photon imaging sessions, we observed unexplained, random transient dilatory events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs1">Supplemental Figure 1B, D</xref>) occurring in both control and BPV mice across low- and high-BP periods. Because similar random dilations have been documented in other mouse strains under comparable <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging conditions, these events may be attributed to the effects of the sedative.

<p>During the pump-<italic>off</italic> periods, BP corresponded to 97±2.0 mmHg and 91±1.9 mmHg for MAP, 113±2.6 mmHg and 105±2.6 mmHg for SBP, 80±1.7 mmHg and 78±1.7 mmHg for DBP, and 34±1.3 mmHg and 27±1.8 mmHg for PP, for mice with pumps infusing saline vs. Ang II, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). During the pump-<italic>on</italic> period, saline infusion did not change BP. However, Ang II infusions evoked significant BP transients corresponding to Δ37±3.9 mmHg (P&lt;0.0001) for MAP, Δ70±3.0 mmHg (P&lt;0.0001) for SBP, Δ29±4.1 mmHg (P&lt;0.0001) for DBP, and Δ28±3.0 mmHg (P&lt;0.0001) for PP, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>. Note that large dynamic activity-induced BP changes were apparent during both saline- and Ang II-infusions, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>. Despite robust BP transients, 20 days of treatment minimally affected the 24-hour averages (vs Baseline) in all cardiovascular variables, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>. The delta BP (Baseline vs Day 20) for MAP was −1±2.0 mmHg and 6±2.4 mmHg for control and BPV mice, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). While the SBP in BPV mice significantly increased Δ9±2.9 mmHg (P=0.0088), mice remained within the lower range of high BP (131±4.4 mmHg). Additionally, prior to treatment, the baseline DBP in BPV was significantly lower than in control mice (P=0.0108), <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>.</p>
<p>Blood pressure exhibits a circadian rhythm that is not discernible in minute-to-minute traces, (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) but remains intact in both controls and BPV mice when analyzed in 1-hour averages, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs3">Supplemental Figure 3C-D</xref>. Thus, cardiovascular variables were assessed during the active (dark) and inactive (light) phases of the mouse 12:12 hr cycle.

<title>Pulsatile Ang II infusion induced high BPV</title>
<p>Having achieved minimal changes in the 24-hour average MAP, yet with prominent BP fluctuations, we quantified blood pressure variability (BPV) over time. Two indices of BPV were assessed: the average real variability (ARV), defined as the absolute difference between consecutive BP measurements, and the coefficient of variation (CV), defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to mean BP. A significant increase in BPV was observed in the BPV group over time relative to baseline, despite stable 24-hour BP averages. During the active period, ARV was significantly increased by day 3 and remained increased throughout the protocol, reaching 16.4 ± 0.66 mmHg (P=0.04) for SBP and 8.12 ± 0.71 mmHg (P=0.04) for PP, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>.

<title>Autonomic function in BPV mice</title>
<p>To compare pressure-induced bradycardic responses between BPV and control mice at both early and later treatment stages, a cohort of control mice received Ang II infusion on days 3-5 (early phase) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs4">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>) and days 21-25 (late phase) thereby transiently increasing BP.

<p>In contrast to the bradycardic response observed during Ang II-induced BP elevations, NE-induced BP pulses triggered a tachycardic response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), with significant positive correlation between SBP and HR appearing during the early phase in the treatment (Inactive period, P&lt;0.0001; Active period, P=0.0002), <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>. These data validate the intermittent infusion protocol as an effective method for inducing significant BPV while preserving normal 24hr MAP. However, due to fundamental differences in bradycardic responses and the presence of off-target effects, the physiological actions of this vasopressor agent are not directly comparable to those of Ang II. These results underscore the necessity of careful vasopressor selection to mitigate off-target effects.</p>

The steeper negative slope observed in BPV mice compared to controls indicates significantly increased parenchymal arteriole reactivity to BP changes (P=0.0118), <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>. However, because BPV mice exhibited lower baseline BP, although not significantly different from controls (P=0.18, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), we examined whether differences in pressure range (i.e. the change in pressure between low and high BP intervals) contributed to the steeper slopes observed in BPV mice. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref> illustrates the relationship between the lowest BP recorded during the acquisition period and the slope derived from the MAP-diameter linear regression analysis. Dashed lines represent the percent change in MAP relative to the minimal averaged BP recorded at the start of the imaging session. BPV mice showed a trend for greater percent change in BP (%Δ61±5.4 mmHg vs %Δ47±4.0 mmHg for control mice, P=0.06; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>, insert). However, the average BP range in control mice was still sufficient for establishing a correlation between BP and diameter, supporting the interpretation that differences in myogenic response stem from intrinsic vascular reactivity rather than limitations in the BP range.</p>
<p>The static cerebral autoregulation curve (CA), originally described by Lassen in 1959, is characterized by a plateau phase in the MAP-CBF relationship, sandwiched between lower and upper limit ranges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. However, the shape of the curve has been challenged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, with evidence suggesting a narrower plateau range and potential dilatory phases as BP deviates from this range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. To investigate pressure-diameter relationships in our cohort of mice, we analyzed parenchymal arterioles from control and BPV mice. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>, arterioles of both groups exhibited significant increases in tone (P&lt;0.0001) as pressure rose from ∼50 to 125 mmHg. When slopes from segmented regression analyses were compared across autoregulatory limits and plateau ranges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, our data revealed a significant decrease in arteriole diameter (P=0.0015) in control mice at pressures &lt;50 mmHg (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>). Within the putative CA plateau range (51-100 mmHg)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, arterioles from both groups showed significant constrictions (P=0.01 for controls; P&lt;0.0001 for BPV mice, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L</xref>), with steeper slopes observed in BPV arterioles (P&lt;0.0001). At pressures &gt;100 mmHg, BPV arterioles exhibited significant arterial dilations (P&lt;0.001), whereas control arterioles maintained constrictions (P&lt;0.001, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5M</xref>). Together, these data suggest a leftward shift in the CA curve of BPV mice, characterized by enhanced myogenic constrictions at comparable pressures and significant arterial dilations at higher pressures where controls arterioles maintain tone, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5N</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown directional sensitivity in parenchymal arteriole responses, whereby increases in MAP evoke more efficient responses as compared to decreases in MAP. Thus, we separated and quantified diameter changes evoked by BP transitions from Low-to-High (increase MAP) and High-to-Low BP (decrease MAP), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs5">Supplemental Figure 5A-F</xref>. Ang II infusion evoked similar increases in MAP when BP transitioned from Low-to-High Δ27±3.6 mmHg in controls and Δ25±3.6 mmHg in BPV mice, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs5">Supplemental Figure 5A</xref>. In addition, MAP decreases were comparable between groups (−Δ21±2.8 mmHg for controls and −Δ25±3.1 mmHg for BPV mice) upon cessation of pump infusion (High-to-Low), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs5">Supplemental Figure 5D</xref>. The significantly steeper negative slopes in BPV arterioles relative to controls (P=0.0117, Low-to-High) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs5">Supplemental Figure 5C</xref>) demonstrate increased parenchymal arteriole constriction to increases in MAP. Conversely, we also observed steeper negative slopes in BPV arterioles compared to controls (P=0.0044, High-to-Low) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs5">Supplemental Figure 5F</xref>) with decreases in MAP suggestive of enhanced arteriole dilations. Collectively, these findings indicate that chronic BPV heightens the responsiveness of parenchymal arterioles to acute BP fluctuations.</p>

<title>Impaired NVC in high BPV mice</title>
<p>Because mechanisms underlying baseline CBF regulation differ from those evoked during the functional hyperemia response, we assessed whether chronic BPV affected functional-evoked outputs or neurovascular coupling (NVC). Functional hyperemia was assessed using two-photon imaging and evoked using air puffs to stimulate mouse whiskers. Blood pressure measurements were simultaneously measured via telemetry, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>. While sensory-evoked vascular responses are commonly used as a proxy for neuronal activation and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, few studies have considered (or reported) BP during these <italic>in vivo</italic> protocols.

NVC responses were compared during low and high BP periods corresponding to pumps being <italic>off</italic> or <italic>on</italic>, respectively, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>.</p>
<p>The average baseline (low BP) MAP was 78±2.5 mmHg and 71.0±3.4 for the control and BPV group, respectively, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>.

To compare NVC responses at low and high BP, the pump reservoir for the control group was switched from saline to Ang II.

Whisker stimulation caused significant dilations (vs. baseline) in all groups, regardless of MAP, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G, H</xref>. However, at higher BP, the magnitude of the NVC response in control mice was greater (P&lt;0.0001, high BP vs low BP). Notably, this pressure-dependent response was abrogated (P=0.60) in the BPV group, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G, H</xref>. A closer look at the post-stimulus recovery phase showed a faster recovery rate (k = −0.45) for parenchymal arterioles of BPV mice during high BP periods compared to controls (P&lt;0.0001), <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>. These data revealed an acute pressure-dependent effect in control mice, with higher pressures resulting in greater sensory-evoked dilations.

<title>Cognitive decline in high BPV mice</title>
<p>Given impaired neurovascular outputs and the established association between high BPV and cognitive decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, we used the NOR and Y-maze tests to assess cognitive performance. Mice were subjected to behavioral testing during the saline-infused period and following 25 days of BPV (via Ang II infusions).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>BPV has emerged as a risk factor for cognitive decline, yet its impact on brain function remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a novel murine model of BPV, where pulsatile BP increases were induced via Ang II infusions without hypertension. Using <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon imaging, we provide evidence of altered vascular function in mice subjected to chronic BP fluctuations. In BPV mice, parenchymal arterioles (&lt;30 μm in diameter) exhibited enhanced myogenic reactivity. In addition, chronic BPV impaired neurovascular outputs and cognitive function. Notably, the NVC response in control mice was pressure-dependent, with greater magnitudes observed when the arterial BP was increased−a relationship that was abolished in mice exposed to chronic BPV. These findings suggest that chronic BPV targets multiple physiological processes (e.g., bradycardic reflex, myogenic reactivity, neurovascular coupling) reinforcing its role as a critical risk factor for brain health.</p>
<p>Our goal was to induce rapid transient blood pressure pulses that significantly increased BPV, while maintaining a stable 24hr average blood pressure. Ang II was selected as a pressor due to its potent vasoconstrictive properties and short half-life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. The subcutaneous dose was carefully titrated to induce BP elevations reaching physiological high levels (150−200 mmHg, SBP), achievable in non-diseased conditions and comparable to doses used in miniosmotic pumps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. The precise mechanisms underlying increased BPV remain unclear, though vascular dysfunction and arterial stiffness have been postulated as contributing factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Age is strongly correlated with arterial stiffness and isolated systolic hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Notably, SBP was modestly increased downstream of BPV in the current model, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>. In the BPV cohort, six out of eight mice exhibited an SBP increase of &gt;Δ10 mmHg compared to baseline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that elevated BPV may contribute to the early onset of systolic hypertension. Given that isolated systolic hypertension is a risk factor for overt hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and BPV precedes hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, prolonged BPV beyond the 25-day treatment period could potentially lead to hypertension. Furthermore, we anticipate that sustained BPV and its resultant hypertension may drive cardiac remodeling, specifically, left ventricular hypertrophy. These findings underscore the need for future studies to investigate the long-term effects of BPV on cardiac morphology.</p>
<p>We explored norepinephrine as an alternative agent to induce BP variations, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. Similar to Ang II-infused mice, NE-treated mice exhibited a significant increase in BPV (i.e. increased CV) while maintaining minimal changes in the 24-hr averaged MAP. However, NE-induced BP pulses elicited a tachycardic response likely driven by NE stimulation of cardiac β1-adrenergic receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Notably, chronic NE administration exaggerated this tachycardic response, with a steeper positive slope over time (Early vs Late; P&lt;0.0001) during the Inactive period, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>. Additionally, NE-treated mice exhibited signs of lethargy, impaired mobility, tachypnea, and an increased rate of premature death beginning on day 11 of treatment. These findings emphasize the need for further investigation into alternative BPV pressors, as each may exert distinct off-target effects.</p>
<p>Our model underscores the importance of assessing BPV independently of average BP values. Retrospective studies in primary care patients reveal BPV occurrences in both hypertensive and non-hypertensive adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, establishing BPV as a critical yet modifiable risk factor, often overlooked by standard in-office single BP measurements. In our model, the significantly higher 24-hour average PP in BPV mice suggests that PP is the most sensitive BP-related variable. Compared to controls, BPV mice exhibited persistently lower DBP and higher PP during the inactive period, indicative of a compensatory mechanism that maintained 24-hour MAP within physiological ranges. However, other factors mitigating hypertension onset cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>The autonomic nervous system (ANS) tightly regulates BP via changes in heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, and stroke volume. Notably, the baroreflex plays a critical role in maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Acute BP elevations activate arterial baroreceptors, which inhibit sympathetic outflow (via enhanced vagal activity) and reduce HR and peripheral vascular resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, thereby lowering arterial BP. However, to sustain relatively stable CBF, baroreflex-mediated inhibition of sympathetic outflow and arteriole dilation is counterbalanced by the intrinsic myogenic properties of the cerebral vasculature, which constricts in response to increases in arterial BP. Dysregulation of these dynamic processes heightens the risk of both cerebral hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion. Notably, impaired baroreflex sensitivity has been linked to aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> and mild cognitive impairments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In our model, chronic BPV significantly blunted the bradycardic response, suggestive of ANS dysregulation, potentially driven by enhanced sympathetic activity, reduced parasympathetic activity, or a combination of both. Previous studies indicate that chronic Ang II infusion suppresses and resets baroreceptor sensitivity independently of the pressure effect, with partial reversal occurring within 30 minutes post-Ang II infusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Unlike conventional sustained Ang II infusion approaches (osmotic pump models), our protocol delivers Ang II intermittently at 3- or 4-hour intervals. This regimen likely mitigates desensitization and Ang II receptor internalization, a response well-documented in sustained infusion models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the same Ang II dose evoked comparable BP increases at the start and end of treatment. Thus, our results support diminished baroreflex responses, aligning with previous reports linking elevated BPV to autonomic dysregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, though the underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Cerebral autoregulation serves as a protective mechanism against fluctuations in cerebral perfusion pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Vessels upstream from cerebral capillaries, including pial arteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> and larger extracranial vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, help buffer arterial pressure changes, thereby limiting excessive variations in CBF. In response to chronic and sustained hypertension, parenchymal arterioles exhibit enhanced reactivity to pressure increases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. This is further accompanied by arteriole remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Although our model does not involve sustained hypertension, we present <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence of heightened myogenic responses of parenchymal arterioles to both BP elevations and reductions. These observations are particularly intriguing as they suggest potential adaptive mechanisms in response to large blood pressure fluctuations.</p>
<p>Chronic BP elevations may drive upregulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC), or suppression of K<sup>+</sup> currents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Cipolla et al., reported that parenchymal arterioles are approximately 30-fold more sensitive to VDCC inhibition via nifedipine than middle cerebral arteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Notably, VDCC expression increases in hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, and long-acting calcium channel blockers (i.e., amlodipine), are among the most effective treatments for BPV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. In an effort to mitigate excessive vasoconstriction and optimize blood flow, during periods of BP-induced constrictions, vasodilatory signals may accumulate. Consequently, when BP decreases, parenchymal arterioles in BPV mice may exhibit greater dilation compared to controls, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs5">Supplemental Figure 5F</xref>. Augmented vasodilation has been reported as adaptive response in rodent models of chronic hypoperfusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. The dynamic nature of BP fluctuations in our model (i.e. increases and decreases) uniquely allows observations of multiple processes occurring concurrently (e.g. enhanced vasoconstrictions in response to high BP, and enhanced dilations potentially resulting from vasoconstriction-evoked ischemia).</p>
<p>If this interpretation holds, our model may reflect conditions in which parenchymal arterioles experience both high pressure and ischemia. The resulting heightened myogenic responses may amplify diameter changes, potentially diminishing pressure buffering capacity and increasing vulnerability to extreme BP fluctuations, predisposing brain tissue to episodic ischemia and/or hyperperfusion. Future studies addressing the impact of BPV on capillary perfusion may provide further insights into the link between BPV and brain pathology, including microbleeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Chronic BPV significantly blunted the NVC response to whisker stimulation. In control mice, NVC exhibited a pressure-dependent effect, with greater response magnitudes observed at higher arterial BP levels−an effect that was abolished in BPV mice. One possible explanation is that the enhanced NVC response (under high BP conditions) in control mice stems from greater baseline arteriole tone, facilitating a more efficient dilatory response to vasoactive signals released during sensory-evoked stimuli. Conversely, the heightened reactivity of parenchymal arterioles to intravascular pressure in BPV mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>) suggests a predominant vasoconstrictive state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>, potentially accompanied by reduced availability of vasodilatory mediators involved in NVC (e.g. nitric oxide, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. Thus, the blunted NVC response observed during elevated BP periods in BPV mice may also result from impaired vasodilation.</p>
<p>Additionally, upon termination of WS, vasoconstrictive mechanisms−exacerbated by elevated BP are unmasked, leading to a faster recovery in arteriole diameter post-stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Another potential explanation is a neuronal mechanism, where diminished neural activity or reduced release of vasodilatory signals may contribute to the impaired NVC response. Further studies should investigate the impact of high BPV on the neurovascular complex under awake conditions, recognizing that factors such as activity and arousal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>, can elevate BP and potentially confound pressure-dependent neurovascular effects.</p>
<p>Beyond blunting NVC, our study demonstrates that chronic BPV contributes to cognitive decline, as evidenced by decreased discrimination and recognition indices in the NOR test. Clinical studies have similarly linked elevated BPV to impairments across multiple cognitive domains, including memory and executive function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Post hoc analyses of the SPRINT MIND trial revealed that patients with elevated BPV experienced the most rapid decline in processing speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Additionally, findings from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative indicated that greater SBP variability correlated with poorer episodic memory performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To assess cognitive function, we employed the NOR test to evaluate episodic memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup> and the spontaneous Y maze test to assess short-term spatial memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. Because telemetry systems necessitated individual housing to avoid signal interference, all mice used in this study were single-housed. Previous studies on C57BL/6 mice have reported conflicting effects of single housing on learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>, with some suggesting stress-induced deficits and others reporting no impact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. These discrepancies may stem from variables such as age at isolation onset, duration of isolation, and behavioral test conditions. To minimize confounding factors, we implemented stringent efforts to ensure consistency across all groups, including standardized cage changes, food replenishment, and pump refills conducted on a single day between 1:00 and 4:00 PM Our results indicate that while 25 days of chronic BPV does not affect short-term spatial memory, it significantly impairs episodic memory.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates that high BPV disrupts cellular communication in the neurovascular complex, contributing to cognitive decline. Importantly, our model elicited substantial BP fluctuations while preventing the onset of hypertension, providing direct evidence of BPV’s causal role in impaired neurovascular function. These findings support the inclusion of BPV assessment as a critical screening and diagnostic tool alongside conventional BP measurements to address cardiovascular and neurovascular risks. Moreover, the adaptable murine model developed in this study offers a robust framework for future investigations into BPV’s impact on brain function.</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study that demonstrates that blood pressure variability impairs myogenic tone and diminishes baroreceptor reflex. The study also provides evidence that blood pressure variability blunts functional hyperemia and contributes to cognitive decline. The evidence is <bold>compelling</bold> whereby the authors use appropriate and validated methodology in line with or more rigorous than the current state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>This study examined the effect of blood pressure variability on brain microvascular function and cognitive performance. By implementing a model of blood pressure variability using intermittent infusion of AngII for 25 days, the authors examined different cardiovascular variables, cerebral blood flow and cognitive function during midlife (12-15-month-old mice). Key findings from this study demonstrate that blood pressure variability impairs baroreceptor reflex and impairs myogenic tone in brain arterioles, particularly at higher blood pressure. They also provide evidence that blood pressure variability blunts functional hyperemia and impairs cognitive function and activity. Simultaneous monitoring of cardiovascular parameters, in vivo imaging recordings, and the combination of physiological and behavioral studies reflect rigor in addressing the hypothesis. The experiments are well designed, and data generated are clear.</p>
<p>A number of issues raised earlier were addressed by the authors in the revised manuscript. The responses are convincing. These included circadian rhythm considerations, baroreflex findings, BP fluctuations driven by animal movement, and data presentation.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a solid study with huge physiological implications. I believe that it will be of great benefit to the field.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This study examined the effect of blood pressure variability on brain microvascular function and cognitive performance. By implementing a model of blood pressure variability using an intermittent infusion of AngII for 25 days, the authors examined different cardiovascular variables, cerebral blood flow, and cognitive function during midlife (12-15-month-old mice). Key findings from this study demonstrate that blood pressure variability impairs baroreceptor reflex and impairs myogenic tone in brain arterioles, particularly at higher blood pressure. They also provide evidence that blood pressure variability blunts functional hyperemia and impairs cognitive function and activity. Simultaneous monitoring of cardiovascular parameters, in vivo imaging recordings, and the combination of physiological and behavioral studies reflect rigor in addressing the hypothesis. The experiments are well-designed, and the data generated are clear. I list below a number of suggestions to enhance this important work:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1B: It is surprising that the BP circadian rhythm is not distinguishable in either group. Figure 2, however, shows differences in circadian rhythm at different timepoints during infusion. Could the authors explain the lack of circadian effect in the 24-h traces?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The circadian rhythm pattern is apparent in Figure 2 (Active BP higher than Inactive BP), where BP is presented as 12hour averages. When the BP data is expressed as one-hour averages (rather than minute-to-minute) over 24hours, now included in the revised manuscript as Supplemental Figure 3C-D, the circadian rhythm becomes noticeable. In addition, we have included one-hour average BP data for all mice in the control and BPV groups, Supplemental Figure 3A-B.</p>
<p>Notably, the Ang-II induced pulsatile BP pattern remains evident in the one-hour averages for the BPV group, Supplemental Figure 3B. To minimize bias and validate variability, pump administrations start times were randomized for both control and BPV groups, Supplemental Figure 3A-B. Despite these adjustments, the circadian rhythm profile of BP is consistently maintained across individual mice and in the collective dataset, Supplemental Figure 3C-D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While saline infusion does not result in elevation of BP when compared to Ang II, there is an evident &quot;and huge&quot; BP variability in the saline group, at least 40mmHg within 1 hour. This is a significant physiological effect to take into consideration, and therefore it warrants discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. The large variations in BP in the raw traces during saline infusion reflects transient BP changes induced by movement/activity, which is now included in Figure 1B (maroon trace). The revised manuscript now includes Line 222 “Note that dynamic activity-driven BP changes were apparent during both saline- and Ang II infusions, Figure 1B”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The decrease in DBP in the BPV group is very interesting. It is known that chronic Ang II increases cardiac hypertrophy, are there any changes to heart morphology, mass, and/or function during BPV? Can the decrease in DBP in BPV be attributed to preload dysfunction? This observation should be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The lower DBP in the BPV group was already present at baseline, while both groups were still infused with saline, and was a difference beyond our control. However, this is an important and valid consideration, particularly considering the minimal yet significant increase in SBP within the BPV group (Figure 1D). Our goal was to induce significant transient blood pressure responses (BPV) and investigate the impact on cardiovascular and neurovascular outcomes in the absence of hypertension. We did not anticipate any major cardiac remodeling at this early time point (considering the absence of overt hypertension) and thus cardiac remodeling was not assessed and this is now discussed in the revised manuscript (Line 443-453).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Examining the baroreceptor reflex during the early and late phases of BPV is quite compelling. Figures 3D and 3E clearly delineate the differences between the two phases. For clarity, I would recommend plotting the data as is shown in panels D and E, rather than showing the mathematical ratio. Alternatively, plotting the correlation of ∆HR to ∆SBP and analyzing the slopes might be more digestible to the reader. The impairment in baroreceptor reflex in the BPV during high BP is clear, is there any indication whether this response might be due to loss of sympathetic or gain of parasympathetic response based on the model used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and have accordingly generated new figures displaying scatter plots of SBP vs HR with linear regression analysis (Figure 3D-G). Our goal is to further investigate which branch of the autonomic nervous system is affected in this model. The loss of a bradycardic response suggests either an enhancement of sympathetic activity, a reduction in parasympathetic activity, or a combination of both. This is briefly discussed in the revised manuscript (Line 486-496).</p>
<p>Heart rate variability (HRV) serves as an index of neurocardiac function and dynamic, non-linear autonomic nervous system processes, as described in Shaffer and Ginsber[1]. However, given that our data was limited to BP and HR readings collected at one-minute intervals, our primary assessment of autonomic function is limited to the bradycardic response. Further studies will be necessary to fully characterize the autonomic parameters influenced by chronic BPV.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 3B shows a drop in HR when the pump is ON irrespective of treatment (i.e., independent of BP changes). What is the underlying mechanism?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any lack of clarity. These observed heart rate (HR) changes occurred during Ang II infusion, when blood pressure (BP) was actively increasing. In the control group, the pump solution was switched to Ang II during specific periods (days 3-5 and 21-25 of the treatment protocol) to induce BP elevations and a baroreceptor response, allowing direct comparisons between the control and BPV group.</p>
<p>To clarify this point, we have revised Line 260-263 of the manuscript: “To compare pressure-induced bradycardic responses between BPV and control mice at both early and later treatment stages, a cohort of control mice received Ang II infusion on days 3-5 (early phase) (Supplemental Figure 4) and days 21-25 (late phase) thereby transiently increasing BP”.</p>
<p>Additionally, a detailed description has been added to the Methods section (Line 96-101): “Controls receiving Ang II: To facilitate between-group comparisons (control vs BPV), a separate cohort of control mice were subjected to the same pump infusion parameters as BPV mice but for a brief period receiving Ang II infusions on days 3-5 and 21-25 for experiments assessing pressure-evoked responses, including bradycardic reflex, myogenic response, and functional hyperemia at high BP.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The correlation of ∆diameter vs MAP during low and high BP is compelling, and the shift in the cerebral autoregulation curve is also a good observation. I would strongly recommend that the authors include a schematic showing the working hypothesis that depicts the shift of the curve during BPV.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this insightful comment. The increase in vessel reactivity to BP elevations in parenchymal arterioles of BPV mice suggests that chronic BPV induces a leftward shift and a potential narrowing of the cerebral autoregulation range (lower BP thresholds for both the upper and lower limits of autoregulation). This has been incorporated (and discussed) into the revised manuscript (see Figure 5N).</p>
<p>One potential explanation for these changes is that the absence of sustained hypertension, a prominent feature in most rodent models of hypertension, limits adaptive processes that protect the cerebral microcirculation from large BP fluctuations (e.g., vascular remodeling). While this study does not specifically address arteriole remodeling, the lack of such adaptation may reduce pressure buffering by upstream arterioles, thereby rendering the microcirculation more vulnerable to significant BP fluctuations.</p>
<p>The unique model allows for measurements of parenchymal arteriole reactivity to acute dynamic changes in BP (both an increase and decrease in MAP). Our findings indicate that chronic BPV enhances the reactivity of parenchymal arterioles to BP changes—both during an increase in BP and upon its return to baseline, Supplemental Figure 5C, F. The data suggest an increased myogenic response to pressure elevation, indicative of heightened contractility, a common adaptive process observed in rodent models of hypertension[2-4]. However, our model also reveals a notable tendency for greater dilation when the BP drops, Supplemental Figure 5F. This intriguing observation may suggest ischemia during the vasoconstriction phase (at higher BP), leading to enhanced release of dilatory signals, which subsequently manifest as a greater dilation upon BP reduction. This phenomenon bears similarities to chronic hypoperfusion models[5,6], where vasodilatory mechanisms become more pronounced in response to sustained ischemic conditions. Future studies investigating the effects of BPV on myogenic responses and brain perfusion will be a priority for our ongoing research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Functional hyperemia impairment in the BPV group is clear and well-described. Pairing this response with the kinetics of the recovery phase is an interesting observation. I suggest elaborating on why BPV group exerts lower responses and how this links to the rapid decline during recovery.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on the heightened reactivity of BPV parenchymal arterioles to intravascular pressure (Figure 5), we anticipate that the reduction of sensory-evoked dilations results from an increased vasoconstrictive activity and/or a decreased availability of vasodilatory signaling pathways (NO, EETs, COX-derived prostaglandins)[7,8]. Consequently, the magnitude of the FH response is blunted during periods of elevated BP in BPV mice.</p>
<p>Additionally, upon termination of the stimulus-induced response−when vasodilatory signals would typically dominate−vasoconstrictive mechanisms are rapidly engaged (or unmasked), leading to quicker return to baseline. This shift in the balance between vasodilatory and vasoconstrictive forces favors vasoconstriction, contributing to the altered recovery kinetics observed in BPV mice. This has been included in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The experimental design for the cognitive/behavioral assessment is clear and it is a reasonable experiment based on previous results. However, the discussion associated with these results falls short. I recommend that the authors describe the rationale to assess recognition memory, short-term spatial memory, and mice activity, and explain why these outcomes are relevant in the BPV context. Are there other studies that support these findings? The authors discussed that no changes in alternation might be due to the age of the mice, which could already exhibit cognitive deficits. In this line of thought, what is the primary contributor to behavioral impairment? I think that this sentence weakens the conclusion on BPV impairing cognitive function and might even imply that age per se might be the factor that modulates the various physiological outcomes observed here. I recommend clarifying this section in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Clinical studies have demonstrated that patients with elevated BPV exhibit impairments across multiple cognitive domains, including declines in processing speed[9] and episodic memory[10]. To evaluate memory function, we utilized behavioral tests: the novel object recognition (NOR) task to assess episodic memory[11] and the spontaneous Y-maze to evaluate short-term spatial memory[12].</p>
<p>Previous research indicates that older C57Bl6 mice (14-month-old) exhibit cognitive deficits compared to younger counterparts (4- and 9-month-old)[13]. To ensure rigorous selection for behavioral testing, we conducted preliminary <italic>NOR</italic> assessment, evaluating recognition memory at the one-hour delay but observing failures at the four-, and 24-hour delays, indicating age-related deficits. Based on these results, animals failing recognition criteria were excluded from subsequent behavioral assessment. However, because no baseline cognitive testing was conducted for the spontaneous Y-maze, it is possible that some mice with aged-related deficits were included in this test, which may have influenced data interpretation.</p>
<p>Additionally, the absence of differences in the Y-maze performance may suggest that short-term spatial memory remains intact following 25 days of BPV, a point that is now discussed in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(9) Why were only male mice used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment and acknowledge the importance of conducting experiments in both male and female mice. Studies involving female mice are currently ongoing, with telemetry data collection approximately halfway completed and two-photon imaging studies on functional hyperemia also partially completed. However, using middleaged mice for these experiments has proven challenging due to high mortality rates following telemetry surgeries. As a result, we initially limited our first cohort to male mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) In the results for Figure 3: &quot;Ang II evoked significant increases in SBP in both control and BPV groups;...&quot;. Also, in the figure legend: &quot;B. Five-minute average HR when the pump is OFF or ON (infusing Ang II) for control and BPV groups....&quot; The authors should clarify this as the methods do not state a control group that receives Ang II.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Blood pressure variability has been identified as an important risk factor for dementia. However, there are no established animal models to study the molecular mechanisms of increased blood pressure variability. In this manuscript, the authors present a novel mouse model of elevated BPV produced by pulsatile infusions of high-dose angiotensin II (3.1ug/hour) in middle-aged male mice. Using elegant methodology, including direct blood pressure measurement by telemetry, programmable infusion pumps, in vivo two-photon microscopy, and neurobehavioral tests, the authors show that this BPV model resulted in a blunted bradycardic response and cognitive deficits, enhanced myogenic response in parenchymal arterioles, and a loss of the pressure-evoked increase in functional hyperemia to whisker stimulation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>As the presentation of the first model of increased blood pressure variability, this manuscript establishes a method for assessing molecular mechanisms. The state-of-the-art methodology and robust data analysis provide convincing evidence that increased blood pressure variability impacts brain health.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One major drawback is that there is no comparison with another pressor agent (such as phenylephrine); therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether the observed effects are a result of increased blood pressure variability or caused by direct actions of Ang II.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge this limitation and have attempted to address the concern by introducing an alternative vasopressor, norepinephrine (NE), Figure 4. A subcutaneous dose of 45 µg/kg/min was titrated to match Ang II-induced transient BP pulse (Systolic BP ~150-180 mmHg), Figure 4A. Similar to Ang II treated mice, NE-treated mice exhibited no significant changes in average mean arterial pressure (MAP) throughout the 20-day treatment period (Figure 4B). Although there was a trend (P=0.08) towards increased average real variability (ARV) (Figure 4C left), it did not reach statistical significance. The coefficient of variation (CV) (Figure 4C right) was significantly increased by day 3-4 of treatment (P=0.02).</p>
<p>Notably, unlike the bradycardic response observed during Ang II-induced BP elevations, NE infusions elicited a tachycardic response (Figure 4A), likely due to β-1 adrenergic receptor activation. However, significant mortality was observed within the NE cohort: three of six mice died prematurely during the second week of treatment, and two additional mice required euthanasia on days 18 and 20 due to lethargy, impaired mobility, and tachypnea.</p>
<p>While we recognize the importance of comparing results across vasopressors, further investigation using additional vasopressors would require a dedicated study, as each agent may induce distinct off-target effects, potentially generating unique animal models. Alternatively, a mechanical approach−such as implanting a tethered intra-aortic balloon[14] connected to a syringe pump−could be explored to modulate blood pressure variability without pharmacological intervention. However, such an approach falls beyond the scope of the present study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Ang II is known to have direct actions on cerebrovascular reactivity, neuronal function, and learning and memory. Given that Ang II is increased in only 15% of human hypertensive patients (and an even lower percentage of non-hypertensive), the clinical relevance is diminished. Nonetheless, this is an important study establishing the first mouse model of increased BPV.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that high Ang II levels are not a predominant cause of hypertension in humans, which is why it is critical that our pulsatile Ang II dosing did not cause overt hypertension, (no increase in 24-hour MAP). Ang II was solely a tool to produce controlled, transient increases in BP to yield a significant increase in BPV.</p>
<p>Regarding BPV specifically, prior studies indicate that primary hypertensive patients with elevated urinary angiotensinogen-to-creatinine ratio exhibit significantly higher mean 24-hour systolic ARV compared to those with lower ratios[15]. However, the fundamental mechanisms driving these harmful increases in BPV remain poorly defined. A central theme across clinical BPV studies is impaired arterial stiffness, which has been proposed to contribute to BPV through reduced arterial compliance and diminished baroreflex sensitivity. Moreover, increased BPV can exert mechanical stress on arterial walls, leading to arterial remodeling and stiffness−ultimately perpetuating a detrimental feed-forward cycle[16].</p>
<p>In our model, male BPV mice exhibited a minimal yet significant elevation in SBP without corresponding increases in DBP, potentially reflecting isolated systolic hypertension, which is strongly associated with arterial stiffness[17,18]. Our initial goal was to establish controlled rapid fluctuations in BP, and Ang II was selected as the pressor due to its potent vasoconstrictive properties and short half-life[19].</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment and acknowledge the necessity of exploring alternative mechanisms underlying BPV, and independent of Ang II. It is our long-term goal to investigate these factors in further studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) How was the dose of Ang II determined? It seems that this dose (3.1ug/hr) is quite high.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Ang II dose was titrated in a preliminary study to one that induced a significant and transient BP response without increasing 24-hour blood pressure (i.e. no hypertension).</p>
<p>Ang II was delivered subcutaneously at 3.1 μg/hr, a concentration comparable to high-dose Ang II administration via mini-osmotic pumps (~1700 ng/kg/min)[20], with one-hour pulses occurring every 3-4 hours. With 6 pulses per day, the total daily dose equates to 18.6 µg/day in a ~30 gram mouse.</p>
<p>For comparison, if the same 18.6 µg/day dose were administered continuously via a mini-osmotic pump (18.6 µg/0.03kg/1440min), the resulting dosage would be approximately 431 ng/kg/min[21,22], aligning with subpressor dose levels. Thus, while the total dose may appear high, it is not delivered in a constant manner but rather intermittently, allowing for controlled, rapid variations in blood pressure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Were behavioral studies performed on the same mice that were individually housed? Individual housing causes significant stress in mice that can affect learning and memory tasks (PMC6709207). It's not a huge issue since the control mice would have been housed the same way, but it is something that could be mentioned in the discussion section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Behavioral studies were performed on mice that were individually housed following the telemetry surgery. The study was started once BP levels stabilized, as mice required several days to achieve hemodynamic stability post-surgery. Consequently, all mice were individually housed for several days before undergoing behavioral assessment.</p>
<p>To account for potential cognitive variability, earlier novel object recognition (NOR) tests were conducted to established cognitive capacity, and mice that did not meet criteria were excluded from further behavioral testing. However, we acknowledge that individual housing induces stress, which can influence learning and memory, and this is a factor we were unable to fully control. Given that both experimental and control groups experienced the same housing conditions, this stress effect should be comparable across cohorts. A discussion on this limitation is now included in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It looks like one control mouse that was included in both Figures 1 and 2 (control n=12) but was excluded in Table 1 (control n=11), this isn't mentioned in the text - please include the exclusion criteria in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the typo−12 control animals were consistently utilized across Figure 1-2, Table 1, Supplemental Table 1, Figure 6C, and Supplemental Figure 2B. Since the initial submission, one control mouse was completed and included into the telemetry control cohort. Thus, in the updated manuscript, we have corrected the control sample size to 13 mice across these figures ensuring consistency.</p>
<p>Additionally, exclusion criteria have now been explicitly included in the manuscript (Line 173-175). Mice were excluded from the study if they died prematurely (died prior to treatment onset) or mice exhibited abnormally elevated pressure while receiving saline, likely due to complications from telemetry surgery.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Please include a statement on why female mice were not included in this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed in our response to Reviewer #1, our initial intention was to include both male and female mice in this study. However, high mortality rates following telemetry surgeries significantly constrained our ability to advance all aspects of the study. As a result, we limited our first cohort to males to establish the basics of the model. A statement is now included in the manuscript, Line 50-53: “Female mice were not included in the present study due to high post-surgery mortality observed in 12-14-month-old mice following complex procedures. To minimized confounding effects of differential survival and to establish foundational data for this model, we restricted the investigation to male mice.”</p>
<p>Potential sex differences might be complex and warrants a separate future research to comprehensively assess sex as a biological variable, which are currently ongoing.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) On page 14, &quot;experiments from control vs experimental mice were not equally conducted in the same season raising the possibility for a seasonal effect&quot; - does this mean that control experiments were not conducted at the same time as the Ang II infusions in BPV mice? This has huge implications on whether the effects observed are induced by treatment or just batch seasonal effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully acknowledge the reviewer’s concern, and our statement aims to provide transparency regarding the study’s limitations. Several challenges contributed to this outcome, including high mortality rates following surgeries (primarily telemetry implantation) and technical issues related to instrumentation, particularly telemetry functionality.</p>
<p>Differences between BPV and saline mice emerge primarily due to mortality or telemetry failures−some mice did not survive post-surgery, while others remain healthy but had non-functional telemeters. This issue was particularly pronounced in 14-month-old mice, as their fragile vasculature occasionally prevented proper BP readings.</p>
<p>Each experiment required a minimum of two and a half months per mouse to complete, with a cost (also per mouse) exceeding $1500 USD ($300 pump, $175 mouse, $900 telemeters, per diem, drugs, reagents etc.). Despite our best effort to ensure comparable seasonal/batch data, these logistical and technical constraints prevented perfect synchronization.</p>
<p>To evaluate whether seasonal differences influenced our results, we incorporated additional telemetry data into the control cohort. Of the seven included control mice, six underwent the same treatment but were allocated to a separate branch of the study, which endpoints did not require a chronic cranial window. We found no significant differences in 24-hour average MAP during the baseline period between control mice with or without a cranial window, Supplemental Figure 2A. Additionally, we grouped mice into seasonal categories based on Georgia’s climate: “Spring-Summer” (May-September) and “Fall-Winter” (October-April) but observed no BP differences between these periods, Supplemental Figure 2B.</p>
<p>Given the absence of seasonal effects on BP and the fact that mice were sourced from two independent suppliers (Jackson Laboratory and NIA), we anticipate that the observed results are driven by treatment rather than seasonal or batch effects.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Methods, two-photon imaging: did the authors mean &quot;retro-orbital&quot; instead of &quot;intra-orbital&quot; injection of the Texas red dye? Also, is this a Texas red-dextran? If so, what molecular weight?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. The correct terminology is “retro-orbital” rather than “intra-orbital” injection. Additionally, we utilized Texas Red-dextran (70 kDa, 5% [wt/vol] in saline) for the imaging experiments. These details have now been incorporated into the Methods section.</p>
