<title>Abstract</title><p>Non-inheritable antibiotic resistance or phenotypic resistance ensures bacterial survival upon antibiotic treatment. However, exogenous factors in promoting phenotypic resistance is poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> are recalcitrant to killing by a broad spectrum of antibiotics under high magnesium. Functional metabolomics demonstrate that magnetism modulates the biosynthesis of fatty acids in increasing the biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids while decreasing unsaturated fatty acids. Exogenous supplementation of fatty acids confirm the role of fatty acids in antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, functional lipidomics reveal that glycerophospholipid metabolism is the major metabolic pathway remodeled by magnetism, where the biosynthesis of PE is decreased but PG is increased. Thus, the membrane composition is altered, leading to increased membrane polarization, and decreased permeability and fluidity. These together reduce the uptake of antibiotics by the bacteria. Thus, our study suggest a previously unrecognized metabolic mechanism by which bacteria escape antibiotic killing by utilizing environmental factor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Non-inheritable antibiotic resistance or phenotypic resistance represent a serious therapeutic challenge for bacterial infectious diseases. Phenotypic resistance does not involve genetic mutations, instead, this type of resistance are transient. Thus, bacteria resume to normal growth after removing the antibiotics. Two extensively studied phenotypic resistance includes biofilm and bacterial persisters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Corona &amp; Martinez, 2013</xref>). Biofilms have complex structures that impede the diffusion of antibiotics and contain elements sequestrating antibiotics to prevent their further actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ciofu <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Moreover, biofilm-forming bacteria and persisters themselves have distinct metabolic state that also significantly negatively influence their susceptibility to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yan &amp; Bassler, 2019</xref>). These two types of phenotypic resistance have common phenomena that their growth are retarded or even stopped in the presence of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Corona &amp; Martinez, 2013</xref>). However, factors promoting bacterial phenotypic resistance that is still proliferate in the presence of antibiotics are poorly defined.</p>
<p>There is a growing body of evidence that metal ions have diverse impact on chemical, physical and physiological phenomena that play roles in development of antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Booth <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Poole, 2017</xref>). One mechanism could involve genetic elements that harbor genes conferring resistance to metals and antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Poole, 2017</xref>) . On the other hand, recent reports suggest that metal cations directly hinder (or enhance) the activity of specific antibiotic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) and that the metabolic environment impacts bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lee &amp; Collins, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Peng <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Light metal ions, such as magnesium, sodium, and potassium, serve as cofactors to many enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Du <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>), some of which could influence drug efficacy. Heavy metal ions, including Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>, confer resistance to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yazdankhah <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Recent reports suggest that sodium negatively regulates redox states to promote antibiotic resistance in <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), while actively growing <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cope with ribosome-targeting antibiotics based on ion flux modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). But whether such ions can promote phenotypic resistance is less explored.</p>

<title>Mg2+ promotes resistance to antibiotics</title>
<p>Magnesium is rich in marine and marine aquaculture, where antibiotics are commonly used. We directly investigate the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on balofloxacin (BLFX) susceptibility in two strains of <italic>Vibrios</italic>, <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> ATCC33787 and <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> VP01, which were isolated from marine aquaculture. In the initial experiment, the ionic environment of marine water was simulated by adding 39 mM NaCl, 35 mM Mg<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 7 mM KCl, and 7 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to LB medium (<bold>Table EV1</bold>), to create a medium which we designated “artificial seawater” (ASWT). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for BLFX in ATCC33787 and VP01 were 54 μg/mL and 25 μg/mL in ASWT and 1 μg/mL and 3 μg/mL in LB medium, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The role of exogenous NaCl in antibiotic resistance was investigated in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>); and the MIC for BLFX was the same in LB medium or M9 medium plus 7 mM KCl or 7 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig EV1</bold></xref>). However, the MIC for BLFX was higher in M9 medium plus Mg<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) and the MIC for BLFX increased with increasing concentration of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Specifically, addition of 50 mM or 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> increased the MIC for BLFX 200- or 1600-fold, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Using the Oxford cup method, the zone of inhibition increased with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub> from 15.6 mM – 62.4 mM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Exogenous MgCl<sub>2</sub> also increased MICs for other quinolones (<italic>e.g.</italic> nalidixic acid, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and moxifloxacin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>) and non-quinolone antibiotics including antibacterial peptides (colistin), macrolides (roxithromycin), tetracyclines (oxytetraycline), β-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime), and aminoglycosides (amikacine, kanamycin, and gentamicin) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). Such non- specific resistance promoting effects indicate that Mg<sup>2+</sup> promotes phenotypic resistance.</p>

<title>Extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>, intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> and chelation of antibiotic</title>
<p>Previous reports suggest that chelation of antibiotics by magnesium ions inhibits antibiotic uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Deitchman <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lunestad &amp; Goksøyr, 1990</xref>). To explore this possibility, the zone of inhibition for balofloxacin was measured with various concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, ranging from 0 mM to 200 mM. Marine water usually contains 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Lower concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, (0.78, 3.125 or 12.5 mM) did not alter the zone of inhibition, while higher concentration including 50 and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> decreased the zone of inhibition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Correlation of the MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration-dependent resistance suggests that chelation influences bacterial survival by 25.5% and 27.7% in 50 and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, respectively, but not at lower MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Furthermore, intracellular balofloxacin decreased with increasing concentration of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>), while exogenous Mg<sup>2+</sup> increased intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> level in a dose-dependent manner, where 50 and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> increased 1.21 and 1.31 mmol/L, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). We also examined rate of efflux and expression of LPS, which contribute to antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kobylka <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Song <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). The results show that expression of TolC/<italic>tolC</italic> and LPS was unaffected by Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). Loss of <italic>waaF, lpxA</italic>, and <italic>lpxC</italic>, three key genes involved in LPS biosynthesis, did not influence sensitivity/resistance to balofloxacin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>). These data demonstrate that influx of Mg<sup>2+</sup> plays roles in balofloxacin resistance.</p>

<title>MgCl<sub>2</sub> affects bacterial metabolism</title>
<p>Although it is well established that Mg<sup>2+</sup> regulates the activity of many metabolic enzymes and strongly influences bacterial metabolism(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Garfinkel &amp; Garfinkel, 1985</xref>), the mechanism of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in promoting antibiotic resistance is less explored. Thus, <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> was cultured in M9 medium in the presence of various amounts of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (0 mM, 0.78 mM, 3.125 mM, 12.5 mM, 50 mM, or 200 mM), analyzed by GC-MS, and identified 54 metabolites. Five biological and two technical replicates were included for each treatment (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig EV2</bold></xref>). Rank-sum test and a permutation test were used to identify differentially expressed metabolites. Forty-one metabolites were identified (p &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), which were presented as a heatmap and Z-value in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig EV3</bold></xref>. Orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was conducted that separated the six treatments into three groups: Group 1 included 0 mM, 0.78 mM, and 3.125 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; Group 2 was a singlet of 12.5 mM; Group 3 included 50 mM and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Component t[1] distinguishes Group 1 from Groups 2 and 3; component t[2] distinguishes Group 3 from Groups 1 and 2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Discriminating variables are shown as S-plot, where cut-off values are ≥ 0.05 absolute value of covariance p and 0.5 for correlation p(corr). Six biomarkers/metabolites were selected from component t[1] and p[1]. More specifically, the abundance of cadaverine, urea, palmitic acid, aminoethanol, and fumaric acid were increased, but pyroglutamic acid and glutamic acid were decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig EV4</bold></xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis suggests that twelve pathways are involved. Notably, one of the pathways is biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (terminology in the software. Actually, it is biosynthesis of fatty acids) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Interestingly, the abundance of palmitic acid and stearic acid were increased in an Mg<sup>2+</sup> dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig EV5</bold></xref>). Moreover, palmitic acid was a crucial biomarker (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Exogenous palmitic acid increased bacterial resistance to balofloxacin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). These results suggest that fatty acid metabolism may be critical to the resistance.</p>

<title>Mg<sup>2+</sup> regulates fatty acid biosynthesis</title>
<p>Fatty acids include saturated and unsaturated fatty acids whose biosynthesis shared common biosynthetic pathways from acetyl-CoA to enoyl-ACP, sequentially mediated by <italic>fabD</italic> or <italic>fabH</italic>, <italic>fabB</italic>/<italic>F</italic>, <italic>fabG</italic> and <italic>fabA</italic>/<italic>Z</italic>. Enoyl-ACP is the direct source to produce unsaturated fatty acids or is metabolized to Acyl-ACP via <italic>fabV</italic> to produce saturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids produce saturated fatty acids via <italic>tesA</italic>/<italic>B</italic> and <italic>yciF</italic>. qRT-PCR was used to quantify the expression of involved genes in bacteria treated with different concentration of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The expression of 18 genes was increased when treated with 50 or 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). The increased expression of FabF was confirmed by Western blot (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Expression of <italic>tesA</italic>, <italic>tesB</italic>, and <italic>yciA</italic>, which convert unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, was increased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). The expression of <italic>fabA</italic> that promotes enoyl-ACP and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids was decreased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), which was confirmed at protein level with Western blot (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Oxazole-2-amine and triclosan inhibit synthesis of fatty acids and decrease bacterial survival in the presence of balofloxacin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). These results indicate that Mg<sup>2+</sup> inhibits synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and promotes synthesis of saturated fatty acids.</p>

<p>We also quantified the gene expression of fatty acid degradation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of genes involved in unsaturated fatty acid degradation was decreased in an MgCl<sub>2</sub> dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>), while the expression of genes for exogenous fatty acid degradation was increased. Western blot data confirmed that the abundance of FadL decreased with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4H</xref>). FadH degrades unsaturated fatty acids, and influences the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. In general, these results suggest that MgCl<sub>2</sub> inhibits degradation of fatty acids.</p>
<p>FabR, FadR, ArcA, and cAMP/CRP are transcriptional factors in regulating fatty acid biosynthesis. FabR inhibits biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids; FadR promotes biosynthesis and inhibits fatty acids degradation; ArcA and cAMP/CRP inhibit and promote fatty acid degradation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Feng &amp; Cronan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fujita <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The expression of <italic>fabR</italic> and <italic>fadR</italic> was increased, <italic>arcA</italic> was decreased. The expression of N646_1004 did not change with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub>, while expression of N646_1885 increased only in the presence of 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4I</xref>). Western blot data confirmed the decreased expression of FadR with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4J</xref>). Viability of Δ<italic>fadR</italic> and Δ<italic>arcA</italic> was decreased in the presence of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, balofloxacin or both in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4K</xref>). Thus, FadR and ArcA could play roles in bacterial resistance to balofloxacin, presumably by a mechanism that is linked to the abundance of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to investigate whether Mg<sup>2+</sup> functions through FadR and ArcA, expression of 8 genes of fatty acid biosynthetic genes (<italic>accA, accC, fabD, fabH, fabR, fabG, fabV,</italic> and <italic>yciA</italic>) and 5 genes of fatty acid degradation (<italic>fadL, fadD, fadB,</italic> and <italic>fadA</italic>) were quantified in wildtype, Δ<italic>fadR</italic> and Δ<italic>arcA</italic> bacterial strains. As expected, the expression of fatty acid biosynthetic genes was decreased in Δ<italic>fadR</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4L</xref>). However, higher expression of <italic>fadD, fadB,</italic> and <italic>fadA</italic> (elevated <italic>fadA</italic> only for Δ<italic>fadR</italic>) was detected in Δ<italic>fadR</italic> or ΔacrA strains, but the expression of these genes was negatively regulated by 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4M-O</xref>).

<p>Furthermore, direct exposure to palmitic acid inhibited balofloxacin-mediated killing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>) but linolenic acid promoted balofloxacin-mediated killing in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>).

<p>S-plot analysis showed that upregulated lipids include behenic acid, PG[16:1(9Z)/16:1(9Z)], PG[18:2 (9Z, 12Z)/16:0], PA [14:0/22:6 (4Z, 7Z, 10Z, 13Z, 16Z, 19Z)], lysoPE(16:0/0:0) and downregulated lipids include linoelaidic acid, palmitoleic acid, PE-NMe(24:0/24:0), PE[16:0/14:1(9Z)], lysoPA(i-12:0/0:0) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>). Among them, the abundance of PG[16:1(9Z)/16:1(9Z)], PG[18:2(9Z,12Z)/16:0], and behenic acid was increased, while that of linoelaidic acid, palmitoleic acid and PE[16:0/14:1(9Z)] were decreased with increasing Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>). Therefore, altered phospholipid abundance may play a role in the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on resistance to balofloxacin.</p>
<p>PE and PG are the two end products of phospholipid metabolism (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>).

Phosphatidylglycerol phosphate synthase (PGS) encoded by <italic>pgsA</italic> and phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS) encoded by <italic>pssA</italic> are crucial enzymes for biosynthesis of PG and PE, respectively. Activities of PGS and PSS were elevated and reduced, respectively, by the increasing concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>). The effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on the activity of PSS was confirmed with recombinant PSS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6J</xref>).

However, depolarization gradually increased for 2 h, reached a plateau for 3 - 5 h and decreased from 5 to 10 h when supplemented with 0.78 or 3.125 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The extent of maximum depolarization and the length of time at higher level of depolarization also increased by MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>).

<p>Moreover, efficacy of antibiotics is strongly influenced by bacterial membrane permeability and fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Saeloh <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Hence, membrane permeability and fluidity were investigated with fluorescence microscopy to visualize <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> cells in the presence of FM5-95 (red dye) and various concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Mg<sup>2+</sup> decreased red staining, and no staining was observed in the presence of 200 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). Consistently, the uptake of SYTO9 dye decreased with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub>, indicating bacterial membrane permeability decreased in an Mg<sup>2+</sup>dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>). These results indicate that exogenous Mg<sup>2+</sup> decreased bacterial membrane permeability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, exogenous palmitic acid shifted the fluorescence signal peaks to the left in an MgCl<sub>2</sub>- and palmitic acid concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>). In contrast, exogenous linolenic acid shifted the peak to the right in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G</xref>). These results support the conclusion that exogenous palmitic acid and linolenic acid decrease or increase membrane permeability, respectively. In Δ<italic>fadR</italic> cells, membrane permeability increased and then slowly decreased with increasing Mg<sup>2+</sup>, remaining higher than the control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7H</xref>). However, Δ<italic>arcA</italic> cells displayed reduced membrane permeability in the presence of low but not high MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7I</xref>). Δ<italic>pgpA</italic> cells exhibited higher membrane permeability than control cells at all MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations, but the effect was smaller at higher MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7J</xref>).

<p>Relative membrane permeability appeared to correlate with relative intracellular balofloxacin and antibiotic efficacy.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study explores the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on phenotypic in <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>. The results suggest that exogenous Mg<sup>2+</sup> promotes biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids and inhibits biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, while it also upregulates the activity of PGS and the abundance of PG, and downregulates the activity of PSS and abundance of PE. As a result, membrane permeability and antibiotic uptake decrease (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7L</xref>), enabling phenotypic resistance. The results are consistent with the observed impact of exogenous Mg<sup>2+</sup> on bacterial survival in the presence of balofloxacin and other antibiotics, and it is well recognized that membrane permeability critically impacts drug efficacy. Another pathway that influences drug uptake involves glutamine-inosine transport mediated by CpxA/R-OmpF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The results also show that exogenous fatty acids influence membrane permeability and bacterial survival in the presence of balofloxacin.</p>
<p>Mg<sup>2+</sup> is the most abundant divalent cation in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pohland &amp; Schneider, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pontes <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) and it plays many essential roles. For example, Mg<sup>2+</sup> stabilizes macromolecular complexes and membranes, binds cytoplasmic nucleic acids and nucleotides, interacts with phospholipid head groups and cell surface molecules, and is an essential cofactor in many enzymatic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Groisman <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). A novel observation of the present study is that exogenous Mg<sup>2+</sup> influences the abundance of palmitic acid and linolenic acid and that it upregulates PGS and downregulates PSS. These findings extend our understanding of the complexity of the biological functions of the divalent magnesium cation.</p>
<p>Recent studies suggest a link between fatty acid biosynthesis and antibiotic resistance in <italic>E. tarda</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Su <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). The present study shows that Mg<sup>2+</sup> has opposite effects on the abundance of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, stimulating biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids at moderately high levels, while inhibiting biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids at ≥ 3 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Therefore, ratio of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids should be a key clue to understand antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>In previous studies of gram-positive and gran-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kumariya <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Said <italic>et al</italic>, 1987</xref>), it was shown that 10 - 20 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> disrupts <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> membranes and kills stationary-phase <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells, but it does influence survival of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Xie &amp; Yang, 2016</xref><italic>)</italic>. Low concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (≤ 10 mM) induce PmrAB-dependent modification of lipid A in wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Herrera <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). A putative zwitterionic amino-containing phospholipid increased significantly, whereas amounts of phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin decreased in two mutants of <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> resistant to mundticin KS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sakayori <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). However, Mg<sup>2+</sup> induces antibiotic resistance through regulating the activity of PGS and PSS is not reported. More importantly, the regulation targets the two enzymes in a reverse manner to enlarge the change in the ratio between PE and PG for recognition of antibiotic resistance, which is a previously unknown mechanism mediated by Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Previous studies on membrane permeability also show that PhoP/Q is activated by low magnesium, and that inhibition or inactivation of PhoP/Q stimulates uptake of β-lactam antibiotics in <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). The effects of the outer membrane permeabilizers, polymyxin B nonapeptide and EDTA, are completely abolished by 3 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kwon &amp; Lu, 2006</xref>). In response to Mg<sup>2+</sup> limited growth, enteric Gram-negative bacteria show higher acylation of lipid A, which alters membrane permeability and reduces uptake of cationic antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Guo <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Mg<sup>2+</sup> reverts the high sensitivity of rough mutants of <italic>Salmonella typhimurium, S. minnesota</italic>, and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 08 (i.e. with defects in the carbohydrate core of the lipopolysaccharide) to several antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Stan-Lotter <italic>et al</italic>, 1979</xref>). Mg<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM) totally inhibited aminoglycoside-mediated outer membrane permeabilization in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hancock <italic>et al</italic>, 1981</xref>). However, mechanisms underlying Mg<sup>2+</sup> regulation to antibiotic resistance are largely unknown. The present study reveals that Mg<sup>2+</sup> plays the crucial role in the membrane permeability responsible for antibiotic resistance via modulating PE and PG in phospholipid metabolism.</p>
<p>In summary, the present study shows that Mg<sup>2+</sup> modulates the phenotypic resistance of <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> to balofloxacin and potentially other quinolones and other classes of antibiotics by a mechanism that involves altered membrane permeability and reduced antibiotic uptake. These findings inform the ongoing and future search for ways to improve the therapeutic effects of antibiotics to magnetism-induced phenotypic resistance.</p>

<p>The study explored the influence of magnesium on phenotypic antibiotic resistance in two Vibrio model bacteria. This research is <bold>fundamental</bold> for revealing the phenotypic antibiotic resistance mechanism utilized by the specified model bacteria in elevated levels of magnesium. The study produced <bold>solid</bold> evidence indicating that in high concentrations of magnesium, the efficacy of selected antibiotics was diminished due to decreased biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and PE, along with an increase in the biosynthesis of PG.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Magnesium modulates phospholipid metabolism to promote bacterial phenotypic resistance to antibiotics&quot;, Li et al demonstrated the role of magnesium in promoting phenotypic resistance in V. alginolyticus. Using standard microbiological and metabolomic techniques, the authors have shown the significance of fatty acid biosynthesis pathway behind the resistance mechanism. This study is significant as it sheds light on the role of an exogenous factor in altering membrane composition, polarization, and fluidity which ultimately leads to antimicrobial resistance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors aimed to identify if and how magnesium affects the ability of two particular bacteria species to resist the action of antibiotics. In my view, the authors succeeded in their goals and presented a compelling study that will have important implications for the antibiotic resistance research community. Since metals like magnesium are present in all lab media compositions and are present in the host, the data presented in this study certainly will inspire additional research by the community. These could include research into whether other types of metals also induce multi-drug resistance, whether this phenomenon can be observed in other bacterial species, especially pathogenic species that cause clinical disease, and whether the underlying molecular determinants (i.e. enzymes) of metal-induced phenotypic resistance could be new antimicrobial drug targets themselves.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study's strengths include that the authors used a variety of methodologies, all of which point to a clear effect of exogenous Mg2+ on drug resistance in the targeted species. I also commend the authors for carrying out a comprehensive study, spanning evaluation of whole cell phenotypes, metabolic pathways, genetic manipulation, to enzyme activity level evaluation. The fact that the authors uncovered a molecular mechanism underlying Mg2+-induced phenotypic resistance is particularly important as the key proteins should be studied further.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I believe there are weaknesses in the manuscript, however. The authors take for granted that the reader is familiar with all the assays utilized, and do not properly explain some experiments, and thus I highly suggest that the authors add a brief statement in each situation describing the rationale for each selected methodology (more details are in the private review to the authors). The Results section is also quite long and bogs down at times, and I suggest that the authors reduce its length by 10 to 20%. In contrast, the Introduction is sparse and lacks key aspects, for example, there should be mention of the study's main purpose and approaches, plus an introduction to the authors' choice of species and their known drug resistance properties, as well as the drug of choice (balofloxacin). Another notable weakness is that the authors evaluated Mg2+-induced phenotypic resistance only against two closely related species, and thus the generalizability of this mechanism of drug resistance is not known. The paper would be strengthened if the authors could demonstrate this type of phenotypic resistance in at least one more Gram-negative species and at least one Gram-positive species (antimicrobial susceptibility evaluations would suffice), each of which should be pathogenic to humans. Demonstrating magnesium-induced phenotypic drug resistance in the WHO Priority Bacterial Pathogens would be particularly important.</p>
<p>In general, the conclusions drawn by the authors are justified by the data, except for the interpretation of some experiments. Importantly, this paper has discovered new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and has also pointed to potential new targets for antimicrobials.</p>
