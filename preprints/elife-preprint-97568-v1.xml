<title>Abstract</title>
<p>How bacterial pathogens exploit host metabolism to promote immune tolerance and persist in infected hosts remains elusive. To achieve this, we show that <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA),</italic> a recalcitrant pathogen, utilizes the quorum sensing (QS) signal 2-aminoacetophenone (2-AA). Here, we unveil how 2-AA-driven immune tolerization causes distinct metabolic perturbations in macrophages’ mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics. We present evidence indicating that these effects stem from a decrease in pyruvate transport into mitochondria. This reduction is attributed to decreased expression of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC1), which is mediated by diminished expression and nuclear presence of its transcriptional regulator, estrogen-related nuclear receptor alpha (ERRα). Consequently, ERRα exhibits weakened binding to the MPC1 promoter. This outcome arises from the impaired interaction between ERRα and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). Ultimately, this cascade results in diminished pyruvate influx into mitochondria and consequently reduced ATP production in tolerized macrophages. Exogenously added ATP in infected macrophages restores the transcript levels of <italic>MPC1</italic> and <italic>ERR-α and</italic> enhances cytokine production and intracellular bacterial clearance. Consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, murine infection studies corroborate the 2-AA-mediated long-lasting decrease in ATP and acetyl-CoA and its association with <italic>PA</italic> persistence, further supporting this QS signaling molecule as the culprit of the host bioenergetic alterations and <italic>PA</italic> persistence. These findings unveil 2-AA as a modulator of cellular immunometabolism and reveal an unprecedent mechanism of host tolerance to infection involving the PGC-1α/ERRα axis in its influence on MPC1/OXPHOS-dependent energy production and <italic>PA</italic> clearance. These paradigmatic findings paving the way for developing treatments to bolster resilience to pathogen-induced damage. Given that QS is a common characteristic of prokaryotes, it is likely that 2-AA-like molecules with similar functions may be present in other pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Host tolerance is a fundamental mechanism of innate immunity. Studies have shown that innate immune cells following infection or exposure to microbial products may enter a state of immune tolerance characterized by reduced responsiveness towards microbial re-exposure a few hours later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Epigenetic and signaling-based mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in host immune tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In recent years, several reports have highlighted the complex interplay between metabolic reprogramming and immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. It was suggested that specific metabolic programs are activated in monocytes and macrophages upon exposure to infection and microbial products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. However, in host tolerance, the molecular mechanisms underlying immunometabolic reprogramming mediated by bacterial pathogens remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Metabolic pathways are essential for generating energy for various cellular functions, including those performed by immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Macrophages use metabolic pathways to generate energy and metabolites to adapt to changing environments and stimuli, thereby enabling them to cope with the needs of a fluctuating immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Thus, properly functioning metabolic pathways are vital for immune cells to counteract pathogens. For instance, the crucial energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is required to phagocytose pathogen-derived molecules efficiently.</p>
<p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)</italic>, a recalcitrant ESKAPE (<italic><underline>E</underline>nterococcus faecium, <underline>S</underline>taphylococcus aureus, <underline>K</underline>lebsiella pneumoniae, <underline>A</underline>cinetobacter baumannii, <underline>P</underline>A,</italic> and <italic><underline>E</underline>nterobacter sp.</italic>) pathogen that causes acute and persistent infections, secretes virulence-associated low molecular weight signaling molecules, several of which are regulated by quorum sensing (QS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and able to modulate host immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. QS is a cell density-dependent signaling system bacteria use to synchronize their activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. MvfR (a.k.a. PqsR), a critical QS transcription factor of <italic>PA,</italic> regulates the synthesis of many small molecules, including signaling molecules such as 2-aminoacetophenone (2-AA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies have demonstrated that 2-AA enables <italic>PA</italic> to persist in infected murine tissues by promoting innate immune tolerance through histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)-mediated epigenetic reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. 2-AA tolerization reprograms the host inflammatory signaling cascade by maintaining chromatin in a “silent” state through increased HDAC1 expression and activity and decreased histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. These changes also impact the protein-protein interaction between HAT and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein/HDAC1 and p50/p65 nuclear factor (NF)-κB subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. The 2-AA-mediated tolerization permits <italic>PA</italic> to persist in infected tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] underscoring the difference from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated tolerization, which instead leads to bacterial clearance and involves different HDACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Mitochondria, the “powerhouse” of the cells, are crucial for the regulation, differentiation, and survival of macrophages and other immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Our group’s previous <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicated that 2-AA affects metabolic functions in skeletal muscle, which contains a high concentration of mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Injection of 2-AA in murine skeletal muscle dampens the expression of genes associated with OXPHOS and the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1 beta (PGC-1β) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Another <italic>PA</italic> QS molecule, 3-oxo-C12-HSL, attenuates the expression of PGC-1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. PGC-1α and PGC-1β belong to the PPARγ family of inducible transcriptional coactivators and are known regulators of mitochondrial metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. The coactivator PGC-1 proteins are involved in various cellular energy metabolic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], including but not limited to mitochondrial metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Recent studies have also emphasized the role of estrogen-related nuclear receptor α (ERRα) in coordinating metabolic capacity with energy demand in health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. PGC-1α activates ERRα transcriptional activity through protein-protein interaction, which enhances the expression of ERRα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] and other mitochondrial genes involved in lipid metabolism and OXPHOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. PGC-1α/ERRα axis has been extensively studied in cancer and established as a central regulatory node of energy metabolism that induces the global expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. ERRα has been shown to occupy the promoter regions of many genes participating in the TCA cycle and OXPHOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], including the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC1). In human renal carcinoma cells, PGC-1α/ERRα interaction results in efficient activation of MPC1 expression and transport of pyruvate into mitochondrion for efficient OXPHOS and energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Given that our previous studies pointed to the 2-AA effect on mitochondrial functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] and that mitochondria are crucial for the regulation, differentiation, and survival of macrophages and other immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] we investigated how 2-AA may mediate cellular metabolic reprogramming in tolerized immune cells by examining the link between the PGC-1α/ERRα axis and 2-AA-mediated immune tolerance. Our findings uncovered the crucial action of 2-AA on energy homeostasis and metabolism in tolerized immune cells through perturbances of the ERRα/PGC-1α interaction, MPC1-mediated pyruvate transport and the production of the key energy metabolism molecules, ATP and acetyl-CoA and their association with the persistence of <italic>PA</italic> in mammalian tissues.</p>

<title>Tolerization by 2-AA impacts the generation of crucial energy metabolites in macrophages</title>
<p>Following infection or exposure to microbial products, innate immune cells may enter a state of tolerance several hours later, as depicted by their diminished responsiveness or unresponsiveness to microbial re-exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Given that 2-AA tolerized cells are non-responsive to 2-AA re-exposure, we investigated the impact of 2-AA on energy homeostasis and metabolism in non-tolerized and tolerized BMDM cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We quantified the levels of ATP and acetyl-CoA, which is a fuel for ATP production, in a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments in which murine BMDM cells were exposed to 2-AA (1<sup>st</sup> 2-AA exposure) or re-exposed (2<sup>nd</sup> 2-AA exposure) to respectively determine their activation, and tolerance as well as memory to this QS molecule (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Initially, following the 1<sup>st</sup> 2-AA exposure (black bars), a significant increase in the concentrations of intracellular ATP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and acetyl-CoA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) was observed in BMDM cells exposed to 2-AA for 1 and 6 h compared to their corresponding naïve control cells (grey bars). However, cells exposed to 2-AA for 48 h (black bar) appeared to have entered a state of tolerance as ATP and acetyl-CoA levels were decreased compared to 2-AA exposures for a shorter time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The tolerance of these cells as well as their memory to 2-AA was determined by their responsiveness to a 2<sup>nd</sup> 2-AA exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To achieve this, these cells were washed to remove 2-AA and allowed to rest for 24 or 106 h in the absence of 2-AA before receiving the 2<sup>nd</sup> 2-AA exposure for 1 or 6 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> (red bars) show the unresponsiveness of BMDM cells to 2-AA re-exposure as evidenced by the similar levels of ATP and acetyl-CoA compared to cells exposed to 2-AA for 48 h (1<sup>st</sup> exposure black bars). The sustained unresponsiveness of the cells to re-exposure indicates that the cells exhibited innate immunological memory, which could not be reverted by 2-AA re-exposure. Similar responsiveness patterns of ATP and acetyl-CoA as with BMDM cells were observed in murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells (Figs. S1A and S1B) or human monocyte THP-1 cells (Figs. S1C and S1D) following exposure or re-exposure to 2-AA. These findings further support our observations with BMDM cells and confirm that either cell type can be used to study responses to 2-AA. These results reinforce the notion that 2-AA impacts crucial energy metabolites in macrophages.</p>

<caption><title>2-AA tolerization decreases crucial metabolites of cellular energy and affects mitochondrial respiration in mouse BMDM.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic representation showing experimental design: naïve cells were exposed to 2-AA for 1, 6, or 48 h (black). Cells exposed to 2-AA (400 µM) for 48 h were washed, rested for 24 or 106 h, and re-exposed (200 µM) for 1 or 6 h (red), respectively.

<p>Moreover, we sought to determine whether 2-AA-tolerized BMDM cells would respond to heterologous stimulus. To test this, we re-exposed the cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an outer membrane bacterial component that strongly induces macrophages. LPS re-exposure of the 2-AA tolerized BMDM cells did not significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.9) increase ATP levels (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>), indicating that 2-AA cross-tolerized the cells to this heterologous bacterial immunostimulant. On the other hand, as expected, we observed increased ATP levels following LPS stimulation of the non-tolerized BMDM cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). The broad spectrum of 2-AA cross-tolerization strongly suggests an interplay of epigenetic mechanism rather than ligand-receptor mediated signaling-based mechanism in bringing out the observed 2-AA-mediated tolerance.</p>

<title>Tolerization by 2-AA leads to a quiescent state by reducing cell bioenergetics and compromising OXPHOS</title>
<p>To further investigate the 2-AA’s impact on the bioenergetics of macrophages, we assessed by Seahorse assay the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as an index of OXPHOS in 2-AA exposed (for 1 and 24 h) and re-exposed (2<sup>nd</sup> exposure for 1 h) BMDM cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Values of basal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) and maximal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) mitochondrial respiration and spare respiratory capacity (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>) interpreted from these measurements revealed that 1 h 2-AA exposure of naïve cells significantly increased OCR compared to naïve control cells. At 24 h post-2-AA exposure, cells had a significantly reduced basal OCR level than the control BMDM cells, indicating decreased OXPHOS and an overall quiescent phenotype of tolerized macrophages. Re-exposure of tolerized macrophages with 2-AA also did not augment maximal and basal OCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1D</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>), indicating the unresponsiveness of tolerized BMDM cells.</p>
<p>These OCR data are consistent with previous direct measurements of ATP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and acetyl-CoA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) and support the notion that 2-AA tolerization induces a quiescent phenotype in these cells characterized by defective OXPHOS. These findings confirm that 2-AA mediates energy homeostatic and metabolic alterations in the immune cells and that 2-AA tolerization arrests these cells in a sustained 2-AA-unresponsive state.</p>

<title>The pyruvate transport into mitochondria is decreased in tolerized macrophages</title>
<p>Since acetyl-CoA and ATP levels were reduced due to 2-AA tolerization, we investigated whether the mitochondrial dysfunction observed is related to pyruvate metabolism. Pyruvate links glycolysis with mitochondrial production of acetyl-CoA and ATP <italic>via</italic> the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and OXPHOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. RAW 264.7 cells initially exposed to 2-AA for 1 or 3 h (black bars) exhibited significantly higher concentrations of cytosolic and mitochondrial pyruvate compared to the corresponding naïve control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Pyruvate significantly decreased over time in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions as cells were entering into the tolerized state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Tolerized cells remain unresponsive to 2-AA re-exposure (red bars), exhibiting no significant change in the concentration of pyruvate in the cytosolic or mitochondrial fraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). A similar result was observed in THP-1 cells (Figs. S1E and S1F).</p>

<p>To gain a better understanding of the 2-AA-mediated reductions in mitochondrial pyruvate, ATP production, and acetyl-CoA levels, we sought to determine the involvement of the MPC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] that is crucial in transporting pyruvate from the cytosol into the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Western blot studies of whole cell lysates of RAW 246.7 cells exposed to 2-AA showed a significant decrease over time in the abundance of MPC1 protein, and tolerized cells remain unresponsive to 2-AA re-exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Together these findings suggest that 2-AA tolerization dysregulates MPC1-mediated transport of the pyruvate into mitochondria.</p>

<title>2-AA tolerization suppresses ERRα binding to the MPC1 promoter and the interaction between PGC-1α and ERRα</title>
<p>Given that the PGC-1α/ERRα axis is the transcriptional regulatory node that activates the expression of MPC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] we determined the protein levels of ERRα. Western blot studies of whole cell lysates showed a significant decrease over time in the abundance of ERRα protein following 1<sup>st</sup> exposure of RAW 246.7 cells to 2-AA, while tolerized cells remain unresponsive to 2-AA re-exposure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

<p>Furthermore, because an ERRα binding putative DNA motif (TNAAGGTCA) has been identified upstream of the <italic>MPC1</italic> promoter in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], and we found the same motif to be present 1.5 kB upstream of the transcription start site of mouse <italic>MPC1</italic> promoter, we analyzed if tolerization led to reduced ERRα binding to the <italic>MPC1</italic> promoter motif TNAAGGTCA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay followed by qPCR analysis revealed that in tolerized cells, ERRα binds approximately 4-fold less efficiently to the putative binding site on the <italic>MPC1</italic> than in corresponding control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the transcriptional activity of ERRα is regulated through a protein-protein interaction with the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] we assessed whether the formation of the PGC-1α/ERRα complex is affected in 2-AA tolerized cells. Using paraformaldehyde fixed nuclear lysates of RAW 264.7 tolerized and naïve cells, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of PGC-1α and reverse co-IP with ERRα followed by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> less ERRα was detected when PGC-1α was pulled down in presence of 2-AA than in naïve control cells. Moreover, reverse co-IP with ERRα protein showed lower levels of PGC-1α in the presence of 2-AA than in naïve control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Control IgG showed no detectable levels of ERRα following nuclear fraction pull down. These results indicate that in the tolerized macrophages, PGC-1α/ERRα interaction is impaired (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, since PGC-1α enhances the transcriptional activity of ERRα through their interaction, and ERRα transcription is regulated <italic>via</italic> an autoregulatory loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], we examined the effect of tolerization on the transcription of <italic>ERRα</italic> and its target gene <italic>MPC1</italic>. Using RAW 264.7 cells infected with the wild type <italic>PA</italic> strain PA14 or isogenic Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> mutant, which does not produce 2-AA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] we observed lower RNA transcript levels of <italic>MPC1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and <italic>ERRα</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) in PA14 compared to Δ<italic>mvfR</italic>. The addition of 2-AA to Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> decreased the levels of both gene transcripts to t levels similar to the PA14 infection condition, supporting the role of 2-AA in effect. To test if the observed effects are due to MPC1-dependent reduction of mitochondrial ATP generation, we supplemented the macrophages with ATP. The findings indicate that the addition of ATP in PA14 infected cells elevated the transcript levels of both <italic>ERRα</italic> and <italic>MPC1</italic>, but not in the Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> infected macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). These results indicate that reduced MPC1 function is due to 2-AA tolerization on the transcriptional activation of <italic>MPC1</italic> through the PGC-1α/ERRα axis.</p>

Here we used RAW 264.7 cells that were infected with the PA14 or the 2-AA deficient Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> mutant to assess the clearance of <italic>PA</italic> by macrophages. Macrophages infected with PA14 showed increased bacterial burden than the cells infected with Δ<italic>mvfR,</italic> and 2-AA addition to Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> led to increased bacterial burden (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Furthermore, we used UK5099 and ATP to interrogate whether MPC1 mediated mitochondrial pyruvate import and bioenergetics are linked to the clearance of <italic>PA</italic> intracellular burden. The addition of the UK5099 inhibitor strongly enhanced the bacterial intracellular burden in Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> infected macrophages compared to the non-inhibited cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). UK5099 had no effect on the PA14 burden in macrophages. Conversely, exogenously added ATP to macrophages infected with PA14 strongly reduced the <italic>PA</italic> intracellular burden (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that 2-AA tolerization decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α by hypo-acetylating the core histone 3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18ac) mark at TNF-α promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], we investigated the link between bioenergetics and TNF-α expression in infected macrophages. UK5099, or ATP was added exogenously to infected macrophages with PA14 or Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, PA14 infected cells showed lower TNF-α transcript levels compared to the Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> infected cells. Supplementation of 2-AA to Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> infected cells led to a decrease in the TNF-α transcript levels. Moreover, the addition of the MPC1 inhibitor, UK5099 in Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> infected counteracted the increase in TNF-α transcript levels, while had no effect in PA14 infected macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The <italic>PA</italic> signaling molecule 2-AA that is abundantly produced and secreted in human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] is the first QS molecule that epigenetically reprograms immune functions, promotes immune tolerance, and sustains <italic>PA’s</italic> presence in host tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The present study provides insights into the mechanistic actions of 2-AA on cellular metabolism that contribute to host immune tolerance to <italic>PA</italic> persistence. We uncover that this signaling molecule causes distinct metabolic alterations in macrophages’ mitochondrial respiration and energy production promoted via the PGC-1α/ERRα axis and MPC1-dependent OXPHOS that links the TCA cycle to the production of ATP and energy homeostasis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Our results show that 2-AA tolerization decreases ATP the crucial energy metabolite and the histone acetylation metabolite acetyl-CoA and <italic>in vivo</italic>, implicating the importance of the key energy-producing mitochondrial process in immune tolerance. Although macrophages respond to the first exposure to 2-AA by enhancing ATP and acetyl-CoA production, long-term exposure to 2-AA leads to a tolerized state characterized by sustained reduced ATP and acetyl-CoA concentrations, a quiescent bioenergetic state with reduced mitochondrial pyruvate uptake and unresponsiveness to a 2<sup>nd</sup> exposure.</p>

<caption><title>Proposed mechanism by which 2-AA impairs bioenergetics through the inhibition of MPC1-mediated pyruvate transport into mitochondria and its impact on the PGC-1α/ERRα axis.</title>
<p>2-AA tolerized macrophages exhibit diminished pyruvate levels in mitochondria due to the decreased expression of <italic>MPC1</italic>, a consequence of the 2-AA impact on the interaction of ERRα with the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α for the effective transcription of ERRα, since ERRα controls its own transcription and that of MPC1. In the presence of 2-AA, the weakened interaction between ERRα and PGC-1α results in reduced expression of MPC1 and ERRα. The reduction in mitochondrial pyruvate levels leads to decreased acetyl-CoA and ATP levels, which modulate HDAC1-and HAT-catalyzed remodeling of H3K18 acetylation. The diminished levels of this epigenetic mark have previously been associated with an increased intracellular presence of bacteria in macrophages, as demonstrated by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].

<p>Our results reveal that the decrease of ATP and acetyl-CoA in tolerized macrophages results from the 2-AA-mediated perturbation of the physical interaction between ERRα and PGC-1α. The PGC-1α/ERRα axis has not previously been implicated in tolerization but has been extensively studied in cancer, underscoring the novelty of our findings. Studies in cancer cells have shown that the physical interaction of human ERRα with PGC-1α strongly enhances the binding of ERRα to DNA to induce the activation of the targeted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] including <italic>MPC1,</italic> responsible for the import of cytosolic pyruvate into mitochondria and PDH, that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in mitochondria. Inhibition of ERRα has been shown in cancer cell metabolism studies to interfere with pyruvate entry in mitochondria by inhibiting the expression of MPC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Indeed, we find that the transcription of <italic>ERRα</italic> and <italic>MPC1</italic> genes and pyruvate uptake into mitochondria is reduced in tolerized macrophages. Given that pyruvate is a primary carbon source in the TCA cycle that fuels OXPHOS and the production of ATP into mitochondria, it explains the reduced ATP and acetyl-CoA levels observed in tolerized macrophages. Future studies will focus on unveiling the pathways by which macrophages respond to the bioenergetic changes identified and decipher their effect on the pyruvate cycle in host tolerance to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>].</p>
<p>We show that the unprecedented action of a QS bacterial small signaling molecule on the interaction between ERRα and PGC-1α in the nucleus is hampered. Although it remains to be elucidated whether 2-AA interferes directly or indirectly with the PGC-1α/ERRα axis, our data bring up the possibility that the reduced production of acetyl-CoA may be responsible, since cholesterol is a known coactivator/ligand of ERRα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], is generated from acetyl-CoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. This possibility may also explain the reduced expression of <italic>ERRα</italic> and its lower abundance since cholesterol is also required for its activation and autoregulation. However, it is also possible that 2-AA may antagonize the interaction between ERRα and PGC-1α by binding to ERRα. Small molecules as antagonist of ERRα have been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. The weaker binding of ERRα to the <italic>MPC1</italic> promoter site, and consequently reduced MPC1 expression explains the reduced pyruvate presence in mitochondria and that of ATP and mitochondrial quiescence.</p>
<p>The observed cellular metabolic perturbances also align with our previous studies in skeletal muscle, which pointed to mitochondrial dysfunction triggered by 2-AA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Interestingly, the <italic>PA</italic> QS LasR-regulated homoserine lactone molecule, 3-oxo-C12-HSL, was reported to attenuate the expression of PGC-1α and decrease the mitochondrial respiratory capacity in lung epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Moreover, another <italic>PA</italic> QS molecule PQS also regulated by LasR was recently shown to induce organelle stress, including mitochondria, by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential in human macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. As opposed to 2-AA, which dampens the pro-inflammatory response, PQS increases proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>], consistent with the fact that PQS is an acute infection type molecule unrelated to chronic/persistent infections.</p>
<p>Previously, we reported that 2-AA tolerization induces HDAC1 expression and activity, reducing H3K18ac at the TNF-α promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The findings with TNF-α transcription using UK5099 and ATP in 2-AA treated macrophages are in support of the bioenergetics disturbances observed in macrophages and their link to epigenetic modifications we have shown to be promoted by 2-AA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Macrophages exposed to 2-AA in the presence of exogenous ATP showed improved intracellular bacterial clearance and enhanced TNF-α levels, supporting the epigenetic interconnection of macrophages and cellular ATP responsiveness levels against infection. The exogenous addition of UK5099 that reverted the efficiency of the <italic>mvfR</italic> infected macrophages to clear the <italic>PA</italic> intracellular burden and the counteraction to the 2-AA effect by ATP addition that increases the clearance of <italic>PA</italic> intracellular burden support the importance of this energy-carrying molecule in <italic>PA</italic> persistence.</p>
<p>The results with the MPC1 inhibitor, UK5099, suggest that the availability of pyruvate could underlie the mechanism of 2-AA-regulated HDAC/HAT-dependent control of transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators and bacterial clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. These results align with our previous findings, showing that establishing bacterial intracellular burden in macrophages is HDAC1 dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. It remains to be elucidated if HDAC/HAT-mediated histone modification directly regulates expression of OXPHOS genes in 2-AA tolerized macrophages as it was shown that histone deacetylation downregulates OXPHOS in persistent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. Given the complexity of 2-AA-mediated long-term effects, future omics studies combined with immune profiling may aid in deciphering the possible network of co-factors across different subpopulations of immune cells and the immunometabolic reprogramming related to 2-AA.</p>
<p>We have shown that although 2-AA tolerization leads to a remarkable increase in the survival rate of infected mice, it permits an HDAC1-dependent sustained presence of <italic>PA</italic> in mice tissues and intracellularly in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Here, we use 2-AA-producing and isogenic non-producing <italic>PA</italic> strains to confirm the 2-AA-mediated decrease in the central metabolite acetyl-CoA and the energy-carrying molecule ATP during infection. These murine infection studies provide strong evidence of the 2-AA biological relevance in reducing these metabolites <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taking together our previous and current <italic>in vivo</italic> findings provide compelling evidence that the metabolic alterations identified favor <italic>PA</italic> persistence in infected tissues.</p>
<p>That 2-AA permits <italic>PA</italic> to persist in infected tissues despite rescuing the survival of infected mice underscores its difference from that of LPS tolerization, which results in bacterial clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] <italic>via</italic> the mechanism that relies on a set of different HDAC enzymes. LPS tolerization predominantly involves changes in H3K27 acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>], while 2-AA tolerization involves H3K18 modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. The 2-AA-mediated effects reported here are also distinct from the epigenetic-metabolic reprogramming mediated by LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], which promotes endotoxin tolerance in immune cells by upregulating glycolysis and suppressing OXPHOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Although 2-AA and LPS implicate different components and lead to different outcomes both involve epigenetic mechanisms and immune memory.</p>
<p>Metabolic reprogramming upon infection may be pathogen-specific, with each pathogen impacting specific metabolic pathways that better fit its respective metabolic needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. This was shown for infections of various tissues with <italic>Chlamydia pneumonia</italic>, <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, and <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>] and, by our group, for <italic>PA</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. It would be interesting, however, to test whether 2-AA affects the killing efficacy of macrophages against other pathogens, as emerging evidence shows that synergistic or antagonistic interactions between clinically relevant microorganisms and host have important implications for polymicrobial infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>].</p>
<p>While in this study, we focused on the role of ERRα mainly in pyruvate metabolism, future studies are needed to reveal other ERRα/PGC-1α axis-dependent metabolic and immune pathways are modulated by 2-AA. In this view, the cholesterol synthesis pathway that relies on acetyl-CoA precursor, as cholesterol is a known coactivator/ligand of ERRα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>] and fatty acid catabolism, generating acetyl-CoA, and PGC-1α regulates fatty acid oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>].</p>
<p>This study unveils the unprecedented actions of a QS bacterial molecule in orchestrating cellular metabolic reprogramming in addition to the epigenetic reprogramming reported previously also shown to promote a long-lasting presence of <italic>PA</italic> in the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. That 2-AA cross-tolerized macrophages to LPS corroborates our previous findings on the implication of epigenetic mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] rather than ligand-receptor mediated signaling-based mechanism, and raises the possibility that this QS molecule may confer non-specific cross protection. An aspect we plan to investigate in the future. The reported immunometabolic reprogramming contributes to a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms, biomarkers, and functional significance that may be involved in immune tolerance to persistent infection, providing for designing and developing innovative therapeutics and interventions. These approaches can focus on promoting host resilience against bacterial burden and safeguarding patients from recalcitrant persistent infections.</p>

<title>Conditions used for the exposures of the cells to 2-AA</title>
<p>Mouse BMDM cells were isolated from femur of CD1 6 weeks old male and female mice and used to estimate the levels of various metabolites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) following exposure and re-exposure to 2-AA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The 1<sup>st</sup> exposure of naïve BMDMs (10<sup>6</sup>/mL in 6-well plates) was achieved with 400 µM 2-AA for 1, 6, or 48 h. Cells exposed for 48 h were used for the 2<sup>nd</sup> 2-AA exposure. These cells were washed to remove residual 2-AA, left in the medium in the absence of 2-AA for either 24 or 106 h, and re-exposed to 2-AA (200 µM) for 1 or 6 h, respectively. For RAW 264.7 (10<sup>6</sup>/mL in 6-well plates) and THP-1 cells (10<sup>6</sup>/mL in 6-well plates) the 2-AA concentration and conditions used were as with BMDM cells. The hours of the 1<sup>st</sup> round and 2<sup>nd</sup> round of exposure to 2-AA are indicated in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>.</p>
<p>For the LPS stimulation studies, cells were stimulated with 400 µM 2-AA or 100 ng/mL LPS for 6 h, and 800 µM of 2-AA for 48 h. Cells receiving 1<sup>st</sup> exposure for 48 h were washed and re-exposed to 400 µM of 2-AA or 100 ng/mL LPS for 6 h.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study demonstrates that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa-derived quorum sensing signal, 2-aminoacetophenone, induces immune tolerization in macrophages by perturbing metabolism, particularly in the context of mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics. The authors present <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for 2-aminoacetophenone-mediated reduction of pyruvate transport into mitochondria, with downstream effects that result in reduced ATP production in tolerized macrophages. The work will be of interest to those studying host-pathogen interactions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Their findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying 2-AA-mediated reduction of pyruvate transport into mitochondria, which impairs the interaction between ERRα and PGC1α, consequently suppressing MPC1 expression and reducing ATP production in tolerized macrophages. While the data presented is intriguing and the paper is well-written, there are several points that warrant consideration. The authors should enhance the clarity, relevance, and impact of their study.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper presents a novel discovery regarding the mechanisms through which PA regulates the bioenergetics of tolerized macrophages.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The relevance of the in vivo model to support the conclusions is questionable. Further clarification is needed on this point.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study tries to connect energy metabolism with immune tolerance during bacterial infection. The mechanism details the role of pyruvate transporter expression via ERRalpha-PGC1 axis, resulting in pro-inflammatory TNF alpha signalling responsible for acquired infection tolerance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the study is an excellent addition to the role of energy metabolism during bacterial infection. The mechanism-based approach in dissecting the roles of metabolic coactivator, transcription factor, mitochondrial transporter, and pro-inflammatory cytokine during acquired tolerance towards infections indicates a detailed and well-written study. The in vivo studies in mice nicely corroborate with the cell line-based data, indicating the requirement for further studies in human infections with another bacterial model system.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have involved various mechanisms to justify their findings. However, they have missed out on certain aspects which connect the mechanism throughout the paper. For example, they measured ATP and acetyl COA production linked with bacterial re-exposures and added various targets like MCP1, EER alpha, PGC1 alpha and TNF alpha. However, they skipped PGC1 alpha levels, ATP and acetyl COA in various parts of the paper. Including the details would make the work more comprehensive.</p>
<p>The use of public data sets to support their claim on immune tolerance is missing. Including various data sets of similar studies will strengthen the findings independently.</p>
