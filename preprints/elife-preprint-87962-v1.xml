<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Pain is a private experience observable through various verbal and non-verbal behavioural manifestations. Despite the importance of understanding the cerebral mechanisms underlying those manifestations, there is currently limited knowledge on the neural correlates of facial expression of pain. Here, we applied a brain decoding approach to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to predict the facial expression of pain during noxious heat stimulation in healthy volunteers. Results revealed the inability of previously developed pain neurosignatures to predict the facial expression of pain. We thus propose a Facial Expression of Pain Signature (FEPS) conveying distinctive information about the brain response to nociceptive stimulations with minimal overlap with other pain-relevant brain signatures. The FEPS provides a better characterization of the distributed cerebral representations of non-verbal pain communication. This underscores the complexity of pain phenomenology by reinforcing the view that neurosignatures conceived as biomarkers must be interpreted in relation to the specific pain manifestation predicted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Theories of pain communication highlight the diversity in pain manifestations, which occur through multiple channels: verbal reports, vocal complaints, change of postures, and facial expressions. From an evolutionary perspective, several manifestations of pain appear to be preserved across vertebrate phyla and reflect various functional roles to preserve the integrity of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Sneddon 2019</xref>). Withdrawal behaviour allows the individual to move away from the noxious source, while facial expressions in social species convey information about the presence of a potential threat and an appeal for assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hadjistavropoulos et al. 2011</xref>). Functionally distinct manifestations imply at least partly segregated neurophysiological processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Sliwa et al. 2022</xref>). Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating the neural correlates of acute pain have suggested that spontaneous or induced fluctuations in pain facial expression partly reflect changes in activity within the cortical targets of the spino-thalamo-cortical pathways. These fluctuations are, however, independent from changes in stimulus intensity and are inversely related to activity in prefrontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kunz et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Vachon-Presseau et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kunz, Chen, and Rainville 2020</xref>). This suggests that pain facial expression may reflect the integration of activity across distributed brain networks processing ascending nociceptive signals, determining action policy, and gating efferent facial motor outputs.</p>
<p>The interest in developing pain neuromarkers has led researchers to use multivariate pattern analysis to investigate the distributed brain mechanisms underlying the experience of pain evoked by acute nociceptive stimuli. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed not one but several brain signatures of acute experimental pain that may reflect the diversity and complexity of pain-related function. The Neurological Pain Signature (NPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wager et al. 2013</xref>) was developed to predict changes in pain induced by variations in stimulus intensity and captured by subjective reports, reflecting primarily the cerebral contributions to acute nociceptive pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Krishnan et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Van Oudenhove et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wager et al. 2013</xref>). To account for spontaneous fluctuations in the perception of pain intensity, the Stimulus-Independent Intensity of Pain Signature (SIIPS-1) was trained on noxious thermal trials after removing the effects of the stimulus intensity and the NPS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Woo et al. 2017</xref>). More recently, the affective dimension of pain has received more attention, resulting in a multivariate pattern predictive of negative affect ratings to thermal pain, referred here as the Thermal Pain Aversive Signature (TPAS; <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Čeko et al. 2022</xref>). Finally, a signature was elaborated to characterise the neuronal representations associated with the valuation of pain (PVP) in the context of a decision task involving a cost-benefit analysis of future pain against a monetary reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Coll et al. 2022</xref>). Taken together, those signatures have contributed to improve our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of pain, as reflected in self-report or explicit decision making.</p>
<p>Facial expression has been used as a reliable behavioural measure of pain across different mammal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Costa et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Craig 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Evangelista et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Langford et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Sotocina et al. 2011</xref>), but few studies have investigated the brain mechanisms associated with the spontaneous non-verbal communication of pain in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kunz et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kunz, Chen, and Rainville 2020</xref>). As an automatic behavioral manifestation, pain facial expression might be an indicator of activity in nociceptive systems, perceptual and evaluative processes, or general negative affect. We assessed the association between pain facial expression and the available pain-relevant brain signatures and we applied multivariate analysis with machine learning techniques to develop a predictive brain activation model of the facial responses to pain.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The Facial Action Coding System (FACS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ekman and Friesen 1978</xref>) was used to quantify the facial expression of pain in healthy participants while brain responses evoked by brief moderately painful heat stimulation were recorded using fMRI. For each trial, the intensity and the frequency of pain-related action units were scored and combined into a FACS composite score (Methods). The association with the NPS, the SIIPS-1, the PVP, and the TPAS was assessed across the whole brain using the correlation between the FACS scores and the dot product computed between each signature and the activation maps for each individual trial.</p>
<p>Pain facial expression was not significantly associated with NPS expression (<italic>pearson-r</italic> = .01; <italic>p</italic> = .86), TPAS expression (<italic>pearson-r</italic> = -.03; <italic>p</italic> = .55), or PVP expression (<italic>pearson-r</italic> = .08; <italic>p</italic> = .07). Low but significant positive correlation was found with the SIIPS-1 expression (<italic>pearson-r</italic> = .10; <italic>p</italic> = .03). These low values indicate that the available pain-relevant brain signatures show poor sensitivity to the facial expression of pain. This motivated the development of a new multivariate brain pattern to predict pain expression.</p>
<p>We used a multivariate approach at the voxel level across the whole brain to develop the FEPS (Methods). A LASSO principal component regression was applied to predict the FACS composite scores from the trial-by-trial fMRI contrast images. The FEPS was able to predict the FACS composite scores with a performance significantly above chance level (averaged cross-validated prediction across 10 folds: <italic>pearson-r</italic> = .49 ± .11; R<sup>2</sup> = .17 ± .08; RMSE = 6.54 ± 0.99; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 compared to a permuted distribution; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>). These results indicate that we were able to develop a multivariate brain pattern accounting for the facial responses related to pain.</p>

</fig>
<p>The distributed pattern of activity predicting pain expression was projected back on the brain to examine the spatial distribution of higher weights contributing to the prediction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Positive weight clusters were found in the primary motor cortex (M1; bilateral), the frontal pole, the right posterior parietal cortex, the aMCC and the dorsal part of the parietal operculum, adjacent to the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). These regions are respectively associated with motor control, reward and affective value, attentional processes, and nociceptive pain processing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Price 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Rushworth et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Shackman et al. 2011</xref>). Notably, separate analysis indicated that M1 activity was not sufficient to achieve significant prediction of facial responses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1S</xref>). Regions showing negative weights included the dorso-lateral PFC (dlPFC), the ventro-lateral PFC (vlPFC), the mid cingulate cortex (MCC), the subgenual ACC, the ventral part of the parietal operculum, the precuneus, and the vmPFC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>). Negative weights imply that increased activity in those regions is associated with decreased facial response, consistent with a role in the inhibition of pain expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kunz et al. 2011</xref>). These results are consistent with the distributed nature of brain activity associated with pain facial expression reflecting in part the ascending nociceptive response and the ensuing affective processes, as well as top-down socio-affective regulation underlying the implementation of learned display rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Karmann et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Several regions identified in the FEPS have also been reported in other pain-related brain signatures. Regions predictive of pain facial expression and pain intensity (NPS and SIIPS-1) include S2, the vmPFC, and the precuneus. The vlPFC is a region that does not receive direct spino-thalamo-cortical nociceptive afferents, and was reported both in the FEPS and in the SIIPS-1. Overlap between the FEPS and the PVP (Pain Value Pattern) include regions associated with reward and affect (i.e. OFC). Finally, the primary motor cortex, and S2 were also reported as contributing regions in the TPAS. The weak positive association between both the SIIPS-1 and the facial expression in addition with the spatial comparison showing some common regions across these pain-relevant signatures suggest possible shared features with the FEPS.</p>
<p>We computed the cosine similarity between the FEPS and other pain-related brain signatures to further examine the shared and specific representations between those predictive patterns (Methods). Cosine similarity ranging from -.03 to .09 was found between the FEPS and the other pain-related brain signatures reflecting the overall low similarity between the signatures at the whole-brain level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Highest similarity values with the FEPS were found for the SIIPS-1 and the PVP, consistent with the notion that the facial expression of pain may reflect at least partly changes in brain responses associated with spontaneous fluctuations in pain experience captured by pain ratings and with the assessment of pain value. Similarity with the FEPS was further assessed across different cortical networks. The significant positive similarity with the SIIPS-1 at the frontoparietal level may suggest common mechanisms in prediction and emotional regulation of the pain experience that would be reflected in both facial expression and subjective reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Pan et al. 2018</xref>). Recruitment of the frontoparietal network may also be involved in the conscious representation of the pain context, making nociceptive information available for integration into decision-making processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Coll et al. 2022</xref>; <xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Bastuji et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cul, Baillet, and Dehaene 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Zheng et al. 2020</xref>). Finally, the convergent similarities in the limbic network with the PVP, and the TPAS, is consistent with a key role of affective pain processing influencing facial expression, perceived pain value, and reported unpleasantness or aversiveness of pain (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Čeko et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Garcia-Larrea and Peyron 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Roy et al. 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>In research and clinical practice, verbal reports of perceived pain intensity are considered to be the gold standard for measuring pain. Other measures that are often weakly correlated with those subjective reports, like facial expressions of pain, are often considered a less valid metric of the experience of pain even though they provide important complementary information on pain-related processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hadjistavropoulos et al. 2011</xref>). The Facial Expression of Pain Signature (FEPS) was able to predict the magnitude of the facial expression of pain. Regions that contribute to the prediction include motor and pain-related areas associated with both sensory and affective processing of pain. Although it shares, to some extent, similar representations with other pain-relevant signatures within various cerebral networks, the FEPS is distinctive from these other signatures. Results of this study provide unique evidence of the complementary information provided by facial expression on pain-related brain processes. Future studies must provide a more comprehensive account of diverse pain manifestations and their related function to better capture the pain phenomenon in its entirety.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Secondary analyses of brain imaging data acquired in 34 participants were performed in this study (18 women, 16 men; age mean±SD = 23.4±2.5 years)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kunz et al. 2011</xref>). No participants reported having a history of neurological or psychiatric disease, nor chronic pain. Participants reported not using alcohol nor analgesic for at least 24h before the experimental session. All participants provided written informed consent and received monetary compensation for their participation. The information about the video recording of the face was indicated in the consent form but this was not emphasized and it was not mentioned at the time of data acquisition. All procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the Centre de recherche de l’institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<sec id="s3b1">
<title>Pre-experimental session</title>
<p>Participants were submitted to a pre-experimental session to assess the range of thermal pain sensitivity using a magnitude estimation procedure. All participants included in this study had a normal range of thermal pain sensitivity. The degree of facial expressiveness was also evaluated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b2">
<title>Thermal stimuli</title>
<p>Thermal stimulations were induced using a Medoc TSA-2001 thermosensory stimulator with a MRI-compatible 3 × 3 cm<sup>2</sup> contact probe (Medoc), positioned at the level of the lower left leg. Thermal stimuli lasted 9 seconds (2s ramp up, 5s plateau at targeted temperature, 2s <italic>ramp down</italic>) and were followed by an interstimulus interval of 18-25 seconds. The experiment was programmed using E-prime software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). A baseline temperature of 38°C was applied between stimuli for all participants. The target temperatures were determined individually before the MRI scans to induce a warm non-painful sensation in the control condition, and a moderate to strong self-reported pain intensity (targeting 75-80/100 on the pain scale; temperature (mean±SD) = 47.8±0.90 °C). Participants were not aware that the warm and painful temperatures remained constant across trials. The order of the control condition and experimental condition was pseudorandomized. There were 8 trials for each experimental condition per run, for a total of 16 trials per condition and a total of 544 pain trials across all participants (34 participants x 16 pain trials). After each stimulus, participants rated the warm or pain sensation by moving a cursor with an MRI-compatible response key on a computerized visual analog scale. Because we were interested in the facial expression of pain, only the painful trials were considered in the analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b3">
<title>Facial expression</title>
<p>The facial expression of the participants was recorded using an MRI-compatible camera (MRC Systems) mounted onto the head coil of the MRI scanner. To be able to quantify facial expressions that occurred during the stimulation, a signal was sent from the stimulator to the sound card to automatically mark the onset of each stimulus on the video recording. Two certified FACS-coders evaluated the video recordings to rate the frequency, and intensity (on a 5-point scale) of pain-related action units (AUs; AU4, AU6-7, AU9-10, and AU43) for each trial (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kunz et al., 2011</xref> for details about the AUs selection). From these scores, a composite score (FACS composite score) was computed by taking the product between the mean AU frequency and mean AU intensity values, reflecting pain expression for each painful trial. The FACS composite scores were then used as the predictive variable. To examine whether the facial expression could be a confounding with the pain reports, we predicted the trial-by-trial FACS composited scores from the pain ratings using a mixed effect model with the participants as a random effect. Pain ratings were only weakly associated to facial responses (R<sup>2</sup><sub>GLMM</sub> = .01; <italic>β</italic> = 0.80±0.25; <italic>t</italic>(518.07) = 3.21; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<p>MRI images were acquired using a 12-channel head coil 3T Siemens TRIO scanner. T1-weighted structural data were collected using a MP-RAGE sequence (TR = 2300ms, TE = 2.91ms, flip angle = 9°, FOV = 256mm, matrix size = 240×256, voxel size = 1×1×1.2mm, 170 whole-brain volumes).

<p>The fMRI data were preprocessed using SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Version 8; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom) on MATLAB 7.4 (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, Massachusetts, United States). Preprocessing steps included a slice-timing correction, a correction for head movements, and co-registration between functional and anatomical images for each participant. Functional images were normalized into the MNI space. A spatial smoothing procedure (6mm FWHM gaussian kernel) and a high pass filter (128s) were also applied.</p>
<p>BOLD signal was modelled using a canonical hemodynamic response function. First level analyses were computed using the GLM to obtain a pain activation map for each trial using SPM8. Additionally, the six movements parameters and averaged signals from the white matter and the cerebrospinal fluid were included as nuisance regressors. Eleven trials were discarded due to excessive movements and a total of 533 activation maps of individual painful trials were used to develop the Facial Expression of Pain Signature (FEPS).</p>

<title>Association between the facial expression of pain and pain-related brain signatures</title>
<p>The dot product between the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wager et al. 2013</xref>), the Stimulus Intensity Independent Pain Signature-1 (SIIPS-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Woo et al. 2017</xref>), the Predictive Value of Pain (PVP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Coll et al. 2022</xref>), the Thermal Pain Aversive Signature (TPAS; <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Čeko et al. 2022</xref>), and the trial-by-trial activation maps was computed to derive a measure of similarity (pattern expression) between the signatures and the maps. These scalar values were then correlated with the FACS composite scores to assess the association between the facial expression of pain and the NPS, the SIIPS-1, the PVP, and the TPAS. Pearson-r correlation coefficients, and p-values are reported.</p>

<title>Multivariate pattern analysis</title>
<p>We applied a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Principal Component Regression (LASSO-PCR) with a 10-fold cross-validation procedure for brain decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Wager et al. 2011</xref>) using scikit-learn implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Pedregosa et al. 2011</xref>). The analyses were performed using the trial-by-trial contrast images as input to the model and the participants as a grouping factor (i.e. data from a given participant could only be either in the training set or the testing set for a given cross-validation fold). This procedure was used to predict FACS composite scores from contrast images. The performance of each regression model was evaluated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (<italic>pearson-r</italic>), coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>), and root mean square error (RMSE). The scikit-learn’s implementation of the coefficient of determination was used, allowing negative values if the model showed worse performance compared to an unfitted model (i.e. a horizontal line). The averaged performance metrics across folds are reported for each analysis. To test if the models performed significantly above chance, permutation tests were computed using 5000 iterations, leading to a p-value corresponding to the probability that the particular metric would be obtained by chance. A bootstrap resampling procedure was also performed to evaluate the stability of the voxel contribution to the model performance. This procedure consists of randomly sampling 5000 times the dataset with replacement. The resulting samples contain the same number of observations as the dataset. The LASSO-PCR procedure as described above is then applied on each sample. Z-scores and p-values are calculated on the overall regression coefficients.</p>
<p>This analysis procedure was first applied at the whole brain level. It was repeated using a spatial mask including only the precentral region bilaterally. This mask was derived from the Oxford-Harvard Cortical Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Caviness et al. 1996</xref>). This secondary analysis was conducted to verify if the pattern of activity within the primary motor cortex (M1) might be sufficient to predict facial expression. This model was not able to predict the FACS composite scores of pain expression and is not discussed further (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A-B</xref>). To ensure that the whole brain model prediction of the facial responses was not confounded with the pain ratings, we predicted the facial composite scores from the FEPS pattern expression scores, and the trial-by-trial pain ratings using a mixed effect model including the participants as a random effect. Variance in the facial composite scores was significantly explained by the FEPS pattern expression scores (<italic>β</italic> = 5.18±0.25; <italic>t</italic>(237.2) = 20.62; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but not by the pain ratings (<italic>β</italic> =0.24±0.20; <italic>t</italic>(484.9) = 1.21; <italic>p</italic> = .23).</p>

<title>Spatial similarity across the FEPS and pain-related brain signatures</title>
<p>Similarity between the FEPS and other pain-related brain signatures was assessed using the cosine similarity computed across all voxels <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="550504v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. This metric was computed on the NPS, the SIIPS-1, the PVP, and the TPAS. To further explore the cortical similarities between the FEPS and other pain-related brain signatures, we also computed the cosine similarity across different cortical networks (i.e. visual, somatomotor, dorsal attention, ventral attention, limbic, frontoparietal, and default mode)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Yeo et al. 2011</xref>). Permutation tests (n = 1000) using generative null models preserving the spatial autocorrelation of a target brain map were used to assess the significance of the similarity between the brain signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Burt et al. 2020</xref>). P-values were calculated from the generated null distributions as the fraction of permuted samples where the absolute cosine similarity was equal or larger than the cosine similarity obtained on the original signatures.</p>

<p>Picard et al. report a novel neural signature of facial expressions of pain. In other words, they provide evidence that a specific set of brain activations, as measured by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), can tell us when someone is expressing pain via a concerted activation of distinctive facial muscles. They demonstrate that this signature provides a better characterization of this pain behaviour when compared with other signatures of pain reported by past research. The Facial Expression of Pain Signature (FEPS) thus enriches this collection and, if further validated, may allow scientists to identify the neural structures subserving important non-verbal pain behaviour. I have, however, some reservations about the strength of the evidence, relating to insufficient characterization of the underlying processes involved.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study relies on a robust machine-learning approach, able to capitalise on the multivariate nature of the fMRI data, an approach pioneered in the field of pain by one of the authors (Dr. Tor Wager). This paper extends Wager's and other colleagues' work attempting to identify specific combinations of brain structures subserving different aspects of the pain experience while examining the extent of similarity/dissimilarity with the other signatures. In doing so, the study provides further methodological insight into fine-grained network characterization that may inspire future work beyond this specific field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The main weakness concerns the lack of a targeted experimental design aimed to dissect the shared variance explained by activations both specific to facial expressions and to pain reports. In particular, I believe that two elements would have significantly increased the robustness of the findings:</p>
<p>1. Control conditions for both the facial expressions and the sensory input. An efficient signature should not be predictive of neutral and emotional facial expressions (e.g., disgust) other than pain expressions, as well as it should not be predictive of sensations originating from innocuous warm stimulation or other unpleasant but non-painful stimulation.</p>
<p>2. Graded intensity of the sensory stimulation: different intensities of the thermal stimulation would have caused a graded facial expression (from neutral to pain) and graded verbal reports (from no pain to strong pain), thus offering a sensitive characterisation of the signal associated with this condition (and the warm control condition).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The objective of this study was to further our understanding of the brain mechanisms associated with facial expressions of pain. To achieve this, participants' facial expressions and brain activity were recorded while they received noxious heat stimulation. The authors then used a decoding approach to predict facial expressions from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. They found a distinctive brain signature for pain facial expressions. This signature had minimal overlap with brain signatures reflecting other components of pain phenomenology, such as signatures reflecting subjective pain intensity or negative effects.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>
The manuscript is clearly written. The authors used a rigorous approach involving multivariate brain decoding to predict the occurrence and intensity of pain facial expressions during noxious heat stimulation. The analyses seem solid and well-conducted. I think that this is an important study of fundamental and clinical relevance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Despite those major strengths, I felt that the authors did not suffciently explain their own interpretation of the significance of the findings. What does it mean, according to them, that the brain signature associated with facial expressions of pain shows a minimal overlap with other pain-related brain signatures?</p>
<p>A few questions also arose during my reading.</p>
<p>Question 1: Is the FEPS really specific to pain expressions? Is it possible that the signature includes a facial expression signal that would be shared with facial expressions of other emotions, especially since it involves socio-affective regulation processes? Perhaps this question should be discussed as a limit of the study?</p>
<p>Question 2: All AUs are combined together in a composite score for the regression. Given that the authors have other work showing that different AUs may be associated with different components of pain (affective vs. sensory), is it possible that combining all AUs together has decreased the correlation with other pain signatures? Or that the FEPS actually reflects multiple independent signatures?</p>
<p>Question 3: Is facial expressivity constant throughout the experiment? Is it possible that the expressivity changes between the beginning and the end of the experiment? For instance, if there is a habituation, or if the participant is less surprised by the pain, or in contrast if they get tired by the end of the experiment and do not inhibit their expression as much as they did at the beginning. If facial expressivity changes, this could perhaps affect the correlation with the pain ratings and/or with the brain signatures; perhaps time (trial number) could be added as one of the variables in the model to address this question.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Picard et al. propose a Facial Expression Pain Signature (FEPS) as a distinctive marker of pain processing in the brain. Specifically, they attempt to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to predict facial expressions associated with painful heat stimulation.</p>
<p>The main strengths of the manuscript are that it is built on an extensive foundation of work from the research group, and that experience can be observed in the analysis of fMRI data and the development of the machine learning model. Additionally, it provides a comparative account of the similarities of the FEPS with other proposed pain signatures. The main weaknesses of the manuscript are the absence of a proper control condition to assess the specificity of the facial pain expressions, a few relevant omissions in the methodology regarding the original analysis of the data and its purpose, and a biased interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>I believe that the authors partially succeed in their aims, as described in the introduction, which are to assess the association between pain facial expression and existing pain-relevant brain signatures, and to develop a predictive brain activation model of the facial responses to painful thermal stimulation. However, I believe that there is a clear difference between those aims and the claim of the title, and that the interpretation of the results needs to be more rigorous.</p>
