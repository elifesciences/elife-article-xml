<title>Abstract</title>
<p>A hallmark of Dengue virus (DENV) pathogenesis is the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement, which is associated with deadly DENV secondary infection, complicates the identification of correlates of protection, and negatively impacts the safety and efficacy of DENV vaccines. ADE is linked to antibodies targeting the fusion loop (FL) motif of the envelope protein, which is completely conserved in mosquito-borne flaviviruses and required for viral entry and fusion. In the current study, we utilized saturation mutagenesis and directed evolution to engineer a functional variant with a mutated FL (D2-FL) which is not neutralized by FL-targeting monoclonal antibodies. The FL mutations were combined with our previously evolved prM cleavage site to create a mature version of D2-FL (D2-FLM), which evades both prM- and FL-Abs but retains sensitivity to other type-specific and quaternary cross-reactive (CR) Abs. CR serum from heterotypic (DENV4) infected non-human primates (NHP) showed lower neutralization titers against D2-FL and D2-FLM than isogenic wildtype DENV2 while similar neutralization titers were observed in serum from homotypic (DENV2) infected NHP. We propose D2-FL and D2-FLM as valuable tools to delineate CR Ab subtypes in serum as well as an exciting platform for safer live attenuated DENV vaccines suitable for naïve individuals and children.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus and is a major global public health threat, with four major serotypes of DENV found worldwide. Dengue causes ∼400 million infections each year, of which ∼20% of cases present clinically, a subset of which may progress to severe Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever/Dengue Shock Syndrome (DHF/DSS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> DENV is transmitted through <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito vectors, and globalization and global warming are increasing the endemic range of Dengue worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> The pathogenesis of Dengue is complex, as first-time infections are rarely severe and lead to serotype-specific immunity. However, re-infection with a different serotype increases the risk of developing DHF/DSS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> This is thought to be due to the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which poorly neutralizing cross-reactive (CR) antibodies (Abs) lead to enhanced viral uptake and infection of unique cell populations in an Fcγ-receptor-mediated manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>ADE remains a major challenge for DENV vaccine development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> The leading DENV vaccine platforms in clinical testing are tetravalent live attenuated virus mixtures of all four serotypes. However, creating formulations that elicit a balanced response has proven challenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Additionally, lab-grown strains differ from patient-derived DENVs in both maturation status and antigenicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> In particular, Abs targeting the fusion loop (FL) have been reported to neutralize lab and patient strains with differing strengths and have been observed to facilitate Fcγ-receptor uptake <italic>in vitro</italic> and therefore ADE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Currently, there is a single FDA-approved DENV vaccine, Dengvaxia. However, it is only approved for use in individuals aged 9-16 with previous DENV infection living in endemic areas and is contraindicated for use in naïve individuals and younger children. In naïve children, vaccination stimulated non-neutralizing CR Abs that increased the risk of severe disease after DENV infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Other DENV vaccines have been tested or are currently undergoing clinical trial, but thus far none have been approved for use in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> The vaccine Qdenga has been approved in the European Union, Indonesia, and Brazil, although vaccine efficacy in adults, naïve individuals, and with all serotypes has not yet been shown.</p>
<p>The DENV FL is located in Envelope (E) protein domain II (EDII) and is involved in monomer-monomer contacts with EDIII.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> During the DENV infection cycle, low pH triggers a conformational change in the E protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> The structure of the virion rearranges, and individual monomers form a trimer with all three FLs in the same orientation, ready to initiate membrane fusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> The core FL motif (DRGWGNGCGLFGK, AA 98-110) is highly conserved, with 100% amino acid conservation in all DENV serotypes and other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including Yellow fever virus (YFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), Kunjin virus (KUNV), Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Usutu virus (USUV), and Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Although the extreme conservation and critical role in entry have led to it being considered extremely difficult to change the FL, we successfully tested the hypothesis that massively parallel directed-evolution could produce viable DENV FL mutants that were still capable of fusion and entry, while altering the antigenic footprint. The FL mutations, in combination with optimized prM cleavage site mutations, ablate neutralization by the prM- and FL-Abs, retain sensitivity to other protective Abs, and provide a novel vaccine strategy for DENV.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To engineer a virus with a novel antigenic footprint at the FL, we targeted the core conserved FL motif. We generated two different saturation mutagenesis libraries, each with 5 randomized amino acids: DRG<bold>X</bold>G<bold>X</bold>G<bold>XXX</bold>FGK (Library 1; AA 101, 103, 105-107) and DRG<bold>XXXXX</bold>GLFGK (Library 2 AA 101-105). Library 1 was designed to mutate known residues targeted by FL mAbs while Library 2 focused on a continuous linear peptide that is the epitope for FL-Abs to maximally alter antigenicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Saturation mutagenesis plasmid libraries were used to produce viral libraries in either C6/36 (<italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito) or Vero 81 (African green monkey) cells and passaged three times in their respective cell types. Following directed evolution, viral genomes were extracted and subjected to deep sequencing to identify surviving and enriched variants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Due to the high level of conservation, it was not surprising that most mutational combinations failed to yield viable progeny. In fact, evolutions carried out on Library 2 only yielded wild-type sequences. For Library 1, wild-type sequences dominated in Vero 81 evolved libraries. However, a novel variant emerged in C6/36 cells with two amino acid changes: DRGWG<bold><underline>S</underline></bold>GC<bold><underline>L</underline></bold>LFGK. The major variant comprised ∼95% of the population, while the next most populous variant (DRGWG<bold><underline>S</underline></bold>GC<bold><underline>W</underline></bold>LFGK) comprised only 0.25% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Bulk Sanger sequencing revealed an additional Env-T171A mutation outside of the FL region. Residues W101, C105, and L107 were preserved in our final sequence, supporting the importance of these residues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> When modeled on the pre-fusion DENV2 structure, the N103S and G106L mutations are located at the interface with the neighboring monomer EDIII domain, protected from the aqueous environment. In the post-fusion form, the two residues are located between W101 and F108 and form the bowl concavity above the chlorine ion in the post-fusion trimer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We used reverse genetics to re-derive the FL N103S/G106L/T171A mutant, which we term D2-FL. As enhancing Abs also target prM,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> we also created a mature version of D2-FL termed D2-FLM, containing both the evolved FL motif and our previously published evolved prM furin cleavage site, which results in a more mature virion like those found in infected patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>We performed growth curves comparing DENV2, D2-FL, and D2-FLM in both C6/36 and Vero 81 cells. In C6/36 cells, the growth of all three viruses was comparable, reaching high titers of 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>-10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> FFU/mL. However, in Vero 81 cells, both FL mutant viruses were highly attenuated, with a 2-2.5 log reduction in titer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The species-specific phenotype in culture involved a change from insect to mammalian cells, as well as a change in growth temperature. To investigate if the mutant viruses were more unstable at higher temperatures, we performed a thermostability assay, comparing viruses incubated at temperatures ranging from 4-55°C before infection. The three viruses had comparable thermostabilities, indicating that this does not explain the attenuation of the FL mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Because the D2-FLM virus contains mutations that increase prM cleavage frequency, we also assayed the maturation status of the three viruses by western blot. D2-FL had a comparable prM:E ratio to the isogenic wildtype DENV2 (DV2-WT), while, as expected, D2-FLM had a reduced prM:E ratio, indicating a higher degree of maturation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we characterized the ability of Abs targeting the FL to recognize DV2-WT, D2-FL, and D2-FLM with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Importantly, D2-FL and D2-FLM were resistant to mAbs targeting the FL. Neutralization by 1M7 is reduced by ∼2-logs in both variants, 1N5 neutralization is reduced by ∼1-log for D2-FL and reduced to background levels for D2-FL, and no neutralization was observed for 1L6 or 4G2 for either variant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Focusing on the D2-FLM virus containing both evolved motifs, we then characterized the antigenicity of the whole virion with a panel of mAbs. As expected, D2-FLM was unable to be neutralized by the prM Abs 1E16 and 5M22; the Ab 2H2 does not neutralize either DV2-WT or D2-FLM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). For Abs targeting epitopes in non-mutated regions, including the ED1 and EDE epitopes that target EDII and EDIII, FRNT<sub>50</sub> values were generally comparable, although EDE1-C10 shows a moderate but statistically significant reduction between DV2-WT and D2-FLM, indicating that the overall virion structural integrity was intact (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we analyzed neutralization of the D2-FLM virus using serum derived from convalescent humans and experimental infected non-human primates (NHPs). Overall, we tested serum from 6 humans and 9 NHPs at different time points with a total of 27 samples. Serum from a homotypic infected NHP (n=3) did not display a difference in neutralization between DV2-WT, D2-FL, and D2-FLM, confirming that prM and FL epitopes are not significant contributors to the homotypic type-specific (TS) neutralizing Ab response in primates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In heterotypic vaccination and infection, most of the serum (18/24) did not cross-neutralize (FRNT<sub>50</sub> &lt; 1:40) DV2-WT, confirming the serotypic difference of DENVs (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, in two NHPs infected with DENV4, strong neutralization potency (FRNT<sub>50</sub> between 1: 100 – 1:1,000) was demonstrated against DV2-WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Heterologous cross-neutralization was significantly reduced to background levels (FRNT<sub>50</sub> &lt; 1:40) against the D2-FLM virus at 90 days post-infection (dpi). Of note, one DENV4 animal (3Z6) showed low levels of neutralization against D2-FLM at early time points (20- and 60-days post-infection), which was eventually lost at later time points. Neutralization observed against D2-FL, in general, fell between DV2-WT and D2-FLM. Interestingly, in animal 3Z6, at 20 dpi, neutralization against DENV-FL was comparable to DV2-WT, while D2-FLM was greatly reduced, indicating that antibodies in the sera targeting the immature virion formed a large portion of the CR response. In contrast, animal 0Y0 displayed less difference in neutralization between D2-FL and D2-FLM, suggesting that FL antibodies were more prominent in this animal. These data suggest that after a single infection, much of the CR Ab responses target prM and the FL and tend to wane over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The collection of FL, mature, and FL-mature variants provides new opportunity to delineate antibody composition in complex polyclonal serum from DENV natural infection and vaccination.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mechanistic understanding of vaccine protection and identification of correlates of protection are immensely important for DENV vaccine development. The dual protective and enhancing properties of DENV Abs create major challenges for dissecting the role of various Ab populations in disease protection. Cross-reactive weakly neutralizing prM- and FL-Abs are often immunodominant after primary DENV infection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and can lead to overestimation of the levels of heterotypic protection in traditional neutralization assays. Since these same antibodies are also associated with ADE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> inaccurate conclusions could have dire consequences if protection <italic>in vitro</italic> translates to the enhancement of disease in human vaccinees. Unfortunately, Ab profiling in polyclonal serum is mainly performed by ELISA, and a neutralization assay that can discriminate Abs does not exist. The D2-FLM variant is not neutralized by FL- and prM-mAbs and appears insensitive to neutralization by these Abs in polyclonal serum. Of note, EDE1-C10 neutralization potency was also reduced in our FL-M variant, further indicating our mutations are affecting the tip of the EDII region which partially overlaps with the EDE1 epitope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In combination with other chimeric DENVs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> D2-FLM provides a reagent to distinguish between TS, protective CR (e.g. E dimer epitope, EDE),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and ADE-prone CR (e.g. FL and prM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> Ab subclasses in neutralization assays after infection and vaccination.</p>
<p>Due to the ADE properties of DENV Abs, studies to understand and eliminate ADE phenotype are under active investigation. For example, mAbs can be engineered to eliminate binding to the Fcγ receptor, abolishing ADE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> While this methodology holds potential for Ab therapeutic development and passive immunization strategies, it is not relevant for vaccination. As FL and prM targeting Abs are the major species demonstrated to cause ADE <italic>in vitro</italic> and are thought to be responsible for ADE-driven negative outcomes after primary infection and vaccination,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> we propose that genetic ablation of the FL and prM epitopes in vaccine strains will minimize the production of these subclasses of Abs responsible for undesirable vaccine responses. Indeed, efforts have been made to reduce the availability of the FL or reduce the ability of FL Abs to drive ADE. Covalently locked E-dimers and E-dimers with FL mutations have been engineered as subunit vaccines that reduce the availability of the FL, thereby reducing the production of FL Abs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> DENV subunit vaccines are an area of active study;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> however, monomer/dimer subunits can also expose additional, interior-facing epitopes not normally exposed to the cell. Furthermore, dimer subunits are not a complete representation of the DENV virion which presents other structurally important interfaces such as the 3-fold and 5-fold symmetries. Concerns about balanced immunity to all four serotypes also apply to subunit vaccine platforms. Given the complexity of the immune response to DENV, live virus vaccine platforms have thus far been more successful. However, the fusion loop is strongly mutationally intolerant. Previous reported mutations in the fusion loop of mosquito-borne flaviviruses include a L107F mutation in WNV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and JEV associated with attenuation, and mutations at position 106 in ZIKV(G106A) and DENV(G106V) which were tolerated. Interestingly, we also recovered a mutation in position 106 (G106L) Using directed-evolution, we successfully generated our D2-FLM variant that combines viability with the desired Ab responses. Therefore, the D2-FLM variant is a novel candidate for a vaccine strain which presents all the native structures and complex symmetries of DENV necessary for T-cell mediated responses and which can elicit more optimal protective Ab responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other considerations of high importance when designing a live DENV vaccine include strain selection and serotype balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> In the current study we used DENV2 S16803, a prototype for DENV2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> However, S16803 was isolated several decades ago, and it may be beneficial to utilize more contemporaneous strains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> Work is currently ongoing to demonstrate the portability of the evolved FL motif on additional DENV2 strains and other serotypes, which is essential for tetravalent vaccine production. D2-FLM was highly attenuated in Vero cells, creating a challenge for vaccine production. Therefore, further adaptation of this strain to grow efficiently in mammalian cells while retaining its antigenic properties is needed. Taken together, the FLM variant holds exciting new possibilities for a new generation of DENV vaccines, as well as a platform to readily measure TS and CR ADE-type responses and thereby assess the true protective potential of any DENV vaccine trials and safeguard approval of DENV vaccines for human use.</p>

<title>High-throughput Sequencing and Analysis</title>
<p>Viral RNA was isolated with a QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen), and cDNA produced using the Superscript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Amplicons were prepared for sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq system with two rounds of PCR using Q5 Hot Start DNA polymerase (NEB). For the first round of PCR, primers were specific to the DENV2 E sequence surrounding the fusion loop motif with overhangs for the Illumina adapters. After purification, this product was used as the template for the second round of PCR using Illumina P5 and P7 primers containing 8-nucleotide indexes. Purified PCR products were analyzed on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and quantified on a Qubit 4 fluorometer (Invitrogen). Amplicon libraries were run on a MiSeq system with 2×150bp reads. Plasmid and P0 libraries were sequenced at a depth of ∼4.5 million reads; later passages were sequenced at a depth of ∼750,000 reads.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study describes engineered dengue virus variants that can be used to dissect epitope specificities in polyclonal sera, and to design candidate vaccine antigens that dampen antibody responses against undesirable epitopes. While the major claims are supported by <bold>solid</bold> evidence, experiments to distinguish the impact on antibody binding from neutralizing activities would have strengthened the study. This work will be of interest to virologists and structural biologists working on antibody responses to flaviviruses.</p>

<p>Summary of the major findings -</p>
<p>1. The authors used saturation mutagenesis and directed evolution to mutate the highly conserved fusion loop (98 DRGWGNGCGLFGK 110) of the Envelope (E) glycoprotein of Dengue virus (DENV). They created 2 libraries with parallel mutations at amino acids 101, 103, 105-107, and 101-105 respectively. The in vitro transcribed RNA from the two plasmid libraries was electroporated separately into Vero and C6/36 cells and passaged thrice in each of these cells. They successfully recovered a variant N103S/G106L from Library 1 in C6/36 cells, which represented 95% of the sequence population and contained another mutation in E outside the fusion loop (T171A). Library 2 was unsuccessful in either cell type.</p>
<p>2. The fusion loop mutant virus called D2-FL (N103S/G106L) was created through reverse genetics. Another variant called D2-FLM was also created, which in addition to the fusion loop mutations, also contains a previously published, evolved, and optimized prM-furin cleavage sequence that results in a mature version of the virus (with lower prM content). Both D2-FL and D2-FLM viruses grew comparably to wild type virus in mosquito (C6/36) cells but their infectious titers were 2-2.5 log lower than wildtype virus when grown in mammalian (Vero) cells. These viruses were not compromised in thermostability, and the mechanism for attenuation in Vero cells remains unknown.</p>
<p>4. Next, the authors probed the neutralization of these viruses using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against fusion loop and domain I, II and III of E protein, and against prM protein. As intended, neutralization by fusion loop mAbs was reduced or impaired for both D2-FL and D2-FLM, compared to wild type DENV2. D2-FLM virus was equivalent to wild type with respect to neutralization by domain I, II, and III antibodies tested (except domain II-C10 mAb) suggesting an intact global antigenic landscape of the mutant virion. As expected, D2-FLM was also resistant to neutralization by prM mAbs (D2-FL was not tested in this batch of experiments).</p>
<p>5. Finally, the authors evaluated neutralization in the context of polyclonal serum from convalescent humans (n=6) and experimentally infected non-human primates (n=9) at different time points (27 total samples). Homotypic sera (DENV2) neutralized D2-FL, D2-FLM, and wild type DENV similarly, suggesting that the contribution of fusion loop and prM epitopes is insignificant in a serotype-specific neutralization response. However, heterotypic sera (DENV4) neutralized D2-FL and D2-FLM less potently than wild type DENV2, especially at later time points, demonstrating the contribution of fusion loop- and prM-specific antibodies to heterotypic neutralization.</p>
<p>Impact of the study-</p>
<p>1. The engineered D2-FL and D2-FLM viruses are valuable reagents to probe antibodies targeting the fusion loop and prM in the overall polyclonal response to DENV.</p>
<p>2. Though more work is needed, these viruses can facilitate the design of a new generation of DENV vaccine that does not elicit fusion loop- and prM-specific antibodies, which are often poorly neutralizing and lead to antibody-dependent enhancement effect (ADE).</p>
<p>3. This work can be extended to other members of the flavivirus family.</p>
<p>4. A broader impact of their work is a reminder that conserved amino acids may not always be critical for function and therefore should not be immediately dismissed in substitution/mutagenesis/protein design efforts.</p>
<p>Appraisal of the results -</p>
<p>The data largely support the conclusions, but some improvements and extensions can benefit the work.</p>
<p>1. In Figure 3A, the authors concluded that the engineered dengue virus fusion loop mutant viruses are insensitive to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the fusion loop. However, the reduction in neutralization sensitivity varied depending on the mAb tested. The contribution of the optimized prM cleavage site (D2-FLM) to sensitivity to fusion loop mAbs also varied.</p>
<p>a) Are the epitopes known for these mAbs? It would be useful to discuss how the epitope of 1M7 differs from the other mAbs. What are the critical residues?</p>
<p>
d) Maybe the D2-FL mutant can be further evolved with selection pressure with fusion loop mAbs 1M7 +/-1N5 and/or other fusion loop mAbs.</p>
<p>2. It would have been useful to include D2-M for comparison (with evolved furin cleavage sequence but no fusion loop mutations).</p>
<p>3. Data for polyclonal serum can be better discussed. Table 1 is not discussed much in the text.</p>
<p>Suggestions for further experiments-</p>
<p>1. It would be interesting to see the phenotype of single mutants N103S and G106L, relative to double mutant N103S/G106L (D2-FL).</p>
<p>
2. The fusion capability of these viruses can be gauged using liposome fusion assay under different pH conditions and different lipids.</p>
<p>
3. Correlative antibody binding vs neutralization data would be useful.</p>

<p>Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of Dengue is largely driven by cross-reactive antibodies that target the DENV fusion loop or pre-membrane protein. Screening polyclonal sera for antibodies that bind to these cross-reactive epitopes could increase the successful implementation of a safe DENV vaccine that does not lead to ADE. However, there are few reliable tools to rapidly assess the polyclonal sera for epitope targets and ADE potential. Here the authors develop a live viral tool to rapidly screen polyclonal sera for binding to fusion loop and pre-membrane epitopes. The authors performed a deep mutational scan for viable viruses with mutations in the fusion loop (FL). The authors identified two mutations functionally tolerable in insect C6/36 cells, but lead to defective replication in mammalian Vero cells. These mutant viruses, D2-FL and D2-FLM, were tested for epitope presentation with a panel of monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal sera. The D2-FL and D2-FLM viruses were not neutralized by FL-specific monoclonal antibodies demonstrating that the FL epitope has been ablated.</p>
<p>Overall the central conclusion that the engineered viruses can predict epitopes targeted by antibodies is supported by the data and the D2-FL and D2-FLM viruses represent a valuable tool to the DENV research community.</p>

<p>Evaluating this study in the context of prior literature -</p>
<p>The authors write &quot;Although the extreme conservation and critical role in entry have led to it being traditionally considered impossible to change the fusion loop, we successfully tested the hypothesis that massively parallel directed evolution could produce viable DENV fusion-loop mutants that were still capable of fusion and entry, while altering the antigenic footprint.&quot;</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. We have adjusted the text above to better reflect and credit the prior literature. Text is modified as follows in the discussion session.</p>
<p>“Previous reported mutations in the fusion loop are mainly derived from experimental evolution using FL-Ab to select for escape mutant or by deep mutational scanning (DMS) of the Env protein for Ab epitope mapping. Mutations in the FL epitope were observed in a DENV2-NGC-V2 (G106V)39, attenuated JEV vaccine strain SA14-14-2 (L107F)40, attenuated WNV-NY99 (L107F)41. While most of the mutations, including the double mutations reported here lead to attenuation of the virus. A recent DMS study showed that Zika-G106A has no observable impact on viral fitness42. Interestingly, we also recovered a mutation G106L, suggesting position 106 and 107 might be the most tolerable position for mutation in mosquito borne flavivirus FL. On the other hand, tick borne flavivirus as well as vector only flavivirus show a more diverse FL composition. The inflexibility of mosquito borne flavivirus might be due to the evolution constraint of the virus to switch between mosquito and vertebrate hosts.”</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that the L107F mutation has been described in other flaviviruses, including the tick-borne flaviviruses DTV and POWV. This mutation in JEV is associated with viral attenuation. This sentence is referring to the fact that, in our libraries, we did not recover variants with mutations at these positions, in contrast to D2-FL with variants at N103 and G106, indicating less mutational tolerance. However, we want to re-direct the focus of this manuscript to engineer a viable DENV that is antigenically different in the FL epitope, but not which residue is more tolerance for mutation.</p>

<p>1. Figure 2c: The FLM sample in the western blot shows hardly any E protein, making E/prM quantitation unreliable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The samples used in Figure 2C derive from the growth curve endpoint (Figure 2A), in which there is a 1-log difference in viral titer between D2 and D2-FLM. Equivalent volumes of viral supernatant were loaded in the gel, explaining the reduced intensity of the E band in D2-FLM. The higher exposure on the right shows the E band more clearly for D2-FLM. The Western blot assay comparing prM/E ratio as a measure of maturation state was described and validated in our previous study (Tse et al. 2022, mbio).  The methods and figure legend have been updated to include greater detail. The polyclonal E antibody was specifically chosen for this study as our previously used monoclonal antibody targeted the fusion loop. The polyclonal antibody was raised against a fragment of E (AA 1-495) and should have minimal effect by the fusion loop mutations.</p>

<p>b) Do these mAbs cover the full spectrum of fusion loop antibodies identified thus far in the field?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not test every known fusion loop antibody that has been described, instead focusing on 1M7, 1N5, 1L6, and 4G2, which were previously described by Smith et al and Crill et al. We also modified the text in discussion to reflect the possibility of other FL-Ab that are not affected by out mutations.</p>
<p>“We have tested a panel of FL-Ab; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that other FL-Abs may not be affected by N103S and G106L. However, we have shown that saturation mutagenesis could generate mutants with multiple amino acid changes, and we are currently using D2-FLM as backbone to iteratively evolve additional mutations in FL to further deviate the FL antigenic epitope.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c) Are the epitopes known for these mAbs? It would be useful to discuss how the epitope of 1M7 differs from the other mAbs? What are the critical residues?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Critical residues for these antibodies have been described. They are as follows: 1M7: W101R, W101C, G111R; 1N5: W101R, L107P, L107R, G111R; 1L6: G100A, W101A, F108A; 4G2: G104H, G106Q, L107K. The critical residues for 1M7 are slightly different than the others, perhaps explaining the residual binding to D2-FL. Note that the critical residue identified previously for 1M7 and 1N5 do not overlap with D2-FLM mutations, suggesting the FL mutations has extending effect on the antigenic FL epitope.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>d) Maybe the D2-FL mutant can be further evolved with selection pressure with fusion loop mAbs 1M7 +/-1N5 and/or other fusion loop mAbs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that it may be possible to further evolve D2-FL using antibody selection, although we have not yet performed these experiments, we are currently performing iterative saturation mutagenesis and directed evolution to further evolve away from the natural FL.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. It would have been useful to include D2-M for comparison (with evolved furin cleavage sequence but no fusion loop mutations).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Neutralization data for some of the mAbs against D2-M can be found in our previous study (Tse et al. 2022 mBio), in which no difference in neutralization was observed compared to DV2 wildtype. Given the limited resources of the anti-DENV NHP and human serum, we did not add D2-M for comparison. Although some insight can be deduced from the D2-FL vs D2-FLM comparison, we agree future studies that are designed to delineate CR-Ab population between prM, FL and other CR-epitopes should include D2-M for comparison.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Data for polyclonal serum can be better discussed. Table 1 is not discussed much in the text. For the R1160-90dpi-DENV4 sample, D2-FL and D2-FLM are neutralized better than wild type DENV2? The authors' interpretation in lines 181-182 is inconsistent with the data presented in Figure 3C, which suggests that over time, there is INCREASED (not waning) dependence on FL- and prM-specific antibodies for heterotypic neutralization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We remade Table 1 to show dilution factors instead of dilution factor-1 of FRNT50.</p>
<p>In general, our human convalescent sera from heterotypic infection (DENV1, 3 and 4) showed none to low neutralization against our DENV2. FRNT50s were between 1: 40 – 1:200. Given the weak potency of the antiserum, it is difficult to compare the FRNT50s between DV2-WT and D2-FLM.</p>
<p>Similarly, in a different NHP cohort (2nd NHP cohort shown in Table 1), only one DENV4 infected NHP (R1160) showed a low heterotypic titer against DENV2. The detectable FRNT50s were between 1: 50 – 1:90. The value was extrapolated based on a single data point (1:40) which has above 50% neutralization. Given the Hill slope of all the neutralization curves were below 0.5, the FRNT50 values is should not be</p>
<p>In conclusion, we do not think serum from Table 1 is potent enough to shows difference between the viruses. The intension to show the negative data in Table 1 is to highlight the difference in serum heterogeneity in DENV infected patients and experimental infected NHPs.</p>
<p>As the reviewer pointed out, the dependence of FL-Ab in later time points increased (the difference between DV2 and D2-FL at 20dpi vs 60dpi vs 90dpi), suggesting non-FL CR-Ab is waning but not prM- and FL-Abs. We rewrote the sentence as follow:</p>
<p>“These data suggest that after a single infection, many of the CR Ab responses target prM and the FL and the reliance on these Abs for heterotypic neutralization increase  overtime (Figure 3C).”</p>

<p>Suggestions for further experiments-</p>
<p>1. It would be interesting to see the phenotype of single mutants N103S and G106L, relative to double mutant N103S/G106L (D2-FL).</p>
<p>1. The fusion capability of these viruses can be gauged using liposome fusion assay under different pH conditions and different lipids.</p>
<p>1. Correlative antibody binding vs neutralization data would be useful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions; we agree these would be of interest and, indeed, these studies are currently underway. In regard to single mutants, these were present in the initial plasmid library but did not enrich after viral production and passage. Two possible explanations can be drawn, 1) The stochastic of directed evolution prevents a single mutant with similar fitness to enriched. 2) The two mutations are compensatory to each other to make a functional mutant. The 2nd hypothesis highlights the difference between saturation mutagenesis (this study) and DMS (in previous studies).</p>
<p>Fusion capability is indeed very interesting, however, the mechanistic difference or not between wildtype FL and the mutated FL in supporting fusion is not the focus of this study. Instead, we are currently working on adapting the D2-FLM in mammalian cells. If successful, the difference in fusion mechanism between the Vero adapted and D2-FLM in different lipid, insect vs mammalian would be of interest.</p>
<p>We are currently developing whole virus ELISA; we avoid using rE monomer for the study as it might neglect the conformation Ab.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of Dengue is largely driven by cross-reactive antibodies that target the DENV fusion loop or pre-membrane protein. Screening polyclonal sera for antibodies that bind to these cross-reactive epitopes could increase the successful implementation of a safe DENV vaccine that does not lead to ADE. However, there are few reliable tools to rapidly assess the polyclonal sera for epitope targets and ADE potential. Here the authors develop a live viral tool to rapidly screen polyclonal sera for binding to fusion loop and pre-membrane epitopes. The authors performed a deep mutational scan for viable viruses with mutations in the fusion loop (FL). The authors identified two mutations functionally tolerable in insect C6/36 cells, but lead to defective replication in mammalian Vero cells. These mutant viruses, D2-FL and D2-FLM, were tested for epitope presentation with a panel of monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal sera. The D2-FL and D2-FLM viruses were not neutralized by FL-specific monoclonal antibodies demonstrating that the FL epitope has been ablated. However, neutralization data with polyclonal sera is contradictory to the claim that cross-reactive antibody responses targeting the pre-membrane and the FL epitopes wane over time.</p>
<p>Overall, the central conclusion that the engineered viruses can predict epitopes targeted by antibodies is supported by the data and the D2-FL and D2-FLM viruses represent a valuable tool to the DENV research community.</p>

<p>Major Critique:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>There is a disconnect between Fig 2A and 2C. FL and FLM viruses have much lower levels of prM-E expression in the viral supernatants based on the western blot in 2C. Why isn't E being detected in the Western? Is the particle-to-pfu ratio skewed in the mutant viruses? Is it possible that the polyclonal is targeting the cross-reactive prM and FL epitopes, and if so would using a monoclonal antibody targeting a known DIII-epitope (2D22) yield a different western result? Also, the legend and methods for Fig 2C are not clear. What is actually being tested in the Western blot? Were equivalent volumes of the different viral preps used?</p>

<p>o A.) Some of the convalescent data contradicts the hypothesis. DS0275 had an equivalent neut between DV2 and D2-FLM, DS1660, and R1160 (90) had better neut against the D2-FLM than DV2. Discussion of these samples is warranted.</p>

<p>The X-axis is a scatter of all of the sequences contained in the library, similar to graphs used for plotting CRISPR screen results. These represent individual sequences from the saturation mutagenesis libraries in the fusion loop of E as described in Figure 1B.</p>

<p>The wording in Lines 92-94 is not clear. It looks like the T171A mutation was present in 95% of the sequences (Line 92). Yet this sequence was not incorporated into the variant virus. What is the rationale for omitting this mutation in downstream variant virus generation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The 95% in Line 92 refers to the variant containing N103S/G106L mutations as seen in Figure 1C. The high-throughput sequencing approach did not include residue 171, so the presence of the T171A mutation in combination with fusion loop mutations cannot be determined. However, the E171A mutation was included in the infectious clone for D2-FL and D2-FLM. The text has been modified to clarify this inclusion.</p>

<p>The authors discuss the potential of the D2-FL or D2-FLM virus as a potential vaccine platform in the abstract, introduction, and conclusion. This is a good idea, but the authors provide no evidence of feasibility in this manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The ultimate goal to engineer a viable DENV with distinct FL antigenic epitope is for it use as live attenuated vaccine. As this is the rationale for the study, we introduce the concept throughout the manuscript. The current study demonstrated the possibility to mutate a novel fusion loop motif in DENV and provided evidence to show the favorable antigenic properties of D2-FLM. We agree with the reviewer that definitive work in animal to show vaccine efficacy need to be done and are currently undergoing. To avoid misleading our audience, we tone down the emphasis of vaccine use in the text.</p>

<p>These lines reference studies that showed greater enhancement by antibodies targeting the fusion loop and prM as compared to other cross-reacting antibodies. The assumption that both our manuscript and others have drawn was that Abs that are cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing are more prone for ADE. As discussed, other groups have attempted to mutate the FL from recombinant E protein to achieve similar goal to remove the fusion loop epitope to reduce ADE. We have re-written the sentence in the followings:</p>
<p>“As FL and prM targeting Abs are the major species demonstrated to cause ADE in vitro, we and others hypothesized these Abs are responsible for ADE-driven negative outcomes after primary infection and vaccination,10–12,32 we propose that genetic ablation of the FL and prM epitopes in vaccine strains will minimize the production of these subclasses of Abs responsible for undesirable vaccine responses.  Indeed, covalently locked E-dimers and E-dimers with FL mutations have been engineered as potential subunit vaccines that reduce the availability of the FL, thereby reducing the production of FL Abs.33–36”</p>
