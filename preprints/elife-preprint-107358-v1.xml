<title>Abstract</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ cells, piRNAs arise from dual-strand piRNA clusters, which are marked by a repressive histone mark H3K9me3, but are transcribed from internal sites in a manner dependent on the HP1 homolog Rhino. Rhino binds to H3K9me3 on these clusters, yet the mechanism controlling its binding to clusters remains unclear. Here, we used cultured ovarian somatic cells (OSCs), which lack endogenous Rhino and its stabilizer Kipferl, whose absence renders the dual-strand clusters inert, and found that exogenous Rhino tends to bind to the ends of dual-strand clusters with asymmetric dimethylarginine histones (ADMA-histones). Depletion of the arginine methyltransferases responsible for ADMA modifications, such as DART4, affected the genomic localization of Rhino in both OSCs and ovaries. We also identified primitive, cluster-like genomic regions, termed DART4 clusters, where Rhino propagates in an DART4-dependent but unstable manner. Our study proposes that ADMA-histones play a crucial role in the initial genome loading of Rhino and in establishing the sites of its propagation, which are subsequently stabilized to support piRNA production.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are germline-enriched small non-coding RNAs that repress transposons in collaboration with PIWI proteins to maintain fertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ cells, piRNAs are primarily derived from dual-strand piRNA clusters, intergenic elements rich in transposon fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. These clusters are occupied with the repressive histone mark H3K9me3 and lack typical promoters, but are transcribed in both directions from the internal sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. This unconventional transcription requires special factors, including heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) homolog HP1d/Rhino (Rhino), and provides piRNA precursors with a variety of sequences, which are then processed to mature piRNAs in the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The mechanism dedicated to this piRNA processing is known as the ping-pong cycle, where Aubergine and Argonaute 3 cleave the precursors in a manner dependent on the sequences of piRNAs already bound to them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. This pathway also consumes transposon RNA transcripts as the sources of mature piRNAs, resulting in transposon repression at the post-transcriptional level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Like other HP1 family members, Rhino has a chromodomain through which it binds to H3K9me3 scattered on dual-strand piRNA clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Deadlock and Cutoff then join Rhino, assembling the Rhino–Deadlock–Cutoff (RDC) complex, which further recruits the transcription factor IIA-L (TFIIA-L) paralogue Moonshiner, the transcription factor IIA-S (TFIIA-S), and the animal TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) paralog TRF2, initiating transcription of the clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Upon transcription, Cutoff binds to piRNA precursors and protects them from splicing, contributing to the production of an abundance of piRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A recent study identified the zinc-finger protein Kipferl as a factor required for Rhino to distinguish between H3K9me3 located on transposons and dual-strand piRNA clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Kipferl stabilizes Rhino on guanine-rich sequence motifs present in dual-strand clusters in an H3K9me3-independent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Maternally inherited piRNAs also play a role in the localization of Rhino to dual-strand clusters during early embryogenesis via Piwi-dependent H3K9me3 epigenetic marks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Rhino has a propensity to spread across the genome. For example, depletion of the histone demethylase Kdm3 in the female germline causes Rhino to spread to adjacent chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Deletion of the region proximal to the transcription start site of the <italic>phospholipase D</italic> gene, which is in the region flanking piRNA cluster 42AB, also resulted in Rhino spreading toward the deleted genomic region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In addition, Rhino tethering experiments with artificial constructs showed that Rhino spreads as the constructs are transcribed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In each case, production of piRNAs from regions after Rhino spreading was detected. These findings suggest that piRNA clusters are defined by Rhino spreading over the genome and imply that the process of piRNA cluster formation is composed of three steps: Rhino spreading, Kipferl-dependent stabilization of Rhino–genome association, and epigenetic inheritance of the Rhino positional memory by maternally inherited piRNAs. Since the genomic localization of both Rhino and Kipferl is interdependent, it is hypothesized that the initial loading of Rhino on the genome precedes its spread or stabilization, and that this process is independent of Kipferl. To investigate this, it is necessary to observe the behavior of Rhino in a cell environment where piRNAs are functional, but where both Kipferl and Rhino are not expressed. However, the mechanism of such Rhino behavior remains unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, we describe the important role of <underline>a</underline>symmetric <underline>dim</underline>ethyl<underline>a</underline>rginine histones (<underline>ADMA</underline>-histones) in the initial loading of Rhino onto the genome and their stabilization. We first established cultured ovarian somatic cells (OSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> expressing FLAG-Rhino by induction with doxycycline (Dox). Unlike ovarian germ cells, OSCs lack Rhino and other factors required for the activation of dual-strand piRNA clusters, such as Deadlock and Cutoff<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>; therefore, dual-strand clusters are not in an active state for piRNA biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We found that Rhino in OSCs assembles nuclear foci similar to Rhino foci in the ovary. We then performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and showed that Rhino tends to bind to the ends of dual-strand clusters with ADMA-histones, such as H3R17me2a. Depletion of the arginine methyltransferases responsible for ADMA modifications, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> arginine methyltransferase 4 (DART4), affected the genomic localization of Rhino in OSCs and in the ovary. We also identified genomic regions where Rhino binds at the ends and propagates in the areas in a DART4-dependent manner, but not stably anchored. Kipferl is present at the regions but is not sufficient to stabilize Rhino-genomic binding after Rhino propagates. piRNAs were mapped to these regions, albeit at low levels. The levels of these piRNAs decreased also in a DART4-dependent manner. Therefore, these regions, referred to as DART4-dependent piRNA clusters (DART4 clusters), are considered to be primitive clusters driven by the propagation of Rhino initially loaded onto the genome via ADMA-histones.</p>

<title>Rhino localizes to the ends of dual-strand clusters in the OSC genome</title>
<p>To observe how Rhino in OSCs behaves intracellularly, we first performed immunofluorescence in FLAG-Rhino inducible OSCs to examine the subcellular localization of FLAG-Rhino upon Dox induction. This showed that Rhino assembled nuclear speckles in OSCs similar to Rhino-positive foci in the ovary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> when the cells were treated with Dox at a concentration of 5 ng/mL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). At lower Dox concentrations and lower levels of Rhino expression, no clear foci appeared (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B), suggesting that Rhino-positive foci form in a manner dependent on the level of Rhino expression.</p>

</fig>
<p>We next conducted ChIP-seq of FLAG-Rhino under conditions where Rhino assembles nuclear foci as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. Genome mapping of the ChIP-seq reads showed that Rhino can be found, albeit weak, on dual-strand piRNA clusters, such as 42AB and 38C on chromosome 2, 80F on chromosome 3, and 102F on chromosome 4, all of which are in an active state in piRNA production in the ovary, but the signals seem to be biased toward the ends of the clusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1C). ChIP-seq of Rhino was also performed in the ovary: Rhino was strongly enriched at highly transcribed piRNA clusters, 42AB, 38C, 80F, and 102F, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1C), which suggests that our ChIP-seq procedure is reliable.</p>
<p>We then compared the mode of Rhino genome binding in OSCs with that in the ovary in a more comprehensive manner. The results show that Rhino in OSCs tends to reside in the genome where Rhino binds locally in the ovary (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The metaplot indicates a tendency for Rhino in OSCs to be toward the cluster ends (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Rhino also binds to the cluster bodies in OSCs, but the signals were weaker compared to those at the ends. Based on these results, we interpret that OSCs contain a factor(s) that promotes Rhino binding toward the ends of the clusters, but unlike the ovary, they lack a factor(s) that promotes and stabilizes Rhino spreading throughout the clusters.</p>
<p>The terminal localization of Rhino in OSCs does not appear to be due to H3K9me2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, E, F</xref>): Of the 823 Rhino signals, only 14 signals overlapped with the H3K9me2 signals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The heatmap also showed that H3K9me2 barely accumulated at the Rhino location (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). The positional correlation between Rhino and H3K9me3 is stronger than between Rhino and H3K9me2 (i.e., 77%; 636 in 823 signals) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Nonetheless, the overlap between Rhino and H3K9me3 was not very strong according to the heatmap (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F, G</xref>). Immunofluorescence also showed weak overlap between the prominent H3K9me3 speckles and FLAG-Rhino foci (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). HP1a, another HP1 family member required for constitutive heterochromatin and known to be a general H3K9me3 marker, co-localizes with H3K9me2/3 and is distributed along the entire length of piRNA clusters similarly in both OSCs and ovary (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1C). HP1a is present in the broad H3K9me3 peak (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Therefore, although H3K9me3 and HP1a might be involved in some aspect of the mechanism underlying Rhino localization, they do not contribute to the localization specificity within that mechanism at least.</p>
<p>FLAG-Rhino ChIP-seq was also performed at low Rhino expression levels. The trend toward terminal localization of Rhino at 5 ng/mL Dox was observed at 0.05 ng/mL and 0.5 ng/mL Dox as well (Supplementary Fig. 1D, E). This indicates that Rhino binds to the OSC genome even at low expression levels. However, Rhino foci were not clearly observed with the lower Dox concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 1A). It is interpreted that genome binding occurs first, followed by Rhino foci formation, which is dependent on Rhino expression levels.</p>
<p>The use of anti-FLAG antibodies in Rhino ChIP in OSCs was justified by the high similarity between the signals of anti-FLAG and anti-Rhino antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1C, D).</p>

<title>Rhino co-localizes with asymmetric dimethylarginine histones on the OSC genome</title>
<p>To identify genomic scaffolds that are potentially involved in determining the genomic localization of Rhino in OSCs, we performed ChIP-seq of key histone modifications and compared the data with Rhino ChIP-seq data. Heatmap revealed that specific ADMA-histones, including H3R2me2a, H3R8me2a, H3R17me2a, and H4R3me2a, tend to co-localize with Rhino across the OSC genome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Consistent with this, these ADMA-histones showed a tendency to localize to the ends of Rhino-bound dual-strand piRNA clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. 2A). H3K4me1 and H3K27ac have been reported to co-localize with H3R8me2a in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, which was not observed in OSCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. 2A). Co-localization of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac with Rhino was also not observed.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="585151v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Examination of the correlation coefficients revealed that signal peaks of each ADMA-histone were significantly correlated with those of FLAG-Rhino (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The ChIP-seq signals of H3R2me2s and H3R8me2s correlate more strongly with FLAG(Dox-) than with FLAG(Dox+), suggesting that these histone modifications may represent background noise (see “background noise” in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). In contrast, ADMA-histones show a higher correlation coefficient with FLAG(Dox+) than with FLAG(Dox-): it is also worth noting that in hierarchical clustering, ADMA-histones form a monophyletic group with FLAG(Dox+) (see “Rhino localization” in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Histone modifications related to transcription, such as H3K4 and H3K27, as well as constitutive heterochromatin markers like H3K9me2 are not associated with the localization of FLAG-Rhino (see “transcriptional regulation” in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Involvement of ADMA-histones in the genomic localization of Rhino was implicated.</p>
<p>The overlaps of ChIP-seq peaks were examined. In the diagram shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, approximately 23% of Rhino ChIP peaks did not overlap with H3K9me3 (187 in 823 sites), but these Rhino peaks were almost encapsulated by the read sets of ADMA-histones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). This suggests that ADMA-histones are involved in the localization of Rhino. However, the degree of overlap of those sites is not very high in each case (Supplementary Fig. 2B). It appears that each ADMA-histone contributes differently to Rhino localization. HP1a was found at the dual-strand clusters in OSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, unlike Rhino, genomic localization of HP1a does not appear to be determined by ADMA-histones and H3K9me3 because approximately 30% of HP1a ChIP peaks did not overlap with the read sets of ADMA-histones and H3K9me3 (492 in 1,672 sites) (Supplementary Fig. 2C). These results suggest that ADMA-histones, together with H3K9me3, contribute significantly and specifically to the recruitment of Rhino to the ends of dual-strand clusters in OSCs.</p>

<title>Arginine methyltransferases DART1 and DART4 differently regulate Rhino genomic binding</title>
<p>Arginine methylation of histones is catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes 11 of these PRMTs, also known as <italic>Drosophila</italic> arginine methyltransferases (DARTs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Of those, DART1, a homolog of mammalian PRMT1, and DART4/CARMER (DART4), a homolog of mammalian PRMT4/CARM1 (CARM1), were reported to be type I PRMTs that catalyze the methylation of monomethylarginine to asymmetric dimethylarginine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. DART8 is involved in asymmetric dimethylation of H3R2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. CG17726 is considered to be a DART member because of its sequence similarity and is expressed in the ovary (Flybase 2024). However, its function remains unknown. If ADMA-histones play an important role in the local recruitment of Rhino to the OSC genome, it is highly likely that the loss of DARTs responsible for ADMA modification would influence the subcellular localization of Rhino.</p>
<p>A previous study showed that HP1a germline knockdown (GLKD) causes Rhino foci to be more prominent in the ovary and reduces Rhino occupancy at the clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Because a similar phenotype was observed for Rhino foci in HP1a-knockdown (KD) OSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>), we used this phenotype to examine the loss-of-function effects of DARTs. Similar phenotypes were observed in DART1- and DART4-KD OSCs as in HP1a-KD OSCs, suggesting that DART1/4-dependent histone ADMA modification is involved in Rhino recruitment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Moreover, the localization of Rhino in DART1/4 KD cells closely matches prominent H3K9me3 foci, suggesting that the arginine methylation activity of DART1/4 contributes to the genomic localization of Rhino in OSCs as a genome scaffold beyond H3K9me3 (Supplementary Fig. 3A). In contrast, this phenotype was not observed for HP1a, suggesting that the effects of DART1/4 are specific to Rhino (Supplementary Fig. 3B).</p>

<p>Fluctuation in the localization of Rhino in the DART1- and DART4-KD OSCs was also observed in ChIP experiments. In ChIP-seq, Rhino tended to be decreased in DART1 KD and DART4 KD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D</xref>), which was confirmed by ChIP-qPCR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Among the ADMA-histones that co-localized with Rhino, H3R17me2a decreased in a DART4-dependent manner and H4R3me2a decreased in a DART1-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), consistent with previous findings for human PRMT1 and CARM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Detailed analysis revealed that the genomic localizations of H4R3me2a lost in DART1 KD (575 sites) and H3R17me2a lost in DART4 KD (653 sites) overlapped at 48 sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).

These results suggest that DART1 and DART4 are involved in Rhino recruitment at distinct genomic sites through the decreases in ADAM-histones in each of their KD conditions (H4R3me2a and H3R17me2a, respectively).</p>
<p>Among ADMA-histones, only H3R8me2a tended to decrease in both DART1 and DART4 KD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). To examine the specificity of the regulation of H3R8me2a by DART1 and DART4, the degree of overlap was visualized in Venn diagrams for H3R8me2a, as well as H3R17me2a and H4R3me2a. The genomic localizations of H3R8me2a decreased by DART1 KD (235 sites) and DART4 KD (58 sites) weakly overlapped (8 sites) (Supplementary Fig. 3C). The genomic localizations of H3R8me2a (58 sites) and H3R17me2a (652 sites) that decreased in DART4 KD overlapped only at 7 sites (Supplementary Fig. 3D), as was the case for H3R8me2a (235 sites) and H4R3me2a (575 sites), which were decreased in DART1 KD (Supplementary Fig. 3E). These results suggest that DART1 and DART4 regulate Rhino localization through H3R8me2a at different sites, as well as through H3R17me2a and H4R3me2a.</p>
<p>The level of Rhino expression was unchanged in DART1/4-KD cells (Supplementary Fig. 3F). Rhino and HP1a even in normal OSCs were under detection levels with anti-ADMA antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 3G). Thus, the loss of DART1/4 does not appear to affect Rhino or HP1a function directly through methylation.</p>

<title>ADMA-histones co-localize with Rhino in a manner dependent of DART4 in the ovary</title>
<p>We examined the localization of ADMA-histones in the Oregon-R ovary.

<p>To determine whether the destabilization of Rhino genome binding observed in OSCs under DART4-KD conditions is also observed in the ovary, we performed GLKD of DART4 using the GAL4-UAS system. Under the DART4-GLKD conditions (Supplementary Fig. 5A), Rhino foci were more prominent in the absence of DART4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). ChIP-seq experiments showed that Rhino localizes almost the same genomic regions in the ovary as in OSCs, although these localizations are weaker compared to piRNA clusters such as 42AB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, D</xref>). Notably, Rhino levels significantly decreased with the loss of H3R17me2a under DART4-GLKD conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C–F</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. 5C, D). These results indicate that the relationship between ADMA-histones and Rhino found in OSCs is conserved in the ovary.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Rhino spreading across clusters annotated in the piRNA cluster database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, such as 42AB, 38C, 80F, and 102F, was little affected by DART4 GLKD (Supplementary Fig. 5E). These results suggest that the weak Rhino localization dependent on ADMA-histones (such as at the terminal sites of piRNA clusters) and the strong Rhino localization within the core regions of piRNA clusters are fundamentally governed by distinct regulatory mechanisms.</p>
<p>Loss of Kdm3 in the ovary (i.e., Kdm3-GLKD ovary) causes an increase in H3K9me2 and regional expansion, accompanied by Rhino spreading and the appearance of ectopic piRNA clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. To determine whether ADMA-histones are involved in this process, we examined the localization of ADMA-histones in the ectopic piRNA clusters. ADMA-histones were found near the 5′ and 3′ ends of the Kdm3 GLKD-dependent piRNA clusters, as well as in the authentic piRNA clusters (Supplementary Fig. 5F). Relatively few ADMA-histones were observed inside the clusters, even in the Kdm3 GLKD-dependent piRNA clusters (Supplementary Fig. 5F). This raises the possibility that ADMA-histones may be involved in the Rhino propagation by defining the spreading regions.</p>

<p>Not only H3R17me2a but also other ADMA-histones were found at the ends of these regions, and H3K9me2 accumulated in the internal areas (Supplementary Fig. 6B), consistent with previous studies suggesting H3K9me2 involvement in the Rhino spreading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. FLAG-Rhino in OSCs was also localized at the ends of the regions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that ADMA-histones are involved in the genomic binding of Rhino both before and after Rhino spreading, resulting in stable genome binding.</p>
<p>We next investigated the potential for piRNA production from the genomic regions where Rhino propagates in a DART4-dependent manner but does not stably anchor. Under control conditions, piRNAs were detected mapping to these regions, albeit at low levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D, F</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. 6A). Under DART4-GLKD conditions, piRNA levels were significantly reduced, suggesting that piRNA production from these regions is dependent on DART4. Although piRNA production was also influenced by Rhino, the reduction observed upon Rhino loss was much less pronounced compared to annotated piRNA clusters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>The expression levels of transposons and genes presumed to be targeted by piRNAs originating from genomic regions showed minimal changes under DART4-GLKD conditions (Supplementary Fig. 6C). Similarly, egg hatching rates remained largely unaffected (Supplementary Fig. 6D). These observations could be attributed to the relatively low levels of piRNAs arising from these regions compared to authentic piRNA clusters (Supplementary Fig. 6E, F), as well as their shorter genomic lengths (Supplementary Fig. 6G). This can also be explained by the fact that piRNA production from authentic clusters remained largely unaffected. Notably, even the functional loss of authentic piRNA clusters in germ cell piRNA production does not usually result in infertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Based on these findings, which highlight that these genomic regions differ from authentic piRNA clusters in many aspects yet possess the ability to produce piRNAs, we designate them as DART4-dependent piRNA clusters (DART4 clusters).</p>
<p>Kipferl stabilizes the Rhino–genome binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. ChIP-seq using anti-Kipferl antibodies showed that Kipferl localizes to the genomic regions where Rhino spreads but does not remain stable, and decreases in DART4 GLKD like Rhino (Supplementary Fig. 7A, B). This suggests that Kipferl is already present in these regions but is not sufficient to stabilize Rhino–genomic binding after Rhino propagates. Therefore, an unknown factor(s) other than Kipferl is required to convert these regions into “authentic” piRNA clusters that stably produce piRNAs by stabilizing Rhino–genomic binding.</p>
<p>In Kipferl mutants, Rhino localization is biased toward satellite repeats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In DART4 GLKD, there appears to be no significant difference in Rhino localization (Supplementary Fig. 7C), nor does Rhino become enriched at satellite repeats (Supplementary Fig. 7D).</p>
<p>A recent comprehensive annotation of active piRNA clusters across eight highly inbred <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains classified the clusters into eight levels of evolutionary novelty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. We subsequently analyzed the enrichment of ADMA-histones, which significantly correlate with Rhino localization in OSCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A–E</xref>) and ovaries (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A–C</xref>) (e.g., H3R2me2a, H3R8me2a, H3R17me2a, and H4R3me2a), around these piRNA clusters. Notably, a trend of greater ADMA-histone enrichment was observed at the ends of the newer clusters (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). This trend was also observed in DART4 clusters (Supplementary Fig. 8A). In contrast, such bias was not observed in older clusters or other genomic loci (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A, B</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 8A). H3R2me2a, H3R8me2a, H3R17me2a, and H4R3me2a showed a loss of enrichment as the clusters aged (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). The DART4-dependent H3R17me2a differences observed between newer and older clusters were less pronounced in DART4 GLKD (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). We next extracted piRNA clusters where piRNAs were detected in the Oregon-R strain and examined them for ADMA-histone enrichment. The results remained consistent (Supplementary Fig. 8B). A similar analysis using GLKD strains yielded identical findings (Supplementary Fig. 8C). These results suggest that DART4 clusters represent relatively new piRNA clusters.</p>

Rhino in DART4 clusters is lost if ADMA-histones are lost. It remains unclear whether DART4 clusters can eventually develop into highly transcribed piRNA clusters, such as 42AB, over the course of evolutionary time.</p></caption>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we took advantage of cultured OSCs for our analysis and found that chromatin marks (i.e., ADMA-histones) play a crucial role in the loading of Rhino onto the genome. Comparative analysis of OSC and ovarian ChIP-seq data also allowed us to identify “primitive” piRNA clusters, DART4 clusters. Based on these results, DART4 clusters are piRNA clusters where Rhino propagates in a DART4-dependent manner from the H3R17me2a marks at the ends, but this spread is not stable. We propose that the process of piRNA cluster formation begins with the initial loading of Rhino onto bivalent nucleosomes containing H3K9me3 and ADMA-histones (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). In OSCs, the absence of Kipferl and other necessary factors means that Rhino loading into the genome does not proceed to the next step. In DART4 clusters, Rhino spreads but does not stabilize, indicating that these regions may be nascent piRNA clusters. The evolutionary analysis showing a stronger tendency for ADMA accumulation at the ends of younger piRNA clusters (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>) provides indirect evidence that DART4 clusters represent evolutionarily young, nascent piRNA clusters. While DART4 clusters may represent a “later” stage compared to annotated piRNA clusters, the essential role of piRNAs in reproduction and species conservation makes it unlikely that a large number of clusters exist in a degenerate state. Thus, we speculate that these clusters represent an “earlier” stage in piRNA cluster formation.</p>
<p>Whether DART4 clusters evolve into large piRNA clusters such as 42AB and 38C during the course of evolution remains an open question. Although these large clusters were not affected by DART4 GLKD, ADMA-histones were still detectable, albeit at low levels, at the ends of their Rhino peaks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). This observation raises the possibility that even large piRNA clusters like 42AB and 38C may have initially formed through a process involving ADMA-histone–mediated Rhino loading followed by propagation, as seen in DART4 clusters. While it remains possible that these clusters formed through a different mechanism without passing through a DART4-cluster-like phase, such a scenario would leave the presence of residual ADMA-histones at their ends unexplained. Nonetheless, evolutionary analyses provide only indirect evidence, and experimental validation will be necessary to determine whether DART4 clusters can indeed mature into larger piRNA clusters.</p>
<p>In general, ADMA-histones are known to function as transcriptional coactivators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. In mammalian cells, H3R8me2a does not co-localize with H3K9me3, but with enhancer modifications such as H3K4me1 and H3K27ac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. This may indicate that the function of ADMA-histones has evolved in a <italic>Drosophila</italic>-specific manner, which is not unlikely given that Rhino itself is <italic>Drosophila</italic>-specific. However, there are regions where Rhino does not localize in the read sets of ADMA-histones and H3K9me3, suggesting that an unknown factor may contribute to the specificity of Rhino targeting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>This study showed that multiple ADMA-histones, such as H3R17me2a and H4R3me2a, play a role in the initial Rhino loading. This suggests that a co-factor(s) with an affinity for ADMAs might be involved. Tudor domains are known to bind partner proteins through methylation of arginine and lysine residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, and Tudor domain-containing protein 3 (TDRD3) was identified as a factor that specifically binds to H3R17me2a and H4R3me2a in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Therefore, TDRD protein family members may be involved in Rhino loading via ADMAs. ADMAs of other histone arginine residues such as H3R42 may also be involved in the regulation of Rhino behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. In this study, ChIP-seq was not performed for these modifications due to the lack of commercially available antibodies.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which ADMA-histones is involved in Rhino propagation remains unclear. Because Rhino propagation has been shown to be correlated with transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, one interpretation is that ADMA-histones may affect Rhino spreading via transcriptional activity. Insertion of insulators into piRNA clusters inhibits piRNA production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, indicating that the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome within the piRNA cluster also affects the extent of Rhino spreading. ADMA-histones were found at the ends of piRNA clusters, reminiscent of the boundaries of topologically associated domains. An unknown stabilizing factor(s) suggested by the absence of Kipferl in some DART4 clusters (Supplementary Fig. 7A, B) may be a relevant factor(s) determining such genomic 3D structures.</p>
<p>Maternally inherited siRNAs initiate piRNA biogenesis from a transgene inserted into the uni-strand piRNA cluster 20A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In this previous report, evidence was presented that siRNAs induce “<italic>de novo”</italic> Rhino loading onto this transgene (20A-X) via H3K9me3. This led us to hypothesize that ADMA-histones should be present in the vicinity of 20A-X. Indeed, we detected ADMA-histones in the region and Rhino, albeit weakly (Supplementary Fig. 5). Thus, this study provided experimental evidence in support of the “<italic>de novo</italic> model” by reinforcing the findings of siRNA induced piRNA biogenesis. This model has been becoming supported by evolutionary analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, but experimental results had been limited. The evolutionarily young piRNA clusters, which appear in a limited number of strains, may have formed through the spread of Rhino into newly inserted transposons, facilitated by the presence of ADMA-histones in their vicinity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, major piRNA clusters such as 42AB and 38C are located at the boundary between heterochromatin and euchromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. It was unclear why these highly transcribed clusters, which are capable of producing substantial piRNAs, tend to appear in regions where two different types of chromatins collide. If DART4 clusters represent the initial stage in the formation of piRNA clusters, our model can answer this question by showing that cluster formation begins with initial Rhino loading by ADMA-histones onto euchromatic regions and then spreads to adjacent regions of H3K9me2-rich heterochromatin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Rhino shows a tendency to spread from an DART4 clusters on chromosome 2 to heterochromatin/euchromatin boundary regions where 42AB and 38C are present (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), supporting our hypothesis.</p>

We performed ChIP-seq experiment using at least two biological replicates, except for ChIP with anti-FLAG antibody in OSCs under Dox = 0.05 and 0.5ng/mL conditions. The replicates were highly correlated, so we merged them together and used the merged libraries for analyses. Because of the low mapping score, four replicates were prepared for Rhino and three for Kipferl in the GLKD condition. Peakcall was completed with MACS2 with q = 0.01 settings using input ChIP-seq data as control unless otherwise noted in figure legends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>.

<p>DART4-dependent piRNA clusters were defined using manorm results based on the macs2 callpeak with option p = 0.01 and --broad --broad cutoff 0.1 output files that met the following seven criteria. First, M value &gt; 0.5 is required for Rhino to be predominantly enriched against DART4 GLKD. Second, the sharp peaks of the mononucleosome units were excluded because of their non-spreading initial Rhino localization. Third, peaks overlapped with DART4-dependent H3R17me2a were excluded because these peaks cannot distinguish spread Rhino and initial Rhino loading. Fourth, each Rhino peak was checked in the genome browser, and if there were consecutive Rhino peaks around it that met the first, second and third criteria, they were grouped together as one peak. Fifth, peaks that overlap with major piRNA clusters such as 42AB, 38C, 80F, and 102F were excluded because they are highly transcribed piRNA clusters. Sixth, peaks on subtelomeres and pericentromeres were excluded because ChIP-seq reads cannot distinguish piRNA clusters or repeats. Finally, peaks whose localization spanned the entire length of a single transposon were excluded because they may reflect genomic differences between ctrl GLKD and DART4 GLKD, such as copy number variation of transposons. The combined peaks that met these seven criteria were defined as single DART4 cluster together with the surrounding contiguous ctrl GLKD-specific Rhino localizations if they were more than 5 kb.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors aim to understand how Rhino, a chromatin protein essential for small RNA production in fruit flies, is initially recruited to specific regions of the genome. They propose that asymmetric arginine methylation of histones, particularly mediated by the enzyme DART4, plays a key role in defining the first genomic sites of Rhino localization. Using a combination of inducible expression systems, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and genetic knockdowns, the authors identify a new class of Rhino-bound loci, termed DART4 clusters, that may represent nascent or transitional piRNA clusters.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>One of the main strengths of this work lies in its comprehensive use of genomic data to reveal a correlation between ADMA histones and Rhino enrichment at the border of known piRNA clusters. The use of both cultured cells and ovaries adds robustness to this observation. The knockdown of DART4 supports a role for H3R17me2a in shaping Rhino binding at a subset of genomic regions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, Rhino binding at, and piRNA production from, canonical piRNA clusters appears largely unaffected by DART4 depletion, and spreading of Rhino from ADMA-rich boundaries was not directly demonstrated. Therefore, while the correlation is clearly documented, further investigation would be needed to determine the functional requirement of these histone marks in piRNA cluster specification.</p>
<p>The study identify piRNA cluster-like regions called DART4 clusters. While the model proposes that DART4 clusters represent evolutionary precursors of mature piRNA clusters, the functional output of these clusters remains limited. Additional experiments could help clarify whether low-level piRNA production from these loci is sufficient to guide Piwi-dependent silencing.</p>
<p>In summary, the authors present a well-executed study that raises intriguing hypotheses about the early chromatin context of piRNA cluster formation. The work will be of interest to researchers studying genome regulation, small RNA pathways, and the chromatin mechanisms of transposon control. It provides useful resources and new candidate loci for follow-up studies, while also highlighting the need for further functional validation to fully support the proposed model.</p>

<p>This study seeks to understand how the Rhino factor knows how to localize to specific transposon loci and to specific piRNA clusters to direct the correct formation of specialized heterochromatin that promotes piRNA biogenesis in the fly germline. In particular, these dual-strand piRNA clusters with names like 42AB, 38C, 80F, and 102F generate the bulk of ovarian piRNAs in the nurse cells of the fly ovary, but the evolutionary significance of these dual-strand piRNA clusters remains mysterious since triple null mutants of these dual-strand piRNA clusters still allows fly ovaries to develop and remain fertile. Nevertheless, mutants of Rhino and its interactors Deadlock, Cutoff, Kipferl and Moonshiner, etc, causes more piRNA loss beyond these dual-strand clusters and exhibit the phenotype of major female infertility, so the impact of proper assembly of Rhino, the RDC, Kipferl etc onto proper piRNA chromatin is an important and interesting biological question that is not fully understood.</p>
<p>This study tries to first test ectopic expression of Rhino via engineering a Dox-inducible Rhino transgene in the OSC line that only expresses the primary Piwi pathway that reflects the natural single pathway expression the follicle cells and is quite distinct from the nurse cell germline piRNA pathway that is promoted by Rhino, Moonshiner, etc. The authors present some compelling evidence that this ectopic Rhino expression in OSCs may reveal how Rhino can initiate de novo binding via ADMA histone marks, a feat that would be much more challenging to demonstrate in the germline where this epigenetic naïve state cannot be modeled since germ cell collapse would likely ensue. In the OSC, the authors have tested the knockdown of four of the 11 known Drosophila PRMTs (DARTs), and comparing to ectopic Rhino foci that they observe in HP1a knockdown (KD), they conclude DART1 and DART4 are the prime factors to study further in looking for disruption of ADMA histone marks. The authors also test KD of DART8 and CG17726 in OSCs, but in the fly, the authors only test Germ Line KD of DART4 only, they do not explain why these other DARTs are not tested in GLKD, the UAS-RNAi resources in Drosophila strain repositories should be very complete and have reagents for these knockdowns to be accessible.</p>
<p>The authors only characterize some particular ADMA marks of H3R17me2a as showing strong decrease after DART4 GLKD, and then they see some small subset of piRNA clusters go down in piRNA production as shown in Figure 6B and Figure 6F and Supplementary Figure 7. This small subset of DART4-dependent piRNA clusters does lose Rhino and Kipferl recruitment, which is an interesting result.</p>
<p>However, the biggest issue with this study is the mystery that the set of the most prominent dual-strand piRNA clusters. 42AB, 38C, 80F, and 102F, are the prime genomic loci subjected to Rhino regulation, and they do not show any change in piRNA production in the GLKD of DART4. The authors bury this surprising negative result in Supplementary Figure 5E, but this is also evident in no decrease (actually an n.s. increase) in Rhino association in Figure 5D. Since these main piRNA clusters involve the RDC, Kipferl, Moonshiner, etc, and it does not change in ADMA status and piRNA loss after DART4 GLKD, this poses a problem with the model in Figure 7C. In this study, there is only a GLKD of DART4 and no GLKD of the other DARTs in fly ovaries.</p>
<p>One way the authors rationalize this peculiar exception is the argument that DART4 is only acting on evolutionarily &quot;young&quot; piRNA clusters like the bx, CG14629, and CG31612, but the lack of any change on the majority of other piRNA clusters in Figure 6F leaves upon the unsatisfying concern that there is much functional redundancy remaining with other DARTs not being tested by GLKD in the fly that would have a bigger impact on the other main dual-strand piRNA clusters being regulated by Rhino and ADMA-histone marks.</p>
<p>Also, the current data does not provide convincing enough support for the model Figure 7C and the paper title of ADMA-histones being the key determinant in the fly ovary for Rhino recognition of the dual-strand piRNA clusters. Although much of this study's data is well constructed and presented, there remains a large gap that no other DARTs were tested in GLKD that would show a big loss of piRNAs from the main dual-strand piRNA clusters of 42AB, 38C, 80F, and 102F, where Rhino has prominent spreading in these regions.</p>
<p>As the manuscript currently stands, I do not think the authors present enough data to conclude that &quot;ADMA-histones [As a Major new histone mark class] does play a crucial role in the initial recognition of dual-strand piRNA cluster regions by Rhino&quot; because the data here mainly just show a small subset of evolutionarily young piRNA clusters have a strong effect from GLKD of DART4. The authors could extensively revise the study to be much more specific in the title and conclusion that they have uncovered this very unique niche of a small subset of DART4-dependent piRNA clusters, but this niche finding may dampen the impact and significance of this study since other major dual-strand piRNA clusters do not change during DART4 GLKD, and the authors do not show data GLKD of any other DARTs. The niche finding of just a small subset of DART-4-dependent piRNA clusters might make another specialized genetics forum a more appropriate venue.</p>
