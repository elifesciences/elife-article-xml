<abstract>
<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS), predominantly derived from mitochondrial respiratory complexes, have emerged as key molecules influencing cell fate decisions like maintenance and differentiation. These redox-dependent events are mainly considered to be cell intrinsic in nature, on the contrary our observations indicate involvement of these oxygen-derived entities as intercellular communicating agents. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline, Germline Stem Cells (GSCs) and neighbouring Cyst Stem Cells (CySCs) maintain differential redox thresholds where CySC have higher redox-state compared to the adjacent GSCs. Disruption of the redox equilibrium between the two adjoining stem cell populations by depleting Superoxide Dismutases (SODs) especially Sod1 results in deregulated niche architecture and loss of GSCs, which was mainly attributed to loss of contact-based receptions and uncontrolled CySC proliferation due to ROS-mediated activation of self-renewing signals. Our observations hint towards the crucial role of differential redox states where CySCs containing higher ROS function not only as a source of their own maintenance cues but also serve as non-autonomous redox moderators of GSCs. Our findings underscore the complexity of niche homeostasis and predicate the importance of intercellular redox communication in understanding stem cell microenvironments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Studies from the past few decades have shown the apparent role of ROS in influencing various biological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. ROS are usually produced in specific cellular compartments close to their target molecules to regulate important signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Mitochondria, a major source of oxidant species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, localize dynamically towards nucleus, effecting oxidation induced reshaping of gene expression profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Localized ROS production are contributed by NADH oxidases distributed across different cellular regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Intracellular hydrogen peroxide gradients, maintained by thioredoxin system, allow intercompartmental exchanges among endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and peroxisomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The process of redox relays is conserved and plays a fundamental role in self-renewal and differentiation of stem cell populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Stem cells whether embryonic or adult generally maintain a low redox profile, barring few exceptions and are characterized by subdued mitochondrial respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Levels of ROS are tightly regulated and elevated amounts promote early differentiation and atypical stem cell behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, leading evidences suggest that many transcription factors require oxidative environment for the maintenance of pluripotent states. For instance, physiological ROS levels play a crucial role in genome maintenance of embryonic stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Multipotent hematopoietic progenitors, intestinal stem cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and neural stem cells require relatively high baseline redox for their maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Suppression of Nox system or mitochondrial ROS compromises the maintenance of these self-renewing populations and promote their differentiation or death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. These evidences point towards the essentiality of a well-tuned redox state for balancing the pluripotent and differentiated states. However, how stem cells regulate their redox potential by possessing a restrained oxidant system is not very clear.</p>
<p>We addressed this fundamental question in two-stem cell population-based niche architecture in <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis. The testicular stem cell niche is composed of a central cluster of somatic cells called the hub which contacts eight to eleven GSCs arranged in a round array<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. A pair of cyst stem cells (CySCs) enclose each GSC and make their independent connections with the hub and GSCs via adherens junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> The hub cells secrete self-renewal factors essential for both GSCs and CySCs maintenance involving signalling cascades like Jak-Stat signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Signalling)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, Hedgehog signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The hub and CySCs produce BMPs which repress GSC differentiation by suppressing transcription of bag-of-marbles (Bam)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Asymmetric division of both GSC and CySC is essential for proper cyst formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. A developing cyst contains a dividing and differentiating gonialblast encircled by cyst cells that provide nourishment to developing spermatids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. However, the maintenance of GSCs in the spatially controlled microenvironment is still not very clear.</p>
<p>We found the existence of a balanced differential redox state between GSC and CySC to be essential for niche homeostasis. CySCs by virtue of their higher redox threshold and more clustered mitochondria generated an intercellular redox state that affected the physiological ROS levels in GSCs. Alterations in CySC redox state affected the self-renewal and differentiation propensities of the GSCs. Intercellular redox imbalance disrupts niche homeostasis by inducing premature differentiation of germline stem cells (GSCs) and aberrant proliferation of cyst stem cells (CySCs), driven by activation of pro-proliferative signaling pathways and attenuation of cell–cell contact–mediated communication. Our results indicated a sophisticated interplay between these two stem cell populations where a higher redox state in CySCs not only supports their self-renewing processes but also non-autonomously promotes the maintenance of GSCs.</p>

<title>CySCs maintain higher differential ROS in comparison to adjacent GSCs</title>
<p>The apical region of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis incorporates a cluster of differentiated cells, the hub which is surrounded by GSCs in a rosette arrangement with each GSC being enclosed by two CySCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Immunostaining the ATP5A subunit of mitochondrial ATPase and marking cell boundary by discs-large (Dlg) indicated different mitochondrial distribution among these two stem cell populations. In wild type adult testis, we observed sparsely populated mitochondria in Vasa<sup>+</sup> GSCs as compared to their dense distribution in CySCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B#, C, D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S1B-B’’</xref>). The number of mitochondria per cell was higher in CySC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). The ATP5A labelling overlapped with <italic>TFAM-GFP</italic>, a mitochondrial transcription factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> that labelled the mitochondria, further confirming the patterning observed between these two stem cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Since mitochondria are known to be one of the major producers of ROS in cells, we tested for the relative redox profiles in these two stem cell populations. Mitochondrial dispersion pattern in GSCs and CySCs, corresponded with the intensity variance of the ROS reporter line <italic>gstD1-GFP</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> among the different cell populations at the niche. CySCs (outlined by a dotted boundary) exhibited distinctly higher <italic>gstD1</italic> reporter intensity than the neighbouring GSC (shown with yellow arrowhead) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S1C’’’</xref>). Quantification of this intensity difference indicated that CySCs exhibited a higher baseline level of ROS compared to GSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1Q</xref>). The hub zone (denoted by asterisk) also presented higher <italic>gstD1-GFP</italic> intensity when compared to the surrounding germline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S1C’’’</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the ability of free-radicals to diffuse, we hypothesized that the somatically derived cells in the niche, by virtue to their higher ROS state might be maintaining the redox environment of their surroundings. In this study, we evaluated the redox interplay between the two stem cell population in the niche. To test the role of CySC in influencing GSC redox state, we asked if disrupting the superoxide dismutases in CySCs would influence the redox state of GSCs. To deplete SOD1, we used <italic>Tj-Gal4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> driver (<italic>Tj&gt;Sod1i</italic>) that expresses majorly in CySCs and early differentiating cyst cells (CCs) with minor levels of expression in the hub. Depletion of SOD1 majorly in CySCs resulted in a net increase in <italic>gstD1</italic> -GFP intensity in the niche zone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1P, R</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S1E</xref>), and an overall rise in superoxide levels, confirmed through DHE fluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1F</xref>). Increased <italic>gstD1</italic> labelling due to SOD1 depletion in CySC (denoted by dotted area) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1P</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S1D’’’</xref>) adjacent to Vasa+ GSC (shown with yellow arrow), resulted in concomitant increase in <italic>gstD1</italic> intensity at the Vasa+ GSC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1P</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S1D’’’</xref>). This indicates that the elevated redox state in CySCs led to a corresponding increase in ROS levels in adjacent GSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1R</xref>) suggesting a potential redox crosstalk between these stem cell populations, where the redox state of CySCs might be influencing the oxidative status of neighbouring GSCs. This crosstalk was further validated by subsequent phenotypic analysis.</p>

<title>Balanced CySC redox profile is crucial for its proliferation and GSC maintenance</title>
<p>Alongside the differential redox profile, we observed that elevated ROS levels in <italic>Tj&gt;Sod1i</italic> had a striking effect on the increase of DAPI<sup>+</sup> nuclei at the testis tip (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>’’). This overcrowding was attributed to both an increase in the number of Tj<sup>+</sup> CySCs and early differentiating CCs, as well as their positional shift (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A’, B’</xref>, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). To further validate these findings, we used an alternative driver line, <italic>C-587-Gal4</italic>, which specifically drives expression in CySCs and CCs. This also resulted in an increase in the total number of Tj<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1H’, and M</xref>) although to a lesser extent than <italic>Tj-Gal4</italic>, suggesting that signals from the hub may also partially influence CySC proliferation. Given the stronger phenotypic effect observed with <italic>Tj-Gal4</italic>, we proceeded with this driver line for subsequent experiments.</p>

However, Vasa<sup>+</sup> cells flanking the hub (GSCs) showed a substantial reduction in number (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C’’-D’’</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). This decline was further validated by western blot analysis, which revealed lower overall detectable levels of Vasa protein, indicating a potential impact of the altered redox state on germline maintenance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2N</xref>). Since, Tj shows a minor expression in hub cells, we validated our phenotypic data using <italic>C-587-Gal4</italic> that is specific for CySCs and CCs. Similar to <italic>Tj&gt;Sod1</italic>, <italic>C-587-Gal4&gt;Sod1i</italic> also showed a reduction in the number of neighbouring GSCs <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">(Fig. S1N</xref>). The observations were further verified using <italic>Sod1i</italic> localized in different chromosome to avoid any chromosome or balancer-based biasness and a similar result was obtained where alterations in CySC ROS affected GSC number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1I-L and O-P</xref>). However, the phenotypic effect of higher ROS was limited to its origin in CySCs only because ablation of GSC redox status did not cause any marked change in niche composition. <italic>Nos-Gal4</italic> driven knock-down of Sod1 in GSCs did not result in significant change in CySC number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2A’, B’ and E</xref>) but effected a considerable reduction on Vasa<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2C’, D’ and F</xref>), aligning with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Although Sod1 is the predominant enzyme which also localizes in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, we observed a similar result upon depleting the matrix localized Sod2 in both GSCs and CySCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2G-M</xref>), indicating the involvement of mitochondrial ROS for the observed cellular phenotypes.</p>
<p>To confirm the active proliferation of cells and rule out the possibility of arrested growth, we utilized fly-Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI) system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> which comprises of two reporter constructs marking G1/S transition (green), S (red) and G2/early mitosis (yellow) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Testes from <italic>Tj&gt;Sod1i</italic> exhibited an approximately two-fold increase in cell number across all stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2O</xref>). However, the percentage of cells in each phase remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref>), indicating that the observed increase in different phases is a consequence of more cells entering proliferation rather than alterations in the duration of different cell-cycle stages. The enhanced number of dividing cells was contributed mainly by progressive division of CySCs, showing &gt;2-fold difference in the accumulation of Zfh1<sup>+</sup> nuclei in S and G2/M phases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S2RV-VII and SV-VII</xref>). The number of Zfh1 labelled cells in G1/S transition was also substantially more (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2RIII and SIII</xref>), indicating dysregulated redox ensued an increased mitotic index of CySCs. The enhanced mitotic activity of these proliferating niche cells is further supported by increased phospho-histone H3 (PH3) incorporation, indicating a higher mitotic frequency compared to the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S2T-U</xref>), along with elevated cyclin D expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2Q</xref>). Downregulation of Sod1 in GSCs through <italic>Nos-Gal4</italic> demonstrated no significant change in G1/S, S and G2/M phase numbers, confirming our previous observation that altering ROS levels in GSCs does not have any non-autonomous effect on CySCs numbers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2P</xref>).</p>

This increased number of Eya<sup>+</sup> cells does not suggest that these differentiating cells are proliferative. Instead, we propose that the knockdown of Sod1 may alter the timing or regulation of cyst cell differentiation, leading to an accumulation of Eya<sup>+</sup> cells near the niche. The supposed premature expression of Eya resulted in a population of differentiating cyst precursor cells co-expressing Eya-Zfh1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A’’, B’’</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>).

<p>Together with reduction in Vasa<sup>+</sup> GSCs shown earlier (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), we also detected gonialblast expressing the differentiation-promoting factor Bam, to be much closer to hub in <italic>Tj&gt;Sod1i</italic> testes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>’’ and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>’’). The mean distance between the hub and Bam<sup>+</sup> cells was found to be shortened by ∼7 microns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>). The relative advancement of spermatogonial differentiation towards the hub was also ascertained by tracking the transformation of GSC-specific spectrosome into branched fusomes connecting the multi-cell gonialblast (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The branching fusomes were found more proximal to hub than controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H, I</xref>’’ and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">J</xref>’’), along with parallel reduction in number of spectrosomes, implying a decline in early-stage germ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S3F</xref>). This loss could possibly be attributed to loss of intercellular contacts, particularly with hub cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref># and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">L</xref>#). The observation corroborated with decreased expression pattern of E-cadherin flanking the hub and GSCs, in <italic>Tj&gt;Sod1i</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M-O</xref>) and could be one of the reasons for GSCs dissociation and differentiation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref>#), Disengagement of GSCs from the hub caused reduction in Socs36E and Ptp61F transcripts which subsequently alter Stat expression, a key driver of E-cadherin expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3P</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Q</xref>). These results suggest that disruption of intercellular redox gradient affected the premature differentiation of stem cells in the niche.</p>

<title>Disrupted niche architecture compromises GSC-CySC communication</title>
<p>GSCs and CySCs intercommunicate through several factors such as EGFR, PI3K/Tor, Notch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> to support CySC maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. EGF ligands secreted by spermatogonia maintain differences in cell polarity and segregates self-renewing from differentiating populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. <italic>Tj&gt;Sod1i</italic> cells showed lower levels of cell-polarity marker Dlg (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>”, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>” and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">E</xref>), that expanded more into the differentiated zone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S4A</xref>), indicating loss of cell polarity and aligning with the overtly proliferative nature of these cells. Along with Dlg, a net reduction in pErk levels was observed across sections in <italic>Sod1i</italic> testis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>’, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>’ and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). This reduction in overall Erk levels may be attributed to the loss of cell contact and altered GSC-CySC balance in <italic>Sod1i</italic> testis. The proliferation of cyst cells correlated with increased levels of self-renewal inducers, including the elevated expression of Hedgehog (Hh) pathway components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, in <italic>Tj&gt;Sod1i</italic> testis. The depletion of Sod1 in CySC resulted in elevated expression of Hh receptor, Patched (Ptc) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S4V</xref>) which extended to regions farther from the hub, overlapping with expanded Tj<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). Since, Ptc itself is a transcriptional Hh target, its expression in CySCs suggests active Hh signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, further supported by higher levels and a similar pattern of Hh transcriptional effector, Cubitus interruptus (Ci), in <italic>Sod1i</italic> testis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>’’, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">N’’, J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S4W</xref>).

<title>Elevating CySC antioxidant defence promotes GSC self-renewal</title>
<p>To further substantiate the role of ROS in coordinating the stem cell populations, we strengthened the cellular defences against oxidants by overexpressing Sod1 in CySCs. We checked the overall ROS level using DHE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S5I</xref>) and monitored the relative GSC/CySC populations. Together with reduction in superoxide levels, we observed an increase in the number of Vasa<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and S5A’’-B’’), and a slight reduction in Tj<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S5E’’-F’’</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ROS is a crucial mediator of stem cell maintenance where these species act as second messengers to induce different post-translational protein modifications thereby, affecting cell fate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The effect of ROS is mainly considered to be autocrine in nature, where generation of these oxidative species is usually restricted to specific cellular compartments, ensuring they act close to their targets. Recent studies have reported non-autonomous generation of ROS by NOX enzymes or upon stimulation by growth factors, to play a critical role in regenerative growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. However, in either case, the target cell serves as both the source and the site of response. Among ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) stands out due to its stability and membrane permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, allowing it to diffuse from its source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Non-myocytic pericardial cells (PCs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibit elevated ROS that act in a paracrine manner to influence adjacent cardiomyocytes (CMs) not by direct diffusion but through activation of the D-p38 MAPK cascade within PCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. In cardiomyocyte monolayers, wounding induces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxide accumulation that propagate via gap junctions, creating a cell-to-cell ROS wave where even distant cells show increased cytosolic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and altered proteomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Together, these findings suggest that ROS can spread between cells either by direct diffusion/gap-junctional transfer or indirectly by modulating signaling cascades and secreted factors. Our findings indicate that CySCs due to their high baseline ROS levels, affect the redox state of their neighbourhood including GSCs. ROS imbalance in CySCs enhance the oxidative levels of their surrounding that is, GSC that cause them to differentiate. High ROS mediated differentiation of GSCs has already been reported earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and depletion of superoxide dismutases in GSCs did result in reduction of their number. However, perturbation of ROS in GSCs did not have significant effect on CySC population. This shows that cell non-autonomous effect of ROS is observed only when it originates from CySCs.</p>
<p>Our observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> testicular stem cell niche suggested a previously unaccounted role of superoxide dismutases in maintaining niche homoeostasis. The redox perturbations affected cyst stem cell dynamics which indirectly influenced the germline. The higher ROS threshold of CySCs maintained the physiological redox state of GSCs. Reduced ROS in GSC was accompanied with its proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, phenocopied when Sod1 was overexpressed in its neighbours (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). However, we feel that net alterations in GSC state were the combinatorial effect of oxidative stress and niche alterations brought about by CySC deregulation.</p>
<p>GSCs are anchored to the hub cells via adherens junctions, allowing them to receive crucial maintenance signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. These include Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) such as Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Glass bottom boat (Gbb), which activate the BMP pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> required for GSC self-renewal, and Unpaired (Upd), which triggers the JAK-STAT pathway to promote GSC adhesion to the hub<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. The suppression of these pathways activates Bam, acting as a switch from transit-amplifying cells to spermatocyte differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Elevated ROS in CySC possibly affected STAT phosphorylation through S-glutathionylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, reducing the levels of STAT-dependent transcripts such as Socs36E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, Ptp61F and E-cadherin. This depletion compromises GSC adhesion, resulting in detachment from neighboring cells, similar to E-cadherin loss conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. This resulted in compromised GSC-CySC paracrine receptions such as EGFR which play a crucial role in the maintenance of cell-polarity that segregates self-renewing CySC populations from the ones receiving differentiation cues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, leading to the accumulation of cells co-expressing both stemness and differentiation markers. In contrast to GSCs, ROS imbalance in CySCs induced accelerated proliferation as well as differentiation due to deregulation of EGFR and Hedgehog pathways. Although, redox modulation of EGFR pathway components has been previously demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, in this study we found Hedgehog to be probably susceptible to redox regulation. The redox dependent induction of Hedgehog probably, contributed to enhancement in CySC numbers which partly contributed to depletion of GSCs.</p>
<p>However, we do not rule out the possibility of hub cells playing an equivalent role in GSC maintenance, given their parallel effect in suppressing GSC differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Tj majorly expresses in CySCs but also shows modest expression in hub. Therefore, the possible depletion of Sod1 in both hub and CySCs by <italic>Tj-Gal4</italic> together with, demonstration of a stronger phenotype in <italic>Tj-Sod1RNAi</italic> testis compared to CySC specific <italic>C587-Sod1RNAi</italic>, indicated potential hub contributions in CySC self-renewal. While ROS accumulation typically enhances EGFR signaling promoting premature GSC differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, the loss of EGFR in somatic cells increases the number of GSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> and is associated with fewer somatic cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. However, we observed that Sod1 depletion caused parallel reduction of both pErk levels and GSC number. It is quite possible that the response of germline to Erk modulation is more context-dependent which is influenced by other receptor tyrosin kinases beyond EGFR. To test this hypothesis, we had tried an EGFR gain-of-function rescue of CySC depletion but the driven progenies were lethal in the absence of Sod1. We also avoided usage of Gal80 dependent clonal populations to maintain a homogenous genetic background and prevent false readouts due to diffusion of ROS signals in unaltered neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The proposed concept of intercellular ROS communication can be of importance in deciphering the biochemical adaptability and plasticity of different niches influencing stem cell fate, ensuring niche size and architecture to prevent stem cell loss and aging. This has been observed in neural stem cells where inflammation-induced quiescence recovers the regenerating capacity of aging brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. In addition to metabolic variations, dependence of the germline on somatic neighbours for its redox state might be one the reasons behind its presumed immortal nature and resistance to aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. The same can also be applied to cancer stem cells, which maintain niche occupancy and resist oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, probably by receiving redox cues from the environment. However, further work is required to elucidate the myriads of driver mechanisms intersecting in the realm of redox regulation that extend beyond the present system into broader translational areas.</p>

<title>Dissection and immunostaining</title>
<p>Anesthetized flies were dissected in 1X Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS). All incubations were carried out at room temperature (25°C) unless otherwise mentioned. Testes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes, followed by three washes with 0.3% PBTX (PBS + TritonX 100). Post-blocking in 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin, testis was incubated overnight at 4°C for primary antisera, followed by washing in 0.3% PBTX 3 times 15 minutes each before incubating with secondary antibody. The tissues were counterstained with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 20 minutes, followed by three washes in 0.3% PBTX for 15 minutes each. For Patched antibody staining, a modified protocol utilizing PIPES-EGTA buffer was used as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. For Eya staining, the tissues were incubated in primary antibody for 2 days. The dpErk was labelled by dissecting fly testes in Schneider’s media, followed by fixation in 4% PFA for 30 min, 3x wash in 0.1% PBTX, blocked and incubated in primary antibody overnight; each step supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (1:100, Sigma, cat#P5726). Samples were mounted in DABCO anti-fade medium prior imaging.</p>
<p>The following primary antibodies were used in the experiments - anti-FasIII (7G10) (1:120, DSHB (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank)), anti-Eya (1:50, DSHB), anti-DEcad (DCAD2) (1:50, DSHB), anti-α-Spectrin (3A9) (1:20, DSHB), anti-Ptc (1:50,DSHB), anti-Ci (1:50, DSHB), anti -Dlg (1:50), anti-βtubulin (1:300, DSHB), anti-pERK (1:100, Cell Signaling (4370)), ATP5A (1:700, Abcam (ab14748)), anti-Tj (1:5000), anti-Vasa (1:4000), anti-Zfh1(1:2000). The primary labelling was detected using appropriate Alexa-Flour tagged secondary antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific).</p>
<p>To assess superoxide levels, testes were dissected in Schneider’s medium (SM) and immediately incubated in 30 µM Dihydroxyethidium (DHE) at 25 °C in the dark. Testes were washed thrice with SM for 7 minutes each before quantifying the emitted fluorescence using SpectraMax iD5 (Molecular Devices).</p>

<title>Quantitative Reverse transcription–PCR</title>
<p>For semi-quantitative RT-PCR and qRT-PCR analyses, total RNA was isolated from testes of 3-5 days old male flies using Qiagen RNA extraction kit. RNA pellets were resuspended in nuclease-free water and quantity of RNA was spectrophotometrically estimated. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1-2 µg of total RNA as described earlier. The prepared cDNAs were subjected to real time PCR using forward and reverse primer pairs as listed below, using 5 µl qPCR Master Mix (SYBR Green, ThermoFisher Scientific), 2 pmol/µl of each primer per reaction for 10 µl final volume in ABI 7500 Real time PCR machine. The fold change in expression was calculated through 2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> method. The primers used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.</p>

<title>Imaging and image analysis</title>
<p>Confocal imaging was carried out using Zeiss LSM 900 confocal microscope, using appropriate dichroics and filters. Images were further analyzed and processed for brightness and contrast adjustments using ImageJ (Fiji). Mean intensity measurements were carried out using standard Fiji plug-ins,The relative distance from the two reference points in the images was estimated through Inter-edge Distance ImageJ Macro v2.0 from Github. All images were assembled using Adobe Photoshop version 21.2.1.</p>

<title>Quantification of GSCs, CySCs and CCs</title>
<p>For GSC quantification, only cells in direct contact with the hub were considered. While single slices are shown for representation, counting was performed on individual slices of z-stacks using the semi-automated Cell Counter plugin in Fiji for all specified genotypes.</p>
<p>For CySC quantification, all Tj-positive and Zfh1-positive cells present in each testis were counted and represented. For cyst cells quantification, only those near the hub were considered, which does not reflect the total number of Eya-positive cells. All quantifications were performed using the Cell Counter plugin in Fiji.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial and <italic>gstD1</italic> -GFP quantification</title>
<p>The mitochondrial analyzer first generates 2D mitochondrial regions of interest (ROIs), followed by the measurement of their total area and circularity. Initially, this is done using a thresholded image of a single slice. For <italic>gstD1-</italic>GFP quantification, we have quantified the region of <italic>gstD1</italic> - GFP that overlapped with Vasa-positive germ cells which are in direct contact with hub to assess the presence of ROS reporter signal within the germline compartment. To ensure accurate cell boundary demarcation, we used Dlg staining as an additional parameter.</p>

<title>Immunoblot Analysis</title>
<p>Protein was extracted from the dissected testes using RIPA buffer as described previously and quantified using Bradford reagent (Biorad). Equivalent concentration of lysate was denatured using 1X Laemelli Buffer with 1 M DTT at 95°C, separated in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with commercial blocking solution in TBST base before sequential primary antibody incubation with anti-Vasa and anti-β-Tubulin (DSHB, E7). Secondary detection was performed using HRP-tag anti-mouse antibody (GE Amersham).</p>

<p>In this work, the authors intend to assess the existence of a redox potential across germline stem cells and neighbouring somatic stem cells in the Drosophila testis. Some aspects of the manuscript are <bold>convincing</bold>, like the clear effect of SOD KD on cyst cell differentiation state. Other conclusions of the work, such as the non-autonomous effect of this KD on germ cells are not sufficiently supported by the data. This remains true even with the revised version of the paper, as the effect of redox state of the soma on the germline is a major point of the paper, and this remains a critical flaw. The work could be potentially <bold>useful</bold> if the critiques of the reviewers were fully addressed; the strength of the evidence of the manuscript as it stands is still <bold>inadequate</bold>. Readers should use their own judgment about the validity and meaningfulness of different findings.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial staining difference is convincing, but the status of the mitos, fused vs fragmented, elongated vs spherical, does not seem convincing. Given the density of mito staining in CySC, it is difficult to tell what is an elongated or fused mito vs the overlap of several smaller mitos.</p>
<p>I'm afraid the quantification and conclusions about the gstD1 staining in CySC vs. GSCs is just not convincing-I cannot see how they were able to distinguish the relevant signals to quantify once cell type vs the other.</p>
<p>The overall increase in gstD1 staining with the CySC SOD KD looks nice, but again I can't distinguish different cel types. This experiment would have been more convincing if the SOD KD was mosaic, so that individual samples would show changes in only some of the cells. Still, it seems that KD of SOD in the CySC does have an effect on the germline, which is interesting.</p>
<p>The effect of SOD KD on the number of less differentiated somatic cells seems clear. However, the effect on the germline is less clear and is somewhat confusing. Normally, a tumor of CySC or less differentiated Cyst cells, such as with activated JAK/STAT, also leads to a large increase in undifferentiated germ cells, not a decrease in germline as they conclude they observe here. The images do not appear to show reduced number of GSCs, but if they counted GSCs at the niche, then that is the correct way to do it, but its odd that they chose images that do not show the phenotype. In addition, lower number of GSCs could also be caused by &quot;too many CySCs&quot; which can kick out GSCs from the niche, rather than any affect on GSC redox state. Further, their conclusion of reduced germline overall, e.g. by vasa staining, does not appear to be true in the images they present and their indication that lower vasa equals fewer GSCs is invalid since all the early germline expresses Vasa.</p>
<p>The effect of somatic SOD KD is perhaps most striking in the observation of Eya+ cyst cells closer to the niche. The combination of increased Zfh1+ cells with many also being Eya+ demonstrates a strong effect on cyst cell differentiation, but one that is also confusing because they observe increases in both early cyst cells (Zfh1+) as well as late cyst cells (Eya+) or perhaps just an increase in the Zfh1/Eya double-positive state that is not normally common. The effects on the RTK and Hh pathways may also reflect this disturbed state of the Cyst cells.</p>
<p>However, the effect on germline differentiation is less clear-the images shown do not really demonstrate any change in BAM expression that I can tell, which is even more confusing given the clear effect on cyst cell differentiation.</p>
<p>For the last figure, any effect of SOD OE in the germline on the germline itself is apparently very subtle and is within the range observed between different &quot;wt&quot; genetic backgrounds.</p>

<p>Upon re-re-review, the manuscript is improved but retains many of the flaws outlined in the first reviews.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review)</bold></p>
<p>Mitochondrial staining difference is convincing, but the status of the mitochondria, fused vs fragmented, elongated vs spherical, does not seem convincing. Given the density of mito staining in CySC, it is difficult to tell whether what is an elongated or fused mito vs the overlap of several smaller mitos.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this, we have now removed the statements regarding the differences in the shape of mitochondria among the stem cell population. We have limited our statements to stating that the CySCs are more mitochondria dense compared to the neighbouring GSCs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The quantification and conclusions about the gstD1 staining in CySC vs. GSCs is just not convincing-I cannot see how they were able to distinguish the relevant signals to quantify once cell type vs the other.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern. To address this, we have included new images along with z-stack reconstructions (Fig 1G-P and S1C-D’’’), which now provide clearer distinction of gstD1 staining between CySCs and GSCs and improve the accuracy of quantification. The intensity of gstD1 staining overlapping with that of Vasa+ zone has been quantified as ROS levels for GSCs. Similarly, the cytoplasmic area of gstD1 stain bounded by Dlg and Tj+ nuclei was quantified as ROS levels for CySCs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Images do not appear to show reduced number of GSCs, but if they counted GSCs at the niche, then that is the correct way to do it, but its odd that they chose images that do not show the phenotype. Further, their conclusion of reduced germline overall, e.g by vasa staining, does not appear to be true in the images they present and their indication that lower vasa equals fewer GSCs is invalid since all the early germline expresses Vasa.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have replaced the figure with images where the GSC rosette is clearly visible, ensuring that the counted GSCs at the niche accurately reflect the phenotype (Fig. 2 C’’, D’’). We agree that Vasa is expressed in all early germline cells. The overall reduced Vasa signal intensity in our western blot analysis for Sod1RNAi reflects a general reduction in the germline population, not just the GSCs. We have modified our statements in the Results appropriately.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, the effect on germline differentiation is less clear-the images shown do not really demonstrate any change in BAM expression that I can tell, which is even more confusing given the clear effect on cyst cell differentiation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s observation. To clarify this point, we have now included z-stack projection images of Bam expression in the revised version (Fig 3E’’-F’’) .</p>
<p>These images more clearly demonstrate the difference in Bam expression, thereby highlighting the effect on germline differentiation. Moreover, Bam expressing cells are present more closure to hub in Sod1RNAi condition, indicating early differentiation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the last figure, any effect of SOD OE in the germline on the germline itself is apparently very subtle and is within the range observed between different &quot;wt&quot; genetic backgrounds.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that the effect of SOD overexpression on the germline is not very significant. The germline cells already possess a modest ROS load and it is a well-established fact that they possess a robust anti-oxidant defence machinery in order to protect the genome. Therefore, elevating the levels of antioxidant enzymes such as Sod1 does not translate into a major change and the effect observed are generally subtle.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review)</bold></p>
<p>In Fig. 1N (tj-SODi), one can see that all of gst-GFP resides within the differentiating somatic cells and none is in the germ cells. Furthermore, the information provided in the materials and methods about quantification of gst-GFP is not sufficient. Focusing on Dlg staining is not sufficient. They need to quantify the overlap of Vasa (a cytoplasmic protein in GSCs) with GFP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our analysis, we have indeed quantified the GFP intensity in area of overlap between gstD1-GFP and Vasa-positive zone in the germ cells which are in direct contact with hub, in order to accurately quantify the ROS reporter signal within the germline compartment. Further, to ensure accurate cell boundary demarcation, we used Dlg staining as an additional parameter. While Dlg staining alone was included in the figure panels for clarity of visualization, the actual quantification was performed by considering both Vasa (for germ cells cytoplasm) and Dlg (for cellular boundaries). This has been clarified in the Materials and Methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, since Tj-gal4 is active in hub cells, it is not clear whether the effects of SOD depletion also arise from perturbation of niche cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that Tj-Gal4 also shows minimal activity in hub cells. To address this, we had tested C587-Gal4 and observed similar effects on niche architecture, though weaker than with Tj-Gal4, underlying the effect of ROS originating from CySC.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>First, the authors are studying a developmental effect, rather than an adult phenotype. Second, the characterization of the somatic lineage is incomplete. It appears that high ROS in the somatic lineage autonomously decreases MAP kinase signaling and increases Hh signaling. They assume that the MAPK signaling is due to changes in Egfr activity but there are other tyrosine kinases active in CySCs, including PVR/VEGFR (PMID: 36400422), that impinge on MAPK. In any event ,their results are puzzling because lower Egfr should reduce CySC self-renewal and CySC number (Amoyel, 2016) and the ability of cyst cells to encapsulate gonialblasts (Lenhart Dev Cell 2015). The increased Hh should increase CySC number and the ability of CySCs to outcompete GSCs. The fact that the average total number of GSCs declines in tj&gt;SODi testes suggests that high ROS CySCs are indeed outcompeting GSCs. However, as I wrote in myfirst critique, the characterization of the high ROS soma is incomplete. And the role of high ROS in the hub cells is acknowledged but not investigated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s concern that our study primarily examines a developmental effect. Our rationale was that redox imbalance during early stages can set longterm trajectories for stem cell behavior and niche organization, which ultimately manifest in adult testes.</p>
<p>We agree that sole evaluation of Erk levels may not reflect the actual status of EGFR signalling and there is an apparent contradictory observation of low Erk and high CySC self-renewal. We believe that this ROS mediated change in Erk status, resulting in high CySC proliferation, might be an outcome of an interplay between other RTKs beyond EGFR. While the expansion of CySCs is primarily governed by Hh, a detailed dissection of these pathways under altered redox environment will be an interesting work to develop in future. Regarding the GSC number, it cannot be definitively stated that high ROS-CySCs are indeed outcompeting the GSCs, but yes, that possibility parallely exists. However, in presence case, there is no denying that the ROS levels of GSCs are indeed high under high CySC-ROS condition. It is known that ROS imbalance in GSCs promote their differentiation which was also observed in the present study through Bam staining. Therefore, redox mediated reduction in GSC number cannot be completely ruled out.  We have already discussed these points in the revised manuscript and suggest possible non-canonical effects of ROS on signal integration within CySCs that might reconcile these findings. Further, in the present study, we have focussed on redox interplay between the two stem cell populations (GSC and CySC) of the niche. Hence, we have not covered the redox profiling of the hub in detail.</p>

<p>The paragraph in the introduction (lines 62-76) mentions autonomous ROS levels in stem cells, not the transfer of ROS from one cell to another. And this paragraph is confusing because it starts with the (inaccurate) statement all stem cells have low ROS and then they discuss ISCs, which have high ROS.</p>

<p>We have revised the paragraph for clarity. It now distinguishes between stem cell types with low versus relatively high ROS requirements (e.g., ISCs, HSCs, NSCs) and includes recent evidence of non-autonomous ROS signaling, such as paracrine ROS action from pericardial cells to cardiomyocytes and gap-junction–mediated ROS waves in cardiomyocyte monolayers. This resolves the ambiguity and presents a balanced view of autonomous and nonautonomous ROS regulation.</p>

<p>While there has been an improvement in the scholarship of the testis, there are still places where the correct paper is not cited and issues with the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All concerns regarding missing or incorrect citations and textual issues have now been carefully addressed and corrected. Relevant references have been added in the appropriate places to ensure accuracy.</p>

<p>The authors are encouraged to more completely characterize the phenotype of high ROS in hub and CySCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included improved images showing the respective ROS profiles GSCs, CySCs and the hub. As mentioned in the earlier response, this work focuses on the redox interplay between GSCs and CySCs hence, we have not included any analysis on hub. However, we agree with reviewer that the hub contributions should also be evaluated as a future direction.</p>
