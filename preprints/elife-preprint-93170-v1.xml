<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We recently described our initial efforts to develop a model for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that were differentiated to form pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), a putative cell of origin for neuroendocrine-positive SCLC. Although reduced expression of the tumor suppressor genes <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> allowed the induced PNECs to form subcutaneous growths in immune-deficient mice, the tumors did not display the aggressive characteristics of SCLC seen in human patients. Here we report that the additional, doxycycline-regulated expression of a transgene encoding wild-type or mutant cMYC protein promotes rapid growth, invasion, and metastasis of these hESC-derived cells after injection into the renal capsule. Similar to others, we find that the addition of cMYC encourages the formation of the SCLC-N subtype, marked by high levels of <italic>NEUROD1</italic> RNA. Using paired primary and metastatic samples for RNA sequencing, we observe that the subtype of SCLC does not change upon metastatic spread and that production of NEUROD1 is maintained. We also describe histological features of these malignant, SCLC-like tumors derived from hESCs and discuss potential uses of this model in efforts to control and better understand this recalcitrant neoplasm.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>From the earliest days of cancer research, attempts to understand the mechanisms of carcinogenesis have depended on experimental models to circumvent the ethical obstacles to performing experiments in human subjects. Such model systems have ranged from normal and cancerous human cells grown in animals or in cell culture to the generation or manipulation of cancers arising from normal cells in whole animals. The success of such approaches is often measured by the similarities of model systems to the observed traits of cancers that have arisen naturally in human subjects. But the utility of certain model systems can also be appraised by evaluation of the information that emerges from them, even when the models lack a clear relationship to any specific type of human cancer. The transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts by Rous sarcoma virus or the induction of leukemias with various murine leukemia viruses exemplify models that lack verisimilitude but nevertheless have revealed major features of carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>).</p>
<p>A common complaint about many models of cancer is that the transformation of a normal cell to a malignant cell occurs in non-human cells. Efforts to transform human cells are often limited by the difficulties of growing human cells in culture and uncertainty about the developmental stage of a given cell lineage at which transformation generally occurs. Techniques for generating, propagating, and differentiating human stem cells -either tissue-specific stem cells or pluripotent stem cells -have raised the possibility of studying carcinogenesis in a wide variety of human cell lineages, as initially demonstrated for gliomas derived from induced human pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>We have recently attempted to study the mechanisms by which small cell lung cancer (SCLC) arises in human lung cells by efficiently differentiating human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) into mature lung epithelial cells, including the likely precursor of SCLC (pulmonary neuroendocrine cells [PNECs]) and then simulating loss of function of the tumor suppressor genes <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic>, tumor suppressors commonly lost in human SCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). PNEC-like cells that have lost the function of these two tumor suppressor genes, by expression of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) specific for <italic>RB1</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic>, can form tumors subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice; however, these tumors grow slowly and do not invade or metastasize, standing in contrast to what is known about the clinical presentation and behavior of SCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Thus, the original hESC-derived SCLC models we generated appeared to be benign growths that do not resemble SCLCs functionally, limiting their utility as models for aggressive human SCLC.</p>
<p>Our earlier findings are consistent with the idea that full transformation of PNECs to form malignant SCLC requires additional changes beyond restricted expression of the tumor suppressor genes <italic>RB1</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic>, such as heightened expression of a proto-oncogene in the <italic>MYC</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In an attempt to show that we can generate more aggressive, SCLC-like tumors from PNECs derived from hESCs, we have added efficiently transcribed <italic>cMYC</italic> oncogenes to cells in which expression of <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> are inhibited by shRNAs. When these cells were then injected into renal capsules of immunodeficient mice, some produced rapidly expanding tumors that invaded locally and sometimes formed metastatic growths, mostly in the liver.</p>
<p>In this report, we describe morphological and transcriptional features of these tumors and discuss how the addition of putative drivers of SCLCs can be used to study the mechanism of carcinogenesis and to test candidate therapies for this “recalcitrant” cancer.</p>

<title>Generation of lung cells, including PNECs, from hESCs</title>
<p>Protocols for maintenance of hESCs and generation of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), and other lung cells were modified from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Two hESC lines, RUES2 (Rockefeller University Embryonic Stem Cell Line 2, NIH approval number NIH hESC-09-0013, Registration number 0013; passage 7-10) and ES02 (HES2, NIH registry, WiCell Research Insititute, Inc. passage 3-7) were cultured and maintained in an undifferentiated state on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Global Stem, cat. no. GSC-6001G). All cells were purchased from ATCC or WiCell in the past 3 years and tests for mycoplasma were negative. The hESC lines were regularly checked for chromosome abnormalities and maintained with normal chromosome numbers. All embryonic stem cell studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Chicago, or by the Tri-Institutional ESCRO committee under protocols 2016-01-002 and 2017-10-004 (Weill Cornell Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Rockefeller University).</p>
<p>hESC differentiation into endoderm was performed in serum-free differentiation (SFD) media of DMEM/F12 (3:1) (Life Technologies) supplemented with N2 (Life Technologies), B27 (Life Technologies), ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml, Sigma), Glutamax (2 mM, Life Technologies), monothioglycerol (0.4 μM, Sigma), 0.05% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Life Technologies) at 37C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> / 5% O<sub>2</sub> / 90% N<sub>2</sub> environment. hESCs were treated with Accutase (Stemcell technology) and plated onto low attachment 6-well plates (Corning Incorporated, Tewksbury MA), resuspended in endoderm induction media containing Y-27632 (10 μM), human BMP4 (0.5 ng/ml), human bFGF, (2.5 ng/ml), and human Activin A (100 ng/ml) for 72 – 84 hours (hrs) dependent on the formation rates of endoderm cells. On day 3 or 3.5, the embryoid bodies were dissociated into single cells using 0.05% Trypsin/0.02% EDTA and plated onto fibronectin-coated (Sigma), 24-well tissue culture plates (∼100,000– 150,000 cells/well). For induction of anterior foregut endoderm, the endoderm cells were cultured in SFD medium supplemented with 1.5 μM Dorsomorphin dihydrochloride and 10 μM SB431542 for 36-48 hrs, and then switched to 36-48 hrs of 10 μM SB431542 and 1 μM IWP2 treatment.</p>
<p>For induction of early-stage lung progenitor cells (days 6–15), the resulting anterior foregut endoderm was treated with CHIR99021 (3 μM), human FGF10 (10 ng/ml), human FGF7 (10 ng/ml), human BMP4 (10 ng/ml) and all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid (ATRA; 50nM) in SFD medium for 8–10d. Day 10–15 cultures were maintained in a 5% CO2/air environment. On days 15 and 16, the lung field progenitor cells were re-plated after brief one-minute trypsinization onto fibronectin-coated plates, in the presence of SFD containing either a combination of five factors: CHIR99021 (3 μM), human FGF10 (10 ng/ml), human FGF7 (10 ng/ml), human BMP4 (10 ng/ml), and ATRA (50 nM), or three factors: CHIR99021 (3 μM), human FGF10 (10 ng/ml), and human FGF7 (10 ng/ml) for days 14-16. Day 16–25 cultures of late-stage lung progenitor cells were maintained in SFD media containing CHIR99021 (3 μM), human FGF10 (10 ng/ml), and human FGF7 (10 ng/ml) in a 5% CO2 / air environment.</p>
<p>For differentiation of mature lung cells (days 25–55), cultures were re-plated after brief trypsinization onto 3.3% matrigel coated 24-well plates in SFD media containing maturation components CHIR99021 (3 μM), human FGF10 (10 ng/ml), human FGF7 (10 ng/ml), and DCI (50 nM Dexamethasone, 0.1 mM 8-bromo-cAMP and 0.1 mM IBMX (3,7-dihydro-1-methyl-3-(2-methylpropyl)-1<italic>H</italic>-purine-2,6-dione). DAPT (10 μM) was added to the maturation media for induction of PNECs. All growth factors and most small molecules used for hESC differentiation were purchased from R&amp;D Systems. ATRA, 8-bromo-cAMP, IBMX and DAPT were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.</p>

<title>Lentivirus transduction of hESCs</title>
<p>HSC lines were constructed to contain DOX-inducible cassettes encoding shRNAs specific for the <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> tumor suppressor genes (RP cells) and RP cells containing DOX-inducible cassettes encoding wildtype human cMYC or a stable, mutant version of cMYC (T58A), to generate RPM and RPM (T58A) cells. The lentiviral vector expressing tetracycline (TET)-inducible shRNA against human P53 was purchased from Gentarget. Inc. (cat# LVP-343-RB-PBS). The lentiviral vectors expressing TET-inducible shRNAs against human <italic>RB1</italic> construct (“pSLIK sh human Rb 1534 hyg” was a gift from Julien Sage; plasmid # 31500) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), TET-inducible wild type cMYC (FUW-tetO-hMYC was a gift from Rudolf Jaenisch; plasmid # 20723) or mutant cMYC (T58A) tagged at the N-terminus with three copies of a hemagglutinin tag (3X-HA) (pLV-tetO-myc T58A was a gift from Konrad Hochedlinger; plasmid # 19763) were obtained from Addgene and sequence verified prior to use. The shRNA target sequences are as follows: RB1 #1: 5’-GGACATGTGAACTTATATA-3’, RB1 #2: 5’-GAACGATTATCCATTCAAA-3’, p53: 5’-CACCATCCACTACAACTACAT-3’.</p>
<p>To generate lentiviral particles, the above plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells with the PC-Pack2 lentiviral packaging mix (Cellecta, Inc.), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. High titer viral particles were used to transduce hESCs in serum-free conditions and antibiotic selection of transduced hESCs was performed without MEF feeder cells, using mTeSR1 stem cell media (Stemcell Tech. Inc.). The efficiency of <italic>RB1</italic> or <italic>P53</italic> knockdown and production of cMYC or cMYC (T58A) were determined by Western Blot after antibiotic selection using the following antibodies: anti-RB1 (Cell Signaling, clone 4H1, Cat# 9309), anti-P53 (Santa Cruz, clone DO-1, Cat# Sc-126), anti-MYC (Cell Signaling, clone D84C12, Cat# 5605), anti-HA (Cell Signaling, clone 6E2, Cat#2367), and anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling, clone 14C10, Cat# 2118). All antibodies for Western Blot were used at a 1:500 working dilution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Living cells in culture were directly fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 25 min, followed with 15 min permeabilization in 1% Triton X-100. Histology on tissues from mice was performed on paraffin-embedded or frozen sections from xenografted tumors and corresponding normal tissues, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Tissues were either fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin and transferred to 70% ethanol, followed by paraffin embedding, or snap frozen in O.C.T medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and fixed in 10% buffered formalin, followed by paraffin embedding. For immunofluorescence, cells or tissue sections were immunostained with antibodies and counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Adjacent sections stained with H&amp;E were used for comparison.</p>
<p>Antibodies used for immunostaining or western blot experiments are as follows: anti-CGRP (Sigma, Clone CD8, Cat# c9487), anti-ASCL1 (Sigma, clone 2D9, Cat# SAB1403577), anti-NCAM1/CD56 (R&amp;D systems, cat# AF2408), anti-Ki67 (Cell Signaling, clone D2H10, Cat# 9027, anti-MYC (Abcam, clone Y69, Cat# ab32072), and anti-NEUROD1 (Sigma-Aldrich, clone 3H8, Cat# WH004760M1). All antibodies were used at a 1:150 working dilution.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS)</title>
<p>FACS to detect definitive endoderm cells was performed using APC anti-c-KIT (Invitrogen, Cat# CD11705), PE anti-human CXCR4 (Biolegend, Clone 12G5, Cat# 306506) and APC anti-EpCAM (Invitrogen, Clone G8.8, Cat# 17-5791-80) at 1:100 dilution. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 30 minutes at 4°C, then washed and suspended in 0.1% BSA/PBS buffer. PE and APC filters were then used to detect cells double positive for KIT and CXCR4, or EpCAM and CXCR4 by signal intensity gating. FACS with anti-CGRP antibody (Abcam, clone 4902, Cat# ab81887) was used to detect CGRP+ cells. Cells were first incubated with anti-human CGRP antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature followed with incubation (1:1000) of secondary antibody conjugated with R-phycoerythrin (PE) for 30 min at room temperature. Then cells were washed and suspended in 0.1% BSA/PBS buffer. PE filter was then used to separate cells into CGRP+ and CGRP-sub-groups by signal intensity gating. Negative controls stained with isotype controls were performed with sample measurements. Cells were sorted on a BD FACSAria II and data were analyzed in FlowJo.</p>

<title>Xenograft formation</title>
<p>0.3-0.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> hESC-derived lung cells or PNECs (at day 55 with or without 30 days of prior exposure to 10 μM DAPT alone or to 10 μM DAPT and 1 μM doxycycline to reduce <italic>P53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic>, and also induce <italic>MYC</italic> expression) were injected subcutaneously or under the renal capsule of 6-8 weeks old, female NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkdc</italic><sup><italic>scid</italic></sup> <italic>Il2rg</italic><sup><italic>tm1WjI</italic></sup>/SzJ (NSG) mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Doxycycline diet began the day after injection (Teklad; 625ppm); tumor development was monitored at least 2-3 times weekly. When animals became moribund or tumor size reached protocol limitations, mice were sacrificed, necropsy performed, and tumors harvested for further histological or molecular study.</p>

<title>Single cell sequencing and data analysis</title>
<p>Single-cell capture, reverse transcription, cell lysis, and library preparation were carried out by the WCM Epigenomics Core Facility using Chromium Single Cell 3’ v3 kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics, USA). Single cell suspenions of RUES2-dervied RPM and RPM (T58A) day 50 cultures were prepared by incubating wells in 0.05% Trypsin/0.02% EDTA for 10-15 min. Digestions were then quenched with excess 0.1% BSA/PBS buffer and passed through 40μm mesh strainer. EGFP+ singlets were sorted at the WCM Flow Cytometry Core Facility on a BD Influx or Sony MA900 cell sorter. Each RUES2-dervied RPM and RPM(T58A) day 50 culture pools were isolated from 3 wells of a 12-well plate across two biological replicates, targeting ∼50,000 viable, EGFP+ viable cells per replicate. Cell counts were then adjusted to 6000-9000 cells/50uL in PBS by Trypan Blue exclusion to achieve an estimated capture of 4000-5000 cells. Sequencing was performed by the WCM Genomics Resources Core Facility on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, paired-end protocol with 26 base pairs for read 1 and 98 bases for read 2). Single cell RNA sequencing from RP cultures were obtained from previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Transcript abundance was quantified by mapping sequencing reads to a custom human transcriptome reference (GENCODE v42, hg38) that included EGFP and was performed using simpleaf/alevin-fry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>Single-cell analyses, including quality filtering, integration, clustering, differential gene expression and reduced-dimensionality visualization, were performed using the Seurat package in R as described in the package SCTransform tutorial (Version 4.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Briefly, cells to be included in the analysis were required to have at least 4000 and at most 45000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and expressed between 1000 and 7,500 unique genes. In addition, cells were excluded if more than 10% of the determined RNA sequences mapped to mitochondrial genes or if they were classified as doublets by scds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). In total, 7,728 cells from two RP culture samples, 1,875 cells from RPM cultures, 1,562 cells from RPM (T58A) cultures, 3,401 cells from RPM tumors and 3,463 cells from RPM(T58A) tumors passed these filters for quality. Samples were integrated using Harmony with the top 15 principal components and was run with up to 50 iterations of the algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Dimensionality reduction was achieved by creating a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) of the first 15 dimensions of harmony integration. Clustering resolution was set at 0.1 for the integrated dataset, resulting in three clusters. Subclustering was conducted in a similar manner and involved re-integration of cells from the neuroendocrine cluster and used identical parameters. Cell type annotation was called using the Azimuth functionality within the Seurat package followed by manual inspection, and enrichment analysis was conducted using enrichR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). A lung atlas containing 584,884 cells was obtained for Azimuth mediated reference mapping from the HubMap portal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>

<title>Generation of hESC-derived PNEC-like cells that express transgenes encoding CMYC</title>
<p>We usd lentivirus vectors encoding doxycycline (DOX)-inducible mRNAs for wildtype (WT) and mutant (T58A) human cMYC (<italic>see Methods</italic>) to infect previously described hESCs from the RUES2 cell line carrying transgenes encoding DOX-inducible small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) complementary to <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic>.

<title>RUES2-derived PNECs that express WT or T58A cMYC show enhanced oncogenicity as xenografts in the renal capsule of immunodeficient mice</title>
<p>To determine whether production of WT or mutant MYC proteins renders PNECs derived from RPM lines more oncogenic, we sorted CGRP-positive RPM and RPM (T58A) cells from cultures of LCs treated with DAPT and injected the cells subcutaneously or into the renal capsule of immunodeficient mice (the NOG strain: NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rγnull) as depicted in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>.

<title>Growth of RUES2-derived RPM tumors are DOX-dependent</title>
<p>Thus far, our data suggest that at least some RUES2-derived, PNEC-like cells in which expression of two tumor suppressor genes, <italic>RB1</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic>, is restricted, RP cells, can be transformed into aggressive, metastatic cells by the addition of transgenes encoding WT or mutant cMYC protein (hereafter referred to as “RPM” or “RPM (T58A)” cells). However, we had not directly compared the relative growth rates of these engineered cell types.</p>
<p>We therefore engrafted immunocompromised mice subcutaneously with equivalent numbers of RP, RPM, or RPM (T58A) cells and monitored tumor growth rates. We noted that the volumes of RPM and RPM (T58A)-derived tumors quickly exceeded the volumes of RP-derived tumors (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). The rapid growth of RPM tumors was dependent on continuous provision of DOX in the diet. If animals on a DOX-free diet were engrafted subcutaneously with RPM or RPM (T58A) cells, they failed to produce tumors (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>; <italic>left</italic>). However, tumor growth was observed in some mice engrafted with such cells if the animals were placed on a DOX-containing diet up to one month after injection (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold> ; <italic>right</italic>). These findings suggest that at least some of the RPM cells remained viable and responsive to the oncogenic effects of depleting RB1 and TP53 and producing cMYC.</p>
<p>The rapid growth and features of RPM and RPM (T58A) tumors in these experiments were histologically consistent with SCLC. Critically, subcutaneous injection did not produce metastastic disease to the liver (<italic>not shown</italic>) nor was there evidence of gross metastases to the lungs in any of the mice examined. (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). These findings suggest that SCLC-like tumors composed of RUES2-derived RPM cells grow rapidly after subcutaneous implantation, but may require a different microenvironment, such as the vascular rich, highly perfused renal capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), providing a more hospitable environment for metastatic seeding.</p>

<title>Inoculation of the renal capsule facilitates metastasis of the RUES2-derived RPM tumors</title>
<p>RPM tumors, as compared to RP tumors, were notable for increased vascularization, larger volume and invasion into surrounding endothelium (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref></bold> to <bold>C</bold>). RPM and RPM (T58A) PNECs injected into the renal capsule of immunocompromised mice also displayed frequent metastasis to the liver (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). For animals that received DOX, but not in animals deprived of DOX, approximately half displayed metastases in distal organs, such as liver or lung (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>).

<title>RUES2-derived RPM tumors most closely resemble the NEUROD1-high (SCLC-N) subtype of SCLC</title>
<p>To better understand the characteristics of RUES2-derived RPM tumors, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on culture-derived (“2D”) and tumor-derived RPM and RPM (T58A) viable EGFP+ cells. By integrating previously published RUES2-derived RP single cell data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), we observed three dominant cell-type groups in transcriptional space, using reference-mapping, enrichment analysis and manual curation to identify cell lineage likelihood: a basal-like cluster marked by expression of <italic>KRT19</italic>, a fibroblast-like cluster marked by expression of <italic>COL1A1</italic>, and the most prominent cluster of cells appearing to have features of neuroendocrine differentiation, marked by expression of the neuroendocrine lineage defining transcription factor <italic>ASCL1</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplemental Table 1</bold>). Comparing the recently described SCLC subtype markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) across these datasets showed that cells within the neuroendocrine differentiation cluster cells expressed <italic>ASCL1</italic> and <italic>NEUROD1</italic>, whereas <italic>POU2F3</italic> RNA was not detected. Levels of <italic>YAP1</italic> RNA were variable and were not co-expressed with either <italic>ASCL1</italic> or <italic>NEUROD1</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). <italic>YAP1</italic> expression was mostly attributed to fibroblast- and basal-like cells that are often observed in long-term cultures of differentiated hESCs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we asked whether the over-expression of <italic>MYC</italic> in RPM cells was associated with increased neuroendocrine differentiation when compared to cell lines that did not contain c<italic>MYC</italic> transgenes (i.e. RP cells). One notable difference between our prior work and this study was our attempt to increase the tumor cell component of the RPM and RPM (T58A) samples by sorting cells for high EGFP expression. EGFP is expressed in <italic>cis</italic> with the <italic>RB1</italic> targeting shRNA; however, EGFP is not expressed uniformly across all cells following the differentiation protocol, suggesting some cells may silence the integrated vector. We performed differential cluster abundance analysis after accounting for the fraction of cells that were EGFP+ during cell sorting. These results indicated that RPM cell lines (WT or T58A) were associated with a two-fold increase in the neuroendocrine compartment when compared with RP cells (p &lt; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figures 1A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref></bold>). Similarly, RPM tumors had a three-fold enrichment of cells expressing neuroendocrine markers compared to RP cell lines (p &lt; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>). Together, these results suggest that the over-expression of either WT or T58A MYC yielded a larger neuroendocrine compartment.</p>
<p>By sub-clustering the neuroendocrine differentiation group, we could clearly identify <italic>ASCL1</italic>-high and <italic>NEUROD1</italic>-high compartments, as well as several other groups of cycling cells that did not cleanly fit into any lung lineage cell identity (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, Supplemental Table 2</bold>). We conducted differential gene expression to further characterize the <italic>NEUROD1</italic>-high (abbreviated “NE-variant”) and <italic>ASCL1</italic>-high (abbreivated “NE”) clusters observed with RPM cells (from cell lines and tumors) and found that the NE-variant cluster was associated with increased expression of genes highly expressed in variant small cell lung cancer (<italic>NEUROD1, SCG3, IGFBPL1, SSTR2</italic> and c<italic>MYC)</italic> (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1C</xref>, Supplemental Table 3</bold>). In contrast, the NE (or “NE-classic”) cluster was linked to heightened expression of a variety of genes ranging from histones (<italic>HISTH1B, HISTH1D</italic>) to redox processes (<italic>MT1E, MT2A</italic>) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). Gene set enrichment analysis of these results in the NE-variant cluster revealed increased expression of genes associated with activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT; p = 6.81x10<sup>-3</sup>) and pancreatic beta cell signaling (p = 1.01x10<sup>-3</sup>). However, this cluster was also linked to lower levels of oxidative phosphorylation (p = 1.07x10<sup>-25</sup>), possibly suggesting these sub-groups of cells are biologically different (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1D</xref></bold>). Further examination of the <italic>ASCL1</italic>-high and <italic>NEUROD1</italic>-high clusters revealed that, across both clusters, RPM and RPM (T58A) cells were associated with higher expression of genes associated with cells in dividing phases of the cell cycle than were observed RP cultures. We compared the proportion of G2M cells between culture-derived RPM and RP models. This revealed that RPM cells were associated with a 10- and 11-fold increase in the NE and NE-variant clusters respectively (NE p = 9.6x10<sup>-6</sup>, NE-Variant p = 1.9x10<sup>-7</sup>) with a relative reduction in cells in the G1 phase (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>). Similar trends were observed from data in human tumors (NE p &lt; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>, NE-Variant p = 1.5x10<sup>-13</sup>, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Given the striking increase in proliferation in cMYC producing cells, we sought to understand the association between c<italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>ASCL1</italic> or <italic>NEUROD1</italic> expression. We computed the cellular density of co-expression patterns of cells that express c<italic>MYC</italic> in addition to either <italic>ASCL1</italic> or <italic>NEUROD1</italic>. This identified that the joint density was highest for cells that co-express c<italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>NEUROD1</italic> and was localized to the <italic>NEUROD1</italic>-high cluster (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1E</xref></bold>). In comparison, c<italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>ASCL1</italic> co-expression patterns were heterogenous, and found in the <italic>ASCL1</italic>-high cluster as well as in cells that could not be annotated with confidence. Moreover, modest correlation between c<italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>NEUROD1</italic> expression was identified in our single cell data (Pearson r = 0.17, p = 3.7x10<sup>-4</sup>, <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1F</xref></bold>). Given that single cell sequencing experiments suffer from a high dropout rate, we attempted to validate c<italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>NEUROD1</italic> co-expression patterns in bulk primary and metastatic RPM tumors. Although we couldn’t determine co-expression within the same cell using bulk gene expression data, we identified an extremely strong correlation between the expression of these two genes (Pearson r = 0.93, p = 0.02, <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1G</xref></bold>). Taken together, we show that the over-expression of <italic>MYC</italic> (WT or T58A) may be linked to an SCLC-N phenotype.</p>
<p>Upon identification of the <italic>ASCL1</italic>- and <italic>NEUROD1</italic>-high clusters, we sought to further characterize how closely they resemble SCLC tumors transcriptionally using a two-pronged approach. First, we overlayed SCLC-A, SCLC-N and SCLC-P signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) from our single cell data and calculated subtype enrichment scores. Enrichment patterns in RPM and RPM (T58A) xenografts revealed that both <italic>ASCL1</italic>- and <italic>NEUROD1</italic>-high clusters expressed SCLC-N-associated genes more frequently than SCLC-A and SCLC-P-associated counterparts (p &lt; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>). In contrast, RP cell cultures more closely resembled cells from tumors with an SCLC-A phenotype (p &lt; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>, <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1H</xref></bold>). Second, we identified the transcriptional identity of RPM xenografts and paired metastases by cellular deconvolution. Bulk gene expression of RPM tumors along with human SCLC biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) were deconvolved into SCLC subtypes. This identified relative cellular proportions of SCLC subtypes in bulk RNA-seq data. Overall, we found high concordance with published subtype annotations and those predicted by our analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Moreover, we found that all RPM xenografts strongly exhibited an SCLC-N transcriptional program. Taken together, these data suggest that over-expression of wild type or mutant <italic>MYC</italic> alters the transcriptional identity of RP cells, encouraging neuroendocrine differentiation, and may assist with the transformation from a SCLC-A to SCLC-N phenotype.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this report, we show that the addition of an efficiently expressed transgene encoding normal or mutant human cMYC can convert weakly tumorigenic human PNEC cells, derived from a human ESC line and depleted of tumor suppressors RB1 and TP53, into highly malignant, metastatic SCLC-like cancers after implantation into the renal capsule of immunodeficient mice.</p>
<p>Experimental models for understanding the origins, behaviors, and control of human cancers have been developed in numerous ways for more than a century. Some of the models depend on producing tumors in animals or transforming the behavior of cells growing in culture with viruses, chemical agents, genetic changes, or other perturbations, or by deriving cells from human cancers and growing them in animals or in tissue culture. The choice of these approaches have been influenced by the goals of the research, the type of cancer under study, and available technologies.</p>
<p>Because SCLC is a highly aggressive cancer with a relatively stereotypic genotype that is generally recalcitrant to therapeutic strategies that have not changed appreciably in the past thirty years, we have been attempting to generate a model for SCLC in which the cancer cells are human in origin, derived from the most commonly affected pulmonary cell lineage (neuroendocrine), and equipped with the major and most common genotypic and phenotypic changes characteristic of SCLC.</p>
<p>The most obvious use of these cells (the RPM lines described here) is for the evaluation of the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents acting directly on tumor cells during growth in culture or during growth as xenografts in immunosuppressed mice. However, treatment strategies that involve host elements other than the tumor itself, such as immune cells or other features of the tumor micro-environment, might require an experimental platform more complex that those that we have constructed here.</p>
<p>Our choice of cMYC to serve as an oncogenic driver in hESC-derived PNECs was based on both the frequent finding of high levels of <italic>cMYC</italic> RNA in human SCLC and the use of Myc over-expression strategies to generate aggressive mouse models of SCLC (7, 8, 41-43). However, not all human SCLC tumors have abundant <italic>cMYC</italic> RNA, and other genes, including other members of the MYC gene family, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SCLC. So it will be interesting to compare the ability of transgenes encoding other MYC proteins, such as <italic>NMYC</italic> and <italic>LMYC</italic>, as well as other oncoproteins (both those implicated and not implicated in human SCLC carcinogenesis) to convert RP cells into malignant tumors, as we have observed here with RPM cells. In particular, it may be important to determine whether hESC-derived SCLC cells with varied genotypes are liable to metastasize to specific sites such as the brain and bone, which are commonly affected in patients with SCLC, but were not sites for metatastic growth in the experiments reported here. Finally, the role of other tumor suppressor genes, such as <italic>PTEN</italic> – implicated in the development of mouse models of histological transformation of LUAD to SCLC that we have recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) – should also be examined in this human ESC-derived model.</p>
<p>We have used transcriptional profiling as a means to compare human ESC-derived SCLC grown from RPM cells with SCLC tumor samples from patients. Other aspects of tumor cell behavior – including pathophysiological features, responses to therapeutic strategies, and the appearance of molecular, metabolic, and immunological markers – might also provide means to determine the degree of similarity between this novel stem cell-derived model and genuine human neoplasms.</p>
<p>Transcriptional profiling has also allowed us to conclude that the hESC-derived tumors arising from RPM RUES2 cells belong to the SCLC-N subtype, one of the major subtypes of SCLC now recognized by several laboratories and clinicians studying SCLC. It is unclear whether SCLC-N truly represents a subtype of SCLC with distinct outcomes and therapeutic sensitivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), or rather a snapshop from a continuum in tumor evolution driven [principally] by <italic>MYC</italic> towards an aggressive, recalcitrant disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Future studies of stem cell-derived SCLC should consider ways to generate tumors that model the other common subtypes including SCLC-P and SCLC-I (“inflamed” SCLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). This might be achieved by altering the cancer genotype, by using a differentiation scheme that produces physiologically varied precursor cells, or by employing a wider variety of hESCs to develop SCLCs.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that in the experiments reported here metastatic spread was observed from RPM tumors growing initially in the renal capsule but not from primary subcutaneous tumors initiated with the same cell culture. It may prove important to test other sites of primary tumor growth, with RPM cells from the RUES2 line or with other SCLC models, to determine the degree to which metastatic spread depends on the site of growth of the primary tumor and to identify specific factors that promote such spread.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors introduced their previous paper with the concise statement that &quot;the relationships between lineage-specific attributes and genotypic differences of tumors are not understood&quot; (Chen et al., JEM 2019, PMID: 30737256). For example, it is not clear why combined loss of RB1 and TP53 is required for tumorigenesis in SCLC or other aggressive neuroendocrine (NE) cancers, or why the oncogenic mutations in KRAS or EGFR that drive NSCLC tumorigenesis are found so infrequently in SCLC. This is the main question addressed by the previous and current papers.</p>
<p>One approach to this question is to identify a discrete set of genetic/biochemical manipulations that are sufficient to transform non-malignant human cells into SCLC-like tumors. One group reported the transformation of primary human bronchial epithelial cells into NE tumors through a complex lentiviral cocktail involving the inactivation of pRB and p53 and activation of AKT, cMYC, and BCL2 (PARCB) (Park et al., Science 2018, PMID: 30287662). The cocktail previously reported by Chen and colleagues to transform human pluripotent stem-cell (hPSC)-derived lung progenitors (LPs) into NE xenografts was more concise: DAPT to inactivate NOTCH signaling combined with shRNAs against RB1 and TP53. However, the resulting RP xenografts lacked important characteristics of SCLC. Unlike SCLC, these tumors proliferated slowly and did not metastasize, and although small subpopulations expressed MYC or MYCL, none expressed NEUROD1.</p>
<p>MYC is frequently amplified or expressed at high levels in SCLC, and here, the authors have tested whether inducible expression of MYC could increase the resemblance of their hPSC-derived NE tumors to SCLC. These RPM cells (or RPM T58A with stabilized cMYC) engrafted more consistently and grew more rapidly than RP cells, and unlike RP cells, formed liver metastases when injected into the renal capsule. Gene expression analyses revealed that RPM tumor subpopulations expressed NEUROD1, ASCL1, and/or YAP1.</p>
<p>The hPSC-derived RPM model is a major advance over the previous RP model. This may become a powerful tool for understanding SCLC tumorigenesis and progression and for discovering gene dependencies and molecular targets for novel therapies. However, the specific role of cMYC in this model needs to be clarified.</p>
<p>cMYC can drive proliferation, tumorigenesis, or apoptosis in a variety of lineages depending on concurrent mutations. For example, in the Park et al., study, normal human prostate cells could be reprogrammed to form adenocarcinoma-like tumors by activation of cMYC and AKT alone, without manipulation of TP53 or RB1. In their previous manuscript, the authors carefully showed the role of each molecular manipulation in NE tumorigenesis. DAPT was required for NE differentiation of LPs to PNECs, shRB1 was required for expansion of the PNECs, and shTP53 was required for xenograft formation. cMYC expression could influence each of these steps, and importantly, could render some steps dispensable. For example, shRB1 was previously necessary to expand the DAPT-induced PNECs, as neither shTP53 nor activation of KRAS or EGFR had no effect on this population, but perhaps cMYC overexpression could expand PNECs even in the presence of pRB, or even induce LPs to become PNECs without DAPT. Similarly, both shRB1 and shTP53 were necessary for xenograft formation, but maybe not if cMYC is overexpressed. If a molecular hallmark of SCLC, such as loss of RB1 or TP53, has become dispensable with the addition of cMYC, this information is critically important in interpreting this as a model of SCLC tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>To interpret the role of cMYC expression in hPSC-derived RPM tumors, we need to know what this manipulation does without manipulation of pRB, p53, or NOTCH, alone or in combination. Seven relevant combinations should be presented in this manuscript: (1) cMYC alone in LPs, (2) cMYC + DAPT, (3) cMYC + shRB1, (4) cMYC + DAPT + shRB1, (5) cMYC + shTP53, (6) cMYC + DAPT + shTP53, and (7) cMYC + shRB1 + shTP53. Wild-type cMYC is sufficient; further exploration with the T58A mutant would not be necessary.</p>
<p>This reviewer considers that there should be a presentation of the effects of these combinations on LP differentiation to PNECs, expansion of PNECs as well as other lung cells, xenograft formation and histology, and xenograft growth rate and capacity for metastasis. If this could be clarified experimentally, and the results discussed in the context of other similar approaches such as the Park et al., paper, this study would be a major addition to the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Chen et al use human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to determine the impact of wildtype MYC and a point mutant stable form of MYC (MYC-T58A) in the transformation of induced pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNEC) in the context of RB1/P53 (RP) loss (tumor suppressors that are nearly universally lost in small cell lung cancer (SCLC)). Upon transplant into immune-deficient mice, they find that RP-MYC and RP-MYC-T58A cells grow more rapidly, and are more likely to be metastatic when transplanted into the kidney capsule, than RP controls. Through single-cell RNA sequencing and immunostaining approaches, they find that these RPM tumors and their metastases express NEUROD1, which is a transcription factor whose expression marks a distinct molecular state of SCLC. While MYC is already known to promote aggressive NEUROD1+ SCLC in other models, these data demonstrate its capacity in a human setting that provides a rationale for further use of the ESC-based model going forward. Overall, these findings provide a minor advance over the previous characterization of this ESC-based model of SCLC published in Chen et al, J Exp Med, 2019.</p>
<p>The major conclusion of the paper is generally well supported, but some minor conclusions are inadequate and require important controls and more careful analysis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. Both MYC and MYC-T58A yield similar results when RP-MYC and RP-MYCT58A PNEC ESCs are injected subcutaneously, or into the renal capsule, of immune-deficient mice, leading to the conclusion that MYC promotes faster growth and more metastases than RP controls.</p>
<p>2. Consistent with numerous prior studies in mice with a neuroendocrine (NE) cell of origin (Mollaoglu et al, Cancer Cell, 2017; Ireland et al, Cancer Cell, 2020; Olsen et al, Genes Dev, 2021), MYC appears sufficient in the context of RB/P53 loss to induce the NEUROD1 state. Prior studies also show that MYC can convert human ASCL1+ neuroendocrine SCLC cell lines to a NEUROD1 state (Patel et al, Sci Advances, 2021); this study for the first time demonstrates that RB/P53/MYC from a human neuroendocrine cell of origin is sufficient to transform a NE state to aggressive NEUROD1+ SCLC. This finding provides a solid rationale for using the human ESC system to better understand the function of human oncogenes and tumor suppressors from a neuroendocrine origin.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. There is a major concern about the conclusion that MYC &quot;yields a larger neuroendocrine compartment&quot; related to Figures 4C and 4G, which is inadequately supported and likely inaccurate. There is overwhelming published data that while MYC can promote NEUROD1, it also tends to correlate with reduced ASCL1 and reduced NE fate (Mollaoglu et al, Cancer Cell, 2017; Zhang et al, TLCR, 2018; Ireland et al, Cancer Cell, 2020; Patel et al, Sci Advances, 2021). Most importantly, there is a lack of in vivo RP tumor controls to make the proper comparison to judge MYC's impact on neuroendocrine identity. RPM tumors are largely neuroendocrine compared to in vitro conditions, but since RP control tumors (in vivo) are missing, it is impossible to determine whether MYC promotes more or less neuroendocrine fate than RP controls. It is not appropriate to compare RPM tumors to in vitro RP cells when it comes to cell fate. Upon inspection of the sample identity in S1B, the fibroblast and basal-like cells appear to only grow in vitro and are not well represented in vivo; it is, therefore, unclear whether these are transformed or even lack RB/P53 or express MYC. Indeed, a close inspection of Figure S1B shows that RPM tumor cells have little ASCL1 expression, consistent with lower NE fate than expected in control RP tumors.</p>
<p>In addition, since MYC appears to require Notch signaling to induce NE fate (Ireland et al), the presence of DAPT in culture could enrich for NE fate despite MYC's presence. It's important to clarify in the legend of Fig 4A which samples are used in the scRNA-seq data and whether they were derived from in vitro or in vivo conditions (as such, Supplementary Figure S1B should be provided in the main figure). Given their conclusion is confusing and challenges robustly supported data in other models, it is critical to resolve this issue properly. I suspect when properly resolved, MYC actually consistently does reduce NE fate compared to RP controls, even though tumors are still relatively NE compared to completely distinct cellular identities such as fibroblasts.</p>
<p>2. The rigor of the conclusions in Figure 1 would be strengthened by comparing an equivalent number of RP animals in the renal capsule assay, which is n = 6 compared to n = 11-14 in the MYC conditions.</p>
<p>3. Statistical analysis is not provided for Figures 2A-2B, and while the results are compelling, may be strengthened by additional samples due to the variability observed.</p>
<p>4a. Related to Figure 3, primary tumors and liver metastases from RPM or RPM-T58A-expressing cells express NEUROD1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) but the putative negative controls (RP) are not shown, and there is no assessment of variability from tumor to tumor, ie, this is not quantified across multiple animals.</p>
<p>4b. Relatedly, MYC has been shown to be able to push cells beyond NEUROD1 to a double-negative or YAP1+ state (Mollaoglu et al, Cancer Cell, 2017; Ireland et al, Cancer Cell, 2020), but the authors do not assess subtype markers by IHC. They do show subtype markers by mRNA levels in Fig 4B, and since there is expression of ASCL1, and potentially expression of YAP1 and POU2F3, it would be valuable to examine the protein levels by IHC in control RP vs. RPM samples.</p>
<p>5. Given that MYC has been shown to function distinctly from MYCL in SCLC models, it would have raised the impact and value of the study if MYC was compared to MYCL or MYCL fusions in this context since generally, SCLC expresses a MYC family member. However, it is quite possible that the control RP cells do express MYCL, and as such, it would be useful to show.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors continue their study of the experimental model of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) they created from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using a protocol for differentiating the hESCs into pulmonary lineages followed by NOTCH signaling inactivation with DAPT, and then knockdown of TP53 and RB1 (RP models) with DOX inducible shRNAs. To this published model, they now add DOX-controlled activation of expression of a MYC or T58A MYC transgenes (RPM and RPMT58A models) and study the impact of this on xenograft tumor growth and metastases. Their major findings are that the addition of MYC increased dramatically subcutaneous tumor growth and also the growth of tumors implanted into the renal capsule. In addition, they only found liver and occasional lung metastases with renal capsule implantation. Molecular studies including scRNAseq showed that tumor lines with MYC or T58A MYC led surprisingly to more neuroendocrine differentiation, and (not surprisingly) that MYC expression was most highly correlated with NEUROD1 expression. Of interest, many of the hESCs with RPM/RPMT58A expressed ASCL1. Of note, even in the renal capsule RPM/RPMT58A models only 6/12 and 4/9 mice developed metastases (mainly liver with one lung metastasis) and a few mice of each type did not even develop a renal sub capsule tumor. The authors start their Discussion by concluding: &quot; In this report, we show that the addition of an efficiently expressed transgene encoding normal or mutant human cMYC can convert weakly tumorigenic human PNEC cells, derived from a human ESC line and depleted of tumor suppressors RB1 and TP53, into highly malignant, metastatic SCLC-like cancers after implantation into the renal capsule of immunodeficient mice.&quot;.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The in vivo study of a human preclinical model of SCLC demonstrates the important role of c-Myc in the development of a malignant phenotype and metastases. Also the role of c-Myc in selecting for expression of NEUROD1 lineage oncogene expression.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are no data on results from an orthotopic (pulmonary) implantation on generation of metastases; no comparative study of other myc family members (MYCL, MYCN); no indication of analyses of other common metastatic sites found in SCLC (e.g. brain, adrenal gland, lymph nodes, bone marrow); no studies of response to standard platin-etoposide doublet chemotherapy; no data on the status of NEUROD1 and ASCL1 expression in the individual metastatic lesions they identified.</p>

<p>We are grateful to the three reviewers and the editors who have provided comments about our manuscript, &quot;Formation of malignant, metastatic small cell lung cancers through overproduction of cMYC protein in TP53 and RB1 depleted pulmonary neuroendocrine cells derived from human embryonic stem cells.”</p>
<p>We are pleased that the reviewers recognized the importance of the problem we have addressed – namely, the need for better models of small cell lung cancer, a relatively common and refractory cancer.  We also appreciate their acknowledgement of the significance of our major finding: that addition of an efficiently expressed CMYC transgene to neuroendocrine cells derived from human embryonic stem cells in which the RB1 and TP53 genes have been suppressed serves to drive aggressive growth and metastatic spread, rendering this system an appealing one for future studies of this recalcitrant cancer.   Further, we acknowledge that more work needs to be done to more fully characterize and better understand the mechanistic features of this model system and to exploit it for therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p>More specifically, we agree with the reviewers that this manuscript would be stronger if it included: (i) tests of other oncogenes, especially other members of the MYC gene family, to serve as drivers of tumor growth and metastasis and tests of orthotropic implantation of cells into the lung; (ii) descriptions of how such tumors with various genotypes respond to therapeutic approaches, both established and novel; and (iii) a more complete assessment of the contribution of abundant MYC proteins to physiological changes in tumor cells, such as growth, apoptosis, and invasion.</p>
<p>While we wish we could provide such information, it is unrealistic to believe that it will be generated by the current constellation of authors in the foreseeable future.  Data in the present manuscript has been generated over nearly five years, mostly in the early phases of that interval.   Since then, some of us have moved from one institution to another, and some have shifted the focus of our studies.  Further delays in publishing the main messages in this paper will only delay the pursuit of further studies, most likely by others.  Indeed, one of the strongest justifications for the novel publication policies at eLife is to return control of the time for dissemination of results to the hands of the authors.  Our situation illustrates the wisdom of that approach.</p>
<p>We also note that the reviewers have raised a few issues that we aim to clarify by revisions of the current manuscript, thereby creating an improved Version of Record, within the next few weeks.   We acknowledge here the significance of those issues and the ambiguities noted by the reviewers.</p>
<p>The issues include the following point noted by more than one reviewer:  our claim that expression of the CMYC oncogene increases the neuroendocrine character of the tumors.  We recognize that this observation may be influenced by the nature of the analysis (single cell or bulk RNA sequencing), the choice of lineage markers (eg, NEUROD1 or ASCL1 or others), and the statistical evaluation of the data.  We will review these aspects of the problem and make appropriate changes in the text to be submitted as the Version of Record.</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 also makes a good point about the possible effects of CMYC on the differentiation of hESC-derived lung progenitors (LPs).  In this paper, we examine this issue only in LPs in which the tumor suppressor genes, RB1 and TP53, have been suppressed.  Further studies of the effect of CMYC on differentiation of LPs with various combinations of functional tumor suppressor genes might well prove valuable in exploring the origins of SCLC.</p>
<p>Finally, we wish to note that a topic discussed by Reviewer 1 (and by us) about the still poorly understood relationship between cancer genotypes and cell lineages has been partially addressed in a paper from our group that has been accepted for publication in Science.</p>
