<abstract>
<p>Predicting an individual’s behaviour in one task condition based on their behaviour in a different condition is a key challenge in modeling individual decision-making tendencies. We propose a novel framework that addresses this challenge by leveraging neural networks and introducing a concept we term the “individual latent representation.” This representation, extracted from behaviour in a “source” task condition via an encoder network, captures an individual’s unique decision-making tendencies. A decoder network then utilizes this representation to generate the weights of a task-specific neural network (a “task solver”), which predicts the individual’s behaviour in a “target” task condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two distinct decision-making tasks: a value-guided task and a perceptual task. Our framework offers a robust and generalizable approach for parameterizing individual variability, providing a promising pathway toward computational modeling at the individual level—replicating individuals in silico.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Humans (and other animals) exhibit substantial commonalities in their decision-making processes. However, considerable variability is also frequently observed in how individuals perform perceptual and cognitive decision-making tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. This variability arises from differences in underlying cognitive mechanisms. For example, individuals may vary in their ability or tendency to retain past experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], respond to events with both speed and accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], or explore novel actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. If these factors can be meaningfully disentangled, they would enable a concise characterization of individual decision-making processes, yielding a low-dimensional, parameterized representation of individuality. Such a representation could, in turn, be leveraged to predict future behaviours at an individual level. Shifting from population-level predictions to an individual-based approach would mark a significant advancement in domains where precise behaviour prediction is essential, such as social and cognitive sciences. Beyond prediction, this approach offers a framework for parameterizing and clustering individuals, thereby facilitating the visualization of behavioural heterogeneity, which has applications in psychiatric analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, this parameterization offers a promising pathway toward computational modeling at the individual level—replicating the cognitive and functional characteristics of individuals <italic>in silico</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Cognitive modelling is a standard approach for reproducing and predicting human behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>], often implemented within a reinforcement learning framework (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]). However, because these cognitive models are manually designed by researchers, their ability to accurately fit behavioural data may be limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. A data-driven approach using artificial neural networks (ANNs) offers an alternative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Unlike cognitive models, which rely on predefined behavioural assumptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], ANNs require minimal prior assumptions and can learn complex patterns directly from data. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have successfully replicated human choices and reaction times in various visual tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Similarly, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] have been applied to model valueguided decision-making tasks such as the multi-armed bandit problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. A promising approach to capturing individual decision-making tendencies while preserving behavioural consistency is to tune ANN weights using a parameterized representation of individuality.</p>
<p>This idea was first proposed by Dezfouli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], who employed an RNN to solve a two-armed bandit task. Their study utilized an autoencoder frame-work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], in which behavioural recordings from a single session of the bandit task, performed by an individual, were fed into an encoder. The encoder produced a low-dimensional vector, interpreted as a latent representation of the individual. Similar to hypernetworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], a decoder then took this low-dimensional vector as input and generated the weights of the RNN. This framework successfully reproduced behavioural recordings from other sessions of the same bandit task while preserving individual characteristics. However, since this individuality transfer has only been validated within the bandit task, it remains unclear whether the extracted latent representation captures an individual’s intrinsic tendencies across a variety of task conditions.</p>
<p>To address this question, we aim to make the low-dimensional representation— referred to as the <italic>individual latent representation</italic>—robust to variations across individuals and task conditions, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Specifically, we propose a framework that predicts an individual’s behaviours, not only in the same condition but also in similar yet distinct task conditions and environments. If the individual latent representation serves as a low-dimensional representation of an individual’s decision-making process, then extracting it from one condition could facilitate the prediction of that individual’s behaviours in another.</p>
<p>In this study, we define the problem of <italic>individuality transfer across task conditions</italic> as follows (also illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We assume access to a behavioural dataset from multiple individuals performing two task conditions: a</p>

<caption><title>The EIDT (encoder, individual latent representation, decoder, and task solver) framework for individuality transfer across task conditions.</title>
<p>The encoder maps action(s) <italic>α</italic>, provided by an individual <italic>K</italic> performing a specific problem <italic>ϕ</italic> in the source task condition <italic>A</italic>, into an individual latent representation (represented as a point in the two-dimensional space in the center). The individual latent representation is then fed into the decoder, which generates the weights for a task solver. The task solver predicts the behaviour of the same individual <italic>K</italic> in the target task condition <italic>B</italic>. During the training, a loss function evaluates the discrepancy between the predicted behaviour <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-1"><inline-graphic mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image" xlink:href="645375v3_inline44.gif"/></inline-formula> and the actual recorded behaviour <italic>β</italic> of individual <italic>K</italic>. The encoder’s input is referred to as an <italic>action sequence</italic>, the form of which depends on task. For example, in a sequential Markov decision process (MDP) task, an action sequence consists of an environment (state transition probabilities) and a sequence of actions over multiple episodes. For a digit recognition task, it consists of a stimulus digit image and the corresponding chosen response.</p></caption>

<title><italic>source task condition</italic> and a <italic>target task condition</italic></title>
<p>We train an encoder that takes behavioural data from the source task condition as input and outputs an individual latent representation. This representation is then fed into a decoder, which generates the weights of an ANN, referred to as a <italic>task solver</italic>, that reproduces behaviours in the target task condition. For testing, a new individual provides behavioural data from the source task condition, allowing us to infer his/her individual latent representation. Using this representation, a task solver is constructed to predict how the test individual will behave in the target task condition. Importantly, this prediction does not require any behavioural data from the test individual performing the target task condition. We refer to this framework as <italic>EIDT</italic>, an acronym for encoder, individual latent representation, decoder and task solver.</p>
<p>We evaluated whether the proposed EIDT framework can effectively transfer individuality in both value-guided sequential decision-making tasks and perceptual decision-making tasks. To assess its generalizability across individuals, meaning its ability to predict the behaviour of previously unseen individuals, we tested the framework using a test participant pool that was not included in the dataset used for model training. To determine how well our framework captures each individual’s unique behavioural patterns, we compared the prediction performance of a task solver specifically designed for a given individual with the performance of task solvers designed for other individuals. Our results indicate that the proposed framework successfully mimics decision-making while accounting for individual differences.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We evaluated our EIDT framework using two distinct experimental paradigms: a value-guided sequential decision-making task (MDP task) and a perceptual decision-making task (MNIST task). For each paradigm, we assessed model performance in two scenarios. The first, <italic>Within-Condition Prediction</italic>, tested a model’s ability to predict behaviour within a single task condition without individuality transfer. In this scenario, a model was trained on data from a pool of participants to predict the behaviour of a held-out individual in that same condition. The second, <italic>Cross-Condition Transfer</italic>, tested the core hypothesis of individuality transfer. Here, a model used behavioural data from a participant in “source” condition to predict that same participant’s behaviour in a different “target” condition.</p>
<p>The prediction performance was evaluated using two metrics: the negative log-likelihood on a trial-by-trial basis, and the rate for behaviour matched. The negative log-likelihood is based on the probability the model assigned to the specific action that the human participant actually took on that trial. The rate for behaviour matched measures the proportion of trials where the model’s most likely action (deterministically predicted by sampling from the output probabilities) matched the participant’s actual choice.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<label>2.1</label>
<title>Markov decision process (MDP) task</title>
<p>The dataset consisted of behavioural data from 81 participants who performed both 2-step and 3-step MDP tasks. Each participant completed three blocks of 50 episodes for each condition, resulting in 486 action sequences in total. All analyses were performed using a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation procedure. For each fold, the model was trained on 80 participants, with 90% used for training updates and 10% for validation-based early stopping.</p>
<sec id="s2a1">
<title>Task solver accurately predicts average behaviour</title>
<p>First, we validated our core neural network architecture in Within-Condition Prediction. We trained a standard task solver, using the architecture defined in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4b4">Section 4.2.4</xref>, on the training/validation pool (<italic>N</italic> = 80) to predict the behaviour of the held-out participant. We compared its performance against a standard cognitive model (a Q-leaning model, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4b3">Section 4.2.3</xref>) whose parameters were averaged from fits to the same training/validation pool.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, the neural network-based task solver significantly outperformed the cognitive model. A two-way (model: cognitive model/task solver, task condition: 2-step/3-step) repeated-measures (RM) ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction (significant level was 0.05) revealed a significant effect of the model on both negative log-likelihood (model: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,80</sub> = 148.828, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, task condition: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,80</sub> = 1.107, <italic>p</italic> = 0.296, <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,80</sub> = 0.240, <italic>p</italic> = 0.626, <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-4"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and the rate for behaviour matched (model: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,80</sub> = 110.684, <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-5"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, task condition: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,80</sub> = 3.914, <italic>p</italic> = 0.051, <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-6"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,80</sub> = 19.059, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-7"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>). This result confirms that our RNN-based architecture serves as a strong foundation for modeling decision-making in this task.</p>

<title>EIDT enables accurate individuality transfer</title>
<p>Next, we tested our main hypothesis in Cross-Condition Transfer. We used the full EIDT framework to predict a participant’s behaviour in a target condition (e.g., 3-step MDP) using their behavioural data from a source condition (e.g., 2-step MDP). We compared the performance of two models:</p>

<p>A Q-learning model whose parameters (<italic>q</italic><sub>lr</sub>, <italic>q</italic><sub>init</sub>, <italic>q</italic><sub>dr</sub>, and <italic>q</italic><sub>it</sub>) were individually fitted for each participant using their data from the source condition and then applied to predict behaviour in the target condition.</p>

<sec id="s2a4">
<title>EIDT</title>
<p>Our framework, trained on the training and validation pool using data from both source and target conditions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2, Supplementary Materials</xref> for representative training and validation curves). To predict behaviour for a test participant, their individual latent representation was computed by averaging the encoder’s output across all of their behavioural sequences from the source condition, and this representation was fed to the decoder to generate the task solver weights. For reference, the averaged individual latent representations are visualized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S3, Supplementary Materials</xref>.</p>
<p>The EIDT framework demonstrated significantly better prediction accuracy than the individualized cognitive model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). A two-way (model: cognitive model/EIDT, transfer direction: 2→3/3→2) RM ANOVA confirmed a significant effect of the model on negative log-likelihood (model: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,80</sub> = 95.705, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-8"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, transfer direction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,80</sub> = 14.255, <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-9"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,80</sub> = 0.008, <italic>p</italic> = 0.012, <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-10"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>) and the rate for behaviour matched (model: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,80</sub> = 100.843, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-11"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, transfer direction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,80</sub> = 13.021, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-12"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,80</sub> = 0.964, <italic>p</italic> = 0.329, <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-13"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>). This result indicates that EIDT successfully captures and transfers individual-specific behavioural patterns more effectively than a traditional parameter-based transfer approach.</p>

<title>Latent space distance predicts transfer performance</title>
<p>To verify that the individual latent representation meaningfully captures individuality, we conducted a “cross-individual” analysis. We generated a task solver using the latent representation of one participant (Participant <italic>l</italic>) and used it to predict the behaviour of another participant (Participant <italic>k</italic>). We then measured the relationship between the prediction performance (<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k,l</italic></sub>) and the Euclidean distance (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>k,l</italic></sub>) between the latent representations of Participants <italic>k</italic> and <italic>l</italic>. As hypothesized, prediction performance was strongly dependent on this distance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). We fitted the data using a generalized linear model (GLM): <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k,l</italic></sub> ~ Gamma log(<inline-formula id="inline-eqn-14"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>). The fitting confirmed that distance (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>k,l</italic></sub>) was a significant predictor: the coefficient <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> was significantly positive for negative log-likelihood (transfer direction 3→2: <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = 0.176, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 2→3: <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = 0.316, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and significantly negative for the rate for behaviour matched (3 → 2: <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = 0.106, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 2 →3: <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = − 0.149, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). This indicates that prediction performance degrades as the behavioural dissimilarity (represented by distance in the latent space) between the source and target individual increases, providing direct evidence that the latent space organizes individuals by behavioural similarity.</p>

<p>To assess if our model could generate realistic behaviour, we conducted on-policy simulations.

<p>The model-generated behaviours closely mirrored human behaviours (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We proposed an EIDT framework for modeling the unique decision-making process of each individual. This framework enables the transfer of an individual latent representation from a (source) task condition to a different (target) task condition, allowing a task solver predict behaviours in the target task condition. Several neural network techniques, such as autoencoders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], hypernetworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], and learning-to-learn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], facilitate this transfer. Our experiments, conducted on both value-guided sequential and perceptual decision-making tasks, demonstrated the potential of the proposed framework in individuality transfer across task conditions.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>EIDT framework extends prior work on individuality transfer</title>
<p>The core concept of using an encoder-decoder architecture to capture individuality builds on the work of Dezfouli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], who applied a similar model to a bandit task. We extended this idea in three key ways. First, we validated that the framework is effective for previously unseen individuals who were not included in model training. Although these individuals provided behavioural data in the source task condition to identify their individual latent representations, their data were not used for model training. Second, we established that this transfer is effective across different experimental conditions (e.g., changes in task rules or difficulty), not just across sessions of the same task. Third, while the original work focused on value-guided tasks, we validated the framework’s applicability to perceptual decision-making tasks, specifically the MNIST task. These findings establish that EIDT effectively captures individual differences across both task conditions and individuals.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Interpreting the individual latent representation remains challenging</title>
<p>Although we found that Q-learning parameters were reflected in the individual latent representation, the interpretation of this representation remains an open question. Since interpretation often requires task-condition-specific considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], it falls outside the primary scope of this study, whose aim is to develop a general framework for individuality transfer. Previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] has explored associating neural network parameters with cognitive or functional meanings. Approaches such as disentangling techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] and cognitive model integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] could aid in better understanding the cognitive and functional significance of the individual latent representation.</p>
<p>Regarding the individual latent representation, disentanglement and separation losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] during the model training could enhance interpretability. However, we used only the reproduction loss, as defined in (5), because interpretable parameters in cognitive models (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]) are not necessarily independent (e.g., an individual with a high learning rate may also have a high inverse temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], resulting these two parameters being represented with one variable).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Why can the encoder extract individuality for unseen individuals?</title>
<p>Our experiments, which divided participants into training and test participant pools, demonstrated that the framework successfully extracts individuality for completely new individuals. This generalization likely relies on the fact that individuals with similar behavioural patterns result in similar individual latent representation and individuals similar to new participants exist in the training participant pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. This hypothesis suggests that individuals can be clustered based on behavioural patterns. Behavioural clustering has been widely discussed in relation to psychiatric conditions, medication effects, and gender-based differences (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]). Our results could contribute to a deeper discussion of behavioural characteristics by clustering not only these groups but also healthy controls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>Which processes contribute to individuality?</title>
<p>In the MNIST task, we assumed that individuality emerged primarily from the decision-making process (implemented by an RNN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]), rather than from the visual processing system (implemented by a CNN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]). The CNN was pretrained, and the decoder did not tune its weights. Our results do not rule out the possibility that the visual system also exhibits individuality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]; however, they imply that individual differences in perceptual decision-making can be explained primarily by variations in the decision-making system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. This assumption provides valuable insights for research on human perception.</p>

<sec id="s3e">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One limitation is that the source and target behaviours were performed on different conditions, but within the same task. Thus, our findings do not fully evaluate the generalizability of individuality transfer across diverse task domains. However, our framework has the potential to be applied to diverse tasks since it connects the source and target tasks via the individual latent representation and accepts completely different tasks for the source and target. A key to realizing this transfer might be ensuring that the cognitive functions, such as memory, required for solving the source and target tasks are (partially) shared. The latent representation is expected to represent individual features of these functions. Conversely, if source and target tasks require completely different functions to solve them, the transfer by EIDT would not work.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of individuality transfer may be influenced by dataset volume. As discussed earlier, prediction performance may depend on whether similar individuals exist in the training participant pool. In our study, 100 participants were sufficient for effective transfer. However, tasks involving greater behavioural diversity may require a substantially larger dataset.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier, the interpretability of the individual latent representation requires further investigation. Furthermore, the optimal dimensionality of the individual latent representation remains unclear. This likely depends on the complexity of tasks involved—specifically, the number of factors needed to represent the diversity of behaviour observed in those tasks. While these factors have been explored in cognitive modeling research (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]), a clear understanding at the individual level is still lacking. Integrating cognitive modeling with data-driven neural network approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] could help identify key factors underlying individual differences in decision-making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3f">
<title>Future directions</title>
<p>To further generalize our framework, a large-scale dataset is necessary, as discussed in the limitations. This dataset should include a large number of participants to ensure prediction performance for diverse individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. All participants should perform the same set of tasks, which should include a variety of tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Building upon our framework, where the encoder currently accepts action sequences from only a single task, a more generalizable encoder should be able to process behavioural data from multiple tasks to generate a more robust individual latent representation. To enhance the encoder, a multi-head neural network architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] could be utilized. A individual latent representation would enable transfer to a wider variety of tasks and allow accurate and detailed parameterization of individuals using data from only a single task.</p>
<p>Robust and generalizable parameterization of individuality enables computational modeling at the individual level.

<title>General framework for individuality transfer across task conditions</title>
<p>We formulate the problem of individuality transfer, which involves extracting an individual latent representation from a source task condition and predicting behaviour in a target task condition with preserving individuality. We consider two task conditions, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, which are different but related. For example, condition <italic>A</italic> might be a 2-step MDP, while condition <italic>B</italic> is a 3-step MDP.</p>
<p>The individuality transfer across task conditions is defined as follows. An individual <italic>K</italic> performs a problem within condition <italic>A</italic>, with their behaviour recorded as 𝒜<sub><italic>K</italic></sub>. Our objective is to predict ℬ<sub><italic>K</italic></sub>, which represents <italic>K</italic>’s behaviour when performing a task with condition <italic>B</italic>. To achieve this, we extract an individual latent representation <bold><italic>z</italic></bold> from 𝒜<sub><italic>K</italic></sub>, capturing the individual’s behavioural characteristics. This representation <bold><italic>z</italic></bold> is then used to construct a task solver, enabling it to mimic <italic>K</italic>’s behaviour in condition <italic>B</italic>. Since condition <italic>A</italic> provides data for estimating the individual latent representation and condition <italic>B</italic> is the target of behaviour prediction, we refer to them as the source task condition and target task condition, respectively.</p>
<p>Our proposed framework for the individuality transfer consists of three modules:</p>
<p><bold>Task solver</bold> predicts behaviour in the target condition <italic>B</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Encoder</bold> extracts the individual latent representation from the source condition <italic>A</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Decoder</bold> generates the weights of the task solver based on the individual latent representation.</p>
<p>These modules are illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. We refer to this framework as EIDT, an acronym for encoder, individual latent representation, decoder and task solver.</p>

<title>Task</title>
<p>At the beginning of each episode, an initial state-cue is presented to the participant. For human participants, the state-cue is represented by animal images (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>). For the cognitive model (Q-learning agent) and neural network-based model, the state-cue is represented numerically (e.g., (2, 1) for the first task state in the second choice). The participant makes a binary decision (denoted as action <italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub> or <italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub>) for each step. In the human experiment, these actions correspond to pressing the left or right cursor key. With a certain probability (either 0.8/0.2 or 0.6/0.4), known as the state-action transition probability, the participant transitions to one of two subsequent task states. This process repeats two times for the 2-step MDP and three times in the 3-step MDP. After the final step, the participant receives an outcome: either a reward (<italic>r</italic> = 1) or no reward (<italic>r</italic> = 0). For human participants, rewards were displayed as symbols, as shown in <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>.

<title>Behavioural data collection</title>
<p>We recruited 123 participants via Prolific. All participants provided their informed consent online. This study was approved by the Committee for Human Research at the Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Osaka, and compiled with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants received a base compensation of £4 for completing the entire experiment, A performance-based bonus (£0 to £2, average: £1) was awarded based on rewards earned in the MDP task. Each participant completed 3 sequences for each step condition (2-step and 3-step MDP tasks), with each sequence comprising 50 episodes. The order of the 2-step and 3-step MDP tasks was randomized across sequences. Statecue assignment (animal images) were randomly determined for each sequence. Participants took a mandatory break (≥ 1 minute) between sequences.</p>
<p>To ensure data quality, we applied exclusion criteria based on average reward, action bias, and response time. Thresholds for these metrics were systematically determined using the interquartile range method on statistics from the initial dataset. Participants were removed from the analysis entirely if their data from any single block fell outside these established ranges. This procedure led to the exclusion of one participant for low average reward (below 0.387 for the 2-step MDP and 0.382 for the 3-step MDP), 23 participants for excessive action bias (outside the 26.3–73.3% range), and 18 for outlier response times (outside the 0.260–1.983 s range). In total, 42 participants (approximately 34%) were excluded, resulting in a final sample of 81 participants for analysis.</p>

<title>Task solver</title>
<p>Before describing the encoder and decoder, we define the architecture of the task solver, which generates actions for the <italic>M</italic>-step MDP task.

<p>For input encoding, we used a 1-of-K scheme. The step of the MDP task is encoded as [1, 0, 0] for step 1, [0, 1, 0] for step 2, and [0, 0, 1] for step 3.

<title>Task solver</title>
<p>The task solver for the handwritten digit recognition task is based on the model proposed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Their model consists of a CNN and an evidence accumulation module. However, since their model represents average human behaviour and does not account for individuality differences, we replace the accumulation module with a GRU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] to capture individuality. The CNN module processes the input image and produces an evidence vector <bold><italic>e</italic></bold> = CNN(<italic>ψ</italic>), where <bold><italic>e</italic></bold> ∈ ℝ<sup><italic>K</italic></sup> and CNN(·) is based on the AlexNet architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The weights of the CNN are sampled from a Bayesian neural network (BNN), introducing stochasticity in the output. This stochasticity enables the models to generate human-like, probabilistic decisions.</p>
<p>The stimulus image is fed into the CNN <italic>S</italic> times, generating <italic>S</italic> evidence distributions <bold><italic>e</italic></bold><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> ∈ ℝ<sup><italic>K</italic></sup> at each time step <italic>t</italic> = 0, …, <italic>S</italic> −1. In this study, we set <italic>S</italic> = 16 to match the maximum response time, as described later. Since the CNN weights are stochastically sampled from the BNN, the CNN’s output varies even when the same image is input multiple times. To model individuality in decision-making, we introduce a GRU with <italic>Q</italic> cells (<italic>Q</italic> = 4 in our setup). The GRU receives as input the previous hidden state <bold><italic>h</italic></bold><sub><italic>t</italic>−1</sub> ∈ ℝ<sup><italic>Q</italic></sup> and the current evidence <bold><italic>e</italic></bold><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>, updating its hidden state as

where Φ represents the GRU’s network weights.

<p>In this task solver, the CNN (driven by BNN) models a visual processing system, while the RNN represents the decision-making system. We assume that the visual system (implemented by CNN and BNN) is shared across all individuals, whereas the decision-making system (implemented by RNN) captures individual differences. Based on this assumption, the CNN and BNN are pretrained using the MNIST dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], and their weight distributions are fixed across individuals.

<title>Encoder and decoder</title>
<p>Since each action sequence contains only a single action, it does not form a true “sequence.” This makes it challenging to extract individuality from a single data point. To address this, the encoder takes a set of single action sequences as input rather than a single sequence. Specifically, the encoder <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-40"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline39.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> extracts the individual latent representation <bold><italic>z</italic></bold> from <italic>U</italic> sets of stimulus images <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>u</italic></sub> and their corresponding responses <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>u</italic></sub>, where <italic>u</italic> = 1, …, <italic>U</italic>. Here, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>u</italic></sub> represent the stimulus presented in the <italic>u</italic>-th trial, and <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>u</italic></sub> represents the corresponding response. The number of action sequences <italic>U</italic> corresponds to the number of samples available for each individual in the dataset. Since the outputs for these action sequences are just averaged, <italic>U</italic> can be adjusted flexibly.</p>
<p>The encoder architecture consists of a single CNN module, a single GRU, and a fully-connected feed-forward network. The CNN module is identical to the one used in the task solver.

<disp-formula id="eqn12">
<graphic xlink:href="645375v3_eqn12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where Ψ represents the network weights. The function <italic>k</italic>(<italic>a, t</italic>, <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-41"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline40.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>) outputs the one-hot encoded action <italic>a</italic> if <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-42"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline41.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and zeros otherwise. The value <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-43"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline42.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> represents the converted response time, obtained from the original response time <italic>b</italic> in the action sequence <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>u</italic></sub>. After processing all <italic>U</italic> sequences, the final hidden states are averaged across sequences: <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-44"><inline-graphic xlink:href="645375v3_inline43.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The individual latent representation is then computed as <bold><italic>z</italic></bold> = <italic>d</italic>(<bold><italic>h</italic></bold>), where <italic>d</italic>(·) represents a single-layer fully-connected feed-forward network. The decoder, implemented as a single linear layer, takes the individual latent representation <bold><italic>z</italic></bold> as input and outputs the weights for the task solver.</p>

<p>This revised paper provides a <bold>valuable</bold> and novel neural network-based framework for parameterizing individual differences and predicting individual decision-making across task conditions. The methods and analyses are <bold>solid</bold> yet could benefit from further validation of the superiority of the proposed framework against other baseline models. With these concerns addressed, this study would offer a proof-of-concept neural network approach to scientists working on the generalization of cognitive skills across contexts.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The manuscript presents EIDT, a framework that extracts an &quot;individuality index&quot; from a source task to predict a participant's behaviour in a related target task under different conditions. However, the evidence that it truly enables cross-task individuality transfer is not convincing.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The EIDT framework is clearly explained, and the experimental design and results are generally well-described. The performance of the proposed method is tested on two distinct paradigms: a Markov Decision Process (MDP) task (comparing 2-step and 3-step versions) and a handwritten digit recognition (MNIST) task under various conditions of difficulty and speed pressure. The results indicate that the EIDT framework generally achieved lower prediction error compared to baseline models and that it was better at predicting a specific individual's behaviour when using their own individuality index compared to using indices from others.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the individuality index appeared to form distinct clusters for different individuals, and the framework was better at predicting a specific individual's behaviour when using their own derived index compared to using indices from other individuals.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I thank the author for the additional analyses. They have fully addressed all of my previous concerns, and I have no further recommendations.</p>

<p>This paper introduces a framework for modeling individual differences in decision-making by learning a low-dimensional representation (the &quot;individuality index&quot;) from one task and using it to predict behaviour in a different task. The approach is evaluated on two types of tasks: a sequential value-based decision-making task and a perceptual decision task (MNIST). The model shows improved prediction accuracy when incorporating this learned representation compared to baseline models.</p>
<p>The motivation is solid, and the modelling approach is interesting, especially the use of individual embeddings to enable cross-task generalization. That said, several aspects of the evaluation and analysis could be strengthened.</p>
<p>(1) The MNIST SX baseline appears weak. RTNet isn't directly comparable in structure or training. A stronger baseline would involve training the GRU directly on the task without using the individuality index-e.g., by fixing the decoder head. This would provide a clearer picture of what the index contributes.</p>
<p>(2) Although the focus is on prediction, the framework could offer more insight into how behaviour in one task generalizes to another. For example, simulating predicted behaviours while varying the individuality index might help reveal what behavioural traits it encodes.</p>

<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>Thank you to the authors for the updated manuscript. The authors have addressed the majority of my concerns, and the paper is now in a much better form.</p>
<p>Regarding my previous Comment 6, I still believe it would be helpful to include a graph similar to what is typically reported for these tasks-specifically, a breakdown of choices based on rare versus common transitions (see Model-Based Influences on Humans' Choices and Striatal Prediction Errors, Figure 2). Presenting this for both the actual behaviour and the simulated data would strengthen the paper and allow for clearer comparison.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work presents a novel neural network-based framework for parameterizing individual differences in human behavior. Using two distinct decision-making experiments, the author demonstrates the approach's potential and claims it can predict individual behavior (1) within the same task, (2) across different tasks, and (3) across individuals. While the goal of capturing individual variability is compelling and the potential applications are promising, the claims are weakly supported, and I find that the underlying problem is conceptually ill-defined.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The idea of using neural networks for parameterizing individual differences in human behavior is novel, and the potential applications can be impactful.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, the authors compare a Q-learning cognitive model (for the MDP task) and RTNet (for the MNIST task) against the proposed framework. However, as I understand it, neither the cognitive model nor RTNet is designed to fit or account for individual variability. If that is the case, it is unclear why these models serve as appropriate baselines. Isn't it expected that a model explicitly fitted to individual data would outperform models that do not? If so, does the observed superiority of the proposed framework simply reflect the unsurprising benefit of fitting individual variability? I think the authors should either clarify why these models constitute fair control or validate the proposed approach against stronger and more appropriate baselines.</p>
<p>(2) It's not very clear in the results section what it means by having a shorter within-individual distance than between-individual distances. Related to the comment above, is there any control analysis performed for this? Also, this analysis appears to have nothing to do with predicting individual behavior. Is this evidence toward successfully parameterizing individual differences? Could this be task-dependent, especially since the transfer is evaluated on exceedingly similar tasks in both experiments? I think a bit more discussion of the motivation and implications of these results will help the reader in making sense of this analysis.</p>
<p>(3) The authors have to better define what exactly he meant by transferring across different &quot;tasks&quot; and testing the framework in &quot;more distinctive tasks&quot;. All presented evidence, taken at face value, demonstrated transferring across different &quot;conditions&quot; of the same task within the same experiment. It is unclear to me how generalizable the framework will be when applied to different tasks.</p>
<p>(4) Conceptually, it is also unclear to me how plausible it is that the framework could generalize across tasks spanning multiple cognitive domains (if that's what is meant by more distinctive). For instance, how can an individual's task performance on a Posner task predict task performance on the Cambridge face memory test? Which part of the framework could have enabled such a cross-domain prediction of task performance? I think these have to be at least discussed to some extent, since without it the future direction is meaningless.</p>
<p>(5) How is the negative log-likelihood, which seems to be the main metric for comparison, computed? Is this based on trial-by-trial response prediction or probability of responses, as what usually performed in cognitive modelling?</p>
<p>(6) None of the presented evidence is cross-validated. The authors should consider performing K-fold cross-validation on the train, test, and evaluation split of subjects to ensure robustness of the findings.</p>
<p>(7) The authors excluded 25 subjects (20% of the data) for different reasons. This is a substantial proportion, especially by the standards of what is typically observed in behavioral experiments. The authors should provide a clear justification for these exclusion criteria and, if possible, cite relevant studies that support the use of such stringent thresholds.</p>
<p>(8) The authors should do a better job of creating the figures and writing the figure captions. It is unclear which specific claim the authors are addressing with the figure. For example, what is the key message of Figure 2C regarding transfer within and across participants? Why are the stats presentation different between the Cognitive model and the EIDT framework plots? In Figure 3, it's unclear what these dots and clusters represent and how they support the authors' claim that the same individual forms clusters. And isn't this experiment have 98 subjects after exclusion, this plot has way less than 98 dots as far as I can tell. Furthermore, I find Figure 5 particularly confusing, as the underlying claim it is meant to illustrate is unclear. Clearer figures and more informative captions are needed to guide the reader effectively.</p>
<p>(9) I also find the writing somewhat difficult to follow. The subheadings are confusing, and it's often unclear which specific claim the authors are addressing. The presentation of results feels disorganized, making it hard to trace the evidence supporting each claim. Also, the excessive use of acronyms (e.g., SX, SY, CG, EA, ES, DA, DS) makes the text harder to parse. I recommend restructuring the results section to be clearer and significantly reducing the use of unnecessary acronyms.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my previous comments with great care and detail. I appreciate the additional analyses and edits. I have no further comments.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Because the &quot;source&quot; and &quot;target&quot; tasks are merely parameter variations of the same paradigm, it is unclear whether EIDT achieves true crosstask transfer. The manuscript provides no measure of how consistent each participant's behaviour is across these variants (e.g., two- vs threestep MDP; easy vs difficult MNIST). Without this measure, the transfer results are hard to interpret. In fact, Figure 5 shows a notable drop in accuracy when transferring between the easy and difficult MNIST conditions, compared to transfers between accuracy-focused and speedfocused conditions. Does this discrepancy simply reflect larger withinparticipant behavioural differences between the easy and difficult settings? A direct analysis of intra-individual similarity for each task pair and how that similarity is related to EIDT's transfer performance is needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comment. We agree that the tasks used in our study are variations of the same paradigm. Accordingly, we have revised the manuscript to consistently frame our findings as demonstrating individuality transfer &quot;across task conditions&quot; rather than &quot;across distinct tasks.&quot;</p>
<p>In response to your suggestion, we have conducted a new analysis to directly investigate the relationship between individual behavioural patterns and transfer performance. As show in the new Figures 4, 11, S8, and S9, we found a clear relationship between the distance in the space of individual latent representation (called individuality index in the previous manuscript) and prediction performance. Specifically, prediction accuracy for a given individual's behaviour degrades as the latent representation of the model's source individual becomes more distant. This result directly demonstrates that our framework captures meaningful individual differences that are predictive of transfer performance across conditions.</p>
<p>We have also expanded the Discussion (Lines 332--343) to address the potential for applying this framework to more structurally distinct tasks, hypothesizing that this would rely on shared underlying cognitive functions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Related to the previous comment, the individuality index is central to the framework, yet remains hard to interpret. It shows much greater within-participant variability in the MNIST experiment (Figure S1) than in the MDP experiment (Figure 3). Is such a difference meaningful? It is hard to know whether it reflects noisier data, greater behavioural flexibility, or limitations of the model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this important point about interpretability. To enhance the interpretability of the individual latent representation, we have added a new analysis for the MDP task (see Figures 6 and S4). By applying our trained encoder to data from simulated Q-learning agents with known parameters, we demonstrate that the dimensions of the latent space systematically map onto the agents' underlying cognitive parameters (learning rate and inverse temperature). This analysis provides a clearer interpretation by linking our model's data-driven representation to established theoretical constructs.</p>
<p>Regarding the greater within-participant variability observed in the MNIST task (visualized now in Figure S7), this could be attributed to several factors, such as greater behavioural flexibility in the perceptual task. However, disentangling these potential factors is complex and falls outside the primary scope of the current study, which prioritizes demonstrating robust prediction accuracy across different task conditions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors suggests that the model's ability to generalize to new participants &quot;likely relies on the fact that individuality indices form clusters and individuals similar to new participants exist in the training participant pool&quot;. It would be helpful to directly test this hypothesis by quantifying the similarity (or distance) of each test participant's individuality index to the individuals or identified clusters within the training set, and assessing whether greater similarity (or closer proximity) to the clusters in the training set is associated with higher prediction accuracy for those individuals in the test set.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion. We have performed the analysis you proposed to directly test this hypothesis. Our new results, presented in Figures 4, 11, S5, S8, and S9, quantify the distance between the latent representation of a test participant and that of the source participant used to generate the prediction model.</p>
<p>The results show a significant negative correlation: prediction accuracy consistently decreases as the distance in the latent space increases. This confirms that generalization performance is directly tied to the similarity of behavioural patterns as captured by our latent representation, strongly supporting our hypothesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The MNIST SX baseline appears weak. RTNet isn't directly comparable in structure or training. A stronger baseline would involve training the GRU directly on the task without using the individuality index-e.g., by fixing the decoder head. This would provide a clearer picture of what the index contributes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a more direct baseline is crucial for evaluating the contribution of our transfer mechanism. For the Within-Condition Prediction scenario, the comparison with RTNet was intended only to validate that our task solver architecture could achieve average humanlevel task performance (Figure 7).</p>
<p>For the critical Cross-Condition Transfer scenario, we have now implemented a stronger and more appropriate baseline, which we call ``task solver (source).'' This model has the same architecture as our EIDT task solver but is trained directly on the source task data of the specific test participant. As shown in revised Figure 9, our EIDT framework significantly outperforms this direct-training approach, clearly demonstrating the benefit of the individuality transfer mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Although the focus is on prediction, the framework could offer more insight into how behaviour in one task generalizes to another. For example, simulating predicted behaviours while varying the individuality index might help reveal what behavioural traits it encodes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this valuable suggestion. To provide more insight into the encoded behavioural traits, we have conducted a new analysis linking the individual latent representation to a theoretical cognitive model. As detailed in the revised manuscript (Figures 6 and S4), we applied our encoder to simulated data from Q-learning agents with varying parameters. The results show a systematic relationship between the latent space coordinates and the agents' learning rates and inverse temperatures, providing a clearer interpretation of what the representation captures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It's not clear whether the model can reproduce human behaviour when acting on-policy. Simulating behaviour using the trained task solver and comparing it with actual participant data would help assess how well the model captures individual decision tendencies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the suggested on-policy evaluation (Lines 195--207). In the revised manuscript (Figure 5), we present results from simulations where the trained task solvers performed the MDP task. We compared their performance (total reward and rate of the highly-rewarding action selected) against their corresponding human participants. The strong correlations observed demonstrate that our model successfully captures and reproduces individual-specific behavioural tendencies in an onpolicy setting.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figures 3 and S1 aim to show that individuality indices from the same participant are closer together than those from different participants. However, this isn't fully convincing from the visualizations alone. Including a quantitative presentation would help support the claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the original visualizations of inter- and intraparticipant distances was not sufficiently convincing. We have therefore removed that analysis. In its place, we have introduced a more direct and quantitative analysis that explicitly links the individual latent representation to prediction performance (see Figures 4, 11, S5, S8, and S9). This new analysis demonstrates that prediction error for an individual is a function of distance in the latent space, providing stronger evidence that the representation captures meaningful, individual-specific information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The transfer scenarios are often between very similar task conditions (e.g., different versions of MNIST or two-step vs three-step MDP). This limits the strength of the generalization claims. In particular, the effects in the MNIST experiment appear relatively modest, and the transfer is between experimental conditions within the same perceptual task. To better support the idea of generalizing behavioural traits across tasks, it would be valuable to include transfers across more structurally distinct tasks.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this limitation and have revised the manuscript to be more precise. We now frame our contribution as &quot;individuality transfer across task conditions&quot; rather than &quot;across tasks&quot; to accurately reflect the scope of our experiments. We have also expanded the Discussion section (Line 332-343) to address the potential and challenges of applying this framework to more structurally distinct tasks, noting that it would likely depend on shared underlying cognitive functions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For both experiments, it would help to show basic summaries of participants' behavioural performance. For example, in the MDP task, first-stage choice proportions based on transition types are commonly reported. These kinds of benchmarks provide useful context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added behavioral performance summaries as requested. For the MDP task, Figure 5 now compares the total reward and rate of highlyrewarding action selected between humans and our model. For the MNIST task, Figure 7 shows the rate of correct responses for humans, RTNet, and our task solver across all conditions. These additions provide better context for the model's performance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the MDP task, consider reporting the number or proportion of correct choices in addition to negative log-likelihood. This would make the results more interpretable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. To make the results more interpretable, we have added a new prediction performance metric: the rate for behaviour matched. This metric measures the proportion of trials where the model's predicted action matches the human's actual choice. This is now included alongside the negative log-likelihood in Figures 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, and 11.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 5, what is the difference between the &quot;% correct&quot; and &quot;% match to behaviour&quot;? If so, it would help to clarify the distinction in the text or figure captions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clarified these terms in the revised manuscript. As defined in the Result section (Lines 116--122, 231), &quot;%correct&quot; (now &quot;rate of correct responses&quot;) is a measure of task performance, whereas &quot;%match to behaviour&quot; (now &quot;rate for behaviour matched&quot;) is a measure of prediction accuracy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the cognitive model, it would be useful to report the fitted parameters (e.g., learning rate, inverse temperature) per individual. This can offer insight into what kinds of behavioural variability the individual latent representation might be capturing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added histograms of the fitted Q-learning parameters for the human participants in Supplementary Materials (Figure S1). This analysis revealed which parameters varied most across the population and directly informed the design of our subsequent simulation study with Q-learning agents (see response to Comment 2-2), where we linked these parameters to the individual latent representation (Lines 208--223).</p>

<p>We have adopted the suggested changes for clarity.</p>
<p>&quot;Individuality index&quot; has been changed to &quot;individual latent representation&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Situation SX&quot; and &quot;Situation SY&quot; have been renamed to the more descriptive &quot;Within-Condition Prediction&quot; and &quot;Cross-Condition Transfer&quot;, respectively.</p>
<p>We have also added a table in Figure 7 to clarify the MNIST condition acronyms (EA/ES/DA/DS).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this critical point. We wish to clarify the nature of our baselines:</p>
<p>For the MDP task, the cognitive model baseline was indeed designed to account for individual variability. We estimated its parameters (e.g., learning rate) from each individual's source task behaviour and then used those specific parameters to predict their behaviour in the target task. This makes it a direct, parameter-based transfer model and thus a fair and appropriate baseline for individuality transfer.</p>
<p>For the MNIST task, we agree that the RTNet baseline was insufficient for evaluating individual-level transfer in the &quot;Cross-Condition Transfer&quot; scenario. We have now introduced a much stronger baseline, the &quot;task solver (source),&quot; which is trained specifically on the source task data of each test participant. Our results (Figure 9) show that the EIDT framework significantly outperforms this more appropriate, individualized baseline, highlighting the value of our transfer method over direct, within-condition fitting.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the previous analysis on inter- and intra-participant distances was not sufficiently clear or directly linked to the model's predictive power. We have removed this analysis from the manuscript. In its place, we have introduced a new, more direct analysis (Figures 4, 11, S5, S8, and S9) that demonstrates a quantitative relationship between the distance in the latent space and prediction accuracy. This new analysis shows that prediction error for an individual increases as a function of this distance, providing much stronger and clearer evidence that our framework successfully parameterizes meaningful individual differences.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors have to better define what exactly he meant by transferring across different &quot;tasks&quot; and testing the framework in &quot;more distinctive tasks&quot;.

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with your assessment and have corrected our terminology throughout the manuscript. We now consistently refer to the transfer as being &quot;across task conditions&quot; to accurately describe the scope of our findings.</p>
<p>We have also expanded our Discussion (Line 332-343) to address the important conceptual point about cross-domain transfer. We hypothesize that such transfer would be possible if the tasks, even if structurally different, rely on partially shared underlying cognitive functions (e.g., working memory). In such a scenario, the individual latent representation would capture an individual's specific characteristics related to that shared function, enabling transfer. Conversely, we state that transfer between tasks with no shared cognitive basis would not be expected to succeed with our current framework.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How is the negative log-likelihood, which seems to be the main metric for comparison, computed? Is this based on trial-by-trial response prediction or probability of responses, as what usually performed in cognitive modelling?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The negative log-likelihood is computed on a trial-by-trial basis. It is based on the probability the model assigned to the specific action that the human participant actually took on that trial. This calculation is applied consistently across all models (cognitive models, RTNet, and EIDT). We have added sentences to the Results section to clarify this point (Lines 116--122).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>None of the presented evidence is cross-validated. The authors should consider performing K-fold cross-validation on the train, test, and evaluation split of subjects to ensure robustness of the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All prediction performance results reported in the revised manuscript are now based on a rigorous leave-one-participant-out cross-validation procedure to ensure the robustness of our findings. We have updated the</p>
<p>Methods section to reflect this (Lines 127--129 and 229).</p>
<p>For some purely illustrative visualizations (e.g., plotting the entire latent space in Figures S3 and S7), we used a model trained on all participants' data to provide a single, representative example and avoid clutter. We have explicitly noted this in the relevant figure captions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors excluded 25 subjects (20% of the data) for different reasons. This is a substantial proportion, especially by the standards of what is typically observed in behavioral experiments. The authors should provide a clear justification for these exclusion criteria and, if possible, cite relevant studies that support the use of such stringent thresholds.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the concern regarding the exclusion rate. The previous criteria were indeed empirical. We have now implemented more systematic exclusion procedure based on the interquartile range of performance metrics, which is detailed in Section 4.2.2 (Lines 489--498). This revised, objective criterion resulted in the exclusion of 42 participants (34% of the initial sample). While this rate is high, we attribute it to the online nature of the data collection, where participant engagement can be more variable. We believe applying these strict criteria was necessary to ensure the quality and reliability of the behavioural data used for modeling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors should do a better job of creating the figures and writing the figure captions. It is unclear which specific claim the authors are addressing with the figure. For example, what is the key message of Figure 2C regarding transfer within and across participants? Why are the stats presentation different between the Cognitive model and the EIDT framework plots? In Figure 3, it's unclear what these dots and clusters represent and how they support the authors' claim that the same individual forms clusters. And isn't this experiment have 98 subjects after exclusion, this plot has way less than 98 dots as far as I can tell. Furthermore, I find Figure 5 particularly confusing, as the underlying claim it is meant to illustrate is unclear. Clearer figures and more informative captions are needed to guide the reader effectively.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that several figures and analyses in the original manuscript were unclear, and we have thoroughly revised our figures and their captions to improve clarity.</p>
<p>The confusing analysis in the old Figures 2C and 5 (Original/Others comparison) have been completely removed. The unclear visualization of the latent space for the test pool (old Figure 3 showing representations only from test participants) has also been removed to avoid confusion. For visualization of the overall latent space, we now use models trained on all data (Figures S3 and S7) and have clarified this in the captions. In place of these removed analyses, we have introduced a new, more intuitive &quot;cross-individual&quot; analysis (presented in Figures 4, 11, S5, S8, and S9). As explained in the new, more detailed captions, this analysis directly plots prediction performance as a function of the distance in latent space, providing a much clearer demonstration of how the latent representation relates to predictive accuracy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I also find the writing somewhat difficult to follow. The subheadings are confusing, and it's often unclear which specific claim the authors are addressing. The presentation of results feels disorganized, making it hard to trace the evidence supporting each claim. Also, the excessive use of acronyms (e.g., SX, SY, CG, EA, ES, DA, DS) makes the text harder to parse. I recommend restructuring the results section to be clearer and significantly reducing the use of unnecessary acronyms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this feedback. We have made significant revisions to improve the clarity and organization of the manuscript. We have renamed confusing acronyms: &quot;Situation SX&quot; is now &quot;Within- Condition Prediction,&quot; and &quot;Situation SY&quot; is now &quot;Cross-Condition Transfer.&quot; We also added a table to clarify the MNIST condition acronyms (EA/ES/DA/DS) in Figure 7.</p>
<p>The Results section has been substantially restructured with clearer subheadings.</p>
