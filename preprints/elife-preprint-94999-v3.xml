<abstract>
<p>In social behavior research, the focus often remains on animal dyads, limiting the understanding of complex interactions. Recent trends favor naturalistic setups, offering unique insights into intricate social behaviors. Social behavior stems from chance, individual preferences, and group dynamics, necessitating high-resolution quantitative measurements and statistical modeling. This study leverages the Eco-HAB system, an automated experimental setup which employs RFID tracking to observe naturally formed mouse cohorts in a controlled yet naturalistic setting, and uses statistical inference models to decipher rules governing the collective dynamics of groups of 10-15 individuals. Applying maximum entropy models on the coarse-grained co-localization patterns of mice unveils social rules in mouse hordes, quantifying sociability through pairwise interactions within groups, the impact of individual versus social preferences, and the effects of considering interaction structures among three animals instead of two. Reproducing co-localization patterns of individual mice reveals stability over time, with the statistics of the inferred interaction strength capturing social structure. By separating interactions from individual preferences, the study demonstrates that altering neuronal plasticity in the prelimbic cortex – the brain structure crucial for sociability – does not eliminate signatures of social interactions, but makes the transmission of social information between mice more challenging. The study demonstrates how the joint probability distribution of the mice positions can be used to quantify sociability.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We have updated the Introduction to add a more logical structure to the need of using maximum entropy models to identify interactions among mice. Additionally, we updated the first paragraph of the Discussion to make it specific that it is the use of maximum entropy models that identifies interaction patterns from the high-throughput data. Finally, we have also added in the Discussion arguments supporting the specific use of pairwise maximum entropy models to study social behaviors.
We have updated the main text of the manuscript to include the new references.
We have
1. added details about the Eco-HAB (it being coarse-grained, etc.) in the abstract to tone down the conclusion.
2. added to the results summary in the Discussion that the results are &quot;within in the setup of the semi-naturalistic Eco-HAB experiments&quot;
3. added to the Discussion that the different results compared to Shemesh et al 2013 means that general studies of social behavior need to compare models with different levels of complexity (e.g. pairwise vs. higher-order interactions).

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social behavior is fundamental for numerous animal species, encompassing human societies. From the dynamic spectacle of Mexican waves in a football stadium to the intricate waggle dance of bees, the diverse manifestations of social interaction raise a pivotal question: How do these social behaviors come to fruition, and what roles do individuals play in their emergence?</p>
<p>In recent decades, the exploration of social behavior has predominantly centered around studying animal dyads in controlled laboratory conditions. However, these experimental paradigms inherently impose limitations on investigating intricate social behaviors that often involve more than two interacting individuals. Studies on social interactions frequently employ tests with brief observation periods, during which animals are evaluated in novel environments, accompanied by the presence of an experimenter that induces stress, influencing social behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Recently, there has been a notable shift towards conducting experiments in natural settings, involving animal groups such as flocks of birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] or swarms of midges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Additionally, semi-naturalistic environments, exemplified by fish in tanks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], marching locusts in arenas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], flocks of sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], and hordes of rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], are increasingly being utilized. These approaches present unique opportunities for the comprehensive quantification of complex social interactions and sociability.</p>
<p>Mice stand out as a valuable model system for delving into the complexities of social behavior, given their intricate manifestation of various social behaviors. They tend to form cohesive groups, showcasing both amicable and agonistic behaviors. Depending on the environmental context, mice demonstrate territoriality and dynamic social hierarchies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Communication among mice is extensive, primarily mediated through odors, allowing them to convey emotional states such as stress, fear, and preferences in food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Additionally, mice exhibit prosocial behaviors, actively assisting distressed fellow mice in need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Decades of research have extensively explored social interactions between pairs of mice, while the study of mouse groups has only recently become feasible with advancements in high-throughput technologies, particularly radiofrequency identification (RFID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. The Eco-HAB system, utilized in this study, leverages RFID tracking to observe naturally-formed cohorts of mice in a controlled yet naturalistic environment, enabling longitudinal experiments on sociability with minimal human interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Social behavior arises from a combination of chance, individual preferences, group structure, and the transmission of preferences and interactions among group members. To unravel these elements and understand the establishment of social networks and hierarchies, we need not only high-resolution quantitative measurements of behavior over extended periods, but also statistical modeling to construct interaction models of collective behavior. One particular statistical method that has been successfully applied to identify interaction models in a diverse range of biological networks are maximum entropy models. Among many examples, maximum entropy models have successfully explain social rules governing collective behavior in bird flocks and mouse hordes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. These models help distinguish observed correlations, like the clustering of mice in a specific location, from direct interactions or individual preferences. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] pioneered the use of these models in studying mouse group behavior, revealing the significance of higher-order interactions in colocalization patterns. While [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] utilized video tracking of groups of four mice, our Eco-HAB setup employs RFID technology for tracking groups of 10-15 mice, providing more compact data with longer recording times but lower spatial resolution. In this study, we integrate Eco-HAB recordings with statistical inference to construct models of collective behavior, focusing on the statistics of system states to identify interaction structures within the group. Our focus is on quantifying sociability in mouse hordes through the inferred interactions within groups, ensuring statistical power. We explore whether interactions between pairs can explain collective behavior and examine how social structure evolves over time. We analyze the effects of individual versus social preferences and investigate the impact of considering three animals instead of two. Using a data analysis approach based on wild type C57BL/6J male and female mice, we discuss social structure and sociability changes in mice with temporary prefrontal cortex plasticity modification.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we explore whether interventions of brain regions that are crucial for processing social information change the interaction patterns among individuals in the Eco-HAB. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a crucial role in processing social information, understanding others’ emotions, maintaining social hierarchy, and transmitting information about food safety in both rodents and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Neuronal activity of the PFC is correlated with proximity to conspecifics, and studies in mice reveal distinct PFC responses to social and non-social olfactory stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. The PFC integrates existing knowledge with new information about self and others, demonstrating dynamic neuronal plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In cognitive tasks involving the PFC and subcortical areas, neuronal connectivity refines more rapidly in the former, highlighting its adaptability to changing environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), particularly TIMP-1, influence synaptic plasticity by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. TIMP-1 is involved in long-term potentiation (LTP), a crucial process for cellular-level memory formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. This sustained release impedes the updating of neuronal connectivity in the prelimbic part of the PFC (PL), crucial for maintaining social structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Our study employs nanoparticles for gradual TIMP-1 release over several days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] to impact plasticity in the PL on the changes in group behavior.</p>

<title>Recording of mice location in naturalistic environment</title>
<p>Eco-HAB is an automated, ethologically-relevant experimental apparatus that tracts voluntary behavior in group-housed mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Constructed to simulate notable characteristics of natural murine environment, it consists of four connected large compartments, two of which contain food and water (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Cohorts of 10 to 15 mice are introduced into the Eco-HAB, where they behave freely while their locations are tracked over time. The details of used mouse strains and cohorts’ compositions can be found in. The compartments are connected with tube-shaped corridors resembling underground tunnels, on whose ends there are 125kHz antennas recording every time a mouse crosses with an accuracy of over 20Hz. Each mouse is tagged with a unique RFID tag. The mice are recorded for 10 days with alternating 12-hour-long light-dark phases that simulate the day-night cycle.</p>

</fig>
<p>The location of each mouse at each time is reconstructed using the time stamps, reducing the data to a discrete time series, <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> at time <italic>t</italic> = 1, 2, …, <italic>T</italic>, with possible values of the locations <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> = 1, 2, 3, 4 corresponding to the four compartments. The time resolution for the discretization is set to 2 seconds. As shown by the color-coded location traces in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, the majority of mice are often found in the same compartment, especially in the non-active light phases: this corresponds to the ethological behavior – mice tend to sleep in a pile to keep each other warm (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]). This suggests that the behavior depends on latent variables, i.a. the circadian clock.</p>
<p>To ensure the relative consistency of the analyzed data, we used the observed rate of transitions to measure the activity of each mouse, and choose an analysis window of 6 hours covering the first half of the dark phase (13:00 - 19:00), which corresponds to the most active time on each day for the entire duration of the experiment. The variability of activity across individuals is larger than the day-to-day variability for a single mouse, suggesting that the level of locomotor activity is a well-defined individual characteristic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Pairwise interaction model explains the statistics of social behavior</title>
<p>We first establish a quantification of sociability by building probabilistic interaction models for groups of mice. Following previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], we use the in-cohort sociability, which measures the excess probability of two mice being found in the same compartment compared to the case where they are independent. Mathematically, in-cohort sociability is defined as:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="550619v4_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="550619v4_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>(<italic>r, r</italic>′) are respectively the empirical frequencies of finding a mouse <italic>i</italic> in compartment <italic>r</italic>, and a pair of mice (<italic>i, j</italic>) in compartments <italic>r, r</italic>′.</p>
<p>As schematically explained in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, in-cohort sociability is due to pairwise interactions between each pair of mice, and modifies how likely they are to be found in each compartment with respect to the mice’s innate preference for that compartment. However, considering the presence of more than two animals, in-cohort sociability is not an effective measure of social structure of the group: two animals with zero attraction to one another can still be found to have a high in-cohort sociability, if a third animal has a strong social bond with both of them, since they all will be spending time with one another.</p>

<caption><title>Mice in Eco-HAB interact pairwisely.</title>
<p>(A, B) The schematics showing pairwise interactions: two mice are more likely to be found in the same compartment than the sum of their individual preference implies (A); also, the probability for three mice being in the same compartment can be predicted from the pairwise interactions (B). (C) From pairwise correlation <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, defined as the probability for mouse <italic>i</italic> and mouse <italic>j</italic> being in the same compartment (subtracted by the prediction of the independent model), and the probability for mouse <italic>i</italic> to be found in compartment <italic>r</italic> (subtracted by the model where each mouse spends equal amount of time in each of the four compartments), <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>ir</italic></sub> <italic>−</italic> 1<italic>/</italic>4, pairwise maximum entropy model learns the interaction strength between a pair of mice, <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, and the local field <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, which gives the tendency for each mouse in each compartment. The data shown is the aggregated 5-day data from day 1 to day 5 of the C57BL/6J males (cohort M1). The pairwise maximum entropy model can predict higher order statistical structures of the data (schematics in panel B), such as the probability for triplets of mice being in the same compartment (subtracted by the prediction of the independent model, mathematically <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>ijk</italic></sub>(<italic>r, r, r</italic>) − <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>)<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>)<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>)) (D), and the probability of <italic>K</italic> mice being found in the same compartment (E). (F) Conditional log-likelihood of mouse locations, predicted by the pairwise model (<italic>l</italic><sup>(1,2)</sup>), the independent model (<italic>l</italic><sup>(1)</sup>), and the null model assuming no compartment preference or interactions (<italic>l</italic><sup>(0)</sup>, the yellow line), for each mice (cohort M1 before TIMP-1 treatment, <italic>N</italic> = 15).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="550619v4_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Since measurements of location preference, and the incohort sociability, together with the dynamical observables such as the rate of activity, are stable over time (SI <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>) it invites a quantitative modeling of the joint-probability distribution of the co-localization of mice.</p>
<p>To distinguish social structure interactions from the effective correlations that define in-cohort sociability, we build a maximum entropy model with pairwise interactions. This approach constrains the joint probability distribution of all the possible co-localization patterns of all mice to reproduce the empirical occupation frequencies <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="550619v4_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and the in-cohort sociability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="550619v4_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, while otherwise remaining as random as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. With these assumptions, the joint probability distribution of the mice co-localization patterns can be written as
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="550619v4_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>ir</italic></sub> is the individual preference of mouse <italic>i</italic> to be in compartment <italic>r</italic>, and <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is the interaction between mouse <italic>i</italic> and mouse <italic>j</italic>. The set of parameters ({<italic>h</italic><sub><italic>ir</italic></sub>, <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>}) is learned through gradient descent (see SI <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref> and <bold>Materials and Methods</bold> for details). The interactions <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> may be positive or negative. We see that although the structure of the interactions <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> follows that of incohort sociability <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, they are not identical (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Likewise, individual mice preferences <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>ir</italic></sub> are not equal to the occupation probability <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>ir</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Thus, this approach allows us to distinguish direct interactions from indirect ones.</p>
<p>To validate the model, we tested that it is able to predict higher order features of the data, such as the probability of a specific combination of triplets of mice being in the same compartment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2BD</xref>), and the probability of observing <italic>K</italic> mice in the same compartment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), with the overestimation at large <italic>K</italic> possibly due to the limit of finite data. Although the model assumes the strength of interaction does not depend on which compartment the mice are in, our minimal model can predict probability of <italic>K</italic> mice in certain compartments (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S4</xref>, compartments 1 and 3). We call in-state probability the distribution of box occupancy of each mouse given the position of all other mice (see <bold>Materials and Methods</bold>). The model prediction for in-state probabilities match the observed one, showing that the model gives an unbiased estimate of individual mouse positions (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S5</xref>). Moreover, models with triplet interactions show signs of overfitting under cross-validation, which is mitigated when the triplet interactions are suppressed close to zero using L2 regularization (see and <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S6</xref>). These results show that pairwise interaction among mice are sufficient to assess the observed collective behavior.</p>

<title>Choosing timescales for analysis</title>
<p>To construct an interaction model based on the steady state distribution, we first need to consider the proper timescales for which we average over the observables, i.e. mean and correlation of the mice co-localization patterns.</p>
<p>If the timescale is too short, then the error of estimation may be large. More severely, the system may not have enough time to equilibrate, and the time average will not result in the steady state distribution. On the other hand, if the timescale is too long, we loose biologically meaningful information about the temporal evolution of the system, such as the adaptation of the mice in a new environment and evolution of the social interaction strength.</p>
<p>To identify the proper timescale, we systematically conduct cross-validation for pairwise maximum entropy models constructed using <italic>K</italic> days of data, where <italic>K</italic> = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and each day of the data contains the 6 hours when the mice are most active. The data is then separated into training sets that consist of 5-hours of the data from each day and test sets that consist of 1-hour of the data each day. Pairwise maximum entropy models with L2 regularization with strength <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>J</italic></sub> imposed on the pairwise interactions are learned from the training set, and the trainingand the test-set likelihoods are computed. As shown in <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S7</xref>, the test-set likelihood decreases as the regularization strength increases for cumulate data with number of days <italic>K ≥</italic> 4, indicating that the pairwise model generalizes well. We choose <italic>K</italic> = 5 for subsequent analysis, as it does not overfit, and it gives us temporal information about how the interaction structures may change over the 10-day experiment.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S8</xref>, for all four cohorts, the box preference tendency is consistent, with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient between models learned from the first and the last five days being 0.6 ± 0.1. For cohort M1, M3 and M4, the distribution of the individual chamber preferences is consistent over time, with the two-sample <italic>F</italic>-test for equal variance being non-significant, and the two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test for equal mean being either non-significant or with a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.04 for cohort M1. For cohort M2, both the mean and the variance of the chamber preferences significantly changed between the first and the last 5 days of the experiment. Nonetheless, the Pearson’s correlation between the two data segments remain large at <italic>p</italic> = 0.57, indicating a consistency over time for the same cohort. Different cohorts exhibit different distributions of chamber preferences.</p>
<p>For the inferred interaction parameters <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, the distribution is consistent between the first 5 days and the last 5 days of the data. Specifically, for all four cohorts, the standard deviations of the interactions do not change between the first 5 days and the last 5 days of the data, as shown by two-sample <italic>F</italic>-test for equal variance. The mean of the inferred interactions does not change for cohort M1 and M3, however for cohort M2 and M4, two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test for equal mean returns a <italic>p</italic> = 0.0034 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0073 respectively for the interactions. Notably, across from the four different cohorts, two-sample <italic>F</italic>-test with Bonferroni correction shows that the variance of all eight 5-day modeling are not significantly different. In contrast, cross-cohort comparison between male (cohort M1 before drug injection) and female (cohort F1 before drug injection) shows significantly different variance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 between the last 5 days of F1 and the first 5 days or the last 5 days of M1) and mean (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) of the inferred interaction strength, which shows that these measures of sociability can be used to distinguish strains or genders. Nonetheless, the strengths of the individual interactions in the specific pairs of mice <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j, J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, vary more notably, as given by Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0.015 ± 0.165 (see <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S8C</xref>). This implies that the maximum entropy model does not infer a social structure that is stable over time.</p>

<title>Quantifying the influence of social versus individual preferences</title>
<p>Further, we ask how important social interactions are for determining mice behavior, by measuring how much the data can be explained by the individual preferences for specific spaces within the territory vs. the interactions with other mice. Mice are social animals, yet they perform many behaviors based on their individual moment-to-moment needs, and it is unclear <italic>a priori</italic> how much the social interactions influence mice behavior in comparison to their individual preference.</p>
<p>For each mouse <italic>i</italic>, we consider three nested models with increasing descriptive power: first, the null model assuming each mouse has the same probability of being found in each compartment, <italic>P</italic> <sup>(0)</sup>(<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) = 1<italic>/</italic>4; second, the independent model that assumes no interactions among mice, and the probability of finding each mouse in each compartment is solely determined by their individual preferences, <italic>P</italic> <sup>(1)</sup>(<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) = <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>); third, the inferred pairwise interaction model based on voluntarily spending time with other mice considered, <italic>P</italic> <sup>(2)</sup>(<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> |{<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>j</italic>≠<italic>i</italic></sub>}), using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 2</xref>.</p>
<p>We then quantified how well each model explains the data by comparing the mean log-likelihoods of finding a mouse in a given compartment, conditioned on the location of all other mice. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, including information on pairwise interactions increases the log-likelihood of the data by as much as including information on individual compartment preferences, as shown by the similar values of the probability ratios <italic>P</italic> <sup>(2)</sup><italic>/P</italic> <sup>(1)</sup> and <italic>P</italic> <sup>(1)</sup><italic>/P</italic> <sup>(0)</sup>. The likelihood is consistent between the first five days and the last five days of the experiment, but exhibits variability across different cohorts of animals within the same strain (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S9</xref>).</p>
<p>Another possible measure of sociability is the mutual information between a single mouse’s location within the territory and the location of the rest of the cohort, which tells us how accurately the position of a single mouse can be predicted if the positions of all other mice are known (see details in). The possible values of the mutual information is between 0 and 2 bits, where 0 bits means no predictability, and 2 bits means perfect predictability. In our Eco-HAB data, the average mutual information for each mouse is 0.0323 ± 0.0151(SD) bits for cohort M1, with the largest value being 0.06 bits, indicating that despite non-zero sociability, the precise mouse position at any single moment is difficult to predict from the network.</p>

<title>Effect of impairing neuronal plasticity in the PL on subterritory preferences and sociability</title>
<p>As a next step we investigate the effects of impairing neuronal plasticity in the prelimbic cortex (PL), the brain structure containing neural circuits indispensable for both maintaining proper social interactions and encoding individual preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. To that end, we inject animals with a Tissue Inhibitor of MetalloProteinases (TIMP-1), an enzyme regulating the activity of synaptic plasticity proteins. Changing its physiological levels was previously shown to disrupt the neuronal plasticity in various brain structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] where an overexpression of TIMP-1 is found to block the activity of matrix metalloproteinases and prevent the induction of late long-term potentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>. More specifically to the PL, it has been recently demonstrated in the Eco-HAB that injecting nanoparticles (NP) gradually releasing TIMP-1 (NP-TIMP-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] in the PL can reduce the mice’s interest in chasing other animals (a proxy for their social ranks), and diminish persistence in seeking reward related to social olfactory cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] – which supports the idea that TIMP-1 has regional-specific effects on behavioral processes.</p>
<p>Here, we measure the behavior of a cohort of <italic>N</italic> = 15 C57BL/6J male mice, before and after the injection of NP-TIMP-1. A cohort of mice is introduced into the Eco-HAB and their free behavior is measured for 10 days (see schematics in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Then, neuronal activity in the PL of the subjects is impaired by injecting nanoparticles releasing TIMP-1 into the PL. After recovery animals are re-introduced into the Eco-HAB, and their behavior is measured for another 10 days. As a control we also have a cohort (male cohort M4, <italic>N</italic> = 9) that is injected with nanoparticles loaded with bovine serum albumin, a physiologically neutral substance having no impact on neuronal plasticity (BSA, vehicle). The detailed experimental procedure can be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. To provide a perspective on both sexes, a female cohort is also included in this study (female cohort F1, <italic>N</italic> = 13); it was processed identically to the experimental group of males described above. For each five days of the experiment, we infer a pairwise model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 2</xref>) and study the changes of the inferred interactions, as well as individual preferences for specific spaces within the territory. The choice of fiveday aggregated data for analysis is in line both with the proper timescales needed for the pairwise maximum entropy model to not overfit, and with the literature that TIMP-1 release from the TIMP-1-loaded nanoparticles is stable for 7-10 days after injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] (i.e. 2-5 days after the mice are reintroduced to Eco-HAB).</p>

<p>We can assess the change in both the interaction strength <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> and the individual preferences for the compartments containing food Δ<italic>h</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> following the prolonged release of TIMP-1. The individual preferences for compartment containing food shows an increase in both its mean and its variance across all mice following treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), with a return to pre-treatment levels after five days, consistent with the time course of TIMP-1 release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. In comparison, the control cohort M4 shows the increase in preference for the compartments containing food after injection of the BSA-loaded nanoparticles, which does not return to base level after 5 days (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). For the interaction strength, as shown by <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, the variability of interactions <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is not significantly different before and after the TIMP-1 injection for the male cohort M1 (two-samples <italic>F</italic>-test for equal variance with Bonferroni correction; see), although there exists a few outliers with strong interactions, which again returns to base level after 5 days of TIMP-1 injection. The increase of interaction variability is significant in the female co-hort, when comparing the first 5 days after treatment with the first 5 days before treatment (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S10</xref>), and is not observed for the male BSA cohort M4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). We can also ask how TIMP-1 induced modification of PL plasticity affects individual mice, by comparing the pairwise specific interactions <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> before and after drug treatment. However, we cannot conclude much as Pearson’s correlation coefficient between <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> shows almost no significant correlation across the four time periods in the above datasets for both the TIMP-1 treated cohort and the BSA-treated control cohort (<xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S11</xref>).</p>
<p>To quantify the sociability of the entire cohort, we compute conditional likelihoods as introduced in the previous paragraphs, as it measures how much the pairwise model explains the observed data compared to a model where mice behave independently. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> shows that for cohort M1, the model’s likelihoods sharply increase following treatment, meaning that the behavior is more predictable. Represented by the independent model, the individual compartment preferences explain most of this increase, suggesting that TIMP-1 treatment reorganizes preferences for specific subterritories. These differences decay back to pre-treatment levels after 5 days, following the time course of drug release. A slightly smaller increase in model’s likelihood is observed in the control cohort M4 after BSA injection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>), suggesting that at least part of the change in compartment preferences can be due to the injection procedure rather than change in the neuronal plasticity itself. In contrast, the increasing model likelihood is not found in the female cohort F1, where the conditional likelihood remains constant after TIMP-1 treatment. However, the contribution of the pairwise interaction is increased (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S10E</xref>), which points to a sex specificity of observed effects.</p>
<p>This observation is further confirmed by the sociability measure of mutual information between single mouse location and the positions of the rest of the cohort, which was introduced in previous paragraphs. The mutual information either does not change (for the male cohort M1, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, or increases (for the female cohort F1, <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S10</xref>) after the injection of TIMP-1.</p>

<title>Impaired neuronal plasticity in the PL affects the structure of social interactions</title>
<p>The increasing variability of pairwise interactions and the non-decreasing mutual information between single mouse location and the location of the rest of the group upon TIMP-1 requires further investigation in the face of previous results showing that injecting TIMP-1 to the PL of wide type animals reduces their sociability. Thus, we examined the detailed group structure of pairwise interactions. We define the dissatisfaction triplet index (DTI) among a triplet of mice as <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>ijk</italic></sub> <italic>≡ − J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub><italic>J</italic><sub><italic>jk</italic></sub><italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ki</italic></sub> if and only if among the three pairwise interactions among mice <italic>i, j</italic> and <italic>k</italic>, exactly one of them is negative (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> for schematics), and otherwise zero. Notice that DTI is analogous to the concept of “frustration” in physics of disordered systems. A positive DTI means a triplet of pairwise interactions where all of them cannot be satisfied simultaneously – for instance, if mouse <italic>i</italic> likes to be with <italic>j</italic> and <italic>k</italic>, but <italic>j</italic> and <italic>k</italic> do not like to be together. We define the global DTI by averaging the local DTI’s across all possible triplets of mice. The larger the global DTI is for a cohort, the more difficult it is for the cohort to form cliques with multiple mice where the interactions among each possible pairs are positive, which may suggest possible difficulty in transmitting information between mice. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, PL-targeted plasticity disruption with TIMP-1 significantly increases the global DTI for the male mice cohort M1 and the female cohort F1 (two-sample Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test, variability from random halves of the data; see for details of the significant test). In contrast, in the control cohort M4, injecting male mice with BSA either does not significantly change the global DTI or decreases it. Notably, the difference of the DTI is not due to the control group M4 has less mice, as sub-sampling both on the level of the inferred interactions (<xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S12</xref>) and on the level of the mice locations (<xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S13</xref>) give the same DTI for cohorts M1 and F1. This increase of the global DTI is due to the increasing variance of the interaction <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, which is related to more of the negative interactions. Randomly shuffling <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> does not change the global DTI, indicating that no network structure was found that contributes to this global DTI (<xref rid="figS14" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S14</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We demonstrate how the joint probability distribution of the mice positions in the Eco-HAB can be used to quantify sociability. By building a pairwise interaction model whose parameters are learned directly from the data, we quantify how much the combined activities of all mice in the cohort are influenced by their individual preferences and how much by the social context. This approach shows that, within the setup of the seminatu-ralistic Eco-HAB experiments, pairwise interactions between mice are sufficient to describe the statistics of collective behavior in larger groups. Additionally, the pair-wise interaction model can capture changes in the social interactions of the network induced by alterations in the neuronal plasticity of the prelimbic cortex (PL) in the tested subjects. The Eco-HAB, combined with this analytical approach, provides a toolbox to quantify sociability in mice, which can be applied generally to different mouse strains to study various behavioral phenotypes, including characteristics associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Compared to traditional experimental methods like the three-chamber test, our study combines the advantages of an ecologically relevant and automatic experimental apparatus with the powerful tools of statistical inference. The use of statistical inference methods such as maximum entropy models disentangles the effects of individual preferences versus pairwise social interactions in generating the patterns of mouse positions within their territory.</p>
<p>The challenge in studying social behavior lies in finding a balance between being specific enough to capture the properties of sociability while avoiding the loss of generalizability. Including excessive details, such as the classification of precise social behavior among mice, may lead to a more accurate description of the specific mice cohort studied, such as the construction of a precise social network. However, it is difficult to assess comparability across different cohorts of mice. Alternatively, as used in this paper, one can construct minimal models and use the ensemble statistics of the models to quantify social properties of a mouse strain without explicitly constructing social networks for each cohort. For example, our study found that the inferred interaction has similar ensemble statistics across four different male cohorts of the same strain but differs across different sexes. This provides evidence to support our argument for a coarse-grained description of mouse social behavior.</p>
<p>Another challenge in studying social behavior lies in the interplay of timescales. We found in this paper that in order to gather enough statistics and to avoid over-fitting, we need to construct probabilistic models using aggregated five-day data, which poses a challenge to balance model construction with enough data versus studying the temporal evolution of sociability. Is the variability of the social network a true property of the social interaction of the mice cohort, or is it due to variabilities of the inferred model caused by the finite data? To address this question, one needs to consider various timescales. For example, mice-mice interactions occur at a much shorter timescale compared to the timescale of changes in the social network, while in between, there are the timescales of adaptation to the new environment and the circadian cycle. These issues need to be addressed using a combination of theoretical tools and experimental validation methods in future works.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have simplified our analysis by focusing on a 6-hour time window each day, during which the rate of locomotor activity is most stable. This approach allowed us to circumvent issues related to individual or strain differences in the circadian cycle, such as the observed “lunch hour” in C57 male mice. One avenue for future research involves reintroducing the circadian cycle as a latent variable to better explain the system. However, caution must be exercised to differentiate between group behavior influenced by the circadian cycle of individual mice and emergent behavior resulting from interactions.</p>
<p>While not the main focus of this paper, we tested our methods of quantifying sociability on both female and male mice of the same strain undergoing the same alteration of neuronal plasticity in the PL. Interestingly, while both male and female mice demonstrate an increase of competitive pairwise interactions upon such alteration, they also exhibit many differences in sociability: for example, the individual preferences increase more in male mice after TIMP-1 injection than the female mice.</p>
<p>We will now discuss the relationship between our study and that of Shemesh et al., wherein the authors applied a similar approach, investigating the social behavior of groups of 4 mice in a complex experimental environment using statistical modeling of the joint probability distribution of mice locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Both Shemesh et al. and us uses maximum entropy models to analyze co-localization patterns of a group of mice housed in complex environments. While Shemesh et al. found that triplet interactions are necessary to describe collective behavior, we found that triplet interactions can be predicted by the pairwise model. We suspect the difference in our results could arise from three factors. First, the experimental arena is quite different between the Eco-HAB and what was used in Shemesh et al. – while the Eco-HAB mimics a naturalistic environment with tubes and connected chambers, the experimental arena in Shemesh et al. contains only one chamber, which could cause a difference in how mice interact. Second, even if the interaction patterns do not change, the nature of the data is different: our data is more coarse-grained spatially, as the state of each mouse is determined by the large compartment it is in, whereas in Shemesh et al., the location is more precise (e.g., a door, a pillar, etc.). As suggested by a comparison to renormalization theory in physics, at coarser spatial scales, the importance of higher-order interactions is likely to decrease. Finally, our studies include more mice (10 to 15) compared to Shemesh et al. (4 mice), which may also influence the importance of higher-order interactions. Larger group size also means that including triplet interactions in our model causes overfitting, which restricts the models we have access to to pairwise interactions. To further investigate these effects, future experiments in Eco-HAB could include mice cohorts of smaller sizes. More generally, this discrepancy when looking at different choices of variables raises the issue that when studying social behavior of animals in a group, it is important to test and compare interaction models with different complexity (e.g. pairwise or with higher-order interactions). Furthermore, since pair-wise maximum entropy model is one of the simplest of all maximum entropy models that can describe interactions among individuals, it serves as an excellent starting point to describe collective and social behavior in animals.</p>
<p>How do we move forward, and what is the ideal experiment to study social behaviors? We believe that Eco-HAB offers a balance between a semi-natural environment and controllability, which works well in studying social behavior. One direction for future experimental studies is to focus on the biological function of social interactions. For example, how do mouse cohorts respond to novel odors and transmit information among the cohort? What is the speed of information transmission related to sociability? The current configuration of the Eco-HAB already allows for the introduction of novel odors accessible to all mice, while the next generation of experiments will localize the introduction of information to individuals. From the analysis perspective, as presented in this manuscript, our current model is purely static. Our model describes the joint probability distribution of mice positions within the territory at concurrent time points and does not model the dynamics of the cohort. To take into account the dynamic aspect of social behaviors, such as dominant mice actively chasing others, one will need to build dynamical models of interaction. For example, this can be done by modeling the probability of transitioning to another compartment of each mouse as a function of the history of its previous location and the locations of all other mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].</p>

C57BL/6J male and female mice were bred in the Animal House of Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences or Mossakowski Medical Research Centre, Polish Academy of Sciences. The animals entered the experiments when 2-3 month old. They were littermates derived from several breeding pairs. The mice were transferred to the animal room at least 2 weeks before the experiments started and put in the groups of 12-15 in one cage (56 cm× 34 cm× 20cm) with enriched environment (tubes, shelters, nesting materials). They were kept under 12h/12h light-dark cycle. The cages were cleaned once per week. Five cohorts of mice were used in the analysis of this manuscript (see details in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Exclude inactive and dead mice from analysis</title>
<p>Mouse whose trajectory does not cover all four compartments within the 6-hour period for at least one day of the experiment is defined as inactive, and excluded from the analysis. Including inactive mice in the maximum entropy model will results in unstable learned parameters, as shown by bootstrapped results. For the same mouse cohort before and after injection of drug (M1, M4, and F1), if a mouse is dead or inactive in either phase of the experiment, its trajectory is masked out from the data for consistency of comparison before and after. Specifically, for cohort F1, mouse number 13 (in the original ordering of the 14 mice) is inactive after the drug application. For cohort M4, mouse number 3 and 11 (in the original ordering of the 12 mice) died after surgery, mouse number 9 (in the original ordering) is inactive in the 10th day after drug injection. The total number of mice used in the analysis is given in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Mice location</title>
<p>The raw data consists of time points when mice cross an antenna, as well as the identity of the specific antenna, which are placed at the ends of the four tunnels. The location of a mouse at any given time point is deduced from the most recent time stamps before and after the current time point. For simplicity, for the time points when a mouse is in the tunnel, the location of the mouse is set to be the compartment it will enter. The time resolution is set to 2 seconds, as two adjacent time stamps with separation less than 2 seconds are likely an artifact of mice sniffing the tunnel and returning to the previous compartment.</p>

<p>The mutual information between single mouse position and the rest of the network is a measure of collectiveness. For Eco-HAB with 4 compartments, the mutual information is between 0 and 2 bits. If the mutual information is close to 2 bits, knowing where other mice are is a perfect predictor for the position of single mouse. If the mutual information is close to 0 bits, knowing where other mice are do not help predicting the position of the singled-out mouse.

<p>To test the validity of a triplet interaction model, we varied the regularization strength <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>. For our largest dataset, the cumulative data consist of all 10 days of the experiment on cohort M1 (<italic>N</italic> = 15), we performed cross-validation by splitting the 6-hour data into 6 different training-test set combo (5 hours of data in training set, and 1 hour in the test set). As shown by <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S6</xref>, the test set likelihood is found to be maximized when the regularization parameter <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> is large, which corresponds to close to zero triplet interactions. This indicates that even for our largest datasets, including the triplet interactions in the model have increased the model complexity beyond what the data allows, and the best way to avoid overfitting is for us to not consider triplet interactions. Hence, the interaction models we choose to study in this manuscript is restricted to pairwise interaction models.</p>

<caption><title>The global dissatisfaction triplet index (DTI) computed using shuffled interaction, <italic>F</italic><sub>shuffled</sub> vs. the global DTI computed using the inferred interaction, <italic>F</italic><sub>random half</sub>.</title>
<p>Each point corresponds to one random half of the data. The two sets of global DTI’s are equal within the range of the error bars, computed by standard deviation across 20 random shuffling of the inferred interaction <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, which shows the global DTI comes from the value of the inferred interaction, and that there is no additional network structure of the inferred interaction</p></caption>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The quantitative approach to analyzing social interactions is laudable and the study is interesting. It demonstrates that the Eco-HAB can be used for high throughput, standardized and automated tests of the effects of brain manipulations on social structure in large groups of mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A demonstration of TIMP-1 impairing neural plasticity specifically in the prelimbic cortex of the treated animals would greatly strengthen the biological conclusions. The Eco-HAB provides coarser spatial information compared to some other approaches, which may influence the conclusions.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors have constructively responded to previous referee comments and I believe that the manuscript is a useful addition to the literature. I particularly appreciate the quantitative approach to social behavior, but have two cautionary comments.</p>
<p>(1) Conceptually it is important to further justify why this particular maximum entropy model is appropriate. Maximum entropy models have been applied across a dizzying array of biological systems, including genes, neurons, the immune system, as well as animal behavior, so would seem quite beneficial to explain the particular benefits here, for mouse social behavior as coarse-grained through the eco-hab chamber occupancy. This would be an excellent chance to amplify what the models can offer for biological understanding, particularly in the realm of social behavior</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Maximum entropy models, along with other statistical inference methods that learn interaction patterns from simultaneously-measured degrees of freedom, help distinguish various types of interactions, e.g. direct vs. indirect interactions among animals, individual preference to food vs. social interaction with pairs. As research on social behavior expands from focusing on pairs of animals to studying groups in (semi-)naturalistic environments, maximum entropy models serve as a crucial link between high-throughput data and the need to identify and distinguish interaction rules. Specifically, among all possible maximum entropy models, the pairwise maximum entropy model is one of the simplest that can describe interactions among individuals, which serves as an excellent starting point to understand collective and social behavior in animals.</p>
<p>Although the Eco-HAB setup currently records spatially coarse-grained data, it still provides more spatial information compared to the traditional three-chamber tests used to assess sociability for rodents. By showing that the maximum entropy model can effectively analyze Eco-HAB data, we hope to highlight its potential in research of social behavior in animals.</p>
<p>To amplify what the models can offer for biological understanding particularly in the realm of social behavior, We have updated the Introduction to add a more logical structure to the need of using maximum entropy models to identify interactions among mice. Additionally, we updated the first paragraph of the Discussion to make it specific that it is the use of maximum entropy models that identifies interaction patterns from the high-throughput data. Finally, we have also added in the Discussion (line 422-425) arguments supporting the specific use of pairwise maximum entropy models to study social behaviors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Maximum entropy models of even intermediate size systems involve a large number of parameters. The authors are transparent about that limitation here, but I still worry that the conclusion of the sufficiency of pairwise interactions is simply not general, and this may also relate to the differences from previous work. If, as the authors suggest in the discussion, this difference is one of a choice of variables, then that point could be emphasized. The suggestion of a follow up study with a smaller number of mice is excellent.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising the issue and agree that the caveat of how general pairwise interactions can describe social behavior of animals needs to be discussed. We have added a sentence in the Discussion to point out this important caveat. “More generally, this discrepancy when looking at different choices of variables raises the issue that when studying social behavior of animals in a group, it is important to test and compare interaction models with different complexity (e.g. pairwise or with higher-order interactions).” We have also toned down our conclusion to limit our results of pairwise interactions describing mice co-localization patterns to the data collected in Eco-HAB (also see Reviewer 3 Major Point 2).</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major points</p>
<p>(1) Do the Authors have evidence that TIMP-1 was effective, as well as specific to the prelimbic cortex?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We refer to the literature for the effectiveness and specificity of TIMP-1 to the prelimbic cortex.</p>
<p>Specifically, the study by Okulski et al. (Biol. Psychiatry 2007) provides clear evidence that TIMP1 plays a role in synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex. They showed that TIMP-1 is induced in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) following stimulation that triggers late long-term potentiation (LTP), a key model of synaptic plasticity. Overexpression of TIMP-1 in the mPFC blocked the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and prevented the induction of late LTP in vivo. Similar effects were observed with pharmacological inhibition of MMP-9 in vitro, reinforcing the idea that TIMP-1 regulates extracellular proteolysis as part of the plasticity mechanism in the prefrontal cortex. These findings confirm that TIMP-1 is both effective and active in this specific brain region.</p>
<p>Further evidence comes from Puścian et al. (Mol. Psychiatry 2022), who used TIMP-1-loaded nanoparticles to influence neuronal plasticity in the amygdala. They found that TIMP-1 affected MMP expression, LTP, and dendritic morphology, showing its impact on synaptic modifications. More directly relevant, Winiarski et al. (Sci. Adv. 2025) demonstrated that injecting TIMP-1-loaded nanoparticles into the prelimbic cortex altered responses to social stimuli, further supporting the idea that TIMP-1 has region-specific effects on behavioral processes.</p>
<p>We have also updated the main text (page 8, 1st paragraph of “Effect of impairing neuronal plasticity in the PL on subterritory preferences and sociability”) of the manuscript to include the above references.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The Authors seem to suggest that one main reason for the different results compared to Shemesh et al. 2013 was the coarseness of the Eco-HAB data. In this case, I think this conclusion should be toned down because of this significant caveat.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and agree that this caveat and difference should be emphasized. To tone down the conclusion, we have</p>
<p>(1) added details about the Eco-HAB (it being coarse-grained, etc.) in the abstract to tone down the conclusion.</p>
<p>(2) added to the results summary in the Discussion (top of page 12) that the results are “within in the setup of the semi-naturalistic Eco-HAB experiments”</p>
<p>(3) added to the Discussion (page 13) that the different results compared to Shemesh et al 2013 means that general studies of social behavior need to compare models with different levels of complexity (e.g. pairwise vs. higher-order interactions). (Also see Reviewer 2 Comment 2.)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points</p>
<p>(1) Please explain what is measured in Fig. 1C (what is on the y axis?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 1C shows the activity of the mice as measured by the rate of transitions, i.e. the number of times the mice switch boxes during each hour of the day, averaged over all N = 15 mice and T = 10 days (cohort M1). The error bars represent variability of activities across individuals or across days. For mouse-to-mouse variability (blue), we first compute for each mouse its number of transitions averaged over the same hour for all 10 days, then we compute its standard deviation across all 15 mice and plot it as error bars. For day-to-day variability (orange), we first compute for each day the number of transitions for each hour averaged over all mice, then compute its standard deviation across all 10 days as the errorbar. We have added the detailed explanation in the caption of Figure 1C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Fig. 3, it would be better to present the control group also in the main figure instead of the supplementary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have merged Figure 3 and Figure 3 Supplementary 1 to present the control group also in the main figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Fig. 3 and corresponding supplements, there seems to be a large difference between males and females. I think this would deserve some more discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While not being the main focus of this paper, we agree with the reviewer that the difference between male and female is important and deserves attention in the discussion and also future study. Thus we have added a paragraph in the Discussion (line 394-399, bottom of page 12).</p>
