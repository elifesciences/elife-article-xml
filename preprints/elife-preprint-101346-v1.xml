<title>Abstract</title><p>Origins of phenotypic novelty represent a paradox. Maintenance of distinct, canalized morphs usually requires a complex array of polymorphisms, whose co-retention requires a genetic architecture resistant to recombination, involving inversions and master regulators. Here, we reveal how such a constraining architecture can still accommodate novel morphs in evolving polymorphisms using the classic polymorphic Batesian mimicry in <italic>Papilio polytes</italic>, whose supergene-like genetic architecture is maintained in a large inversion. We show that rapidly evolving alleles of the conserved gene, <italic>doublesex</italic>, within this inversion underlie the genetic basis of this polymorphism. Using precisely dated phylogeny and breeding experiments, we show that novel adaptive mimetic morphs and underlying alleles evolved in a sequentially dominant manner, undergoing selective sweeps in the mimetic species as predicted under Haldane’s sieve. Furthermore, we discovered that mimetic forms share precise inversion breakpoints, allowing rare exon swaps between the universally dominant and a recessive allele to produce a novel, persistent intermediate phenotype, ultimately facilitating the acquisition of phenotypic novelty. Thus, genetic dominance, selective sweeps, rapid molecular divergence, and rare recombination promote novel forms in this iconic evolving polymorphism, resolving the paradox of phenotypic novelty arising even in highly constrained genetic architectures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nearly a hundred years ago, JBS Haldane—one of the architects of Modern Synthesis— predicted that novel adaptive mutations under strong selection will rise rapidly to a high frequency if they are genetically dominant over wild-type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. This is because the new, even partially dominant mutations are exposed to selection instantly, rather than suffer potential loss by random genetic drift, even when they initially appear as heterozygotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. This is now known as Haldane’s sieve. In undefended prey species or Batesian mimics, the mutation that confers phenotypic similarity to well-protected aposematic models is under strong selection because it confers high fitness by reducing predation pressure. Thus, this adaptive mutation will spread rapidly under strong selection if it is dominant, as Haldane predicted. Indeed, mimetic forms in polymorphic mimicry in <italic>Papilio</italic> swallowtails are often genetically dominant over non-mimetic forms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Two critical predictions follow from this: (a) mimetic forms that evolve in succession are likely to be sequentially dominant, and (b) the mimicry gene will show signatures of selective sweeps and/or episodic selection because of a few successive mutations that improve mimetic resemblance. However, testing the Haldane’s sieve hypothesis has been difficult in wild populations since the precise evolutionary chronology of mimetic forms in relation to non-mimetic relatives among these species, the dominance relationships among different female forms, and the precise molecular identities of the underlying genes and alleles have been poorly characterised. Likewise, strongly advantageous novel mutations that sweep through populations may completely replace wild-type alleles, making it difficult to estimate their evolutionary origins and the dominance relationships amongst them. On the contrary, selection for balanced polymorphisms in Batesian mimicry may maintain successive beneficial alleles, preserving their evolutionary histories in relation to the original wild-type (<italic>f. cyrus</italic> in case of the <italic>polytes</italic> species group; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This makes mimicry polymorphisms an excellent system to test the predictions of Haldane’s sieve, which we do here by uncovering the missing pieces mentioned above. Finally, we ask how molecular evolution and dominance interact with other genetic aspects to facilitate the evolution of novel forms in an existing polymorphism.</p>

<p><italic>Papilio</italic> swallowtail butterflies exhibiting polymorphic and female-limited mimicry are classic examples of complex polymorphisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. As edible Batesian mimics, they derive protection from predators by mimicking toxic, warningly patterned (i.e., aposematic) butterflies. Exemplifying this is the <italic>Papilio polytes</italic> species group, which exhibits four female-limited mimetic morphs or forms (‘<italic>f.</italic>’): <italic>f. cyrus</italic> is male-like and non-mimetic, whereas <italic>f. polytes</italic>, <italic>f. theseus</italic> and <italic>f. romulus</italic> are Batesian mimics of aposematic <italic>Pachliopta</italic> models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Female forms <italic>cyrus</italic> and <italic>polytes</italic> occur in several species across the range of the group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). However, <italic>f. romulus</italic> is endemic to S. Asia and <italic>f. theseus</italic> is endemic to islands of SE Asia, because their aposematic models (<italic>Pachliopta hector</italic> and the black form of <italic>Pachliopta aristolochiae</italic>, respectively) are endemic to those regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The diversity of these mimetic polymorphisms peak in Sri Lanka and India, where forms <italic>cyrus</italic>, <italic>polytes</italic> and <italic>romulus</italic> co-occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and in SE Asia where forms <italic>cyrus</italic>, <italic>polytes</italic> and <italic>theseus</italic> co-occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The female forms in <italic>P. polytes</italic> are autosomally inherited and governed by a single locus, <italic>H</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, which was recently identified to be <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>—a developmental master regulator. Although <italic>dsx</italic> controls early developmental sex differentiation in insects, it has been co-opted repeatedly in pupal stages to produce ecologically relevant polymorphisms such as polymorphic mimicry in <italic>P. polytes</italic>, evolving rapidly under positive and pervasive selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. An inversion spanning the entire mimetic <italic>H</italic> allele generates a supergene-like architecture and largely prevents recombination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. How does a single conserved gene such as <italic>dsx</italic> with a constraining genetic architecture promote the remarkable phenotypic diversity observed across lineages in <italic>Papilio</italic>?</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<label>1.</label><title>Evolutionary chronology of mimetic forms</title>
<p>We showed recently that <italic>P. polytes</italic> is not a single species, as traditionally believed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, but a group of three allopatric species in two clades: (a) <italic>P. polytes</italic> (Asian mainland) and its sister <italic>P. javanus</italic> (mainly Sunda Islands), and (ii) <italic>P. alphenor</italic> (the Philippines), sister to the species pair <italic>P. phestus</italic> and <italic>P. ambrax</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a–b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. They show hallmarks of distinct species such as well-supported phylogenetic structure, genome-level divergence, strong assortative mate preference, and postzygotic barriers to hybridization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This discovery reveals the evolutionary history of mimetic polymorphism in this iconic species group, based on the unequal distribution of various female forms across species and populations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To determine the evolutionary chronology of different female forms along with the underlying mimicry gene inversion among species, we used secondary fossil calibration as previously applied in <italic>Papilio</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> to date the species phylogeny (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b–c</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>; sample details in Table S1). We estimated that the group is 9.58 million years (my) old (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 12.04 to 7.08 my), with the sexually monomorphic <italic>P. protenor</italic> being basal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b–c</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). We used a whole-genome dataset of the <italic>polytes</italic> group as well as inversion breakpoint-specific primers (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>) to track the evolutionary history of the <italic>dsx</italic> inversion. The orientation of the <italic>dsx</italic> homologs of outgroups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and the basal <italic>P. protenor</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> was inferred to be ancestral. Mimicry-related sexual dimorphism, and the <italic>dsx</italic> inversion, is a derived state shared by all descendent species, and is estimated to have evolved between 9.58 my and 4.21 mya (95% HPD: 5.76 to 2.77 my; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b–c</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). The ancestral orientation of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>f. cyrus</italic> were lost, and the <italic>dsx</italic> inversion and mimetic <italic>f. polytes</italic> were fixed, in the ancestor of <italic>P. phestus</italic> and <italic>P. ambrax</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). However, both mimicry and inversion polymorphisms were retained in <italic>P. alphenor</italic>, <italic>P. javanus</italic> and <italic>P. polytes</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, c</xref>). Females of these three species share the non-mimetic <italic>f. cyrus</italic> and mimetic forms <italic>f. polytes</italic> and <italic>f. theseus</italic>. We included multiple Batesian models of mimetic female forms that occur over their ranges, including all three models from the Indian subcontinent (<italic>Pachliopta aristolochiae, Pachliopta hector</italic> and <italic>Pachliopta pandiyana</italic>) in the time-calibrated phylogenetic reconstruction. The split between <italic>Pachliopta aristolochiae</italic> and <italic>Pachliopta hector</italic> is estimated to have occurred around 0.45 mya (95% HPD: 0.82 to 0.15 my; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). The wing pattern of <italic>Pachliopta aristolochiae</italic> is shared among several aposematic <italic>Pachliopta</italic> and related genera that occupy the mainland and islands in the Indo-Australian region, whereas <italic>P. hector</italic> has a unique wing pattern with two white bands on the forewing and no white spots on the hindwing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Thus, based both on the occurrence of female <italic>f. romulus</italic> in <italic>P. polytes</italic> alone (split from its sister <italic>P. javanus</italic> at approx. 1 my) and the evolution of the unique wing pattern of the Batesian model <italic>Pachliopta hector</italic> (split from its sister <italic>Pachliopta aristolochiae</italic> at approx. 0.45 my), we infer the evolution of <italic>f. romulus</italic> to be less than 0.45 my (95% HPD: 0.82 to 0.15 my) under a new protective umbrella of the S. Asia-endemic <italic>Pachliopta hector</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b–c</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). We tried to find sequences of the <italic>dsx</italic> inversion breakpoints in the genome sequences of all species in the subgenus <italic>Menelaides</italic> but found no sequence matches in any species outside of the <italic>P. polytes</italic> species group. Thus, the mimicry-related inversion found in the <italic>P. polytes</italic> species group appears to be restricted to that group alone. This implies that whatever long-term balancing selection that different <italic>dsx</italic> alleles underlying different female forms of <italic>P. polytes</italic> have experienced also span only the estimated approx. 9.58 my for <italic>f. cyrus</italic> and <italic>f. polytes</italic>, and approx. 1 to 0.45 my or shorter for <italic>f. romulus</italic>. However, smaller inversions in parts of <italic>dsx</italic> appear to be associated with mimicry in species of the <italic>memnon</italic> and <italic>gambrisius</italic> species groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<label>2.</label><title>Mimetic polymorphism in <italic>P. polytes</italic> maps to <italic>dsx</italic> alleles and their expression</title>
<p>The genetic basis of forms <italic>cyrus</italic> and <italic>polytes</italic> was earlier mapped to <italic>dsx</italic> alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. It was possible that <italic>f. romulus</italic> of <italic>P. polytes</italic> is regulated by another gene since it involves pigmentation (red spotting and white bands) that is different from <italic>f. polytes</italic> (white spotting). We identified the mimicry locus in <italic>f. romulus</italic> with a genome-wide association study using a <italic>romulus-cyrus</italic> segregating brood. GWAS revealed 20 sites significantly associated with <italic>f. romulus</italic>, all of which mapped to the <italic>dsx</italic> and neighbouring scaffolds that retain synteny with the <italic>dsx</italic>-containing chromosome 25 in <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>, <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>). Surprisingly, there were no significant hits within the <italic>dsx</italic> gene, which indicated that reads from <italic>f. romulus</italic> did not map to the <italic>cyrus</italic> allele, perhaps due to an inversion and subsequent genetic divergence. To test this possibility, we sequenced whole genomes of 41 wild-caught <italic>P. polytes</italic> including all three female forms across its geographical range (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>, Table S1. We found that reads from <italic>romulus dsx</italic> mapped to the mimetic <italic>H</italic> allele of <italic>f. polytes</italic>, and a few reads sparsely mapped to exons of the non-mimetic <italic>h</italic> allele. This indicated that <italic>romulus dsx</italic> occurred in the same inverted orientation as the <italic>H</italic> allele of <italic>f. polytes</italic>, which we now distinguish as <italic>dsx</italic> alleles <italic>H<sup>R</sup></italic> and <italic>H<sup>P</sup></italic>, respectively, and <italic>h</italic> referring to the recessive <italic>cyrus</italic> allele. To test whether <italic>H<sup>R</sup></italic> and <italic>H<sup>P</sup></italic> have the same <italic>dsx</italic> inversion, we inspected their breakpoints using breakpoint-specific primers (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>) in wild-caught as well as lab-bred individuals, including mapping broods. We found that the breakpoints of <italic>H<sup>R</sup></italic> and <italic>H<sup>P</sup></italic>were indistinguishable, confirming that the two mimetic alleles have a common evolutionary origin (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from sharing inversion breakpoints, <italic>H<sup>R</sup></italic> and <italic>H<sup>P</sup></italic> alleles were expressed at similar levels in the developing wings of 3-day old female pupae (mimetic wings) compared to those in males (non-mimetic wings) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). This 3-day pupal stage is a critical window for wing colour pattern differentiation of mimetic females in this species group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, isoform expression in the female forms was distinct: of the three known female isoforms of <italic>dsx, dsxF1</italic> was expressed predominantly in <italic>f. romulus</italic> wings compared to <italic>f. polytes</italic> wings (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). Moreover, each isoform differs in sequence and structure at the C-terminal end, which potentially alters the DNA-binding ability and facilitates regulation of different downstream effectors by <italic>dsx</italic> to produce the mimetic and non-mimetic wing patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Thus, evidence from genotype-phenotype mapping (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>), developmental expression (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>) and allelic characterisation (see below) shows implies that the <italic>H<sup>R</sup></italic> allele and its isoforms genetically and developmentally define and developmentally regulate <italic>f. romulus</italic>, even though it shares the same inversion breakpoints, many of the defining SNPs and pupal expression levels of the <italic>H<sup>P</sup></italic> allele of mimetic <italic>f. polytes</italic>.</p>
<p>Similar to <italic>f. romulus</italic>, the inversion breakpoints of <italic>f. theseus</italic> were identical to that of <italic>f. polytes</italic>, as seen in the alignment of genomic data (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). This confirmed that the <italic>dsx</italic> inversion occurred only once and was shared across all the mimetic female forms. However, the <italic>dsx</italic> coding sequence of <italic>f. theseus</italic> was identical to that of <italic>f. polytes</italic> in both <italic>P. javanus</italic> and <italic>P. alphenor</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This suggests that <italic>f. theseus</italic> may be a developmentally regulated variant of <italic>f. polytes</italic> in which white spots on hindwings are not expressed. This might also explain why <italic>f. polytes</italic> and <italic>f. theseus</italic> show equal dominance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Similar to <italic>f. polytes</italic>, <italic>f. theseus</italic> possibly evolved in the common ancestor of <italic>P. javanus</italic> and <italic>P. alphenor</italic> since it is shared between them (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a–c</xref>). In a previous study, Zhang <italic>et. al.,</italic> (2017) discovered different non-overlapping sets of <italic>theseus-</italic>specific SNPs in <italic>Papilio polytes</italic> and <italic>Papilio alphenor</italic>. Based on our finding that <italic>Papilio polytes</italic> is a complex of three species, we note that the Zhang <italic>et. al.</italic> study compared <italic>theseus</italic> females from <italic>P. javanus</italic> (sampled from Indonesia) with <italic>polytes</italic> females from <italic>P. polytes</italic> (sampled from Japan). Therefore, what they obtained were species-specific differences and not form-specific differences, which were non-overlapping between the two sets of <italic>theseus</italic> samples. The lack of sequence-level differences between forms <italic>polytes</italic> and <italic>theseus</italic> is encapsulated in our gene tree (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>), where both forms co-occur on the same branch, whether coding or non-coding <italic>dsx</italic> sequences are considered.

<p>An intriguing difference in the genetic basis of wing patterning in <italic>Papilio</italic> compared to <italic>Heliconius</italic> butterflies is the nature of genetic dominance. <italic>Papilio</italic> usually have a single locus governing polymorphic wing patterns, and morphs are determined by complete dominance in wing pattern inheritance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> whereas in <italic>Heliconius,</italic> several loci govern different aspects of wing patterning, and they often exhibit co-dominance among mimetic forms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Complete dominance might have been selected in <italic>Papilio</italic> Batesian mimics to protect mimetic forms from maladaptive intermediates. On the other hand, selection of co-dominance in the aposematic <italic>Heliconius</italic> might have led to novel combinations of wing patterns, which appear to be favoured in this group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. To characterise dominance relationships in <italic>P. polytes</italic>, we performed a series of crosses between pure-breeding lines of all three female forms, designed to exploit the known female-limitation of mimicry and achiasmatic oogenesis (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3d</xref>). These crosses showed a clear and complete dominance hierarchy between the three <italic>P. polytes</italic> female form alleles, with <italic>romulus</italic> &gt; <italic>polytes</italic> &gt; <italic>cyrus</italic>, and all segregating broods showing ∼1:1 ratio of dominant and recessive phenotypes, as expected under complete dominance (<xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>–5). These dominance relationships, and the strict allelic inheritance and expression of mimicry in a sex-specific manner, were confirmed by genotyping of parents and female offspring using our form-specific primers (Methods, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). None of the segregating broods showed intermediate or otherwise unusual wing colour phenotypes even when they were grown across different seasons in slightly variable climatic conditions and nutrition regimes, showing that environmental variation or genetic background did not affect the wing patterns (<xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>–5, personal observations). The female forms were thus controlled strictly by their allelic combinations under complete dominance.</p>
<p>The inferred sequence of origins of female forms and its inverse relationship with genetic dominance in <italic>P. polytes</italic> strictly follow the pattern predicted by Haldane: the ancestral, non-mimetic <italic>f. cyrus</italic> that evolved less than 9.58 mya is universally recessive, the next novel mimetic <italic>f. polytes</italic>=<italic>f. theseus</italic> that originated before 4.21 my is dominant over <italic>f. cyrus</italic>, and the most recent <italic>f. romulus</italic> that originated less than 1 mya is universally dominant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). These genetic dominance relationships and sex-limitation of mimicry do not break down in interspecific crosses with monomorphic or polymorphic sister species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> – contrary to the pattern observed in <italic>Heliconius numata</italic> where derived dominant alleles also show codominance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> <italic>–</italic> indicating that the genetic bases of these two critical adaptations are highly canalised, outweighing the potential impacts of different genomic backgrounds across species.</p>

<p>How have the selective sweeps and episodic positive selection influenced molecular diversity and allelic differentiation in <italic>dsx</italic> in the context of mimicry? An analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms revealed that the three <italic>dsx</italic> alleles (<italic>H<sup>R</sup></italic>, <italic>H<sup>P</sup></italic> and <italic>h</italic>) were highly differentiated: pairwise comparisons of genome sequences of the three female forms revealed high average Fst (0.6 to 1) between variable loci of the three <italic>dsx</italic> alleles (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). DNA sequences of <italic>H<sup>R</sup></italic>, <italic>H<sup>P</sup></italic> and <italic>h</italic> alleles (<italic>H<sup>R</sup></italic> n=10; <italic>H<sup>P</sup></italic> n=35; and <italic>h</italic> n=26) showed a total of 151 fixed substitutions (i.e., 13% of the exonic sequence), which have accumulated in short timeframes with the evolution of the three alleles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>–<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Some of these substitutions are in the critically important domain regions of this conserved developmental master regulator, and a few involve amino acid substitutions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). For example, the OD2 domain of <italic>H<sup>R</sup></italic> has some <italic>romulus-</italic>specific amino acid substitutions which might affect the protein-protein interactions of <italic>dsx</italic> that this domain facilitates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, all these allele-specific substitutions appear to fix early in the evolution of alleles, irrespective of how the female forms are parsed subsequently among species: the <italic>dsx</italic> gene tree showed a well-supported topology in which branches clustered first by colour forms and then by species, rather than the reverse—a pattern also seen in the haplotype network (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>).

<p>The high molecular divergence between the coding regions of the three <italic>dsx</italic> alleles within the <italic>polytes</italic> species group, and especially between the mimetic <italic>H<sup>R</sup></italic> and <italic>H<sup>P</sup></italic> alleles of <italic>P. polytes</italic> alone in approx. 1 my, represents an exceptionally high rate of adaptive divergence under positive selection. Indeed, the percentage substitutions observed in <italic>dsx</italic> alleles within this single species is comparable to that across multiple insect genera (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>).

<label>5.</label><title>Rare exon swaps produce novel mimetic intermediates</title>
<p>The <italic>dsx</italic> alleles determining different female forms are protected by the inversion or lack of recombination, but how can novel forms evolve in this existing polymorphism? Do they arise strictly from existing forms in a sequential manner via accumulation of substitutions, as suggested above for existing female forms in the <italic>polytes</italic> species group? Or are there other mechanisms, such as evolution in isolation followed by hybridization and introgression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, or enhancer shuffling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and differential developmental regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> by which new forms may be accommodated? A novel female form of <italic>P. polytes</italic> offers a window into this interesting problem. This intermediate form, which we first noticed in nature (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>, and was also observed by Clarke and Sheppard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>) and then retrieved in a captive, mixed breeding population (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), had <italic>romulus</italic>-like forewings and <italic>polytes</italic>-like hindwings. We bred this form for over five generations, confirming that it was fertile and genetically stable. We examined the <italic>dsx</italic> sequence of two individuals from this pure-breeding line, which showed that they carried <italic>romulus-</italic>specific SNPs in exon 1, and <italic>polytes-</italic>specific SNPs in exons 2–5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b–c</xref>). This implied that their ancestor had a recombination event in the approx. 35kb intronic region between exon 1 of <italic>H<sup>R</sup></italic> and exon 2 of <italic>H<sup>P</sup></italic> alleles. This intermediate phenotype demonstrates that <italic>romulus-</italic>specific SNPs in exon 1 (which contains the DNA-binding domain) may be sufficient to change the phenotype of the forewings but not produce a complete <italic>romulus</italic> phenotype, and that exons 2–5 of <italic>H<sup>P</sup></italic> could override the dominance of <italic>H<sup>R</sup></italic>allele to produce <italic>polytes</italic>-like hindwings. The protein-protein interaction domain that lies on other exons may be more critical for patterning hindwings, implying that <italic>dsx</italic> could have form-specific interacting partners, which is also suggested by the <italic>romulus-</italic>specific amino acid substitutions in OD2 domain of <italic>H<sup>R</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The 35kb region between exons 1 and 2 may also carry regulatory elements that affect the expression of <italic>dsx</italic>. Although, we do not observe an overall difference in <italic>dsx</italic> expression between these female forms (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>), the isoform <italic>dsx</italic>F1 seems to exclusively express in <italic>romulus</italic> females.

<p>This persistent intermediate phenotype suggests genetic means, e.g., a rare exon swap, by which novel mimicry phenotypes may be generated. This intermediate phenotype has no existing aposematic model to protect it from predation, so it may be considered at present to be maladaptive. However, such naturally occurring standing variation might become adaptive in other selective landscapes with different distasteful models. Interestingly, other wing pattern combinations, e.g., <italic>polytes</italic>-like forewings and <italic>romulus</italic>-like hindwings, or any other intermediate phenotypes, have never been observed in the field or in the lab. This suggests that the strong genetic architecture and selection together constrain the kind of standing genetic variation in wing patterns observed in this species group.</p>
<p>In light of our overall findings about the evolutionary history of mimetic polymorphism in the <italic>P. polytes</italic> species group and the novel female form just described, it is worth considering the roles of standing genetic variation versus new mutations, potential modification of dominance relationships in relation to Haldane’s sieve, and maintenance of genetic mimetic polymorphisms under long-term balancing selection. There was substantial discussion and speculation about these aspects from the time of the Modern Synthesis to early breeding experiments to probe the inheritance of mimicry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. With theoretical and molecular genetic advances, a much more nuanced hypothesis has developed. The consensus seemed to be that for Batesian mimicry to evolve, an initial mutation would be required that establishes partial mimetic resemblance to an aposematic model. Due to the complexity associated with wing pattern phenotypes, it is likely that additional subsequent mutations would be necessary to improve mimetic resemblance, and these were termed “modifiers”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. A modifier could add to mimetic resemblance itself, make it partially or completely dominant, and/or reduce recombination to ensure that the mutations associated with mimicry did not break down and were inherited together. Therefore, modifiers could encompass an array of mutations ranging from point mutations that alter gene function to large inversions and rearrangements that could give rise to supergene architecture. The mimicry “gene” could subsequently either go to fixation, or the mimetic and non-mimetic allelic combinations could be maintained by balancing selection in polymorphic species under negative frequency dependence. In <italic>Papilio polytes</italic>, it was assumed that mimetic polymorphism is maintained by long-term balancing selection on the underlying allelic variation at the mimicry gene <italic>dsx</italic>, as HKA tests showed high genetic diversity at this locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Our work defines the timescales of these long-term balancing selection events to be up to 9.58 my and 1 my for the mimetic forms in the <italic>P. polytes</italic> species group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="s2a" ref-type="sec">Section 1</xref> of Results and Discussion). Additionally, our analysis revealed that <italic>dsx</italic> has experienced selective sweeps in the mimetic species of the <italic>P. polytes</italic> species group but not in the basal non-mimetic <italic>P. protenor</italic>, implying that mimetic alleles experienced a rapid increase in frequency in the population. This contrast of high genetic diversity and signatures of sweep could co-occur if the mimetic allele shared among the species swept through the population under a soft sweep between 9.58 my and 4.21 mya, before the mimetic species split from each other. The selective sweeps likely caused moderate levels of genetic hitchhiking, and the alleles subsequently accumulated mutations due to lack of recombination and rapid molecular evolution at this locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, resulting in high genetic diversity at the locus with some remnants of a sweep.</p>
<p>The origin of the first mutation causing mimetic resemblance may affect the spread of this trait through the population. While this may have come from existing standing genetic variation or new mutations, the latter has largely been implicated in mimicry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. The <italic>dsx</italic> gene lies within a specific inversion that seems to be unique to the <italic>P. polytes</italic> species group as we have found no matching inversion breakpoint sequences outside of the <italic>polytes</italic> species group. Yet, <italic>dsx</italic> seems to have been repeatedly recruited in mimetic resemblance in other closely related groups as well, however, with other unique allelic combinations and independent smaller inversions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, along with our genetic analysis of allelic variations and selective sweeps, current evidence appears to support Fisher, Sheppard and Ford’s speculations that mimicry in the <italic>P. polytes</italic> species group may have evolved in large part from novel mutations at <italic>dsx</italic>, many of which apparently sweeping through the populations, rather than from standing genetic variation that was shared between <italic>polytes</italic> and <italic>memnon</italic> species groups. Under this scenario, the predictions of Haldane’s sieve would be valid and directly determined by the dominance of new mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The more challenging aspect of Haldane’s sieve is to identify whether a novel mutation contributing to mimetic resemblance is partially or completely dominant at the point of origin, or it may subsequently become dominant under selection. Under Batesian and Müllerian mimicry, evolution of dominance modifiers may allow an initial recessive mutation to become partially or completely dominant, thereby facilitating its spread through the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. It is currently unclear what may constitute a dominance modifier in the context of mimetic resemblance, for example, a regulatory element may alter the expression levels of an allele or an epistatic interaction may alter the dominance of a mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. However, in terms of evolutionary dynamics under Haldane’s sieve, the spread and the subsequent evolution of this mimicry mutation would be impacted by the point of dominance, not the origin. It is currently methodologically challenging to deduce whether dominance arose with the first mutation leading to a partial mimetic resemblance or evolved subsequently as mimicry was perfected with additional mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, and how much fitness benefit successive mutations offered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. In the future, a combination of genetic and developmental manipulations may perhaps be able to throw light on these aspects.</p>
<p>Our recent finding that <italic>P. polytes</italic> is a complex of three species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> makes it necessary to reevaluate previous genetic studies that assumed <italic>javanus</italic> and <italic>alphenor</italic> to be subspecies of <italic>P. polytes</italic>. Clarke and Sheppard’s characterisation of inheritance of the female forms was based on interspecific hybrids between the three species rather than segregating broods of the same species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The first genome-wide mapping and developmental expression studies of mimicry polymorphism were done in the Philippine <italic>P. alphenor</italic>, not in <italic>P. polytes</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Subsequent reference genome and developmental studies found inversion breakpoints and differential expression of <italic>dsx</italic> largely in the Japanese populations of <italic>P. polytes</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Previous studies determined the evolutionary history of mimetic forms in this group based on samples from different species, which has possibly led to incorrect conclusions regarding the origin of <italic>f. theseus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, conclusions regarding the developmental genetic basis of mimicry from the present and previous genetic studies on <italic>P. polytes</italic> and <italic>P. alphenor</italic> are not contradictory, showing that: (a) the developmental genetic basis of mimicry and female polymorphism is shared between both the species, and (b) <italic>dsx</italic> controls mimetic polymorphism by means of: (i) an inversion—which predates the diversification of all mimetic species in the group—that isolates mimetic from non-mimetic alleles, (ii) allelic variation and differential gene expression across males/<italic>f. cyrus</italic> and mimetic females, producing sex-limitation of the mimetic polymorphism, and (iii) tissue-specific isoform expression across developmental stages to accommodate novel adult polymorphisms that are regulated in late development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our work contains extensive sampling of the <italic>polytes</italic> species group, including dozens of specimens of all known female forms from mainland Asia, specifically South Asia where mimetic polymorphism is most striking, and several island groups that were not sampled in previous studies. This extensive sampling and our reconstruction of the evolutionary history of mimetic polymorphism in this group, the origin of each female form, the dominance relationships between alleles of <italic>dsx</italic>, and molecular evolution <italic>dsx</italic> in relation to mimetic polymorphism, provided unparalleled insights into the evolutionary and genomic history of this entire species group that substantially contrast with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. We have characterised allele-specific mutations across the <italic>dsx</italic> gene, which could be used for functional assessment and identification of key mutations that affect mimetic phenotypes. We demonstrate that the female forms in the <italic>polytes</italic> species group have evolved in a step-wise fashion through Haldane’s sieve— each successive novel mimetic form having complete dominance over pre-existing forms. Further, we find that novel wing phenotypes could arise from rearrangements in existing form-specific alleles, through exon swaps, and that different exons of the same gene could regulate colour patterns on the forewing and hindwing. Our work also sheds light on how dominance may interact with other genetic and population genetic phenomena, such as recombination and selective sweeps, to influence evolutionary trajectories of diversification of lifeforms.</p>

We extracted DNA from thoracic muscle of preserved samples using QIAGEN DNeasy blood and tissue kit, quantified the extracted DNA using Qubit fluorometric quantification, and prepared libraries using Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-free library preparation kit. We used a 2x100 PE run on Illumina HiSeq 2500 for re-sequencing genomes of our <italic>Papilio</italic> samples. We also downloaded available genome sequences from the SRA database for <italic>P. alphenor, P. javanus, P. phestus, P. ambrax</italic> and <italic>P. protenor</italic>. We checked the quality of raw reads, aligned them to the <italic>Papilio polytes</italic> reference genome (Ppol_1.0, genome version 1.0, annotation version 1.0) from NCBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, using BWA aligner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, and called SNPs using the GATK pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. We processed the alignment files to mark and remove duplicates, merge files from the same sample, performed indel realignment, called haplotypes, and combined the resulting VCF files for genotype calling. We filtered the resulting SNPs using the recommended parameters in the GATK manual. The resulting dataset contained samples that had an average coverage per sample of 9X across the genome; and 13X and 8X across the mimetic and non-mimetic <italic>doublesex</italic> scaffolds respectively. Exons of the <italic>dsx</italic> gene showed nearly complete coverage and higher depth compared to introns. Post filtering of called SNPs, we obtained a set of 27,965,662 SNPs for the <italic>polytes</italic> species group. We extracted <italic>dsx</italic> CDS from individual alignments using bcftools-1.6 mpileup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. We aligned exons manually and annotated allele-specific SNPs to generate the SNP map for <italic>dsx</italic> in Extended <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. We identified sites that were fixed in all samples of each female form to generate consensus CDS for each <italic>dsx</italic> allele. We also sequenced genomes of two intermediate female individuals from a pure-breeding line, aligned and processed them as given above, and manually annotated SNPs to find out their exonic composition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). We performed nucleotide and protein alignments in MEGA X<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> and visualised them in Jalview<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Estimation of divergence times</title>
<p>We acquired sequence data for four mitochondrial markers (cytochrome c oxidase subunit-I, tRNA leucine, cytochrome c oxidase subunit-II and 16S) and two nuclear markers (elongation factor-I alpha and wingless) from a broad range of Papilionidae species (Condamine et al 2023<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and Joshi and Kunte Biorxiv<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>) to estimate the time of origin of the mimics and models. We aligned the sequences using MAFFT v7.475<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and visually verified the accuracy of the alignments using MEGA X<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. We used PartitionFinder 2.1.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> to identify the best-fitting partitioning scheme and corresponding models of evolution. We used BEAST v2.7.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> for generating the time-calibrated phylogeny. We applied an optimized relaxed clock model and a birth-death model as molecular clock and tree priors, respectively. For time calibration, we used three primary calibration points (the crown ages of (1) Papilionidae, between 47.80 and 150 Ma, (2) Parnassiinae, between 23.03 and 150 Ma, and (3) Luehdorfiini, between 5.33 and 150 Ma) and 10 secondary calibration points (the crown ages of (1) Papilioninae, between 34.40 and 62.90 Ma, (2) Leptocircini, between 26.60 and 49.90 Ma, (3) Troidini, between 26.90 and 50.40 Ma, (4) Papilionini, between 27.50 and 50.90 Ma, (5) Old World <italic>Papilio</italic>, between 21.52 and 33.5 Ma, (6) subgenus <italic>Heraclides</italic>, between 16.07 and 27.48 Ma, (7) subgenus <italic>Araminta</italic>, between 9.89 and 18.61 Ma, (8) subgenus <italic>Papilio</italic>, between 7.01 and 13.85 Ma, (9) subgenera <italic>Achillides</italic>, <italic>Princeps</italic>, and <italic>Menelaides</italic>, between 15.57 and 24.39 Ma, and (10) subgenus <italic>Menelaides</italic>, between 10.90 and 17.65 Ma) with uniform priors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We ran six independent MCMC chains for 150 million generations and sampled every 15,000 generation. We performed the phylogenetic analyses on the CIPRES web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phylo.org/index.php/portal">http://www.phylo.org/index.php/portal</ext-link>).

We constructed the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree using TreeAnnotator after removing 25% of the samples as burnin.

<title>Estimation of signatures of selection in <italic>P. polytes, P. javanus</italic> and <italic>P. alphenor</italic></title>
<p>To identify loci showing signatures of selection in the genomic dataset, we filtered the SNP dataset (total 27 million SNPs) by species and calculated mu statistic using Raised Accuracy in Sweep Detection (RAiSD) v.2.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. We used a conservative cutoff (&gt;99.5%) of the µ statistic to identify loci experiencing selective sweeps. To minimise the possibility of false positives, we randomly resampled SNPs from a subset of samples to calculate the false positive rate threshold in RAiSD. The resulting threshold was lower than the 99.5% cutoff we had used, so it did not eliminate any resulting hits. The number of identified SNPs experiencing selective sweeps that were included within annotated genetic elements and those that were in the intergenic regions lacking annotation features are given elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The identities of annotated loci experiencing selective sweeps among the species are listed in Table S6. We mapped the genes experiencing selective sweeps in each species and common across the five mimetic species to the <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> using BLAST+ to identify their chromosomal locations. We used Circos-0.69-9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> to map these genes across chromosomes for each species, assuming synteny between <italic>P. polytes</italic> and <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> genomes.</p>

<title>Cross design and dominance hierarchy</title>
<p>We used mated wild-caught females from NCBS campus to start <italic>P. polytes</italic> greenhouse populations, which we maintained in large (2x2x2m) cages. We raised larval broods at approx. 28±4°C, on a diet of lemon (<italic>Citrus sp.</italic>) and curry plants (<italic>Murraya koenigii</italic>) and maintained the adults on Birds Choice™ butterfly nectar. We generated mapping broods (design described in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3d</xref>) by separating mating pairs from the population and letting the mated females lay eggs in individual small (0.6x0.6x1m) cages. Because of achiasmatic oogenesis, we then back-crossed the heterozygous male offspring normally with homozygous recessive females from the greenhouse populations. For GWAS, we generated a total of six segregating broods (1:1 mimetic:non-mimetic female progeny), three each segregating for <italic>polytes/cyrus</italic> and <italic>romulus/cyrus</italic> phenotypes. Among these, we sequenced the parents and 50 female offspring of each form from a <italic>romulus-cyrus</italic> segregating brood that produced 426 offspring. We used these six broods as well as similarly generated <italic>romulus-polytes</italic> segregating broods for genotyping with form-specific primers (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>) to establish the dominance hierarchy (TableS4–5). Among 290 individuals genotyped from 10 mapping broods, we observed no cross-reactivity of primers between forms, indicating that these SNPs are indeed form-specific, and that the colour forms are inherited and expressed in a sex-specific manner.</p>

We found very few reads from <italic>romulus</italic> individuals mapping to the non-mimetic <italic>cyrus</italic> allele of <italic>dsx</italic> from the reference genome. This may be due to low representation and coverage of the <italic>dsx</italic> gene with the GBS method, or due to mismatch between the highly divergent <italic>romulus</italic> and <italic>cyrus dsx</italic> sequences. We used Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons to call significant associations.

<p>In this study, Deshmukh et al. provide an elegant illustration of Haldane's sieve, the population genetics concept stating that novel advantageous alleles are more likely to fix if dominant because dominant alleles are more readily exposed to selection. To achieve this, the authors rely on a uniquely suited study system, the female-polymorphic butterfly Papilio polytes.</p>
<p>Deshmukh et al. first reconstruct the chronology of allele evolution in the P. polytes species group, clearly establishing the non-mimetic cyrus allele as ancestral, followed by the origin of the mimetic allele polytes/theseus, via a previously characterized inversion of the dsx locus, and most recently, the origin of the romulus allele in the P. polytes lineage, after its split from P. javanus. The authors then examine the two crucial predictions of Haldane's sieve, using the three alleles of P. polytes (cyrus, polytes, and romulus). First, they report with compelling evidence that these alleles are sequentially dominant, or put in other words, novel adaptive alleles either are or quickly become dominant upon their origin. Second, the authors find a robust signature of positive selection at the dsx locus, across all five species that share the polytes allele.</p>
<p>In addition to exquisitely exemplifying Haldane's sieve, this study characterizes the genetic differences (or lack thereof) between mimetic alleles at the dsx locus. Remarkably, the polytes and romulus alleles are profoundly differentiated, despite their short divergence time (&lt; 0.5 my), whereas the polytes and theseus alleles are indistinguishable across both coding and intronic sequences of dsx. Finally, the study reports incidental evidence of exon swaps between the polytes and romulus alleles. These exon swaps caused intermediate colour patterns and suggest that (rare) recombination might be a mechanism by which novel morphs evolve.</p>
<p>This study advances our understanding of the evolution of the mimicry polymorphism in Papilio butterflies. This is an important contribution to a system already at the forefront of research on the genetic and developmental basis of sex-specific phenotypic morphs, which are common in insects. More generally, the findings of this study have important implications for how we think about the molecular dynamics of adaptation. In particular, I found that finding extensive genetic divergence between the polytes and romulus alleles is striking, and it challenges the way I used to think about the evolution of this and other otherwise conserved developmental genes. I think that this study is also a great resource for teaching evolution. By linking classic population genetic theory to modern genomic methods, while using visually appealing traits (colour patterns), this study provides a simple yet compelling example to bring to a classroom.</p>
<p>In general, I think that the conclusions of the study, in terms of the evolutionary history of the locus, the dominance relationships between P. polytes alleles, and the inference of a selective sweep in spite of contemporary balancing selection, are strongly supported; the data set is impressive and the analyses are all rigorous. I nonetheless think that there are a few ways in which the current presentation of these data could lead to confusion, and should be clarified and potentially also expanded.</p>
<p>(1) The study is presented as addressing a paradox related to the evolution of phenotypic novelty in &quot;highly constrained genetic architectures&quot;. If I understand correctly, these constraints are assumed to arise because the dsx inversion acts as a barrier to recombination. I agree that recombination in the mimicry locus is reduced and that recombination can be a source of phenotypic novelty. However, I'm not convinced that the presence of a structural variant necessarily constrains the potential evolution of novel discrete phenotypes. Instead, I'm having a hard time coming up with examples of discrete phenotypic polymorphisms that do not involve structural variants. If there is a paradox here, I think it should be more clearly justified, including an explanation of what a constrained genetic architecture means. I also think that the Discussion would be the place to return to this supposed paradox, and tell us exactly how the observations of exon swaps and the genetic characterization of the different mimicry alleles help resolve it.</p>
<p>(2) While Haldane's sieve is clearly demonstrated in the P. polytes lineage (with cyrus, polytes, and romulus alleles), there is another allele trio (cyrus, polytes, and theseus) for which Haldane's sieve could also be expected. However, the chronological order in which polytes and theseus evolved remains unresolved, precluding a similar investigation of sequential dominance. Likewise, the locus that differentiates polytes from theseus is unknown, so it's not currently feasible to identify a signature of positive selection shared by P. javanus and P. alphenor at this locus. I, therefore, think that it is premature to conclude that the evolution of these mimicry polymorphisms generally follows Haldane's sieve; of two allele trios, only one currently shows the expected pattern.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Deshmukh and colleagues studied the evolution of mimetic morphs in the Papilio polytes species group. They investigate the timing of origin of haplotypes associated with different morphs, their dominance relationships, associations with different isoform expressions, and evidence for selection and recombination in the sequence data. P. polytes is a textbook example of a Batesian mimic, and this study provides important nuanced insights into its evolution, and will therefore be relevant to many evolutionary biologists. I find the results regarding dominance and the sequence of events generally convincing, but I have some concerns about the motivation and interpretation of some other analyses, particularly the tests for selection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study uses widespread sampling, large sample sizes from crossing experiments, and a wide range of data sources.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Purpose and premise of selective sweep analysis</p>
<p>A major narrative of the paper is that new mimetic alleles have arisen and spread to high frequency, and their dominance over the pre-existing alleles is consistent with Haldane's sieve. It would therefore make sense to test for selective sweep signatures within each morph (and its corresponding dsx haplotype), rather than at the species level. This would allow a test of the prediction that those morphs that arose most recently would have the strongest sweep signatures.</p>
<p>Sweep signatures erode over time - see Figure 2 of Moest et al. 2020 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000597">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000597</ext-link>), and it is unclear whether we expect the signatures of the original sweeps of these haplotypes to still be detectable at all. Moest et al show that sweep signatures are completely eroded by 1N generations after the event, and probably not detectable much sooner than that, so assuming effective population sizes of these species of a few million, at what time scale can we expect to detect sweeps? If these putative sweeps are in fact more recent than the origin of the different morphs, perhaps they would more likely be associated with the refinement of mimicry, but not necessarily providing evidence for or against a Haldane's sieve process in the origin of the morphs.</p>
<p>(2) Selective sweep methods</p>
<p>A tool called RAiSD was used to detect signatures of selective sweeps, but this manuscript does not describe what signatures this tool considers (reduced diversity, skewed frequency spectrum, increased LD, all of the above?). Given the comment above, would this tool be sensitive to incomplete sweeps that affect only one morph in a species-level dataset? It is also not clear how RAiSD could identify signatures of selective sweeps at individual SNPs (line 206). Sweeps occur over tracts of the genome and it is often difficult to associate a sweep with a single gene.</p>
<p>(3) Episodic diversification</p>
<p>Very little information is provided about the Branch-site Unrestricted Statistical Test for Episodic Diversification (BUSTED) and Mixed Effects Model of Evolution (MEME), and what hypothesis the authors were testing by applying these methods. Although it is not mentioned in the manuscript, a quick search reveals that these are methods to study codon evolution along branches of a phylogeny. Without this information, it is difficult to understand the motivation for this analysis.</p>
<p>(4) GWAS for form romulus</p>
<p>The authors argue that the lack of SNP associations within dsx for form romulus is caused by poor read mapping in the inverted region itself (line 125). If this is true, we would expect strong association in the regions immediately outside the inversion. From Figure S3, there are four discrete peaks of association, and the location of dsx and the inversion are not indicated, so it is difficult to understand the authors' interpretation in light of this figure.</p>
<p>(5) Form theseus</p>
<p>Since there appears to be only one sequence available for form theseus (actually it is said to be &quot;P. javanus f. polytes/theseus&quot;), is it reasonable to conclude that &quot;the dsx coding sequence of f. theseus was identical to that of f. polytes in both P. javanus and P. alphenor&quot; (Line 151)? Looking at the Clarke and Sheppard (1972) paper cited in the statement that &quot;f. polytes and f. theseus show equal dominance&quot; (line 153), it seems to me that their definition of theseus is quite different from that here. Without addressing this discrepancy, the results are difficult to interpret.</p>

<p>The paradox that we refer to here is essentially the contrast of evolving new adaptive traits which are genetically regulated, while maintaining the existing adaptive trait(s) at its fitness peak. While one of the mechanisms to achieve this could be differential structural rearrangement at the chromosomal level, it could arise due to alternative alleles or splice variants of a key gene (caste determination in Cardiocondyla ants), and differential regulation of expression (the spatial regulation of melanization in Nymphalid butterflies by ivory lncRNA). In each of these cases, a new mutation would have to give rise to a new phenotype without diluting the existing adaptive traits when it arises. We focused on structural variants, because that was the case in our study system, however, the point we were making referred to evolution of novel traits in general. We will add a section in the revised discussion to address this.</p>

<p>(2) While Haldane's sieve is clearly demonstrated in the P. polytes lineage (with cyrus, polytes, and romulus alleles), there is another allele trio (cyrus, polytes, and theseus) for which Haldane's sieve could also be expected. However, the chronological order in which polytes and theseus evolved remains unresolved, precluding a similar investigation of sequential dominance. Likewise, the locus that differentiates polytes from theseus is unknown, so it's not currently feasible to identify a signature of positive selection shared by P. javanus and P. alphenor at this locus. I, therefore, think that it is premature to conclude that the evolution of these mimicry polymorphisms generally follows Haldane's sieve; of two allele trios, only one currently shows the expected pattern.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the genetic basis of f. theseus requires further investigation. f. theseus occupies the same level on the dominance hierarchy of dsx alleles as f. polytes (Clarke and Sheppard, 1972) and the allelic variant of dsx present in both these female forms is identical, so there exists just one trio of alleles of dsx. Based on this evidence, we cannot comment on the origin of forms theseus and polytes. They could have arisen at the same time or sequentially. Since our paper is largely focused on the sequential evolution of dsx alleles through Haldane’s sieve, we have included f. theseus in our conclusions. We think that it fits into the framework of Haldane’s sieve due to its genetic dominance over the non-mimetic female form. However, this aspect needs to be explored further in a more specific study focusing on the characterization, origin, and developmental genetics of f. theseus in the future.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Deshmukh and colleagues studied the evolution of mimetic morphs in the Papilio polytes species group. They investigate the timing of origin of haplotypes associated with different morphs, their dominance relationships, associations with different isoform expressions, and evidence for selection and recombination in the sequence data. P. polytes is a textbook example of a Batesian mimic, and this study provides important nuanced insights into its evolution, and will therefore be relevant to many evolutionary biologists. I find the results regarding dominance and the sequence of events generally convincing, but I have some concerns about the motivation and interpretation of some other analyses, particularly the tests for selection.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study uses widespread sampling, large sample sizes from crossing experiments, and a wide range of data sources.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this point. This strength has indeed helped us illuminate the evolutionary dynamics of this classic example of balanced polymorphism.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Purpose and premise of selective sweep analysis</p>
<p>A major narrative of the paper is that new mimetic alleles have arisen and spread to high frequency, and their dominance over the pre-existing alleles is consistent with Haldane's sieve. It would therefore make sense to test for selective sweep signatures within each morph (and its corresponding dsx haplotype), rather than at the species level. This would allow a test of the prediction that those morphs that arose most recently would have the strongest sweep signatures.</p>
<p>Sweep signatures erode over time - see Figure 2 of Moest et al. 2020 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000597">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000597</ext-link>), and it is unclear whether we expect the signatures of the original sweeps of these haplotypes to still be detectable at all. Moest et al show that sweep signatures are completely eroded by 1N generations after the event, and probably not detectable much sooner than that, so assuming effective population sizes of these species of a few million, at what time scale can we expect to detect sweeps? If these putative sweeps are in fact more recent than the origin of the different morphs, perhaps they would more likely be associated with the refinement of mimicry, but not necessarily providing evidence for or against a Haldane's sieve process in the origin of the morphs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our original plan was to perform signatures of sweeps on individual morphs, but we have very small sample sizes for individual morphs in some species, which made it difficult to perform the analysis. We agree that signatures of selective sweeps cannot give us an estimate of possible timescales of the sweep. They simply indicate that there may have been a sweep in a certain genomic region. Therefore, with just the data from selective sweeps, we cannot determine whether these occurred with refining of mimicry or the mimetic phenotype itself. We have thus made no interpretations regarding time scales or causal events of the sweep. Additionally, we discuss the results we obtained for individual alleles represent what could have occurred at the point of origin of mimetic resemblance or in the course of perfecting the resemblance, although we cannot differentiate between the two at this point (lines 320 to 333).</p>

<p>(2) Selective sweep methods</p>
<p>A tool called RAiSD was used to detect signatures of selective sweeps, but this manuscript does not describe what signatures this tool considers (reduced diversity, skewed frequency spectrum, increased LD, all of the above?). Given the comment above, would this tool be sensitive to incomplete sweeps that affect only one morph in a species-level dataset? It is also not clear how RAiSD could identify signatures of selective sweeps at individual SNPs (line 206). Sweeps occur over tracts of the genome and it is often difficult to associate a sweep with a single gene.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>RAiSD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0085-8">https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0085-8</ext-link>) detects selective sweeps using the μ statistic, which is a combined score of SFS, LD, and genetic diversity along a chromosome. The tool is quite sensitive and is able to detect soft sweeps. RAiSD can use a VCF variant file comprising of SNP data as input and uses an SNP-driven sliding window approach to scan the genome for signatures of sweep. Using an SNP file instead of runs of sequences prevents repeated calculations in regions that are sparse in variants, thereby optimizing execution time. Due to the nature of the input we used, the μ statistic was also calculated per site. We then tried to annotate the SNPs based on which genes they occur in and found that all species showing mimicry had atleast one site that showed a signature of sweep contained within the dsx locus.</p>

<p>(3) Episodic diversification</p>
<p>Very little information is provided about the Branch-site Unrestricted Statistical Test for Episodic Diversification (BUSTED) and Mixed Effects Model of Evolution (MEME), and what hypothesis the authors were testing by applying these methods. Although it is not mentioned in the manuscript, a quick search reveals that these are methods to study codon evolution along branches of a phylogeny. Without this information, it is difficult to understand the motivation for this analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for bringing this to our notice, we will add a few lines in the Methods about the hypothesis we were testing and the motivation behind this analysis. We will additionally cite a previous study from our group which used these and other methods to study the molecular evolution of dsx across insect lineages.</p>

<p>(4) GWAS for form romulus</p>
<p>The authors argue that the lack of SNP associations within dsx for form romulus is caused by poor read mapping in the inverted region itself (line 125). If this is true, we would expect strong association in the regions immediately outside the inversion. From Figure S3, there are four discrete peaks of association, and the location of dsx and the inversion are not indicated, so it is difficult to understand the authors' interpretation in light of this figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We indeed observe the regions flanking dsx showing the highest association in our GWAS. This is a bit tricky to demonstrate in the figure as the genome is not assembled at the chromosome level. However, the association peaks occur on scf 908437033 at positions 2192979, 1181012 and 1352228 (Fig. S3c, Table S3) while dsx is located between 1938098 and 2045969. We will add the position of dsx in the figure legend of the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(5) Form theseus</p>
<p>Since there appears to be only one sequence available for form theseus (actually it is said to be &quot;P. javanus f. polytes/theseus&quot;), is it reasonable to conclude that &quot;the dsx coding sequence of f. theseus was identical to that of f. polytes in both P. javanus and P. alphenor&quot; (Line 151)? Looking at the Clarke and Sheppard (1972) paper cited in the statement that &quot;f. polytes and f. theseus show equal dominance&quot; (line 153), it seems to me that their definition of theseus is quite different from that here. Without addressing this discrepancy, the results are difficult to interpret.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Among P. javanus individuals sampled by us, we obtained just one individual with f. theseus and the H P allele, however, in the data we added from a previously published study (Zhang et. al. 2017), we were able to add nine more individuals of this form (Fig. S4b and S7), while we did not show these individuals in Fig 3 (which was based on PCR amplification and sequencing of individual exons od dsx), all the analysis with sequence data was performed on 10 theseus individuals in total. In Zhang et. al. the authors observed what we now know are species specific differences when comparing theseus and polytes dsx alleles and not allele-specific differences. Our observations were consistent with these findings.</p>
