<title>Abstract</title><p>Lipid metabolism plays a critical role in cancer metastasis. However, the mechanisms through which metastatic genes regulate lipid metabolism remain unclear. Here, we describe a new oncogenic-metabolic feedback loop between the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor ZEB2 and the key lipid enzyme ACSL4 (long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4), resulting in enhanced cellular lipid storage and fatty acid oxidation to drive breast cancer metastasis. Functionally, Depletion of ZEB2 or ACSL4 significantly reduced lipid droplets (LD) abundance and cell migration. ACSL4 overexpression rescued the invasive capabilities of the ZEB2 knockdown cells, suggesting that ACSL4 is crucial for ZEB2-mediated metastasis. Mechanistically, ZEB2 activated ACSL4 expression by directly binding to the ACSL4 promoter. ACSL4 binds to and stabilizes ZEB2 by reducing ZEB2 ubiquitination. Notably, ACSL4 not only promotes the intracellular lipogenesis and lipid droplet accumulation but also enhances fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and ATP production by upregulating the FAO rate-limiting enzyme CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 isoform A). Finally, we demonstrated that ACSL4 knockdown significantly reduced metastatic lung nodes in vivo. In conclusion, we reveal a novel positive regulatory loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4, which promotes LD storage to meet the energy needs of breast cancer metastasis, and identify the ZEB2-ACSL4 signaling axis as an attractive therapeutic target for overcoming breast cancer metastasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>More than 90% of breast cancer-related deaths are due to metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Current treatments, including endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, are ineffective in preventing breast cancer metastasis and remain the greatest clinical challenge for breast cancer treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Cancer metastasis is associated with a process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. EMT is a pre-metastatic state in which epithelial cells lose their tight junctions and convert to migratory mesenchymal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Metastatic invasion is a highly energy-intensive process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. It has become increasingly recognized that metabolic reprogramming during the EMT process contributes to metastasis and tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Emerging evidence suggests that lipid metabolic reprogramming plays a critical role in meeting the energy requirements of metastatic invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Elucidating the mechanism by which reprogrammed lipid metabolism helps us exploit novel and attractive targets for metastatic therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>Lipid metabolism includes a complex network of pathways that regulate fatty acid (FA) synthesis, storage, and degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. For lipid anabolism, FA are stored in a dynamic organelle called a lipid droplet, which is composed of a monolayer of phospholipids that covers a hydrophobic core containing neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesteryl esters (CE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Lipid droplets (LD) accumulation is associated with aggressiveness in many cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, including breast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and prostate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Indeed, the aggregation of FA in LD is considered a priming state to prepare for metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In the case of need, FA can be released and oxidized for energy support. For example, it has been reported that fatty acids stored in lipid droplets were a crucial resource in fueling the metastatic process in pancreatic cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Additionally, previous studies have suggested that metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) depends on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to produce high ATP levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Although lipid metabolism is crucial for cancer metastasis, the signalling pathway that regulates lipid metabolic reprogramming during breast cancer metastasis remains unclear.</p>
<p>Dysregulation of lipid metabolic enzymes has been documented in cancer metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Long-chain fatty acyl synthetase (ACSL) 4 belongs to the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase ligase enzyme family <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. ACSL4 catalyses the conversion of long-chain FAs to acyl-CoAs, a necessary step for free long-chain FAs to enter the next metabolic pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The increased expression and activity of ACSL4 have been observed in many cancer types and are well-known biomarkers of ferroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Although it has been reported that ACSL4 is a tumor suppressor that activates ferroptosis, many studies have suggested that ACSL4 is an oncogene that contributes to tumor progression. For example, ACSL4 promotes Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation and metastasis via lipogenesis and lipid droplet accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In prostate cancer, ACSL4 promotes cell growth, invasion, and hormonal resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The function of ACSL4 in breast cancer has been implicated in hormone therapy resistance involving the regulation of energy-dependent transporter expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. However, regulation of lipid metabolism by ACSL4 during breast cancer invasion remains unclear.</p>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrate a novel positive feedback loop between the EMT transcription factor ZEB2 and the essential lipid metabolic enzyme ACSL4, resulting in enhanced cellular lipid droplet accumulation and fatty acid oxidation to drive breast cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, ZEB2 activates ACSL4 expression by directly binding to the ACSL4 promoter. ACSL4 stabilizes and upregulates ZEB2 via transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In addition, we also provide evidence that overexpression of ZEB2 or ACSL4 is associated with worse prognosis in advanced breast cancer. Our findings provide insights into lipid metabolic mechanisms during the EMT process and reveal a novel oncogenic-metabolic pathway critical for breast cancer EMT and metastasis.</p>

<title>Plasmid construction and cell transfection</title>
<p>The PLKO.1-TRC-LUC lentivirus vector containing shRNA (shACSL4-1 and shACSL4-2) and the control vector were purchased from WZ Biosciences. The virus package plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G were purchased from Addgene. To produce the lentivirus, the shRNA vector and package plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells using polyethyleneimine (Polysciene). After 48 hours or 72 hours, supernatants were harvested and passed through 0.45 um filters to collect the virus and stored at −80 °C until further use. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a viral solution containing 8ug/ml polybrene (Hanbio Biotechnology). 48 hours after transfection, the virus was removed from the culture and fresh medium was added. The cells were subsequently selected using 2 mg/mL puromycin to obtain a stable cell line. MCF-7 cells were transfected with HBLV-h-ACSL4-3xflag-ZsGreen-PURO or control lentiviral plasmid. The plasmids were purchased from Hanbio Biotechnology.</p>
<p>For the siRNA assay, 5 nM negative control siRNA or ACSL4 and ZEB2 siRNA (GenePharma) were transfected into MDA-MB-231 or paclitaxel-resistant cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Six hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium and the cells were harvested after 24-48 hours for qPCR or western blot analysis. The siRNA sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Western blot analysis</title>
<p>For western blotting, cells were lysed in WIP buffer (Beyotime) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein levels were quantified by BCA assay (Beyotime), and equal amounts were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred onto a 0.22 µm PVDF membrane for probing. After blocking for 1 hour in 5% non-fat milk diluted in TBST, the membrane was incubated with various primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The following primary antibodies were used: ACSL4 (ab155282, Abcam), ZEB2 (sc-271984, Santa Cruz), E-cadherin (3195S, CST), N-cadherin (610921, BD Biosciences), vimentin (D21H3, 5741T, CST), CPT1A (ab220789, Abcam), GAPDH (10494-1-AP, Protein Tech), Myc-Tag (71D10, 2278T, CST), and HA-Tag (C29F4, 3724T, CST). Next, secondary antibodies were added and the proteins were detected using an ECL kit (Millipore). Immunoreactive signals were visualized using the GE Amersham Imager 600 chemiluminescence system.</p>

<title>Migration and invasion assay</title>
<p>A wound healing assay was performed to examine the migratory ability of the cells. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 4×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> cells per well in a complete medium at 37 °C. Until cells reached 80-90% density, a sterile plastic tip was used to create a wound line across the surface of the plates. The suspended cells were discarded. After The cells were cultured in reduced serum DMEM medium in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 °C for 48 hours. Images were obtained using a phase-contrast microscope. Each assay was performed in triplicates.</p>
<p>The cell invasion capacity was measured using Matrigel-coated Transwell chambers (8.0 μm; Corning Inc.). Briefly, cells were suspended in 200 μL serum-free medium and seeded in the upper chamber of a Transwell. The lower chamber of the Transwell was filled with medium containing 10% FBS-containing medium. The Transwell chambers were then incubated at 37 °C. After culturing for 24 hours, the Transwell holes were penetrated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes and then stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution for 15 minutes. Invading cells were imaged and counted in five random fields.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence (IF) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays</title>
<p>For the immunofluorescence assay, cells were seeded on confocal dishes, washed in PBS three times, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature. The cells were blocked with 10% goat serum (AR0009, BOSTER) for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times. The cells were then incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were rinsed thrice with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature.</p>
<p>For BODIPY 493/503 and Phalloidin staining, cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 15 minutes and washed twice with PBS. The cells were then incubated with BODIPY 493/503 (1:2500 in PBS, GLPBIO) / Phalloidin (HUAYUN) for 15 minutes at room temperature. DAPI was used to stain the nuclei. Images were acquired by confocal microscopy (Ni-E-A1, Nikon, 40x) and analyzed using NIS Elements Viewer software and ImageJ.</p>
<p>For immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay, paraffin-embedded tissue slides were dewaxed with xylene and rehydrated using a graded series of alcohols. This was followed by antigen retrieval and blocking with 5% BSA for 60Lminutes. After that, Tissue slices were incubated with primary antibodies against ACSL4, ZEB2, Vimentin or ERα at 4 °C overnight in a humidified container and then detected with the SP Rabbit&amp;Mouse HRP Kit (CWBIO). Images were acquired using a digital pathology scanning system (Aperio CS2).</p>

<title>Untargeted lipidomics and proteomics</title>
<p>Cell Lipids were extracted in a chloroform-methanol mixed solution (2:1, −20 °C). The extracted cell lysates were immersed in liquid nitrogen and frozen for 5 minutes. The extracted cell lysates were placed in a 2 ml adapter, and the above steps were repeated twice. Samples were then centrifuged to pellet the proteins (5 minutes, 12000 rpm), and the supernatant was stored for analysis in a vacuum centrifugal concentrator. The sample was dissolved in 200 μl isopropanol, filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane, and detected by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). The lipidomics data were analyzed using LipidSearch software (version 4.0). The software identified intact lipid molecules based on their molecular weight and fragmentation pattern using an internal library of predicted fragment ions per lipid class. The spectra were then aligned based on retention time and the MS1 peak areas were quantified across the sample conditions. Excel 2010 was used to calculate intensity, and the R program (version 3.2.5) was used for data manipulation and statistical analyses, including unsupervised hierarchical clustering and heatmap visualization.</p>

<title>ZEB2 and ACSL4 are over-expressed and correlated in highly invasive breast cancer cells</title>
<p>To explore the molecular mechanism of highly invasive breast cancer, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of wild-type and two drug-resistant luminal breast cancer cell lines. Significant changes in 6155 genes was found (P &lt; 0.05). Notably, EMT and stemness genes such as ZEB2, SNAIL, TWIST, TRAIL, Gli2, WNT, and AKT3, which are overexpressed in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), were significantly upregulated in drug-resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). In contrast, differentiated genes such as FOXA1, ERα, E-cadherin, and GATA3, which are highly expressed in the luminal subtype, were significantly downregulated (Supplementary Fig. S1B), suggesting that drug-resistant cells underwent EMT and became stem-like cells. We noticed that the rate-limiting enzymes of fatty acid metabolism, long-chain fatty acyl synthetase 4 (ACSL4), and EMT transcription factor ZEB2 were among the top 200 upregulated (&gt;2-fold) genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S2). To verify these findings in the clinical sample, we analyzed ZEB2 and ACSL4 expression in TCGA database and found that ACSL4 expression was positively correlated with ZEB2 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, r=0.7657, p&lt;0.001) and inversely correlated with ERα expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, r=-0.3312, p&lt;0.001). by using the TCGA database, we compared the overall-survival (OS) between ACSL4 or ZEB2 high- and low-expression breast cancer patients. We found that patients with higher ACSL4 or ZEB2 expression, especially those with simultaneous high expression had worse prognosis than those with lower expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-1F</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm this correlation, we performed western blot analysis and found that Basal-like and Taxol-resistant cell lines, which lack ERα expression, showed high expression of ZEB2 and ACSL4, whereas low or no ZEB2 and ACSL4 expression was detected in luminal subtype cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Consistently, tissue samples from 45 breast cancer patients had similar expression patterns, with ZEB2 and ACSL4 being relatively highly expressed in ER-negative patient samples (patients 6, 7, 8, and 9) (Supplementary Fig. S3A and 3B). The immunohistochemistry staining assay, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H-1J</xref>, also confirmed that the expression of ACSL4 was positively correlated with ZEB2 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>, p&lt;0.001) and inversely correlated with ERα expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>, p&lt;0.001).

<title>Overexpression of ACSL4 contributes to ZEB2-mediated breast cancer invasion</title>
<p>Because ACSL4 is overexpressed in highly invasive breast cancer cells, we hypothesized that ACSL4 is essential for driving breast cancer migration and invasion. We then established a stable ACSL4 overexpressed MCF7 cell line, which was less aggressive than the basal-like breast cancer cells. The overexpression of ACSL4 significantly enhanced the metastatic and invasive capacities of MCF7 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Conversely, ACSL4 knockdown by shRNA significantly reduced the metastatic and invasive capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells compared to that of the control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Interestingly, the Phalloidin staining showed that the ACSL4 knockdown cells had a significantly smaller length to width ratio, which indicates the reversion of EMT process, than those of the control group (p&lt;0.05)(Supplementary Fig. S4). We also observed that overexpression of ZEB2 significantly enhanced the metastatic and invasive capacities of MCF7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A and 4B). Conversely, the metastatic and invasive abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly reduced in ZEB2 knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. S5C and 5D). To investigate the downstream genes regulated by ACSL4, we performed RNA sequencing analysis and identified that the tight junction and focal adhesion pathways were among the most upregulated pathways in ACSL4 knockdown cells compared to control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). To verify the RNA-seq results, we examined the expression of adhesion-related genes by immunoblotting and found that after silencing of ACSL4 and ZEB2, the luminal epithelial marker E-cadherin was increased, whereas the mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin and N-cadherin were decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).

<title>ACSL4 and ZEB2 promote Lipid droplet production and lipogenesis</title>
<p>ACSL4 is a member of the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase family, which catalyzes the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into their active forms. However, the mechanism by which ACSL4 regulates lipid metabolism in breast cancer remains unclear. A previous study revealed that ACSL4 promotes lipid droplets (LD) accumulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, we measured the basal LD content of breast cancer cells, including MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and Taxol-resistant MCF-7 cells. The basal number and size of lipid droplets were significantly larger in MDA-MB-231 and Taxol-resistant MCF-7 cells, both of which are highly invasive breast cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Fluorescence microscopy revealed that ACSL4 co-localized with LD in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). Notably, ACSL4 knockdown reduced cytoplasmic LD abundance and LD-containing cells in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).

<p>Lipid droplets are phospholipid monolayers containing a hydrophobic core comprising triacylglycerols (TG) and cholesterol esters (CE). As ACSL4 promotes intracellular LD accumulation in breast cancer cells, we investigated the effect of ACSL4 on the lipid composition of breast cancer cells. Untargeted Lipidomic analyses revealed that ACSL4 knockdown breast cancer cells had a reduced ability to incorporate long-strain monounsaturated (18:1, 17:1, 22:1, 24:1, 26:1) and saturated FA (16:0, 18:0, 24:0, 26:0) into triacylglycerol and phospholipids (PL), indicating that ACSL4 promotes the incorporation of long-chain monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids into triacylglycerol and phospholipids in these cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Moreover, all these lipids, including triacylglycerol, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters, had decreased incorporation of several polyunsaturated FA, such as 22:6, 20:4, 22:4, and 22:5, in ACSL4 depleted cells as reported previously (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S7A)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Consistently, the total amount of different lipid species, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S7B, were significantly decreased after ACSL4 knockdown. All together, these results suggest that ACSL4 directs the long train of free fatty acids into lipid anabolism to form different lipid species in the LD or other cellular membranes.</p>

<title>Exogenous fatty acid promotes LD accumulation and fuel cell invasion</title>
<p>A previous study reported that some tumors tended to increase their intake of extracellular fatty acids to promote migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. As we observed that depletion of ACSL4 greatly reduced cytoplasmic LD abundance and invasive potential in basal-like breast cancer cells, we hypothesized that LD accumulation is an important step prior to breast cancer invasion. To verify our hypothesis, we examined whether exogenous fatty acids contributed to LD accumulation and the invasive ability of breast cancer cells. Exogenous oleic acid (OA) was added to the cell culture medium. Treatment with oleic acid dramatically enhanced LD abundance in the cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), indicating that breast cancer cells tend to store lipids in LD for energy reserves. Next, we assessed the effects of exogenous oleic acid treatment on cell migration. Transwell and Wound healing assays revealed that oleic acid-treated cells exhibited significantly enhanced invasive and metastatic capacities compared with control cells. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S8). To better determine the role of oleic acid and ACSL4 on cell migration, the oleate was added in the culture medium of ACSL4 knockdown cells.

Therefore, we cloned five segments of the ACSL4 promoter and a control segment to generate promoter-luciferase constructs, based on the location of these E-boxes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). ZEB2 overexpression significantly enhanced the luciferase activity of all five E-box-containing segments of the ACSL4 promoter, whereas no significant change was observed in the control segment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). To examine whether ZEB2 directly binds to the ACSL4 promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using four sets of primers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Primer set 1, which covered segment 1, consistently exhibited apparent ZEB2 binding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref>). However, no binding was detectable using the other three sets of primers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), indicating that ZEB2 binds to the E-Box located at nucleotides −184 to −295 of the ACSL4 promoter.</p>

<p>Since the −287 E-box exhibited apparent ZEB2 binding, we generated mutants of the −287 E-box promoter-luciferase construct. The Luciferase Reporter Assay revealed that ACSL4 promoter activity was almost entirely abolished by the mutations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>), suggesting that this promoter region is essential for ZEB2-mediated ACSL4 promoter activation. Taken together, these data suggest that ZEB2 directly binds to the ACSL4 promoter to activate its mRNA expression.</p>

<title>ACSL4 regulates ZEB2 mRNA expression and protein stabilization</title>
<p>We hypothesized that ACSL4 regulates the expression of ZEB2. We then performed quantitative PCR and immunoblotting and observed that both ZEB2 mRNA and protein levels were reduced after the depletion of ACSL4 in the two BCSC cell lines (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). A previous study has reported that ACSL4 regulates c-Myc protein stability in HCC. We reasoned that ACSL4 might in turn regulate the stability of ZEB2. Therefore, we performed a ubiquitination assay to investigate whether ACSL4 regulates ZEB2 protein stability via ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin and myc-ZEB2 expression vectors along with either an empty vector or an ACSL4 overexpression vector. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>, the expression of ACSL4 caused a significant decrease in the ubiquitination of ZEB2. Conversely, we observed a increasing ubiquitination of ZEB2 in ACSL4 silencing cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), suggesting that ACSL4 attenuated the ubiquitin proteolysis of ZEB2. Notably, co-IP assays and GST pull down assays revealed a specific interaction between ACSL4 and ZEB2 proteins, supporting the notion that ZEB2 and ACSL4 are present in a protein complex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S10). Immunofluorescence assay revealed that ACSL4 and ZEB2 were co-localized in some certain regions of the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. S11). To further confirm the role of ACSL4 in the regulation of ZEB2 proteolysis, cycloheximide was added to the cell medium to block the synthesis of new proteins. Interestingly, endogenous ZEB2 protein levels were almost completely suppressed in ACSL4 knockdown cells from 0h to 8h time points (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>). This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that ZEB2 mRNA levels were significantly suppressed by the ACSL4 knockdown. Conversely, ZEB2 protein maintained a relatively steady level at 6 hours in ACSL4 overexpressing cells compared with control cells that undergone obvious ZEB2 proteolysis at 4 hours after adding CHX, indicating an increased ZEB2 protein stability in ACSL4 overexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7J</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that ACSL4 not only stabilizes the ZEB2 protein by attenuating its ubiquitination but also upregulates ZEB2 mRNA expression. Therefore, ACSL4 regulates ZEB2 through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.</p>

<p>To further validate our in vitro findings, we examined the effect of ACSL4 on lung metastasis of breast cancer cells in an animal model.

<p>To further validate the role of LD in ACSL4 high-expression cells, we examined LD content in frozen sections of the two groups. Consistent with the in vitro results, there was an obvious reduction in LD accumulation in the ACSL4 depletion tissue compared to that in control tissue (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that ACSL4 promotes the lung metastasis of breast cancer cells in vivo.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The rewiring of metabolic pathways during EMT has only recently been recognized. In addition to glycolysis, dysregulated lipid metabolism has been shown to contribute to cancer invasion and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Many EMT-driving factors have been found to reprogram the lipid metabolic pathways by regulating metabolic enzymes. For example, TGF-β, a major driver of EMT, activates fatty acid synthase (FASN) and forms a FASN-TGFβ1-FASN positive loop in cisplatin-resistant cells, resulting in EMT induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. However, the direct regulation of lipid enzymes by EMT factors remains to be elucidated. Herein, we demonstrated that the lipid rating-enzyme ACSL4 is a direct downstream target of the EMT transcription factor ZEB2 in controlling lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, ZEB2 activates ACSL4 mRNA expression by directly binding to its promoter, which contains four ZEB2 consensus sequences. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between ZEB2 and ACSL4 expression levels in clinical breast cancer samples. ACSL4 re-expression rescues the migration ability of ZEB2-depleted cells. These observations indicated that ACSL4 is crucial for ZEB2-mediated metastasis.</p>
<p>We also demonstrated that ACSL4 directly binds to and stabilizes ZEB2 by reducing its ubiquitination. Our results are consistent with a recent report that ACSL4 stabilizes the oncoprotein c-Myc via the ubiquitin-proteasome system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We propose that as an LD enzyme, ACSL4 may participate in the protein degradation system of LD. This is likely to be a novel function of ACSL4. Interestingly, a recent study reported that lipid droplets recruit Numb through the AP2A/ACSL3 complex to promote Numb degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Thus, it is likely that lipid droplets act as a platform for protein degradation. Interestingly, our RNA-seq data revealed that some ubiquitin E3 ligases, such as FBXO4, UBE3C, NEDD4, RBX1 etc. were significantly reduced in ACSL4 knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. S12). This result indicated that ACSL4 may reduce the ubiquitin of ZEB2 via down-regulating ubiquitin E3 ligase. Additionally, we found that ACSL4 promoted ZEB transcription as the mRNA level of ZEB2 was significantly reduced after ACSL4 knockdown. A recent study reported that LD-derived lipolysis provide acetyl-CoA for the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. We observed that ACSL4 can also promote FAO, which generates acetyl-CoA for the epigenetic regulation. It is likely that ACSL4 regulates the ZEB2 mRNA level via lipid-epigenetic reprogramming mechanism, which is worth studying in the future. Therefore, ACSL4 regulates ZEB2 not only via a post-transcriptional mechanism but also via a transcriptional mechanism. Notably, the relationship between ZEB2 and ACSL4 could form a positive feedback loop: ZEB2 transcriptionally activates ACSL4, and conversely, ACSL4 stabilizes the ZEB2 protein by reducing its ubiquitination. Amplification of either gene might therefore lock this loop in an active state, resulting in the enhanced invasive and metastatic capabilities of breast cancer cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported that ACSL4 could act as a tumor suppressor or oncogene, depending on the specific cancer type and tissue environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Indeed, ACSL4 could either be located at the cytomembrane or at the lipid droplets and endoplasmic reticulum membrane, indicating the different functions of ACSL4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The cytomembrane ACSL4 is likely responsible for dictating ferroptosis sensitivity by shaping the plasma membrane lipidome, whereas ACSL4 localized to lipid droplets has other functions. We provide evidence that ACSL4, which is located in lipid droplets, is a pro-metastatic factor that promotes invasion and migration. Notably, we demonstrated that ACSL4 depletion significantly suppressed the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ACSL4 and ZEB2 were found to be preferentially expressed in basal-like breast cancer cells and clinical samples that lacked ERα expression, indicating that they are promising targets for highly invasive breast cancer. Survival analysis revealed that breast cancer patients with high expression of ACSL4 or ZEB2 is associated with worse overall survival than those patients with low expression. Notably, patients with high expression of both have the worst overall survival. Thus, ACSL4 and ZEB2 could specifically be used as prognostic markers for breast cancer, and this axes hold promise as a new metabolic therapeutic target for highly invasive breast cancer.</p>
<p>Although ACSL4 has been shown to play an essential role in metastasis in many types of cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, its mechanism of ACSL4-mediated metastasis is not fully understood. ACSL4 is a member of the long-chain fatty acetyl-CoA synthetase enzyme family that catalyzes fatty acids to their active form, acyl-CoA, which can be directed to anabolism or catabolism, depending on the cellular background. We observed that the knockdown of ACSL4 significantly reduced the number and size of LD, indicating that fatty acids were directed to anabolism to form LD by ACSL4. Indeed, it has been shown that fatty acids are stored in LD before entering fatty acid oxidation, and the formation of LD is required for fatty acids oxidation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. This is in line with our observation that exogenous fatty acids (oleic acid) significantly enhance lipid droplet accumulation and migration. Importantly, lipidomic analysis revealed that the knockdown of ACSL4 significantly decreased the incorporation of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids into different species of lipids, including triacylglycerols (TAG), phospholipids (PE, PC), and cholesteryl esters (CE). Consistently, Frozen tissue sections from a metastatic animal model confirmed that high ACSL4 expression was accompanied by apparent LD accumulation. These results suggest that ACSL4 is a crucial regulator that promotes lipid storage during breast cancer metastasis. Interestingly, knockdown of ACSL4 restored the expression of E-cadherin, an essential adhesion molecule, indicating that ACSL4 promotes tumor invasion through multiple mechanisms.</p>
<p>Reprogramming of lipid metabolism is an essential step in metastasis. Lipid droplets are highly dynamic monolayer membrane-bound organelles involved in energy utilization, signal transduction, and cancer invasion. The number and size of LD are associated with cancer aggressiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We observed that highly invasive breast cancer cells were enriched with LD. Using fluorescence microscopy, we noticed that the number of LD was significantly reduced after cell migration. Our findings are in line with a recent study showing that LD undergo lipolysis during the process of migration in pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. It is likely that fatty acids are released from lipid droplets and form acyl-CoA, which enters OXPHOS to support the energy needed for metastasis. Therefore, these data support the notion that increased LD accumulation is a priming state prior to metastasis, and that LDs are crucial resources to fuel the process of metastasis.</p>
<p>In addition, we observed that ACSL4 also participates in FA catabolism, as the long-chain fatty acid-derived OCR rate and ATP production were significantly reduced in ACSL4-depleted cells, indicating that ACSL4 is essential for FAO stimulation. Our results are in line with a recent study that reported that hexokinase 2 enhances tumorigenicity by activating the ACSL4-mediated fatty acid β-oxidation pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Notably, the expression of CPT1, a rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, was significantly reduced in the ACSL4-depleted cells. Among the three isoforms of CPT1, CPT1A is the only isoform regulated by ACSL4. We proposed that ACSL4 promotes FAO and ATP production by upregulating CPT1A, thereby providing energy support for breast cancer metastasis. Our results reveal the mechanism of previous findings that FAO is a critical energy pathway in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In addition to the finding that ACSL4 promotes FAO to fuel metastasis, we observed that lactate levels did not change after ACSL4 knockdown, suggesting that glycolysis is not involved in ACSL4-mediated energy metabolism. Therefore, we propose a model in which cell migration is a multistep process accompanied by dynamic cellular lipid metabolic changes. At the pre-metastatic stage, ACSL4 enhances LD accumulation by promoting lipogenesis. During metastasis, ACSL4 stimulates fatty acid oxidation to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we provide insights into the mechanistic links between EMT and lipid metabolism and identify the ZEB2/ACSL4 axis as a novel metastatic metabolic pathway that stimulates both lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, resulting in enhanced breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Importantly, our results demonstrate that ACSL4 is a direct downstream target of ZEB2 in controlling lipid storage and LD accumulation, which are important steps and energy pools for metastasis. Clinically, our findings identified ZEB2-ACSL4 signalling as an attractive therapeutic target for overcoming breast cancer metastasis. Elevated ACSL4 levels can be used as an effective marker for predicting cancer progression in patients with advanced breast cancer. The limitation of this study is the clinical samples is only 45. The future study should expand the clinical samples and cases to provide more clinical evidence for the crucial role of ACSL4 in breast cancer metastasis.</p>

<p>In this study, Jiamin Lin et al. investigated the potential positive feedback loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4, which regulates lipid metabolism and breast cancer metastasis. They reported a correlation between high expression of ZEB2 and ACSL4 and poor survival of breast cancer patients, and showed that depletion of ZEB2 or ACSL4 significantly reduced lipid droplets abundance and cell migration in vitro. The authors also claimed that ZEB2 activated ACSL4 expression by directly binding to its promoter, while ACSL4 in turn stabilized ZEB2 by blocking its ubiquitination.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<p>We appreciate the positive comments from the editors and reviewers. The followings are the point to point responses to the questions and comments of the Reviewers:</p>

<p>In this study, Jiamin Lin et al. investigated the potential positive feedback loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4, which regulates lipid metabolism and breast cancer metastasis. They reported a correlation between high expression of ZEB2 and ACSL4 and poor survival of breast cancer patients, and showed that depletion of ZEB2 or ACSL4 significantly reduced lipid droplets abundance and cell migration in vitro. The authors also claimed that ZEB2 activated ACSL4 expression by directly binding to its promoter, while ACSL4 in turn stabilized ZEB2 by blocking its ubiquitination. While the topic is interesting, there are several concerns with the study:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. My concern regarding the absence of appropriate thresholds or False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjustments for the RNA-seq analysis has not been addressed, leading to incorrect thresholds and erroneous identification of significant signals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the concern about the RNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq data was analyzed by the Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for controlling the false discovery rate. The procedure of RNA-seq bioinformatic analysis is as follows:
For data analysis, raw data of fastq format were firstly processed through in-house perl scripts. In this step, clean data were obtained by removing reads containing adapter, reads containing N base and low quality reads from raw data. All the downstream analyses were based on the clean data with high quality. Index of the reference genome was built using Hisat2 v2.0.5 and paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using Hisat2 v2.0.5. FeatureCounts v1.5.0-p3 was used to count the reads numbers mapped to each gene, and then FPKM of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to this gene. Differential expression analysis of two conditions/groups was performed using the DESeq2 R package (1.20.0). The resulting P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for controlling the false discovery rate. Genes with an adjusted P-value (&lt;0.05) found by DESeq2 were assigned as differentially expressed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Figure 3B and C, it appears that the knockdown efficiency of ACSL4 is inadequate in these cells, which contradicts the Western blot results presented in Figure 2F.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the concern. In figure 3B and 3C, we use the shRNA for the knockdown experiment and in Figure 2F we use siRNA for the knockdown experiment, so the efficiency of them were different.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Regarding Figure 6, the discovery of consensus binding sequences (CACCT) for ZEB2 alone is insufficient evidence to support the direct binding of ZEB2 to the ACSL4 promoter.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the concern. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which examines the direct interaction between DNA and protein, to test if ZEB2 directly binds to the ACSL4 promoter. The results showed that the primer set 1, which covered -184 to -295 of ACSL4 promoter region exhibited apparent ZEB2 binding (Fig. 6F). Moreover, the mutant sequence (AAAA) of ACSL4 promoter showed significant decreased luciferase activity (Fig. 7H). All these evidences suggest that ZEB2 directly bond to the consensus sequence of ACSL4 promoter.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. For Figure 7E, there are multiple bands present, and it appears that ZEB2-HA has been cropped, which should ideally be presented with unaltered raw data. Please provide the uncropped raw data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the concern. The raw data of the figure 7E ZEB2-HA is shown in Author response image 1:</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Figure 7C, the author claimed to have used 293T cells for the ubiquitin assay, which are not breast cancer cells. Moreover, the efficiency of over-expression differs between ZEB2 and ACSL4 in 293T cell lines. Performing the experiment in an unrelated cell line to justify an important interaction is not acceptable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the concern. We also performed the ubiquitination assay in MDA-MB-231 cells in Fig 7D (Author response image 2), The results confirm that knockdown of ACSL4 obviously enhanced the ubiqutination of ZEB2. We also have performed the IP experiment in MDA-MB-231 cells in Author response image 3 (Fig 7F). The results confirmed the interaction between ZEB2 and ACSL4:</p>

<p>We appreciate the positive comments from the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I still have some points that should be addressed by the Authors:</p>
<p>The interaction between ACSL4 and ZEB2 is still not convincing, due to the cellular localization of ACSL4 and ZEB2 is different. The authors should consider utilizing the Duolink experiment to more accurately determine the interaction location of these two proteins in cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. We performed GST pull-down assay to examine whether ZEB2 and ACSL4 form a complex. GST pull-down assay confirmed the interaction of ZEB2 and ACSL4 (Supplementary Fig. S10). We also performed immunofluorescence assay and found that ZEB2 was co-localized with ACSL4 in some certain regions of the cytoplasm in Author response image 5 (Supplementary Fig. S11):</p>

<p>In Figure S4, the authors showed both &quot;shACSL4&quot; and &quot;siACSL4&quot;, which is a description error.</p>

<p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer to point out the mistake. We have corrected the &quot;siACSL4&quot; into &quot;shACSL4&quot;.</p>
