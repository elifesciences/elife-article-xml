<title>Summary</title><p>Homeostatic plasticity preserves neuronal activity against perturbations. Recently, somatic action potential broadening was proposed as a key homeostatic adaptation to chronic inactivity in neocortical neurons. Since action potential shape critically controls calcium entry and neuronal function, broadening provides an attractive homeostatic feedback mechanism to regulate activity. Here, we report that chronic inactivity induced by sodium channel block does not broaden action potentials in neocortical neurons under a wide range of conditions. In contrast, action potentials were broadened in CA3 neurons of organotypic hippocampal cultures by chronic sodium channel block and in hippocampal dissociated cultures by chronic synaptic block. Mechanistically, BK-type potassium channels were proposed to underly inactivity-induced action potential broadening. However, BK channels did not affect action potential duration in our recordings. Our results indicate that action potential broadening can occur in specific neurons and conditions but is not a general mechanism of homeostatic plasticity in cultured neurons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Action potentials (APs) control various functions including neurotransmitter release from axonal boutons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, calcium signals in the soma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, and synaptic plasticity in dendrites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. AP broadening during short-term plasticity on the time scale of milliseconds to seconds is well-established and occurs in many types of neuronal cell bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and nerve terminals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. There are also indications that APs change during long-term plasticity on the time scale of minutes to hours. When examining Hebbian long-term plasticity (i.e., positive feedback-based and input-specific long-term plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>), some studies reported AP broadening. For example, presynaptic APs of hippocampal mossy fiber boutons broaden during depolarization-induced potentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and somatic APs of neurons in the amygdala broaden during fear conditioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In contrast, the role of the AP duration is less clear for non-Hebbian homeostatic long-term plasticity (i.e., negative feedback-based and non-input specific long-term plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>). Specifically, homeostatic plasticity induced by neuronal inactivity in the presence of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) has been studied for decades, but AP broadening was initially not described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. A recent study however reports prominent AP broadening during TTX-induced homeostatic plasticity at the soma of cultured neocortical neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, which was not observed at presynaptic boutons of cultured neocortical neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Compartmentalized AP broadening at the neuronal cell body would provide a strikingly simple and previously overlooked mechanism by which neuronal inactivity could increase subsequent excitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This mechanism involves decreased calcium entry during TTX application causing changes in gene expression that would result in broadened APs and more calcium entry after TTX removal. In this model, AP broadening is a key link in the homeostatic feedback loop underlying homeostatic plasticity. In a collaborative effort across several laboratories, we therefore systematically investigated AP broadening in cultured neurons during homeostatic plasticity under various experimental conditions.</p>

<title>Cell type- and model-specific AP broadening in hippocampal neurons</title>
<p>APs in CA3 neurons of hippocampal organotypic slice cultures broaden homeostatically upon chronic inactivity using both, synaptic block by glutamate receptor antagonists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> or sodium channel block by TTX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> (see also ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> for a similar trend). We first aimed to confirm homeostatic AP broadening in CA3 neurons in organotypic slice cultures. APs were elicited by depolarizing currents from the resting membrane potential during perfusion with TTX-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid. APs recorded in CA3 pyramidal neurons treated with TTX (48 hours) had longer durations than those in control cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref>; median [IQR]: 1.75 [1.69–1.86] ms and 2.13 [2.07–2.22] ms for control and TTX-treatment, respectively, 14 cells each, P &lt; 0.001), confirming earlier reports of homeostatic AP broadening in these neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we tested whether homeostatic AP broadening occurred in dissociated hippocampal cultured neurons, a model widely used to study homeostatic plasticity. We inhibited neuronal activity for 48 hours to induce homeostatic plasticity by either blocking AP firing using TTX (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) or by blocking synaptic transmission using the low-affinity glutamate receptor blocker kynurenic acid (Kyn) or the high-affinity glutamate receptor blocker 2,3-Dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo [f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX). Surprisingly, AP duration was unaffected by TTX-treatment in primary hippocampal cultured neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>; median [IQR]: 2.07 [1.79–2.34] ms and 2.08 [1.32–2.61] ms for control and TTX, 25 and 24 cells, respectively, P = 0.96). In contrast, Kyn-treatment significantly increased AP duration in the same set of interleaved experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>; 2.52 [2.31–2.72] ms, 22 cells, P = 0.014) and NBQX-treatment led to a small trend towards broader APs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>; P = 0.26). Importantly, sodium channel block and synaptic block both increased spontaneous AP firing frequency, indicating that homeostatic adaptations other than AP broadening were shared between both induction methods (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E, F</xref>; P = 0.008 for control against Kyn, P = 0.005 for control against NBQX, P = 0.013 for control against TTX). These data indicate that AP broadening occurred upon sodium channel block in CA3 neurons in organotypic slice cultures and upon synaptic block in dissociated hippocampal cultures, but not in the commonly-studied model of homeostatic plasticity using dissociated hippocampal cultured neurons and 48 hours of TTX application.</p>

<title>Stable AP duration in primary dissociated neurons during TTX-induced homeostatic plasticity</title>
<p>In contrast to our finding in dissociated cultured neurons of the hippocampus, a recent study described TTX-induced AP broadening in dissociated cultured neurons of the neocortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. To resolve this discrepancy, we set out to replicate AP broadening in neocortical cultured neurons. Given that exact reproduction of experimental conditions is challenging and neuronal plasticity depends on brain region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, animal species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and animal strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, we probed homeostatic AP broadening under different experimental conditions varying: 1) experimental animal species (rat and mouse), 2) strain (C57BL/6 and CD1 mice), 3) sub-strain (C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J mice), 4) brain area (cortex and hippocampus), 5) cortical subdomain (prefrontal cortex), 6) culture duration (10–14, 15–21, and 32 days <italic>in vitro</italic>), 7) culture growth medium, 8) recording solutions, and 9) laboratory and experimenter performing recordings (conditions I–X in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, condition XI are recordings from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; see also <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – figure supplement 1</xref>). Even though AP durations varied up to 2-fold between conditions, homeostatic AP broadening was not detectable in any of the tested conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). To detect cross-conditional AP broadening by TTX, we merged all conditions based on their difference in AP duration after TTX-treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). However, AP duration was the same in control and TTX-treated cells (217 and 197 cells, respectively, P = 0.83).</p>

</fig>
<p>We next tested whether AP broadening was concealed by systematic differences in neuronal health or recording quality between control and treatment group. We first analyzed AP amplitude as a measure of neuronal viability. AP amplitudes were not affected following TTX treatment in any of the eleven recording conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) or a cross-conditional comparison (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Next, neurons grown using a culture protocol or cortical subdomain previously associated with AP broadening were further analyzed to avoid the inclusion of inhibitory or depolarized neurons (ref. 13; conditions I, VII, and VIII). Inclusion criteria were the occurrence of multiple APs upon 200 ms-current injections (≥ 2 APs), a resting membrane potential below – 55 mV, and a maximum AP depolarization rate between 100 and 337 V/s (includes 96% of excitatory and exclude &gt;80% of the inhibitory neurons; ref. 21). Applying any or all three of these criteria did not reveal AP broadening upon TTX treatment (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – figure supplement 2</xref>). These data indicate that stricter exclusion criteria result in smaller variability in action potential duration but do not uncover AP broadening in these datasets.</p>
<p>Instead of depolarization-evoked APs, Li <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> recorded hyperpolarization-evoked ‘rebound APs’ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), possibly reducing the impact of different resting membrane potentials and depolarizing current injection on the AP waveform. We determined that the duration of rebound APs was similarly unaffected by TTX treatment across several conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G, H</xref>). These data show that TTX-induced AP broadening does not robustly occur in dissociated cultured neurons.</p>

<title>Homeostatic plasticity increases network activity and excitatory synaptic transmission</title>
<p>To verify successful induction of homeostatic plasticity under our experimental conditions, we quantified changes in neuronal activity and synaptic strength following TTX-induced homeostatic plasticity.

<title>Lack of BK channel-dependent AP broadening in dissociated cultured neurons</title>
<p>Various potassium channel subtypes regulate AP repolarization and could therefore underlie AP broadening. Li <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> reported that downregulation of BK-type potassium channels led to homeostatic AP broadening in neocortical cultured neurons. We tested the role of BK channels in AP repolarization (neurons grown under condition I). However, blocking BK channels with Iberiotoxin (IbTx, 300 nM) did not lead to broadening of depolarization-evoked APs in control and TTX-treated cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>; P = 0.10 and 0.48, respectively), or a merge of both conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>; P = 0.10). Rebound APs were similarly unaffected by BK channel block (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 – figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we tested whether recurrent neuronal activity, which increases cytosolic calcium and boosts BK-channel activity, enhanced AP broadening following TTX treatment.

<p>In electrical recordings, intracellular recording solution may have disturbed cytosolic calcium dynamics and therefore BK- and thus calcium-dependent AP repolarization. As an independent approach, we recorded the AP duration in hippocampal cultured neurons using the genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) Ace-mNeon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> before and after acute IbTx perfusion (100 nM). BK channel block did not affect AP duration in the soma or along the axon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Using the GEVI, we again tested the role of BK channels in AP broadening during a train of APs (5 APs at 20 Hz, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). The broadening of somatic, proximal axonal, and distal axonal APs during trains was similar before and after BK channel block, indicating that AP duration was not modulated by BK channels. To confirm that IbTx was indeed pharmacologically active in Ace-mNeon recordings, we preconditioned cells with 4-AP (30 µM) prior to IbTx perfusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Neurons preconditioned with 4-AP had broader somatic APs which were further broadened by IbTx, presumably due to increased calcium influx following 4-AP treatment, in turn activating more BK channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. These data indicate that IbTx application was pharmacologically active but BK channels did not contribute to AP repolarization in cultured neocortical neurons.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Homeostatic AP broadening has been reported in some systems, but it has not been tested systematically across experimental models so far. We found that AP broadening did not occur following the induction of homeostatic plasticity with TTX in the most commonly studied model system (primary dissociated neocortical neurons). However, AP broadening was observed in cultured hippocampal slices. Furthermore, blocking BK channels, which were reported to mediate AP broadening during homeostatic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, did not impact AP duration in dissociated cultured neurons. Our results therefore indicate that AP broadening in cultured dissociated neurons is not a required component of homeostatic plasticity.</p>

<title>TTX-induced homeostatic AP regulation in organotypic hippocampal cultured neurons</title>
<p>AP broadening was previously shown to occur in CA3 neurons of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures following TTX-induced homeostatic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Consistently, we recorded broader APs in CA3 neurons following neuronal inactivity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In contrast to CA3 neurons, granule cells of the dentate gyrus did not show TTX-induced AP broadening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Similarly, CA1 neurons did not show AP broadening following synaptic block-induced homeostatic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, homeostatic AP broadening is cell type-specific.</p>

<title>TTX-induced homeostatic AP regulation in primary dissociated cultured neurons</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, only three studies so far reported on the duration of APs following TTX-induced homeostatic plasticity in dissociated cultured neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. While Li <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> observed TTX-induced broadening, the studies by Lee, Chung, and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> reported stable AP duration, consistent with our findings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Furthermore, in other studies investigating TTX-induced homeostatic plasticity in dissociated cultured neurons, prominent AP broadening as observed by Li <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> was either missed or absent, as in our recordings (see for example refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>). One possible explanation for this inconsistency could be the cell type-specificity of AP broadening. We focused on large, presumably excitatory neurons. However, we and others could have selected different neuron types compared to Li <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In an attempt to reduce bias, we incorporated multi-lab, randomization, and blinding strategies across many of our experiments. Only recordings with leaky seal formation or inadequate capacitance compensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> were excluded. AP amplitudes were unaffected by TTX treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). We then applied additional exclusion criteria to ensure that variability in neuronal type, health or recording quality were not causing a type II statistical error. Again, AP amplitudes were unaffected by TTX treatment after excluding recordings with low resting membrane potential, with peak AP rates of depolarization outside the range for excitatory neurons, or those that did not fire repetitively (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – figure supplement 2</xref>). Even when these three criteria were applied together TTX failed to broaden AP duration, confirming that AP broadening was not associated with homeostatic plasticity in neocortical neurons following TTX treatment.</p>

<title>Synaptic block-induced homeostatic AP regulation in primary dissociated cultured neurons</title>
<p>Homeostatic AP broadening was shown in CA3 neurons upon activity block by the low-affinity glutamate receptor blocker Kyn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We similarly observed Kyn-induced AP broadening in dissociated cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>).

<title>Absence of BK channel-dependent AP broadening in dissociated cultured neurons</title>
<p>Li <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> proposed that BK channels hasten AP repolarization and that this effect is lost during TTX-induced homeostatic plasticity, leading to AP broadening. We did not detect AP broadening when blocking BK channels in either control or TTX-treated cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Furthermore, APs did not broaden differentially during repetitive firing in control and TTX-treated neurons, suggesting no activity-dependent effect of TTX or BK channels on AP duration. Voltage imaging using Ace-mNeon similarly showed that width of single APs and broadening during AP trains in the soma and axon were unaffected by BK channel block. Blocking BK channels only affected AP repolarization when cells were preconditioned with 4-AP. These results are consistent with previous reports showing that in some neurons BK channels do not contribute to repolarization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> while doing so in others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Differences in the abundance of other types of potassium channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and intracellular calcium buffering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> are known to affect the contribution of BK channels to AP repolarization and may account for the lack of AP broadening upon BK channel block in our dissociated cultured neurons. The lack of BK channel contribution to AP repolarization in our dissociated neurons is another possible explanation (in addition to different selection of cells) for why we and others have not observed the homeostatic AP broadening described by Li <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>

Besides somatic APs, APs in excitatory presynaptic terminals of the somatosensory thalamus were also unaffected by whisker deprivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>.

<title>Hyperactivity-induced homeostatic AP regulation</title>
<p>Homeostatic plasticity occurs not only upon activity block but also upon hyperactivity, generally involving opposite adaptations.

<sec id="s4e1">
<title>Condition IX and X (Heine Lab, Mainz, Germany)</title>
<p>In short, mice pups were decapitated and brains were removed. Hippocampi were dissected in ice-cold Hank’s balanced saline solution and digested by trypsin for 15 minutes at 37 °C. Next, the tissue was washed with cold HBSS and mechanically dissociated using Pasteur pipettes in DNAse-, glutamate- and FBS-supplemented DMEM growth medium. 100 µL of cell suspension containing approximately 70.000 cells was placed on a glass coverslip and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1 hour. Coverslips were then transferred to 12-well plates with glutamate-, B27- and sodium pyruvate-supplemented Neurobasal A medium (1 mL per well) and cultivated until use. Double distilled water was added in between the wells of the 12-well plate to prevent evaporation of the medium during cultivation.</p>

<title>Recordings from dissociated cultures</title>
<p>Within conditions, recordings were performed blinded (except conditions IV and VI) and interleaved from randomized sister coverslips of the same culture, at the same recording setup, and by the same experimenter.</p>
<sec id="s4f1">
<title>Conditions I – IV, VII and XI (Hallermann Lab, Leipzig, Germany)</title>
<p>Voltage- and current-clamp recordings were performed with borosilicate pipettes using a HEKA EPC10/2 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Borosilicate glass tubes (Science Products, Hofheim, Germany) were pulled by a DMZ Universal Electrode Puller with filament heating (Zeitz Instruments, Martinsried, Germany) to 3–6.5 MΩ pipette resistance. Pipettes were filled with internal solution (see <italic>Solutions and reagents</italic> section) and mounted on a micromanipulator (Kleindiek Nanotechnik, Reutlingen, Germany) using a custom-built pipette holder. Recordings were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). All current-clamp recordings were filtered with the internal 10 kHz 8-pole Bessel filter of the HEKA EPC10/2 amplifier and subsequently digitized (200 kHz) with the HEKA EPC10/2 using Patchmaster software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Built-in compensation was used for voltage offset and pipette capacitance. Membrane potentials were not corrected for liquid junction potential and bridge compensation was adjusted to minimize the current injection artifact. APs were evoked by brief 1 ms depolarizing current injections of 500–1500 pA or 500 ms hyperpolarizing pulses (300–1000 pA) leading to APs upon return to resting membrane potential (‘rebound APs’). Both, depolarization-evoked and rebound APs were first recorded at resting membrane potential without holding current. While depolarization readily evoked APs in all conditions, rebound AP did not occur in all conditions at their resting membrane potential. In these cells, holding currents were used to depolarize cells until rebound APs were observed upon long hyperpolarizing pulses. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents were recorded in voltage-clamp mode at -70 mV membrane potential in neurons grown in conditions I and II. Currents were filtered with the internal 3 kHz 8-pole Bessel filter of the HEKA EPC10/2 amplifier, digitized (200 kHz) and detected using the template matching algorithm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> implemented in NeuroMatic (Version 2.00, 15.09.2008; ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>).</p>

<title>Conditions V, VI and VIII (Smith Lab, Portland, OR, USA)</title>
<p>Current-clamp recordings were performed with borosilicate pipettes using a HEKA EPC10 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Patch pipettes (5–10 MΩ resistance) were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass tubes (Warner Instruments, Holliston, MA, USA) using a P-87 electrode puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA). Pipettes were filled with an internal solution (see <italic>Solutions and reagents</italic> section) and mounted on a micromanipulator (ROE-200, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA). Recordings were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Voltage signals were filtered at 2.9 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz. Membrane potentials were corrected for liquid junction potential and bridge balance was performed manually prior to data acquisition. All APs were evoked by a sequence of transient injections relative to the resting membrane potential and measurements taken from the APs elicited with the minimal stimulus using either depolarizing current injections (500–1000 pA in 100 pA increments for 1–3 ms in 0.5 ms increments in conditions V and VI or 20–140 pA in 20 pA increments for 0.5 s in condition VIII) or following rebound from longer hyperpolarizing pulses (300–1200 pA in 100 pA increments for 500 ms).</p>

<sec id="s4f3">
<title>Conditions IX &amp; X (Heine Lab, Mainz, Germany)</title>
<p>Voltage- and current-clamp recordings were performed with borosilicate pipettes using a HEKA EPC9 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Filamented glass tubes (Science Products, Hofheim, Germany) were pulled by a Narishige PC-100 electrode puller. Resistance of the pipettes was 2–6 MΩ. Pipettes were filled with internal solution (see <italic>Solutions and reagents</italic> section) and mounted on a micromanipulator (Luigs &amp; Neumann, Ratingen, Germany). Recordings were performed at room temperature (21–24 °C). Signals were filtered at 2.9 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz using Patchmaster software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Built-in compensation was used for voltage offset and pipette capacitance. Membrane potentials were not corrected for liquid junction potential. APs were evoked by brief 1 ms depolarizing current injection of 50–300 pA or 500 ms hyperpolarizing pulses (300–400 pA) leading to APs upon return to resting membrane potential (‘rebound APs’).</p>

<title>Preparation of organotypic hippocampal cultures</title>
<p>Cultures were prepared as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. In brief, young Wistar rats (P5– P7) were anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by decapitation, the brain was removed, and each hippocampus was dissected. Hippocampal slices (350 μm) were obtained using a Vibratome (Leica, VT1200S, Wetzlar, Germany). They were placed on 20 mm latex membranes (Millicell; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) inserted into 35 mm Petri dishes containing 1 mL of culture medium and maintained for up to 8 days in an incubator at 34 °C, 95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The culture medium contained 25 mL MEM, 12.5 mL HBSS, 12.5 mL horse serum, 0.5 mL penicillin/streptomycin, 0.8 mL glucose (1 M), 0.1 mL ascorbic acid (1 mg/mL), 0.4 mL HEPES (1 M), 0.5 mL B27, and 8.95 mL sterile H<sub>2</sub>O. To limit glial proliferation, 5 μM ARA-C was added to the culture medium starting at DIV 4.</p>

<title>AP recordings from organotypic hippocampal cultures</title>
<p>Whole-cell recordings were obtained from CA3 neurons in organotypic cultures at DIV 7 to DIV 10. All recordings were made at 34 °C in a temperature-controlled recording chamber (Luigs &amp; Neumann, Ratingen, Germany) using 7–10 MΩ patch pipettes. CA3 pyramidal neurons were recorded in current-clamp with a Multiclamp 700B Amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). APs were elicited by delivering DC step pulses (duration 1.0 s) at an interstimulus interval of 10–15 s. During the whole recording, ionotropic glutamate and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors were blocked with 2–4 mM kynurenic acid and 100 μM picrotoxin, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i">
<title>Analysis of APs</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using IGOR PRO software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA; Version 6.32A or 6.37), the Patcher’s Power Tool (Version 2.19 Carbon, 15.03.2011) and NeuroMatic (Version 2.00, 15.09.2008; ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>) extensions, as well as self-written IGOR PRO scripts. AP durations were quantified as the duration at half-maximal AP amplitude, amplitude being the difference between AP peak and the membrane potential preceding stimulation. When AP durations were recorded at half-maximal amplitude between AP threshold (defined as the membrane potential at which the voltage rate of change first reaches 10 V/s) and AP peak, AP durations were still unaffected by TTX treatment (data not shown). To exclude the effect of mis-balanced bridge compensation on AP shape, only APs that occurred after the end of the second current injection artifact (elicited by the end of current-injection) were analyzed. In some recordings, current injection artifacts were blanked over 50 µs at the beginning and the end of the current injection and only experiments in which blanking did not affect AP amplitude and duration were subsequently analyzed.</p>

<title>Hippocampal dissociated cultures and transfection for GEVI imaging</title>
<p>Culture preparation and GEVI transfection were performed as previously described by Sabater <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In short, hippocampi were dissected from embryonic day 17.5 Wistar rat pups of either sex, treated with trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) at 0.5 mg/mL, and mechanically dissociated using fire polished Pasteur pipettes. Neurons were plated on 18 mm glass coverslips pre-treated with 100 µg/mL poly-L-lysine and coated with 10 µg/mL laminin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cultures were maintained in Neurobasal medium with B27 (1x) and GlutaMAX (1x, all obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), supplemented with FBS (2%, Biosera, Nuaille, France) and Penicillin/Streptomycin (1%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For transfections with Ace2N-mNeon-4AA (Ace-mNeon, ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>; distributed by Biolife Solutions Inc., Bothell, WA, USA), the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) was used. The medium was changed at DIV 3 to culture medium without antibiotic or FBS, and transfections with Effectene were performed at DIV 7 following the manufacturer’s protocol. After transfection neurons were maintained in serum-free media without antibiotics. For all experiments 30% of the medium was changed weekly and neurons were imaged 7– 14 days after transfection (14–21 DIV).</p>

<title>GEVI Imaging conditions</title>
<p>GEVI imaging was performed as previously described by Sabater <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In short, neurons were imaged using an inverted Olympus IX71 epifluorescence microscope with a 60x 1.42 NA oil-immersion objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Coverslips were mounted in a heated chamber (Warner instruments, Holliston, MA, USA; total volume ∼500 µL) and placed on an IMTP microscope stage (Scientifica, Uckfield, United Kingdom). Cells were maintained in external HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBS: 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.45 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM Glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, Osmolarity 290 mOsm) and experiments were carried out at near physiological temperatures of 32–35 °C.</p>
<p>In Ace-mNeon imaging experiments, ∼505 nm excitation illumination was provided using a 525 nm LED (Solis LED, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA), a 500/20 nm excitation filter, and a 510 nm long-pass dichroic mirror. Ace-mNeon emission transmitted through the dichroic was filtered using a 520 nm long-pass filters (Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT, USA). A power density of 10 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> was obtained at the specimen plane. Images were acquired at 3.2 kHz with an ORCA-Flash4.0 V2 C11440-22CU scientific CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) cooled to ∼ - 20 °C with the Exos2 water cooling system (Koolance, Auburn, WA, USA). Images were acquired with HCImage software (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu, Japan), binned to 4 × 4 and cropped to a 16 × 512-pixel region of interest, necessary to achieve the high image acquisition rates. Images were saved in CXD format.</p>
<p>Stimulation of APs was achieved with an extracellular tungsten parallel bipolar electrode (FHC, Bowdoin, ME, USA) mounted on a PatchStar motorized micro-manipulator (Scientifica, Uckfield, United Kingdom). To reliably induce an AP, we delivered a 1 ms 10 mV pulse at the soma. The timing of the LED illumination, the acquisition and stimulation were triggered externally through Clampex software (pClamp 10, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA).</p>
<p>All GEVI Imaging recordings were performed in presence of NBQX (10 µM), Gabazine (10 µM) and D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV, 25 µM; all from Bio-Techne, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany) in order to block synaptic transmission and ensure that the observed events were due to the stimulation only. IbTx was delivered using a custom gravity-fed perfusion system and bath volume was maintained by a peristaltic pump (Watson-Marlow 120s; Watson-Marlow, Rommerskirchen, Germany).</p>

<title>Image analysis</title>
<p>Image analysis was performed as previously described by Sabater <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In short, voltage imaging recordings were analyzed in ImageJ and custom scripts within MATLAB software as follows. Prior to analysis, if drift had occurred in the x and y axis during the recording, the images were aligned using the TurboReg ImageJ plugin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Images were then imported into MATLAB and fluorescence intensity profiles were obtained from regions of interest (ROIs) manually drawn around neuronal structures identified visually on a maximum projection image of the time series by averaging across the ROI pixels in each frame. The fluorescence profile was separated into single trials and corrected for background camera noise by subtracting the average intensity value of the timepoints where no illumination light was applied. Then, recordings were reconstructed at a sampling rate of 100 kHz using cubic spline interpolation. Bleaching was estimated by fitting a single exponential function to each individual trace smoothed using an averaging filter with a window of 3 and interpolated. The resulting curve was used to correct an unfiltered interpolated version of the recording. An accurate representation of the AP waveform with an enhanced SNR was obtained by averaging over the repeats and extracting the AP parameters from the resulting trace. The fluorescence profile during the 20 ms preceding a response was used as baseline.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that action potential (AP) broadening is not a universal feature of homeostatic plasticity in response to chronic activity deprivation. By leveraging state-of-the-art methods across multiple brain regions and laboratories, the authors demonstrate that AP half-width remains largely stable, challenging previous assumptions in the field.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ritzau-Jost et al. investigate the potential contribution of AP broadening in homeostatic upregulation of neuronal network activity with a specific focus on dissociated neuronal cultures. In cultures obtained from a few brain regions from mice or rats using different culture conditions and examined by different laboratories, AP half-width remained stable despite chronic activity block with TTX. The finding suggests that AP width is not significantly modulated by changes in sodium channel activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The collaborative nature of the study amongst the neuronal culture experts and the rigorous electrophysiological assessments provides for a compelling support of the main conclusion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given the negative nature of the results, a couple of remaining issues (such as the cell density of cultures and the presentation of imaging experiments with a voltage sensor) warrant further consideration. In addition, a discussion of the reasons for the seeming stability of AP half-width to sodium channel modulation might help extend the scope of the study beyond the presentation of a negative conclusion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study reexamined the idea that action potential broadening serves as a homeostatic mechanism to compensate for changes in network activity. The key finding was that, while action potential broadening does occur in certain neurons - such as CA3 pyramidal cells-it is far from a universal response. This is important because it helps resolve longstanding discrepancies in the field, thereby contributing to a better understanding of network dynamics. The replication of these findings across multiple laboratories further strengthened the study's rigor.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Mechanisms of network homeostasis are essential to understand network dynamics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No weaknesses were noted by this reviewer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript &quot;Unreliable homeostatic action potential broadening in cultured dissociated neurons&quot; by Ritzau-Jost et al. investigates action potential (AP) broadening as a mechanism underlying homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Given the existing variability in the literature concerning AP broadening, the authors address an important and timely research question of considerable interest to the field.</p>
<p>The study systematically demonstrates cell-type- and model-specific AP broadening in hippocampal neurons after chronic treatment with either tetrodotoxin (TTX) or glutamatergic transmission blockers. The findings indicate AP broadening in CA3 pyramidal neurons in organotypic cultures after TTX treatment, but notably not in dissociated hippocampal neurons under identical conditions. However, blocking glutamatergic neurotransmission caused AP broadening in dissociated hippocampal neurons. Moreover, extensive evaluations in neocortical dissociated cultures robustly challenge previous findings by revealing a lack of AP broadening following TTX treatment. Additionally, the proposed role of BK-type potassium channels in mediating AP broadening is convincingly questioned through complementary electrophysiological and voltage-imaging experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript exhibits an outstanding experimental design, employing state-of-the-art techniques and a rigorous multi-lab validation approach that greatly enhances scientific reliability. The experimental results are meticulously illustrated, and the conclusions drawn are justified and supported by the presented data. Furthermore, the manuscript is comprehensively and clearly written.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Concerning the statistical analyses employed, it is advisable to consider the Kruskal-Wallis test with corrections for multiple comparisons when evaluating more than two experimental groups.</p>
