<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are a frequent cause of progressive dementia. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is diagnosed in ∼90% of cases, with an estimated prevalence of ∼10% in the population over 65 years of age <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The role of germline genetic variation in neurodegenerative diseases and AD has been studied intensely. Although autosomal dominant forms of AD due to rare germline variants with high penetrance account only for an estimated ∼1% of cases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, a number of common variants were also shown to contribute to disease risk. Carriers of one germline copy of the epsilon4 (E4) allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4), present in ∼15 to 20% of population, have a three-fold higher risk of AD, while two copies (∼2 to 3 % of population) increase the risk by ∼10-fold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified an additional ∼50 common germline variants that more moderately increase the risk of AD, including TREM2, CD33, and MS4A6A variants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the APOE4 allele is responsible for an increased inflammatory and neurotoxic response of microglia and astrocytes in the brain of carriers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and it was noted that the majority of the other germline AD-risk variants are located within or near genes expressed in microglia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and in particular at microglia-specific enhancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. These data, together with transcriptional studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> support the hypothesis that genetic variation in microglia may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration and AD.</p>
<p>Somatic genetic heterogeneity (mosaicism), resulting from post-zygotic DNA mutations, is widespread in human tissues, and a cause of tumoral, developmental, and immune diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Aditionally, a role of somatic variants in neuropsychiatric disorders is also suspected <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Mosaicism has been documented in the brain tissue of AD patients in several deep-sequencing studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, showing that the enrichment of putative pathogenic somatic mutations in the PI3K-AKT, MAPK, and AMPK pathway do occur in the brain of patients in comparison to controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However these studies performed in whole brain tissue lacked cellular resolution and mechanistic insights, and the role of somatic mutants in neurodegenerative diseases remains poorly understood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Somatic variants that activate the PI3K-AKT-mTOR or MAPK pathways in neural progenitors are a cause of cortical dysplasia and epilepsy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and developmental brain malformations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, while somatic variants that activate the MAPK pathway in brain endothelial cells are associated with arteriovenous malformations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we reported that expression of a somatic variant activating the MAPK pathway in microglia causes neurodegeneration in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, but the presence and contribution of microglial somatic clones in neurodegenerative diseases and AD remains unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated the presence and nature of somatic variants in brain cells from control and AD patients. In an attempt to examine all brain cells at the same resolution, nuclei from neurons, glia cells and microglia, which only represent ∼5% of brain cells, were pre-sorted. In addition, although human microglia are reported to develop in embryo and renew by local proliferation within the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, bone marrow-derived myeloid cells can enter the brain, in particular during pathological processes. Therefore we also analyzed matched peripheral blood in order to identify shared somatic mutants between microglia and blood. Finally, in order to achieve high sensitivity in the detection of variants that confer a proliferative or activation advantage (driver mutations) and support the emergence or pathogenicity of mosaic clones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and/or that have been previously associated with neurological diseases, we initially performed a targeted deep-sequencing of a panel of 716 genes covering somatic variants reported in clonal proliferative disorders and neurological diseases. We found that microglia from AD patients were enriched for pathogenic variants in comparison to age-matched controls. Furthemore, we found that these microglia-specific AD-associated variants preferentially target the MAPK pathway, including recurrent CBL ring-domain mutations. In addition, we showed that these variants drive a microglia transcriptional program characterized by a strong neuro-inflammatory response previously associated with neurotoxicity, including the production of IL1 and TNF, both in <italic>in vitro</italic> microglia models and in patients. The natural history of the AD-associated microglia clonal inflammatory disorder we describe here is difficult to establish. Specifically, we do not know whether it contributes to the onset of the neuro-inflammatory process at an early stage of the disease, or if microglia carrying driver mutations preferentially expand later during the course of the disease in response to tissue inflammation. Under both hypotheses however, the presence of neuro-inflammatory microglial clones may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in a subset of AD patients. This report reveals a previously unrecognized presence of AD-associated microglia harboring pathogenic somatic variants in humans and provides mechanistic insight for neurodegenerative diseases by delineating cell-type specific variant recurrence.</p>

<title>Clonal diversity among brain cells and blood from controls and AD patients</title>
<p>We examined post-mortem frozen brain samples and matching blood from 45 patients with intermediate-onset sporadic AD and 44 control individuals who died of other causes, including 27 donors age-matched donors with the AD cohort (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; Table S1</bold>). APOE risk allele frequency for patients and controls was comparable to published series <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref></bold>), and analysis of germline mutations did not identify deleterious variants in the 140 genes associated with neurological diseases. Myeloid/microglia, neurons, and glia/stromal cells were purified by flow cytometry using antibody against PU.1 and NeuN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1C</xref></bold>). Single nuclei (sn)RNAseq was performed on PU.1<sup>+</sup> nuclei from one control and 3 AD patients to evaluate microglia enrichment following PU.1<sup>+</sup> purification, and a cell-type annotation analysis indicated that ∼94% of PU.1 nuclei correspond to microglia (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D-S1H</xref></bold>). An average of 2.5 brain samples were analyzed for each donor, including cortex samples obtained from all donors, and hippocampus samples, mostly obtained from AD patients (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>; <bold>Table S1</bold>). A total of 744 DNA samples from blood, PU.1<sup>+</sup> nuclei, NeuN<sup>+</sup> nuclei, and Double Negative nuclei (glia/stromal cells) from patients and controls (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>) were submitted to targeted hybridization/capture and deep-DNA targeted sequencing (TDS, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>, see Methods), at mean coverage of ∼1,100x (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1I</xref></bold>), for a panel of 716 genes (3.43 Mb, referred to below as BRAIN-PACT) which included genes reported to carry somatic variants in clonal proliferative disorders (n=576 genes) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> or implicated in neurological diseases (n=140) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> (<bold>Table S2</bold>, see Methods).</p>

<p>After QC and filtering of germline variants, variant calling using ShearwaterML and a curated Mutect1 analysis identified 826 somatic synonymous and non-synonymous single-nucleotide-variations (SNVs), at an allelic frequency &gt; 0.3% (mean 1.3%) in the 744 samples, corresponding to an overall variant burden of 0.3 mut/Mb <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>)</bold>. Sixty-six SNV were present in more than one sample (<bold>Table S3</bold>). Droplet digital-PCR performed on pre-amplification DNA for ∼10% of the 760 unique SNV was positive in 90% of cases <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref>; Table S3).</bold> After annotation using the OncoKB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> and ClinVar <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> databases for disease-associated or causative variants (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-2F</xref>; Table S3</bold>), 96 unique SNV were classified as Pathogenic (P)-SNV. 40% of these P-SNV were tested by droplet digital-PCR and confirmed in 95% of cases <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>; Table S3)</bold>. Positive and negative results in matching brain samples from individual donors were confirmed in 100% of samples at a mean depth of ∼5000x (range 648-23.000x) (<bold>Table S3</bold>). A venn-diagram analysis of SNVs detected in PU.1<sup>+</sup>, NeuN<sup>+</sup>, DN, and blood samples indicated that most (&gt;90%) SNV and P-SNV were cell-type or tissue specific, with ∼ 5% of SNV and ∼ 8% of P-SNV shared between the blood and brain of individual donors (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref></bold>; <bold>Table S3)</bold>. These data indicate that targeted deep-sequencing of purified nuclei allows to detect clonal mosaic variants with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, ‘bar-coding’ of clonal variants across tissues suggest that blood clones have a minor contribution to microglia somatic diversity, consistent with its local maintainance and proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup></p>

<p>Somatic clonal diversity of the different cell types, as evaluated by the SNV/megabase burden was higher in blood (1 mut/Mb) and PU.1+ nuclei (0.5 mut/Mb) than for DN and neurons (0.18 mut/Mb) (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref></bold>).

These data altogether indicate that the clonal diversity of microglia and blood both increase with age, and that the clonal diversity of blood cells is lower in AD than in age-matched controls who died of other causes including cancer and cardiovascular diseases (see Methods). This is consistent with recent studies showing that clonal hematopoiesis is associated with a higher risk of several diseases related to ageing such as cardiovascular diseases, but inversely associated with the risk of AD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>P-SNV/Mb burden also increased with age (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>), however, we found that the P-SNV/Mb burden was selectively and highly enriched in PU.1+ samples from AD patients in comparison to age-matched controls (p=0.0003, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>).

These data altogether indicatesd that a subset of AD patients (12/45, ∼ 27% of this series) present with microglial clones carrying one or several oncogenic variants that activate the RTK/MAPK pathway, and are characterized by recurrent oncogenic variants in CBL and RIT1.</p>

<p>In half of the AD patients, no microglia driver variants were identified. Targeted deep sequencing (TDS) cannot identify variants located outside of the BRAIN-PACT panel, such as other potential additional variants that would activate the MAPK pathway.

CBL<sup>404C/Y</sup> cells presented with a phenotype comparable to isogenic CBL<sup>404C/C</sup> microglia-like cells for expression of IBA1, CSF1R, NGFR, EGFR, CD11b, MRC1, CD36, CD11c, Tim4, CD45, and MHC Class II (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5G</xref></bold>). Their viability was also comparable to control (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5H</xref></bold>). However, CBL<sup>404C/Y</sup> cells were larger and presented with more lamellipodia, resulting in an amoeboid morphology less frequently observed in isogenic controls (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D,4E</xref></bold>), and their proliferation rate was slightly increased, as measured by EDU incorporation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref></bold>). Moreover CBL<sup>404C/Y</sup> cells cultured in CSF1-supplemented medium also presented with a higher basal pERK level than control when restimulated with CSF1 (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5I</xref></bold>), and ERK phosphorylation after stimulation of starved microglia-like cells with CSF-1 was increased by ∼2 fold in comparison to isogenic WT (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref></bold>). Altogether, these results showed that heterozygosity for a CBL<sup>C404Y</sup> allele is sufficient to activate human microglia-like cells increasing their proliferation and ERK activation.</p>

<p>Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of RNAseq comparing CBL<sup>404C/Y</sup> and isogenic CBL<sup>404C/C</sup> microglia-like cells showed upregulation of Glycolysis, Oxidative Phosphorylation, and mTORC1 signatures, indicating increased metabolism and energy consumption by the mutant cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>; Table S8</bold>).

<title>The MAPK variant neuroinflammatory microglial signature is detectable in patients</title>
<p>Unsupervised Louvain clustering of the snRNAseq data from 5 samples of purified microglia nuclei from 4 donors (control, AD without and with driver variants, see <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref></bold>; <bold>Table S9</bold>) outlined 17 microglia clusters (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A-E</xref> and S7A</bold>).

In particular microglia cluster 2/2B, where KRAS A59G variant reads from patient AD52 are detected despite the small size of the mutant clones and the low sensitivity of scRNAseq to detect low allelic frequency variants, was most enriched for the inflammatory, TNF, mTOR and oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis signatures (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report here that microglia from a cohort of 45 patients with intermediate-onset sporadic AD (mean age 65 y.o), is enriched for clones carrying driver/oncogenic variants predominantly in the MAPK pathway. These variants are absent from blood, glia or neurons in most cases. They include reccurent MAPK pathway variants (CBL RING domain variants in 6 patients), which promote microglial proliferation, activation, and expression of a neuroinflammatory/neurodegereration-associated transcriptional programme <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the production of neurotoxic cytokines IL1b, TNF, and IFNg <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref></sup>. Heterozygous expression of pathogenic CBL variant in human microglia-like cells was sufficient to drive a transcriptional program that associates with increased metabolic activity and a neurotoxic inflammatory response, also observed in microglia from patients with MAPK-activating variants.</p>
<p>The association between AD and MAPK pathway variants is consistent with a previous study where WES performed on unseparated brain tissue from AD patients showed that putative pathogenic somatic variants were enriched for the MAPK pathway, despite the lower sensitivity of the approach and the lack of cellular specificity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The pathogenic role of the somatic pathogenic variants in the MAPK pathway associated with the microglia of AD patients is supported by several lines of evidence. We show here that they promote a neuroinflammatory/neurodegereration-associated transcriptional programme in microglia like cells. In addition, somatic variants that activate the MAPK pathway in tissue macrophages cause a clonal proliferative and inflammatory disease called Histiocytosis, strongly associated with neurodegeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>, and introduction in mouse microglia of the variant allele most frequently associated with histiocytosis (BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>) causes neurodegeneration in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The allelic frequencies of pathogenic variants found in AD patients is lower than values classically observed in solid tumors or leukemia, but within the range of the clonal frequency of pathogenic T cells observed in auto-immune diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref></sup>, and we found that they were in the range of the allelic frequencies observed for the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> variant in microglia in the brain of Histiocytosis patients. Moreover, the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway is involved in microglia proliferation, activation and inflammatory response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">121</xref></sup>, neuronal death, neurodegeneration, and AD pathogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref></sup>, and its activation has been proposed to be an early event in the pathophysiology of AD in human <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref></sup>. Neuroinflammation is an early event in AD pathogenesis, increasingly considered as critical in pathogenesis initiation and progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref></sup>. This is underscored by the observation that the main known genetic risk factor for sporadic AD is the APOE4 allele, responsible for an increased inflammatory response in the brain of APOE4 carriers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In this regard, the contributing role of MAPK activating variants could be comparable to that of the APOE4 allele, and we noted that the allelic frequency of APOE4 allele is lower in patients with pathogenic variants (16/46 alleles, 34%) than patients without detected variant (23/44 alleles, 53%) although the difference did not reach significance in this series.</p>
<p>Variants targeting the DNA-repair and DNA/histone methylation pathways are also enriched among AD patients, sometimes associated in the same patients, albeit their functional significance was not investigated here. Of note however, germline variants of the DNA-repair transcription factor TP53, and DNA damage sensors ATR and CHEK2 were shown to promote accelerated neurodegeneration in human <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Microglia variants are frequently absent from blood, and our DNA sequencing barcoding approach does not support a model where blood cells massively infiltrate the brain or replace the microglia pool in patients from our series, but instead consistent with the local maintenance and proliferation of microglia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In addition, our results are consistent with a recent study showing that clonal hematopoiesis was inversely associated with the risk of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The association of microglia clones carrying pathogenic variants with AD in a subset of patients, together with evidence that they drive neuroinflammation, suggest that these clones could contribute to AD pathogenesis, together with other genetic and environmental factors. Lewis bodies, amyloid angiopathy, tauopathy, or alpha synucleinopathy, were equally distributed among AD patients with or without microglia clones carrying MAPK activating variants. The natural history of the microglial clones is difficult to study in human. It is possible that microglial clones with proliferative and activation advantage and a neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic profile may be present at the onset and contribute to the early stages of the disease. Alternatively it is also possible that the microglial clones carrying the driver mutations appear or are selected later during the course of the disease in the inflammatory milieu of the AD brain. In the latter case, microglial clones would not contribute to disease initiation, but may contribute to the progression of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.</p>

<title>Tissue samples</title>
<p>The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Human tissues were obtained with patient-informed consent and used under approval by the Institutional Review Boards from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (IRB protocols #X19-027). Snap-frozen human brain and matched blood were provided by the Netherlands Brain Bank (NBB), the Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC, NIH), Hospital Sant Joan de Déu and the Rapid Autopsy Program (MSKCC, IRB #15-021). Samples were neuropathologically evaluated and classified by the collaborating institutions as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc5">5</xref></italic>) or non-dementia controls. The mean age of AD patients is 65 years old (55.5% female, 44.5 male). The mean age of all controls is 54 years old (60% female, 40% male), and of the mean age of AD age-matched controls was 70 years old (60%, 40% male). The overall mean of the post-mortem delay interval was 9.8 hours. Patients did not present with germline pathogenic PSEN1/2/3 or APP AD’s associated variants. For additional information on donor’s brain regions. sex, age, cause of death, Apoe status, Braak status see Supplementary table S2. To avoid possible contamination of sequencing data with variants from donor’s tumoral disease, for the group of non-dementia controls, we refrained from selecting cases with blood malignancies or with brain tumors. Samples from histiocytosis patients were collected under GENE HISTIO study (approved by CNIL and CPP Ile-de France) from Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital and Hospital Trousseau and from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.</p>

<title>Nuclei isolation from frozen brain samples, FACS-sorting and DNA extraction</title>
<p>All samples were handled and processed under Air Clean PCR Workstation. ∼250-400 mg of frozen brain tissues was homogenized with a sterile Dounce tissue grinder using a sterile non-ionic surfactant-based buffer to isolate cell nuclei ‘homogenization buffer’ (250 mM Sucrose, 25 mM KCL, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris buffer pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 3 μM DAPI, Nuclease Free Water). Homogenate was filtered in a 40-μm cell strainer and centrifuged 800g 8 min 4°C. To clean-up the homogenate, we performed a iodixanol density gradient centrifugation as follow: pellet was gently mixed 1:1 with iodixanol medium at 50% (50% Iodixanol, 250 mM Sucrose, 150 mM KCL, 30 mM MgCl2, 60 mM Tris buffer pH 8.0, Nuclease Free Water) and homogenization buffer. This solution layered to a new tube containing equal volume of iodixanol medium at 29% and centrifuged 13.500g for 20 min at 4°C. Nuclei pellet was gently resuspended in 200 μl of FACS buffer (0.5% BSA, 2mM EDTA) and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation 800g 5 min 4°C, sample was incubated with anti-NeuN (neuronal marker, 1:500, Anti-NeuN-PE, clone A60 Milli-Mark™) for 40 min. After centrifugation 800g 5 min 4°C, sample was washed with 1X Permeabilization buffer (Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set, eBioscience™) and centrifuged 1300g 5 min, without breaks to improve nuclei recovery. Staining with anti-Pu.1 antibody in 1X Permeabilization buffer (microglia marker 1:50, Pu.1-AlexaFluor 647, 9G7 Cell Signaling) was performed for 40 min. After a wash with FACS buffer sample were ready for sorting. Nuclei are FACS-sorted in a BD FACS Aria with a 100-μm nozzle and a sheath pressure 20 psi, operating at ∼1000 events per second. Nuclei were sorted into 1.5 ml certified RNAse, DNAse DNA, ATP and Endotoxins tubes containing 100μl of sterile PBS. For each population we sorted &gt;10<sup>5</sup> nuclei. Sorting purity was &gt;95%. Sorting strategy is depicted in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>. Of note, the Double-negative gate is restricted to prevent cross-contamination between cell types. Nuclei suspensions were centrifuged 20 min at 6000g and processed immediately for gDNA extraction with QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen) following manufacture instructions. DNA from whole-blood samples was extracted with QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen) following manufacture instructions. Flow cytometry data was collected using DiVa 8.0.1 Software. Subsequent analysis was performed with FlowJo_10.6.2. For sorting strategy, see <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>.</p>

<title>DNA library preparation and sequencing</title>
<p>DNA samples were submitted to the Integrated Genomics Operation (IGO) at MSKCC for quality and quantity analysis, library preparation and sequencing. DNA quality mas measured with Tapestation 2200. All samples had a DNA Integrity Number (DIN) &gt;6. After PicoGreen quantification, ∼200ng of genomic DNA were used for library construction using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa Biosystems KK8504) with 8 cycles of PCR. After sample barcoding, 2.5ng-1µg of each library were pooled and captured by hybridization with baits specific to either the HEME-PACT (Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets related to Hematological Malignancies) assay, designed to capture all protein-coding exons and select introns of 576 (2.88Mb) commonly implicated oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc6">6</xref></italic>) and/or HEME/BRAIN-PACT (716 genes, 3.44 Mb, table S1) an expanded panel that included additional custom targets related to neurological diseases including, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and others (table S1) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc15">15</xref></italic>). To simplify, in the manuscript the combined panel is referred to as ‘BRAIN-PACT’. In table S3, ‘Heme-only’ or ‘Brain-only’ is indicated in the cases for which only one or the other panels were used.

<title>Mutation data analysis</title>
<p>The data processing pipeline for detecting variants in Illumina HiSeq data is as follows. First the FASTQ files are processed to remove any adapter sequences at the end of the reads using cutadapt (v1.6). The files are then mapped using the BWA mapper (bwa mem v0.7.12). After mapping the SAM files are sorted and read group tags are added using the PICARD tools. After sorting in coordinate order the BAM’s are processed with PICARD MarkDuplicates. The marked BAM files are then processed using the GATK toolkit (v 3.2) according to best practices for tumor normal pairs. They are first realigned using ABRA (v 0.92) and then the base quality values are recalibrated with the BaseQRecalibrator. Somatic variants are then called in the processed BAMs using MuTect (v1.1.7) for SNV and ShearwaterML(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc18">18</xref></italic>).</p>

<title>muTect (v1.1.7)</title>
<p>To identify somatic variants and eliminate germline variants, we run the pipeline as follow: PU.1, DN and Blood samples against matching-NeuN samples, and NeuN samples against matching-PU.1. In addition, we ran all samples against a Frozen-Pool of 10 random genomes. We selected Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) [Missense, Nonsense, Splice Site, Splice Regions] that were supported by at least 4 or more mutant reads and with coverage of 50x or more. Fill-out file for each project (∼27 samples per sequencing pool), were used to exclude by manual curation, variants with high background noise. This resulted in 428 variants (Missense, Nonsense, Splice_site, Splice_Region).</p>
<p><bold>ShearwaterML,</bold> was used to look for low allelic frequency somatic variants as it has been shown to efficiently call variants present in a small fraction of cells with true positives being ∼90%. Briefly, the basis of this algorithm is that is uses a collection of deep-sequenced samples to learn for each site a base-specific error model, by fitting a beta-binomial distribution to each site combining the error rates across all normal samples both the mean error rate at the site and the variation across samples, and comparing the observed variant rate in the sample of interest against this background model using a likelihood-ratio test. For detailed description of this algorithm please refer to (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc17">17</xref></italic>). In our data set, for each cell type (NeuN, DN, PU.1) we used as “normal” a combination of the other cell types, i.e PU.1 vs NeuN+DN, DN vs NeuN+PU.1, NEUN vs PU.1+DN, Blood vs NeuN+DN. Since all samples were processed and sequenced using the same protocols, we expect the background error to be even across samples. More than 400 samples were used as background leading to an average background coverage &gt;400.000x. Resulting variants for each cell type were filtered out as germline if they were present in more than 20% of all reads across samples. Additionally, variants with coverage of less than 50x and more than 35% variant allelic frequency (VAF) were removed from downstream analysis. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini &amp; Hochberg’s False Discovery Rate (FDR) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc19">19</xref></italic>) and a q-value of cutoff of 0.01 was used to call somatic variants. Variants were required to have a least one supporting read in each strand. Somatic variants within 10bp of an indel were filtered out as they typically reflect mapping errors. We selected Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) [Intronic, Intergenic, Missense, Nonsense, Splice Site, Splice Regions] that were supported by at least 4 or more mutant reads and annotated them using VEP. Finally, to reduce the risk of SNP contamination, we excluded variants with a MAF (minor allelic frequency) cutoff of 0.01 using the gnomeAD database. This resulted in 509 SNVs.</p>
<p>We compared the final mutant calls from Muetc1 and ShearwaterML and found that 30% of the events (91 variants) that were called by MuTect1 were also called by ShearwaterML. Overall a total of 826 variants (table S3) were found, with a mean coverage at the mutant site of 668.3X (10% percentile: 276X, 90% percentile: 1181X) and a mean of 29.1 mutant reads (10% percentile: 4, 90% percentile: 52), with 84% of mutated supported by at least 5 mutant reads (table S3). The median allelic frequency was ∼1.34% (table S3). Negative results for matching brain negative samples were confirmed in 100% of samples at a mean depth of ∼5000x (range 648-23.000x) (table S3), confirming nuclei sorting purity of &gt;95% for PU.1+, DN, and NEUN+ populations.</p>

<title>Validation of variants by droplet-digital-PCR (ddPCR)</title>
<p>We performed validation of ∼12% of variants (81/643) by droplet-digital PCR (ddPCR) on pre-amplified DNA or on libraries (in the cases where DNA was available). Around 15% (12/81) of the variants analyzed by ddPCR were called by ShearwaterML, ∼44% (34/81) were called by Mutect1 and 40% (33/81) by both ShearwaterML+ Mutect1. Altogether we confirmed 73/81 of variants tested (∼91%). In addition, 61assays (from variants detected in PU.1+ nuclei) were tested in corresponding cell types isolated from the same brain region. This can help estimate the sorting purity. We found that the mean sorting purity was &gt;96%, even in the cases were the clone in PU.1was &gt;3% (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). Assays were also run in matching blood when available. The mean depth of ddPCR was ∼5000x and mutant counts of 3 or more were considered positive.

The remaining assays were designed and ordered through Bio-Rad. For setting-up the right conditions for newly designed assays, cycling conditions were tested to ensure optimal annealing/extension temperature as well as optimal separation of positive from empty droplets. All reactions were performed on a QX200 ddPCR system (Bio-Rad catalog # 1864001). When possible, each sample was evaluated in technical duplicates or quartets. Reactions contained 10ng gDNA, primers and probes, and digital PCR Supermix for probes (no dUTP). Reactions were partitioned into a median of ∼31,000 droplets per well using the QX200 droplet generator. Emulsified PCRs were run on a 96-well thermal cycler using cycling conditions identified during the optimization step (95°C 10’; 40-50 cycles of 94°C 30’ and 52-56°C 1’; 98°C 10’; 4°C hold). Plates were read and analyzed with the QuantaSoft sotware to assess the number of droplets positive for mutant DNA, wild-type DNA, both, or neither. ddPCR results are listed in table S3.</p>

<title>Quantification of mutational load and statistics</title>
<p>We defined mutational load or mutational burden as the number of synonymous and non-synonymous somatic single-nucleotide-variant (SNV) per megabase of genome examined (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc24">24</xref></italic>). Overall, a total of 643 single-nucleotide-variants (SNV) were detected resulting in 0.3 mutations/Mb sequenced. As detailed in the manuscript, the mutational load varies considerably across cell types and patients. To quantify mutational load we took into consideration the panel used for sequencing each sample: HEME-PACT (2.88 Mb) or the extended panel BRAIN-PACT (3.44 Mb) (see table S1,S3). Therefore, the number of mutations was normalized by the number of Mb sequenced for that specific sample. In the cases where we calculated mutational load per patient, we averaged the mutational load of each sample from that patient for a given cell type [(i.e if for one patient, 2 PU.1 samples were sequenced, one from hippocampus and one from superior parietal gyrus (with BRAIN-PACT) then the mutational load for PU.1 for that patient is the mean of the mutational load of the 2 PU.1 samples analyzed). For the quantification of pathogenic variants, the same analysis is performed, quantifying only variants that are reported as pathogenic/likely pathogenic by ClinVar and/or OncoKb. Statistical significance was analyzed with GraphPad Prism (v9) and R (3.6.3). Non-parametric tests were used when data did not follow a normal distribution (Normality test: D’Agostino-Pearson and Shapiro-Wilk test). For normally distributed data, unpaired t-test was used to compare two groups and one-way, nested one-way or two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used for comparing more than two groups, as indicated in the Fig.s. For data that did not have a normal distribution, the tests performed were unpaired two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis test and Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons. Pearson and Spearman were used for correlation analysis. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, we used multivariate logistic regression analysis to test if there was an association between Alzheimer’s disease and the presence of driver variants in PU.1+ nuclei.

<title>Nuclei isolation from frozen brain samples for sn-RNAseq</title>
<p>For sn-RNAseq studies we only selected samples with RIN score in whole tissue of 6 or more. All samples were handled and processed under Air Clean PCR Workstation. About 250-400 mg of frozen brain tissues were homogenized with a sterile Dounce tissue grinder using a sterile homogenization buffer to isolate cell nuclei (250 mM Sucrose, 25 mM KCL, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris buffer pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 3 μM DAPI, Nuclease Free Water and 20 U/ml of Superase-In RNase inhibitor and 40 U/ml RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor). Homogenate was filtered in a 40-μm cell strainer and centrifuged 800g 8 min 4°C. To clean-up the homogenate, we performed a iodixanol density gradient centrifugation as follow: pellet was gently mixed 1:1 with iodixanol medium at 50% (50% Iodixanol, 250 mM Sucrose, 150 mM KCL, 30 mM MgCl2, 60 mM Tris buffer pH 8.0, Nuclease Free Water) and homogenization buffer. This solution layered to a new tube containing equal volume of iodixanol medium at 29% and centrifuged 13.500g for 20 min at 4°C. Nuclei pellet was resuspended in FACS buffer with RNAse inhibitors (0.5% BSA, 2mM EDTA, Superase-In RNase inhibitor and 40 U/ml RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor) and centrifuged 800g 5 min, 4 °C. Nuclei pellet was fixed with 90% ice-cold methanol and incubated for 10 min on ice, followed by a centrifugation at 1300g (without brakes, which improves with nuclei recovery after fixation). The pellet was resuspended in permeabilization buffer (6% BSA, Superase-In RNase inhibitor 20 U/mL, RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor 40 U/mL and 0.05% Triton) followed by a centrifugation at 1300g. Sample was incubated with anti-Pu.1 antibody (microglia marker 1:50, Pu.1-AlexaFluor 647, 9G7 Cell Signaling) in permeabilization buffer. After a wash with FACS buffer sample were ready for sorting. Nuclei are FACS-sorted in a BD FACS Aria with a 100-μm nozzle and a sheath pressure 20 psi, operating at ∼1000 events per second. Nuclei were sorted into 1.5 ml certified RNAse, DNAse DNA, ATP and Endotoxins tubes containing 100μl of sterile PBS. For each population we sorted &gt;10<sup>5</sup> nuclei into FACS buffer.</p>

The removal of doublets using DoubletFinder and cells with high mitochondrial content (&gt;10% mitochondrial RNA) yielded between 6,437 and 9,241 nuclei per patient and sample. Microglia represented 94 ± 3% of total cells. Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) per nucleus and gene count per nucleus were comparable between donors. Integrated_snn at resolution 0.2 outlined 17 microglia clusters. Except for cluster 13 consisting at 97% of cells from the healthy control C11_AG, all donors and samples were represented in every cluster.

<title>Generation of the CBL<sup>+/C404Y</sup> and isogenic WT hiPSC lines</title>
<p>The CBL<sup>C404Y</sup> (c.1211 G&gt;A) variant was inserted at the endogenous locus in the C12 WT hiPSC using Cytidine base editing (CBE) with CBE enzyme BE3-FNLS (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc46">46</xref></italic>). Briefly, the sgRNA for CBE was designed to target the non-coding strand and introduce the position 6 “C-to-T” conversion, to create the G-to-A conversion on the coding strand. The sgRNA target sequence was cloned into the pSPgRNA (Addgene plasmid # 47108) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc47">47</xref></italic>) to make the gene targeting construct. To introduce the CBL C404Y variants, the WT hiPSC (C12) were dissociated using Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies) and electroporated (1 x10<sup>6</sup> cells per reaction) with 4 µg sgRNA-construct plasmid and 4 µg CBE enzyme coding vector BE3-FNLS (Addgene plasmid # 112671) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc46">46</xref></italic>) using Lonza 4D-Nucleofector and the Nucleofector solution (Lonza V4XP-3034) following our previously reported protocol (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc48">48</xref></italic>). The cells were then seeded, and 4 days later, the hiPSC were dissociated into single cells by Accutase and re-plated at a low density (4 per well in 96-well plates) to get the single-cell clones. 10 days later, individual colonies were picked, expanded and analyzed by PCR and DNA sequencing to identify the clones carried the desired CBL<sup>C404Y</sup> heterozygous variant and the isogenic WT control clones.

Statistic: Student t-test. <bold>(B)</bold> HEK293T cells expressing Flag-RIT1 (WT and mutants) were treated -/+ 20% FBS before harvesting and Lysates were probed with antibodies against Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk 1/2, Thr202/Tyr204, (pMAPK)), total MAPK (p44/42 MAPK, Erk1/2, (MAPK)), and Flag. N= 5 independent experiments. Statistic: Student t-test. <bold>(C)</bold> Flag-tagged RIT1 constructs were expressed in HEK293T cells. Lysates were used in pulldown reactions with immobilized GST-PAK1-CRIB domain and in immunoprecipitation reactions with Cdc42 antibody. Bound RIT1 was measured by anti-Flag Western blotting. Lysates were also analyzed by anti-Flag and anti-MAPK Western blotting. <bold>(D)</bold> CHKE2 R346H is a loss-of-function mutant. The R346H variant is located within the catalytic loop of the protein kinase domain and shown in red on the 3D structure of CHEK2 kinase domain (pdb code: 2cn5) (LEFT). CHEK2 R346 Lysates from HEK293T cells expressing Flag-WT or CHEK2 R346 were probed with antibodies that recognizes the auto phosphorylated and activated form of CHK2 and Flag (MIDDLE). Flag-tagged WT and R346H CHK2 were expressed in HEK293T cells, proteins were isolated by immunoaffinity capture using anti-Flag resin. CHK2 activity was measured with [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled ATP and a synthetic CHK2 substrate peptide. Wild-type CHK2 showed robust activity, while the R346H mutant was inactive (RIGHT). <bold>(E)</bold> Western-blot analysis of CBL expression (TOP), pMAPK and total MAPK (MIDDLE) and respective quantification (BOTTOM) in BV2 cell lines transduced with empty vector, CBL<sup>WT</sup>, CBL<sup>Y371H</sup>, CBL<sup>I383M</sup>, CBL<sup>C384Y</sup>, CBL<sup>C404Y</sup> and CBL<sup>C416S</sup>.

<p>This is a <bold>fundamental</bold> study that advances our understanding of the contribution of somatic variations in microglia that may contribute to the onset or progression of neurodegenerative disease. Specifically, during Alzheimer's disease, somatic mutations were identified in the MAPK pathway genes. The findings presented here are backed by <bold>compelling</bold> evidence drawn from a patient cohort, along with mechanistic proof-of-concept studies. Collectively, this research will be of interest to a wide audience, particularly those involved in the study of somatic mutations, neurodegeneration, immunology, and cell signalling.</p>

<p>In the manuscript &quot;A microglia clonal inflammatory disorder in Alzheimer's Disease&quot;, Vicario et al. provide a compelling study elucidating a potential contribution of somatic mutations within the microglia population of the CNS that accelerates microglia activation and disease-associated gene signatures in Alzheimer's disease. Here they especially identified an &quot;enrichment&quot; of pathological SNVs in microglia, but not the peripheral blood, that are associated with clonal proliferative disorders and neurological diseases in a subset of patients with AD. Convincingly, they identified P-SNVs in microglia of AD patients located within the ring domain of CBL, a negative regulator of MAPK signaling. They further provide mechanistic insights into how these variants result in MAPK over-activation and subsequently in a pro-inflammatory phenotype in human microglia-like cells in vitro.</p>
<p>Overall, this study provides clear and detailed evidence from an AD patient cohort pointing to a potential contribution of microglia-specific somatic mutations to disease onset and/or progression in a subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
As outlined above, the study identified P-SNVs in microglia of AD patients associated with clonal proliferative disorders, but also gave an in-depth analysis of re-occurring P-SNVs located within the ring domain of CBL, a negative regulator of MAPK signaling. They further provide mechanistic insights into how these variants result in MAPK over-activation and subsequently in a pro-inflammatory phenotype in HEK cells, BV2 cells, MAC cells, and human microglia-like cells in vitro.</p>
<p>Great care was taken here to validate their hypotheses at each step, as well as to identify the limitations of the possible conclusions. For example, they highlight that the pathway proposed to be affected may be an explanation for a subset of AD patients, and emphasize that it is yet unclear whether this accumulation of pathological SNVs is a cause or consequence of disease progression</p>
<p>The study clearly supports an enrichment of P-SNVs in several genes associated with clonal proliferative disorders in microglia and nicely separates this from SNVs associated with clonal hematopoiesis in the peripheral blood found in AD patients and controls.</p>
<p>The authors further acknowledged that several age-matched control patients were diagnosed with cancer or tumor-associated diseases and carefully dissected the occurring SNVs in these patients are not associated with the P-SNVs identified in the microglial compartment of the AD cohort.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Even though the study is overall very convincing, several points could help to connect the seen somatic variants in microglia more with a potential role in disease progression. The connection of P-SNVs in the genes chosen from neurological disorders was not further highlighted by the authors.</p>
<p>The authors show in snRNA-seq data that a disease-associated microglia state seems to be enriched in patients with somatic variants in the CBL ring domain, however, this analysis could be deepened. For example, how this knowledge may translate to patient benefits when the relevant cell populations appear concentrated in a single patient sample (Figure 5; AD52) is unclear; increasing the analyzed patient pool for Figure 5 and showcasing the presence of this microglia state of interest in a few more patients with driving mutations for CBL or other MAPK pathway associated mutations would lend their hypotheses further credibility.</p>
<p>A potential connection between P-SNVs in microglia and disease pathology and symptoms was not further explored by the authors.</p>
<p>A recent preprint (Huang et al., 2024) connected the occurrence of somatic variants in genes associated with clonal hematopoiesis in microglia in a large cohort of AD patients, this study is not further discussed or compared to the data in this manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Vicaro et al. aimed to quantify and characterize mosaic mutations in human sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain samples. They focused on three broad classes of brain cells, neurons that express the marker NeuN, microglia that express the marker PU.1, and double-negative cells that presumably comprise all other brain cell types, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and endothelial cells. The authors find an enrichment of potentially pathogenic somatic mutations in AD microglia compared to controls, with MAPK pathway genes being particularly enriched for somatic mutations in those cells. The authors report a striking enrichment for mutations in the gene CBL and use in vitro functional assays to show that these mutations indeed induce MAPK pathway activation.</p>
<p>The current state of the AD and somatic mutation fields puts this work into context. First, AD is a devastating disease whose prevalence is only increasing as the population of the U.S. is aging, necessitating the investigation of novel features of AD to identify new therapeutic opportunities. Second, microglia have recently come into focus as important players in AD pathogenesis. Many AD risk genes are selectively expressed in microglia, and microglia from AD brain samples show a distinct transcriptional profile indicating an inflammatory phenotype. The authors' previous work shows that a genetic mouse model of mosaic BRAF activation in macrophages (including microglia) displays a neurodegenerative phenotype similar to AD (Mass et al., 2017, doi:10.1038/nature23672). Third, new technological developments have allowed for identifying mosaic mutations present in only a small fraction of or even single cells. Together, these data form a rationale for studying mosaic mutations in microglia in AD. In light of the authors' findings regarding MAPK pathway gene somatic mutations, it is also important to note that MAPK has previously been implicated in AD neuroinflammation in the literature.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study demonstrated several strengths.</p>
<p>Firstly, the authors used two methods to identify mosaic mutations:</p>
<p>
(1) deep (~1,100x) DNA sequencing of a targeted panel of 716 genes they hypothesized might, if mutated somatically, play a role in AD, and</p>
<p>
(2) deep (400x) whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify clonal mosaics outside of those 716 genes.</p>
<p>A second strength is the agreement between these experiments, where WES found many variants identified in the panel experiment, and both experiments revealed somatic mutations in MAPK pathway genes.</p>
<p>Third, the authors demonstrated in several in vitro systems that many mutations they identified in MAPK genes activate MAPK signaling. Finally, the authors showed that in some human brain samples, single-cell gene expression analysis revealed that cells bearing a mosaic MAPK pathway mutation displayed dysregulated inflammatory signaling and dysregulation in other pathways. This single-cell analysis was in agreement with their in vitro analyses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study also showed some weaknesses. The sample size (45 AD donors and 44 controls) is small, reflected in the relatively modest effect sizes and p-values observed. This weakness is partially ameliorated by the authors' extensive molecular and functional validation of mutation candidates. Another weakness is the lack of discussion of whether the genes found to be mutated somatically in AD show any AD-risk alleles in the population. If they did, it would further support the authors' conclusions that they are playing a role in AD. Finally, as the authors point out, this study cannot conclude whether microglial mosaic mutations cause AD or are an effect of AD. Future studies may shed more light on this important question.</p>
<p>Conclusions and Impact:</p>
<p>Considering the study's aims, strengths, and weaknesses, I conclude that the authors achieved their goal of characterizing the role of mosaic mutations in human AD. Their data strongly suggest that mosaic MAPK mutations in microglia are associated with AD. The impacts of this study remain to be seen, but they could include attempts to target CBL or other mutated genes in the treatment of AD. This work also suggests a similar approach to identifying potentially causative somatic mutations in other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
