<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling elicits multiple downstream pathways, most notably the Ras/MAPK cascade facilitated by the adaptor protein Grb2. However, the mechanism by which Grb2 is recruited to the FGF signaling complex remains unresolved. Here we showed that genetic ablation of FGF signaling prevented lens induction by disrupting transcriptional regulation and actin cytoskeletal arrangements, which could be reproduced by deleting the juxtamembrane region of the FGF receptor and rescued by Kras activation. Conversely, mutations affecting the Frs2-binding site on the FGF receptor or the deletion of Frs2 and Shp2 primarily impact later stages of lens vesicle development involving lens fiber cell differentiation. Our study further revealed that the loss of Grb2 abolished MAPK signaling, resulting in a profound arrest of lens development. However, removing Grb2’s putative Shp2 dephosphorylation site (Y209) neither produced a detectable phenotype nor impaired MAPK signaling during lens development. Furthermore, the catalytically inactive Shp2 mutation (C459S) only modestly impaired FGF signaling, whereas replacing Shp2’s C-terminal phosphorylation sites (Y542/Y580) previously implicated in Grb2 binding only caused placental defects, perinatal lethality, and reduced lacrimal gland branching without impacting lens development, suggesting that Shp2 only partially mediates Grb2 recruitment. In contrast, we observed that FGF signaling is required for the phosphorylation of the Grb2-binding sites on Shc1 and the deletion of Shc1 exacerbates the lens vesicle defect caused by Frs2 and Shp2 deletion. These findings establish Shc1 as a critical collaborator with Frs2 and Shp2 in targeting Grb2 during FGF signaling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The lens is an exemplary model for studying signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cvekl and Zhang, 2017</xref>). In mice, the lens placode emerges as thickened epithelia within the lateral head ectoderm at E9.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). It undergoes invagination to form the lens pit at E10.5, and upon separation from the surface ectoderm, progresses into the lens vesicle at E11.5. Following this, lens progenitor cells within the lens vesicle proliferate and migrate toward the equator of the lens, where they differentiate into lens fibers responsible for the lens’s focusing power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lovicu and McAvoy, 2005</xref>). Genetic modification of the FGF signaling cascade alters various lens developmental processes, including lens invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Carbe and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pan et al., 2006</xref>), lens vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kuracha et al., 2011</xref>), the establishment of the transition zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2019</xref>), lens epithelium proliferation and survival, as well as lens fiber differentiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lovicu and Overbeek, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Qu et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Robinson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the lens provides valuable insights into the nuanced interplay of FGF signaling components during distinct stages of lens formation.</p>

<p>The current model of FGF signaling posits that its primary orchestration centers on the Frs2/Shp2/Grb2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beenken and Mohammadi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brewer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eswarakumar et al., 2005</xref>). According to this model, FGFR activation induces phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Frs2, creating a platform for recruiting Shp2 and Grb2. In conjunction with its constitutively bound partner Sos (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor), Grb2 subsequently initiates Ras/MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hadari et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ong et al., 2000</xref>). Prior research in eye development supports this notion, revealing that Crk proteins augment Ras signaling by associating with the Frs2/Shp2/Grb2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Collins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Madakashira et al., 2012</xref>), while PI3K-AKT signaling is activated through direct Ras binding with the PI3K catalytic subunit p110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). However, unresolved questions persist regarding downstream mediators of FGF signaling. Earlier studies suggested that mice with Frs2 mutants lacking the Grb2 binding site can survive healthily, whereas those lacking the Shp2 binding site exhibit severe eye development defects and significantly reduced MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gotoh et al., 2004</xref>). These results suggest the critical importance of Shp2 in Grb2-mediated Ras signaling, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. Additionally, Soriano and colleagues generated allelic series of <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and <italic>Fgfr2</italic> mutants disrupting the Frs2 binding sites and multiple tyrosine phosphorylation residues, both individually and in combination, yet their phenotypes proved less severe than those of the respective null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clark and Soriano, 2024</xref>) These studies suggest that there may exist additional adaptor(s) other than Frs2 to mediate FGF signaling. One potential candidate for mediating FGF signaling is the Shc family of proteins, which exist in three isoforms: p66, p52, and p46 (Wills and Jones, 2012). These proteins contain a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain and an SH2 domain, both of which can interact with phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Additionally, Shc proteins possess multiple tyrosine residues that, upon phosphorylation, can be recognized by other molecules, including Grb2. Previous studies have demonstrated that FGF stimulation leads to increased Shc phosphorylation and its binding to Grb2, although the specific binding site remains unresolved (Dunican et al., 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Klint et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Schuller et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the functional significance of Shc’s interaction with the FGF receptor in vivo has yet to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that genetic alterations to FGFR— whether by deleting all isoforms, the juxtamembrane region, or the specific Frs2 binding site—disrupt the successive phases of lens development, encompassing lens induction, vesicle formation, and fiber differentiation. Surprisingly, while we established that Grb2-Ras signaling serves as the primary conduit of FGF signaling, interfering with Grb2 dephosphorylation and binding by Shp2 or even abolishing Shp2 phosphatase activity did not eliminate either MAPK signaling or lens differentiation. Conversely, we observed that FGF-induced Shc phosphorylation hinges on the FGFR juxtamembrane domain rather than its Frs2 binding site. Although the deletion of Shc1 has only a modest impact on lens development and MAPK activity individually, its combination with Frs2 and Shp2 deletion results in a profound arrest of lens vesicle development. These results suggest that Shc functions independently of Frs2 and Shp2 to augment Grb2-Ras signaling within the FGF pathway.</p>

<title>FGF signaling is required for lens induction</title>
<p>Previous studies have established the presence of all four FGF receptors in the surface ectoderm during lens induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>). However, despite the deletion of the primary FGFRs, <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and <italic>Fgfr2</italic>, only thinning of the lens placode occurred, with no discernible impact on lens determination transcription factors like Pax6, Sox2, and Foxe3. To explore whether the compensatory effects of remaining FGFRs obscure the role of FGF signaling in lens induction, we eliminated all four FGFRs using the <italic>Le-Cre</italic> deletor driven by the <italic>Pax6</italic> lens ectoderm (LE) enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ashery-Padan et al., 2000</xref>). The <italic>Le-Cre</italic> activity within the lens placode at E9.5, as indicated by the embedded GFP reporter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, arrows), resulted in the complete loss of pERK in the ectoderm, confirming FGF signaling inactivation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, inserts and arrowheads). Consequently, while the initial marker of lens induction, increased Pax6 expression as the surface ectoderm transitions into the lens placode, persisted in the mutant, Sox2 expression failed to be upregulated. Furthermore, subsequent lens placode invagination, driven by apical constriction evidenced by polarized F-actin localization on the apical side by E10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chauhan et al., 2011</xref>), was disrupted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> arrows). This occurred despite the proper localization of Fibronectin at the basal side of the lens placode (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>), suggesting that overall cell polarity remained unaffected. The <italic>Le-Cre;Fgfr1<sup>f/f</sup>;Fgfr2<sup>f/f</sup>;Fgfr3<sup>f/f</sup>;Fgfr4<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutant also failed to exhibit the expected upregulation of Foxe3 and Jag1 in lens vesicle, further underscoring impaired lens induction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, arrowheads). Previous studies have highlighted FGF and BMP interaction during lens formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Garcia <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), yet the dorsal-to-ventral gradient of BMP signaling, as indicated by pSmad staining, persisted in <italic>Le-Cre;Fgfr1<sup>f/f</sup>;Fgfr2<sup>f/f</sup>;Fgfr3<sup>f/f</sup>;Fgfr4<sup>-/-</sup></italic>knockouts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, arrowheads). Furthermore, Wnt signaling, a known negative regulator of lens induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Smith et al., 2005</xref>), showed no signs of abnormal activity, as indicated by the absence of Lef1 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, arrows). These results demonstrated that FGF signaling is required independently of Bmp and Wnt signaling for lens induction.</p>
<p>We next focused on the two primary FGFRs, Fgfr1 and 2, to scrutinize the latter phases of lens development. In contrast to mutants with deletion of all four FGFRs, we observed apical confinement of F-actin and expression of Foxe3 in the <italic>Le-Cre;Fgfr1<sup>f/f</sup>;Fgfr2<sup>f/f</sup></italic>mutant lens cells, although the number of Foxe3-expressing cells were reduced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E and H</xref>, arrows). However, there was a conspicuous reduction in phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream target S6 in the lens vesicle, suggesting that deletion of <italic>Fgfr1/2</italic> disrupted mTOR signaling (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>, arrowheads). Underscoring the lens differentiation defect, Prox1, a crucial transcription factor for lens fiber development, along with the lens-specific protein αA crystallin expression, was also lost in the <italic>Le-Cre;Fgfr1<sup>f/f</sup>;Fgfr2<sup>f/f</sup></italic>mutant lens vesicle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, arrows) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Garg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ochi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Xie et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, there was a notable decrease in Cyclin D1 expression and increasing TUNEL staining within the lens vesicle, indicating cell proliferation and apoptosis defects ((<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G, I</xref> and J, arrows and arrowheads) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Garcia <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Ras mediates FGF signaling to suppress apoptosis in the developing lens</title>
<p>FGF signaling is known to stimulate the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway. To explore the significance of Ras signaling, we employed a genetic rescue strategy utilizing an inducible <italic>Kras</italic> allele capable of expressing the constitutively active <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> upon Cre-mediated recombination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tuveson et al., 2004</xref>). When crossed with <italic>Fgfr1/2</italic> mutants, this allele effectively restored pERK expression and normalized lens vesicle invagination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). By E13.5, the <italic>Le- Cre;Fgfr1<sup>f/</sup> <sup>f</sup>;Fgfr2<sup>f/f</sup> <sup>f</sup>;Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic>lens displayed robust phosphorylation of MEK, the upstream kinase of Erk, concomitant with the expression of lens fiber markers Prox1 and αA crystallin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B and C</xref>). Notably, the rescued lens reached about half the size of a control lens (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). These results suggest that Kras signaling acts as a primary conduit for FGF signaling during lens development.</p>

<p>To ascertain whether cell death underpins the pronounced lens vesicle defect in <italic>Le- Cre;Fgfr1<sup>f/f</sup>;Fgfr2<sup>f/f</sup></italic>mutant, we targeted Bax and Bak, two core regulators of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, for deletion. This intervention notably reduced TUNEL signals within the lens placode (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E and F</xref>) and resulted in a recovery of lens formation, as evidenced by the expression of Foxe3, Maf, and Jag1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), although the lens remained considerably smaller than the wild-type control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>).

<title>The juxtamembrane domain and Frs2 binding site of FGFR regulate the consecutive steps of lens development</title>
<p>Previous studies have mapped the Frs2 binding site to the juxtamembrane domain of FGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dhalluin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ong <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). To probe the role of this region in lens development, we employed two distinct alleles: one entirely devoid of the juxtamembrane domain (amino acid 407-433 in Fgfr1, <italic>Fgfr1<sup>ΔFrs</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hoch and Soriano, 2006</xref>), and another harboring mutations in two pivotal residues essential for Frs2 binding (L424A and R426A in Fgfr2, <italic>Fgfr2<sup>LR</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Eswarakumar et al., 2006</xref>).

This suggests that the juxtamembrane domain of FGFR likely serves additional functions beyond Frs2 binding in lens induction.</p>

<p>The absence of a lens induction phenotype in the <italic>Le-Cre;Fgfr1<sup>f/f</sup>;Fgfr2<sup>f/LR</sup></italic> mutant raised the question regarding the role of Frs2 in lens development. Upon examining the iSyTE lens gene expression database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kakrana et al., 2018</xref>), we observed a rapid increase in <italic>Fgfr3</italic> expression in the murine lens from E11.5 onwards, surpassing the levels of both <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and <italic>Fgfr2</italic> by E12.5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). This led us to consider whether heightened <italic>Fgfr3</italic> expression could potentially mask the effects of <italic>Fgfr2<sup>LR</sup></italic> mutation during later stages of lens development. To explore this hypothesis, we further deleted <italic>Fgfr3</italic> in conjunction with the <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and <italic>Fgfr2<sup>LR</sup></italic> mutant, which indeed impeded the differentiation and elongation of posterior lens epithelial cells, as evidenced by the absence of αA crystallin, Jag1, and Maf at E11.5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). By E12.5, unlike the <italic>Le- Cre;Fgfr1<sup>f/f</sup>;Fgfr2<sup>f/LR</sup></italic> mutant, which retained pERK staining and generated lens fibers to populate the lens vesicle similar to controls, the <italic>Le-Cre;Fgfr1<sup>f/f</sup>;Fgfr2<sup>f/LR</sup>;Fgfr3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> triple mutant remained a hollow lens vesicle without any pERK expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F and G</xref>). This observation bears a striking resemblance to the phenotype previously reported when all three FGFRs were deleted at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Thus, while the Frs2 binding site on FGFR is dispensable for lens induction and lens vesicle formation, it evidently emerges as crucial for the later stage of lens fiber differentiation.</p>

<title>Grb2 mediates FGF-MAPK signaling in lens cell differentiation</title>
<p>If Frs2 is responsible for lens fiber differentiation rather than lens induction, we anticipate that its downstream target, Grb2, would exhibit a similar phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we genetically deleted <italic>Grb2</italic> using the <italic>Le-Cre</italic> driver. Indeed, the <italic>Le-cre;Grb2<sup>f/f</sup></italic>mutant formed a lens vesicle at E12.5 but lacked pERK staining, correlating with decreased Cyclin D3 expression and increased TUNEL staining (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Notably, the initial lens determination gene Foxe3 was unaffected, but differentiation marker Jag1 was absent while Maf and crystallin were reduced. This lens differentiation defect is evident as early as E11.5, characterized by a significant reduction in the expression of cell cycle regulators Cyclin D1 and p57, as well as the pro- differentiation transcription factor Prox1, suggesting dysregulation of the cell cycle and failure to initiate the lens fiber cell differentiation program (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). By E13.5, the lens vesicle remained hollow and smaller compared to the control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B and C</xref>). The deletion of Grb2 affects lens differentiation without hindering the formation of the lens vesicle, mirroring the effect of Frs2 binding site mutation, thus supporting the notion that Grb2 is the primary downstream effector of Frs2 in promoting lens fiber differentiation.</p>

<title>The Grb-Shp2 binding plays a modest role in FGF signaling</title>
<p>While both Frs2 and Shp2 possess phosphotyrosine residues that can engage with Grb2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), it’s noteworthy that only mutations in the Shp2 binding sites, rather than those in the Grb2 binding sites on Frs2, led to severe eye development defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gotoh <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). This intriguing observation spurred us to investigate the potential role of Shp2 as an adaptor in facilitating the interaction between Frs2 and Grb2.

<title>Inactivation of Shp2 phosphatase activity failed to abrogate FGF-induced MAPK signaling</title>
<p>The results presented above indicate that the direct binding of Grb2 to the Shp2 C-terminus is not essential for FGF signaling.

<p>The PhosphoSitePlus database indicates that Grb2 still possesses a less frequently phosphorylated Y160 site, which has also been previously implicated in FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ahmed et al., 2015</xref>). To rigorously assess the potential impact of Shp2-mediated Grb2 dephosphorylation, we developed a <italic>Shp2<sup>CS</sup></italic> mouse model by substituting the cysteine residue at position 463 (C459 in humans) with alanine in Shp2’s catalytic domain, effectively abolishing its enzymatic activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E and F</xref>). Unlike the earlier <italic>Shp2</italic> null mutants that perished by E7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yang et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Shp2<sup>CS/CS</sup></italic>embryos exhibited stunted growth but survived until E9.5, indicating that the <italic>Shp2<sup>CS</sup></italic> mutation doesn’t entirely abrogate Shp2’s function (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Moreover, after removing the <italic>flox</italic> allele using Cre-expressing adenovirus, the <italic>Shp2<sup>f/CS</sup></italic> MEF cells still retained considerable pERK activity in response to FGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study used lens development as a model system to dissect the intricate mechanisms of FGF signaling. By systematically disrupting FGF signaling components, it unveiled a previously unappreciated dependency on precise FGF dosage for each developmental stage. Genetic rescue experiments and targeted manipulation of tyrosine phosphorylation further demonstrated that FGF signaling relies only partially on Frs2 and Shp2 for Grb2 recruitment, ultimately activating Ras and preventing cell death. Contrary to prevailing expectations, while both the adaptor function and the phosphatase activity of Shp2 are vital for embryonic survival, they play a surprisingly modest role in lens development, challenging the current understanding of Shp2 signaling mechanism. Notably, our research suggests that Shc may provide an alternative pathway for Grb2 recruitment and subsequent Ras activation. Although various adaptor proteins like Frs2, Crk, Shb, and Gab have been recognized for their roles in FGF signal transduction, recent findings suggest that mutations in their binding sites on FGF receptors have a significantly lesser impact compared to <italic>Fgfr</italic> null mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brewer <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Klint and Claesson-Welsh, 1999</xref>). Our data propose that Shc1 serves as an alternative route for FGF signal transmission, thereby adding a new dimension to our understanding of FGF signaling dynamics.</p>
<p>Lens induction, the pivotal event in eye development, has captivated developmental biologists since Hans Spemann’s seminal discovery over a century ago, which identified the optic vesicle’s role in triggering the overlying head ectoderm to differentiate into the lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Spemann, 1901</xref>). However, the nature of the lens inductive signal has remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Makrides et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Robinson, 2006</xref>). Previous studies suggested that FGF signaling might not be essential, as deleting Fgfr1/2 in the head ectoderm did not affect the expression of the early lens determination gene, Foxe3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Garcia <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Contrary to this notion, we have ablated all FGFRs present in the surface ectoderm, which led to a complete loss of pERK, confirming the absence of FGF signaling activity. While the mutant ectoderm still expressed Pax6, this observation may be confounded by the fact that the Le-Cre driver used for FGFR deletion depends on Pax6 activity. Importantly, the mutant tissue failed to upregulate Sox2 and Foxe3, the definitive markers of the lens induction. Moreover, the disruption of FGF signaling prevented the apical confinement of F-actin, impeding lens placode invagination driven by apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chauhan <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Considering the concomitant expression of FGF ligands in the optic vesicle, our findings suggest that FGF signaling is an indispensable factor in lens induction.</p>
<p>The role of Shp2 phosphatase in enhancing Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) signaling pathways is well established, yet its molecular mechanism remains largely unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Neel et al., 2003</xref>). The prevailing model posits that Shp2 functions by dephosphorylating key tyrosine residues on target proteins, thereby activating Ras signaling. However, it has also been suggested that Shp2 itself can undergo C-terminal phosphorylation, potentially serving as a docking platform for other signaling molecules. Through targeted mutagenesis of these putative phosphorylation sites (<italic>Shp2<sup>YF</sup></italic>), we demonstrate the critical role of Shp2 phosphorylation in placental formation and neonatal survival. Biochemical analyses revealed distinct cellular responses to FGF and PDGF stimulation in <italic>Shp2<sup>YF</sup></italic> mutants, suggesting context-dependent functions for these C-terminal modifications, which may explain the narrow phenotypic spectrum associated with the <italic>Shp2<sup>YF</sup></italic> mutation. Intriguingly, the inactivation of Shp2 phosphatase activity via the <italic>Shp2<sup>CS</sup></italic>mutation also resulted in minimal disruption of FGF signaling in lens development, unlike the control <italic>Le-Cre; Shp2<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mutant, which showed a significant reduction in pERK levels and subsequent lens differentiation defects. This lack of a robust phenotype cannot be attributed to residual protein activity following Cre-mediated gene deletion due to the systemic nature of the <italic>Shp2<sup>CS</sup></italic> mutation. While Shp2 phosphatase deficiency did cause early embryonic lethality and abrogated the development of the more FGF-sensitive lacrimal gland, the absence of a pronounced lens phenotype calls into question the essentiality of Shp2 phosphatase activity for its overall function. Given the distinct phenotype observed in the <italic>Shp2<sup>YF</sup></italic> mutant, it is plausible that Shp2 fulfills dual roles as both an adaptor and a phosphatase in certain signaling contexts, challenging existing paradigms and inviting further investigation into its multifaceted biological functions.</p>
<p>Previous studies have identified FGFR as a docking station for various signaling adaptor proteins, including Frs2, Plcg, Crk, Grb14 and Shb. In a herculean effort, Soriano and colleagues have eliminated these binding sites, both individually and collectively, but the outcomes were unexpectedly mild compared to the more severe phenotypes observed in the corresponding null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brewer <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clark and Soriano, 2024</xref>). For instance, whereas the <italic>Fgfr1</italic> null mutant is lethal by E6.5, mutants lacking the ability to bind Frs2, CrkL and Plcg/Shb//Grb14 survive until E10.5. More strikingly, <italic>Fgfr2</italic> null mutants typically succumb by E10.5 due to widespread organ development failures, yet mutants deficient in these specific binding sites can reach adulthood with minimal apparent defects. The fact that combining <italic>Fgfr1/2</italic> signaling mutations does not mimic the null phenotype further suggests that these mild mutant phenotypes are not simply a result of compensatory actions by other FGF receptors. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in our understanding of FGF signaling, implying the existence of unidentified factors that can compensate for the loss of Frs2 and other adaptors. Our study proposes Shc1 as a potential player in this complex signaling web, which is consistent with the observations that Shc1 can be phosphorylated in association with FGF receptors at sites known to facilitate Grb2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Klint et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Schuller et al., 2008</xref>), indicating an alternative route for signal propagation. Previous studies have shown that Shc proteins are predominantly expressed in lens epithelial cells and downregulated in lens fiber cells of the chick lens. Despite this downregulation, Shc becomes associated with α6A integrin in the lens fiber zone (Walker et al., 2002). However, the functional significance of Shc’s abundant expression in the lens epithelial zone remained unclear. In our study, we found that <italic>Shc1</italic> knockout models exhibited relatively mild lens phenotypes at E15.5 during lens differentiation, possibly due to functional redundancy among Shc family proteins. Importantly, we discovered that Shc phosphorylation is dependent on FGF signaling during lens vesicle development. Furthermore, simultaneous deletion of <italic>Shc1</italic>, <italic>Frs2</italic>, and <italic>Shp2</italic> exacerbated lens development defects, resulting in a hollow lens vesicle significantly smaller than that observed in Frs2/Shp2 double mutants. These results demonstrate that Shc participates in FGF signaling in lens epithelial cells during lens vesicle development. These findings point towards a robust and adaptable FGF signaling network, capable of engaging alternative pathways through Frs2, Shc, and other adaptor proteins, thereby maintaining its function despite significant genetic disruptions. These insights underscore the complexity and resilience of cellular signaling networks, understanding which is important for developing strategies to manipulate them in developmental and disease contexts.</p>

<p>The relative lens sizes were measured using Image J and normalized against the control. The anterior/posterior lens ratio was determined by comparing the length of the anterior epithelium, as measured in Image J, to the length of the posterior lens boundary. The percentage of TUNEL and cleaved-caspase3 positive cells were normalized against the total number of DAPI positive cells. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7. Sample sizes were not predetermined. Data represent mean ± s.d. Statistical differences between two groups were assessed using an unpaired, two-tailed t-test, while comparisons among three or more groups employed one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript uses the eye lens as a model to investigate basic mechanisms in the Fgf signaling pathway. Understanding Fgf signaling is of broad importance to biologists as it is involved in the regulation of various developmental processes in different tissues/organs and is often misregulated in disease states. The Fgf pathway has been studied in embryonic lens development, namely with regards to its involvement in controlling events such as tissue invagination, vesicle formation, epithelium proliferation and cellular differentiation, thus making the lens a good system to uncover the mechanistic basis of how the modulation of this pathway drives specific outcomes. Previous work has suggested that proteins, other than the ones currently known (e.g., the adaptor protein Frs2), are likely involved in Fgfr signaling. The present study focuses on the role of Shp2 and Shc1 proteins in the recruitment of Grb2 in the events downstream of Fgfr activation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings reveal that the juxtamembrane region of the Fgf receptor is necessary for proper control of downstream events such as facilitating key changes in transcription and cytoskeleton during tissue morphogenesis. The authors conditionally deleted all four Fgfrs in the mouse lens that resulted in molecular and morphological lens defects, most importantly, preventing the upregulation of the lens induction markers Sox2 and Foxe3 and the apical localization of F-actin, thus demonstrating the importance of Fgfrs in early lens development, i.e. during lens induction. They also examined the impact of deleting Fgfr1 and 2, on the following stage, i.e. lens vesicle development, which could be rescued by expressing constitutively active KrasG12D. By using specific mutations (e.g. Fgfr1ΔFrs lacking the Frs2 binding domain and Fgfr2LR harboring mutations that prevent binding of Frs2), it is demonstrated that the Frs2 binding site on Fgfr is necessary for specific events such as morphogenesis of lens vesicle. Further, by studying Shp2 mutations and deletions, the authors present a case for Shp2 protein to function in a context-specific manner in the role of an adaptor protein and a phosphatase enzyme. Finally, the key surprising finding from this study is that downstream of Fgfr signaling, Shc1 is an important alternative pathway - in addition to Shp2 - involved in the recruitment of Grb2 and in the subsequent activation of Ras. The methodologies, namely, mouse genetics and state-of-the-art cell/molecular/biochemical assays are appropriately used to collect the data, which are soundly interpreted to reach these important conclusions. Overall, these findings reveal the flexibility of the Fgf signaling pathway and it downstream mediators in regulating cellular events. This work is expected to be of broad interest to molecular and developmental biologists.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness that needs to be discussed is that Le-Cre depends on Pax6 activation, and hence its use in specific gene deletion will not allow evaluation of the requirement of Fgfrs in the expression of Pax6 itself. But since this is the earliest Cre available for deletion in the lens, mentioning this in the discussion would make the readers aware of this issue.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>I have reviewed the revised manuscript submitted by Wang et al., which is entitled &quot;Shc1 cooperates with Frs2 and Shp2 to recruit Grb2 in FGF-induced lens development&quot;. In this paper, the authors first examined lens phenotypes in mice with Le-Cre-mediated knockdown (KD) of all four FGFR (FGFR1-4), and found that pERK signals, Jag1 and foxe3 expression are absent or drastically reduced, indicating that FGF signaling is essential for lens induction. Next, the authors examined lens phenotypes of FGFR1/2-KD mice and found that lens fiber differentiation is compromised and that proliferative activity and cell survival are also compromised in lens epithelium. Interestingly, Kras activation rescues defects in lens growth and lens fiber differentiation in FGFR1/2-KD mice, indicating that Ras activation is a key step for lens development, downstream of FGF signaling. Next, the authors examined the role of Frs2, Shp2 and Grb2 in FGF signaling for lens development. They confirmed that lens fiber differentiation is compromised in FGFR1/3-KD mice combined with Frs2-dysfunctional FGFR2 mutants, which is similar to lens phenotypes of Grb2-KD mice. However, lens defects are milder in mice with Shp2YF/YF and Shp2CS mutant alleles, indicating that involvement of Shp2 is limited for the Grb2 recruitment for lens fiber differentiation. Lastly, the authors showed new evidence on the possibility that another adapter protein, Shc1, promotes Grb2 recruitment independent of Frs2/Shp2-mediated Grb2 recruitment.</p>
<p>Strength</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript provides valuable data on how FGFR activation leads to Ras activation through the adapter platform of Frs2/Shp2/Grb2, which advances our understanding on complex modification of FGF signaling pathway. The authors applied a genetic approach using mice, whose methods and results are valid to support the conclusion. The discussion also well summarizes the significance of their findings.</p>
<p>Weakness</p>
<p>The authors found that the new adaptor protein Shc1 is involved in Grb2 recruitments in response to FGF receptor activation. However, the main data on Shc1 are only histological sections and statistical evaluation of lens size. In the revised manuscript, the authors did not answer my major concern that cellular-level data are missing, which is not fully enough to support their main conclusion on the involvement of Shc1 in Grb2 recruitment of FGF signaling for lens development. Since the title of this manuscript is that Shc1 cooperates with Frs2 and Shp2 to recruit Grb2 in FGF-induced lens development, it is important to provide the cellular-level evidence on Shc1.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Shc1 cooperates with Frs2 and Shp2 to recruit Grb2 in FGF-induced lens development&quot; by Wang et al., investigates the molecular mechanism used by FGFR signaling to support lens development. The lens has long been known to depend on FGFR-signaling for proper development. Previous investigations have demonstrated the FGFR signaling is required for embryonic lens cell survival and for lens fiber cell differentiation. The requirement of FGFR signaling for lens induction has remained more controversial as deletion of both Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 during lens placode formation does not prevent the induction of definitive lens markers such as FOXE3 or αA-crystallin. Here the authors have used the Le-Cre driver to delete all four FGFR genes from the developing lens placode demonstrating a definitive failure of lens induction in the absence of FGFR-signaling. The authors focused on FGFR1 and FGFR2, the two primary FGFRs present during early lens development and demonstrated that lens development could be significantly rescued in lenses lacking both FGFR1 and FGFR2 by expressing a constitutively active allele of KRAS. They also showed that the removal of pro-apoptotic genes Bax and Bak could also lead to a substantial rescue of lens development in lenses lacking both FGFR1 and FGFR2. In both cases, the lens rescue included both increased lens size and the expression of genes characteristic of lens cells.</p>
<p>Significantly the authors concentrated on the juxtamembrane domain, a portion of the FGFRs associated with FRS2. Previous investigations have demonstrated the importance of FRS2 activation for mediating a sustained level of ERK activation. FRS2 is known to associate both with GRB2 and SHP2 to activate RAS. The authors utilized a mutant allele of Fgfr1, lacking the entire juxtamembrane domain (Fgfr1ΔFrs) and an allele of Fgfr2 containing two-point mutations essential for Frs2 binding (Fgfr2LR). When combining three floxed alleles and leaving only one functional allele (Fgfr1ΔFrs or Fgfr2LR) the authors got strikingly different phenotypes. When only the Fgfr1ΔFrs allele was retained, the lens phenotype matched that of deleting both Fgfr1 and Fgfr2. However, when only the Fgfr2LR allele was retained the phenotype was significantly milder, primarily affecting lens fiber cell differentiation, suggesting that something other than FRS2 might be interacting with the juxtamembrane domain to support FGFR signaling in the lens. The authors also deleted Grb2 in the lens and showed that the phenotype was similar to that of the lenses only retaining the Fgfr2LR allele, resulting a failure of lens fiber cell differentiation and decreased lens cell survival. However, mutating the major tyrosine phosphorylation site of GRB2 did not affect lens development. The authors additionally investigated the role of SHP2 in lens development by either deleting SHP2 or by making mutations in the SHP2 catalytic domain. The deletion of the SHP2 phosphatase activity did not affect lens development as severely as total loss of SHP2 protein, suggesting a function for SHP2 outside of its catalytic activity. Although the loss of Shc1 alone has only a slight effect on lens size and pERK activation in the lens, the authors showed that the loss of Shc1 exacerbated the lens phenotype in lenses lacking both Frs2 and Shp2. The authors suggest that SHC1 binds to the FGFR juxtamembrane domain allowing for the recruitment of GRB2 in independently of FRS2.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors used a variety of genetic tools to carefully dissect the essential signals downstream of FGFR signaling during lens development.</p>
<p>(2) The authors made a convincing case that something other than FRS2 binding mediates FGFR signaling in the juxtamembrane domain.</p>
<p>(3) The authors demonstrated that despite the requirement of both the adaptor function and phosphatase activity of SHP2 are required for embryonic survival, neither of these activities is absolutely required for lens development.</p>
<p>(4) The authors provide more information as to why FGFR loss has a phenotype much more severe than the loss of FRS2 alone during lens development.</p>
<p>(5) The authors followed up their work analyzing various signaling molecules in the context of lens development with biochemical analyses of FGF-induced phosphorylation in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).</p>
<p>(6) In general, this manuscript represents a Herculean effort to dissect FGFR signaling in vivo with biochemical backing with cell culture experiments in vitro.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors demonstrate that the loss of FGFR1 and FGFR2 can be compensated by a constitutive active KRAS allele in the lens and suggest that FGFRs largely support lens development only by driving ERK activation. However, the authors also saw that lens development was substantially rescued by preventing apoptosis through the deletion of BAK and BAX. To my knowledge, the deletion of BAK and BAX should not independently activate ERK. The authors do not show whether ERK activation is restored in the BAK/BAX deficient lenses. Do the authors suggest the FGFR3 and/or FGFR4 provide sufficient RAS and ERK activation for lens development when apoptosis is suppressed? Alternatively, is it the survival function of FGFR-signaling as much as a direct effect on lens differentiation?</p>
<p>(2) Do the authors suggest that GRB2 is required for RAS activation and ultimately ERK activation? If so, do the authors suggest that ERK activation is not required for FGFR-signaling to mediate lens induction? This would follow considering that the GRB2 deficient lenses lack a problem with lens induction.</p>
<p>(3) The increase in p-Shc is only slightly higher in the Cre FGFR1f/f FGFR2r/LR than in the FGFR1f/Δfrs FGFR2f/f. Can the authors provide quantification?</p>
<p>(4) The authors have not shown directly that Shc1 binds to the juxtamembrane region of either Fgfr1 or Fgfr2.</p>

Referring to Jag1 among &quot;lens-specific markers&quot; (page 5) is debatable, suggesting changing to the lines of &quot;the expected upregulation of Jag1 in lens vesicle&quot;. The Abstract could be modified to clearly convey the existing knowledge gap and the key findings of the present study. As it stands now, it is a bit all over the place. Some typos in the manuscript need to be fixed, e.g. &quot;...yet its molecular mechanism remains largely resolved&quot; - unresolved? &quot;...in the development lens&quot; - in the developing lens? In Figure 4 legend, &quot;(B) Grb2 mutants Grb2 mutants displayed...&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful and constructive feedback. We have added the caveat regarding the Le-Cre dependency on <italic>Pax6</italic> expression to the discussion, removed the reference to Jag1 as a “lens-specific marker” and corrected the typographical errors noted by the reviewer.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors demonstrate that the loss of FGFR1 and FGFR2 can be compensated by a constitutive active KRAS allele in the lens and suggest that FGFRs largely support lens development only by driving ERK activation. However, the authors also saw that lens development was substantially rescued by preventing apoptosis through the deletion of BAK and BAX. To my knowledge, the deletion of BAK and BAX should not independently activate ERK. The authors do not show whether ERK activation is restored in the BAK/BAX deficient lenses. Do the authors suggest the FGFR3 and/or FGFR4 provide sufficient RAS and ERK activation for lens development when apoptosis is suppressed? Alternatively, is it the survival function of FGFR-signaling as much as a direct effect on lens differentiation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our interpretation is that at the lens induction stage, where FGFR1 and FGFR2 are crucial, their primary function operates through Ras signaling to promote cell survival. Thus, either constitutively active <italic>KRAS</italic> or the direct suppression of apoptosis by deleting <italic>Bak</italic> and <italic>Bax</italic> is sufficient to rescue lens induction. This rescue enables the subsequent differentiation of lens progenitor cells, a process for which FGFR3 and FGFR4 are sufficient to support.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors make the argument that deleting all four FGFRs prevented lens induction but that the deletion of only FGFR1 and FGFR2 did not. Part of this argument is the retention of FOXE3 expression, αA-crystallin expression, and PROX1 expression in the FGFR1/2 double mutants. However, in Figure 1E, and Figure 1F, the staining of the double mutant lens tissue with FOXE3, αA-crystallin, and PROX1 is unconvincing. However, the retention of FOXE3 expression in the FGFR1/FGFR2 double mutants was previously demonstrated in Garcia et al 2011. Also, there needs to be an enlargement or inset to demonstrate the retention of pSMAD in the quadruple FGFR mutants in Figure 1D.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated Figure 1E with a clearer image of FOXE3 staining to better illustrate FOXE3 expression in the FGFR1/2 double mutants. It seems there may have been a misunderstanding regarding our claims about αA-crystallin and PROX1. To clarify, our observation is that both αA-crystallin and PROX1 are lost in the FGFR1/2 double mutants, which we believe is clearly demonstrated in Figure 1F. Additionally, we have added inserts to Figure 1D to highlight the retention of pSMAD.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Do the authors suggest that GRB2 is required for RAS activation and ultimately ERK activation? If so, do the authors suggest that ERK activation is not required for FGFR-signaling to mediate lens induction? This would follow considering that the GRB2 deficient lenses lack a problem with lens induction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do believe that GRB2 is required for RAS-ERK signaling activation; however, ERK activation is not absolutely required for lens induction. This conclusion is consistent with our previous study, which showed that deletion of ERK1/2 did not prevent lens induction (Garg et al. eLife 2020;9:e51915), as well as with our current findings demonstrating that the GRB2-deficient mutant is still capable of supporting lens induction.</p>

<p>(4) The increase in p-Shc is only slightly higher in the Cre FGFR1f/f FGFR2r/LR than in the FGFR1f/Δfrs FGFR2f/f. Can the authors provide quantification?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>pShc quantification is now provided in Fig. 7B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors have not shown directly that Shc1 binds to the juxtamembrane region of either Fgfr1 or Fgfr2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is not yet clear whether Shc1 directly binds to the juxtamembrane region of FGFR1 or FGFR2, as it may also be recruited indirectly. We acknowledge this as an important question that warrants further investigation in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors have used the Le-Cre strain for all of their lens deletion experiments. Previous work has documented that the Le-Cre transgene can cause lens defects independent of any floxed alleles in both homozygous and hemizygous states on some genetic backgrounds (Dora et al., 2014 PLoS One 9:e109193 and Lam et al., Human Genomics 2019 13(1):10. Are the controls used in these experiments Le-Cre hemizygotes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated in the Method section, Le-Cre only or Le-Cre and heterozygous flox mice were used as controls.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>There are only a few minor weaknesses that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>(1) The point could be made in the Discussion that since Le-Cre depends on Pax6 placodal expression, it is challenging to evaluate the impact of deletion of the four Fgfrs on the expression of Pax6 (since Pax6 needs to be activated prior to achieving Fgfr deletion). A different Cre line (e.g. a Cre which is expressed in the surface ectoderm prior to lens placode formation) could help partially address this question, although it may not be able to comment on the requirement of the Fgfrs specifically in the lens ectoderm. Thus, it will be prudent to mention this in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the caveat regarding the Le-Cre dependency on <italic>Pax6</italic> expression to the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Referring to Jag1 among &quot;lens-specific markers&quot; (page 5) is debatable, I suggest changing it along the lines of &quot;the expected upregulation of Jag1 in lens vesicle&quot;.</p>

<p>The wording has been changed as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The Abstract could be modified to clearly convey the existing knowledge gap and the key findings of the present study. As it stands now, it is a bit all over the place.</p>

<p>The abstract has been revised.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Some typos in the manuscript need to be fixed.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>My specific suggestions are shown below.</p>
<p>(1) The authors need to describe the role of Shc1 in FGF signaling and vertebrate lens development, by citing previous publications in the introduction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have detailed previous studies on the role of Shc in FGF signaling in the Introduction and discussed its function in the vertebrate lens in the Discussion section.</p>

<p>(3) Results (page 5, line 13): The authors mentioned &quot;Sox2 expression remained at basal levels&quot;. Since Figure 1B indicates that Sox2 expression fails to be upregulated in FGFR1/2 mutant lens placode in contrast to Pax6, it is better to clearly mention the failure in upregulation of Sox2 expression in the FGFR1/2 mutants.</p>

<p>This sentence has been rewritten as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Results (page 6, line 8): The authors mentioned &quot;we observed .... expression of Foxe3 in ...mutant lens cells (Figure 1E, arrows). However, Foxe3-expressing lens cells are a very small population in Figure 1E. It is important to state the decreased number of Foxe3-expressing lens cells in FGFR1/2 mutants. In addition, I would like to request the authors to show histograms indicating sample size and statistical analysis for marker expression: Foxe3 (Figure 1E), Prox1 and aA-crystallin (Fig. 1F), cyclin D1 and TUNEL (Fig. 1G) and pmTOR and pS6 (Supplementary figure 1B).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a statement indicating that the number of <italic>Foxe3</italic>-expressing cells is reduced in FGFR1/2 mutants, which is now quantified in Fig. 1H. Quantifications for Cyclin D1 and TUNEL are now shown in Fig. 1I and J, respectively. However, we chose not to quantify Prox1, αA-crystallin, pmTOR, and pS6, as the FGFR1/2 mutants showed no staining for these markers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Results (page 6, line 19- page 7, line 6): The authors showed that inducible expression of constitutive active Kras, KrasG12D, using Le-Cre, recovered lens size to the half level of wild-type control. However, in the lens of mice with Le-Cre; FGFR1/2f/f; LSL-KrasG12D, pERK was detected in the most posterior edge of the lens fiber core, whereas pERK was detected in the broader area of the lens in control. Furthermore, pMEK was detected in the whole lens of mice with Le-Cre; FGFR1/2f/f; and LSL-KrasG12D, whereas pMEK was detected only in the lens epithelial cells at the equator. So, the spatial profile of pERK and pMEK expression was different from those of wild-type, although the authors observed that Prox1 and Crystallin expression are normally induced in the lens of mice with Le-Cre; FGFR1/2f/f; LSL-KrasG12D. I wonder whether the lens normally develops in mice with Le-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D? Is the lens growth enhanced in mice with Le-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D? Please add the panels of mice with Le-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D in Figure 2B and 2C. In addition, I wonder whether apoptosis is suppressed in the lens of mice with Le-Cre; FGFR1/2f/f; LSL-KrasG12D?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we previously reported (Developmental Biology 355, 2011, 12–20), <italic>Le-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D</italic> did not lead to enhanced lens growth. While we agree that including images of <italic>Le-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D</italic> as controls in Fig. 2B and C and evaluating apoptosis in <italic>Le-Cre; FGFR1/2f/f; LSL-KrasG12D</italic> mutants would be appropriate, we regretfully no longer have these animals available to conduct these experiments.</p>
