<title>Abstract</title><p>To maintain metabolic homeostasis, enzymes must adapt to fluctuating nutrient levels through mechanisms beyond gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that human glutamine synthetase (GS) can reversibly polymerize into filaments aided by a composite binding site formed at the filament interface by the product, glutamine. Time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) confirms that glutamine binding stabilizes these filaments, which in turn exhibit reduced catalytic specificity for ammonia at physiological concentrations. This inhibition appears induced by a conformational change that remodulates the active site loop ensemble gating substrate entry. Metadynamics ensemble refinement revealed &gt;10 Å conformational range for the active site loop and that the loop is stabilized by transient contacts. This disorder is significant, as we show that the transient contacts which stabilize this loop in a closed conformation are essential for catalysis both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells. We propose that GS filament formation constitutes a negative-feedback mechanism, directly linking product concentration to the structural and functional remodeling of the enzyme.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To support the metabolic needs of a cell, enzymes must be regulated to adapt to changing nutrient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Atkinson 1965</xref>). Because these changes often occur faster than the rates of transcription/translation or degradation, this regulation is conferred allosterically by downstream metabolites or posttranslational modifications, or orthosterically via substrate availability and/or product inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mathy and Kortemme 2023</xref>). In metabolism, one common allosteric mechanism is feedback inhibition whereby downstream metabolites alter the enzymatic activity of upstream processes, typically at rate-limiting or committed metabolic nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gerhart and Pardee 1962</xref>). In classical models of allostery, this regulation is conferred through the binding of an effector molecule at a site other than the protein’s active site, known as the allosteric site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cui and Karplus 2008</xref>). Allosteric ligand binding subsequently induces or stabilizes a conformational change in the protein that can manifest at the tertiary, quaternary, and/or quinary (e.g. filamentous or other supramolecular states) level leading to the activity change observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hvorecny and Kollman 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>While many well-studied metabolic enzymes have evolved dedicated small molecule or protein allosteric binding sites as a primary means of regulation, an increasing number of soluble metabolic enzymes have been observed to adopt supramolecular, filamentous quinary structures as a mechanism for allosteric regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Noree et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Park and Horton 2019</xref>). Filament formation can confer multiple distinctive mechanisms of enzyme regulation including repression and activation, providing an alternative to synthesis/degradation to rapidly alter the balance of enzyme activity within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lynch, Kollman, and Webb 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hvorecny and Kollman 2023</xref>). Indeed, more classic small molecule binding sites can regulate enzyme filamentation and the combination of these two modes represents a rich expansion of classical allostery, integrating structural and functional changes at the level of protein assembly.</p>
<p>Here, we examine how glutamine metabolism is controlled by different potential allosteric mechanisms. Glutamine levels must be critically regulated, as it uniquely serves as both an anaplerotic donor (carbon source) and a nitrogen donor in key metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Tecson et al. 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fung, Ryu, and Thompson 2025</xref>). In addition, it is, obviously, a building block in protein biosynthesis.</p>
<p>Glutamine synthetase (GS) is an ancient enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent condensation of glutamate and ammonia to glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Eisenberg et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">de Carvalho Fernandes, Turchetto-Zolet, and Pereira Passaglia 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Tecson et al. 2025</xref>). Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in blood, where a majority originates from <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis by GS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Tecson et al. 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fung, Ryu, and Thompson 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Castegna and Menga 2018</xref>). Moreover, ammonia generated through catabolic processes is detoxified through GS-catalyzed glutamine formation. The ammonia detoxification is critically important in the brain, where loss of function GS variants cause severe developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Spodenkiewicz et al. 2016</xref>). Regulation of human GS has so far been largely described at the transcriptional or protein degradation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Eisenberg et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rigual et al. 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Castegna and Menga 2018</xref>) where GS expression is restricted to certain cell types and tissues and expressed GS can be degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system in a glutamine dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhao et al. 2025</xref>; T. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Van Nguyen et al. 2016</xref>; Thang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Van Nguyen et al. 2017</xref>; Thang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Van Nguyen 2021</xref>). However, regulation via these processes would require hours to achieve appreciable changes in intracellular GS concentrations. By contrast, multiple allosteric and feedback mechanisms have been described for bacterial GS homologs, including by filamentation in both <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Eisenberg et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Huang et al. 2022</xref>) and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Petrovska et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">He et al. 2009</xref>). These observations led us to ask how human GS activity could be regulated on the timescales required to adapt to dynamic changes in nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Here, we used a combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), enzymology, and cell proliferation assays, to discover a regulatory mechanism that incorporates both feedback inhibition and filamentation. We find that human GS forms filamentous assemblies that are stabilized by its own reaction product, glutamine. Human GS filaments display lower catalytic efficiency for ammonia, which we attribute to changes in protein flexibility surrounding the active site. We probe the importance of this change in protein dynamics with mutagenesis using enzyme activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and in HEK293 cells. Our findings support a model where product-stabilized GS filaments serve as an allosteric feedback mechanism, regulating activity through modulation of the enzyme’s conformational landscape.</p>

<title>Identification of heterogeneous oligomeric assemblies of human GS</title>
<p>To define regulatory mechanisms of GS, we first used cryoEM to examine the conformational landscape of GS. Our initial attempts at <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of GS using N-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged constructs were met with low molecular weight complex compositions by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and we observed rare, decameric 2D averages by negative-stain electron microscopy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B). However, most particles and 2D classes were distorted and this preparation did not result in a large population of the canonical decameric form observed in the X-ray structure of the identical GS construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Krajewski et al. 2008</xref>). However, scarless preparations of GS, either through N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-tag and Ulp1 cleavage during purification or C-terminal Intein-CBD-His<sub>6</sub> tag and DTT facilitated intein self-cleavage yielded pure enzyme with both decameric and higher molecular weight species observed by SEC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B). In addition to scarless preparations yielding canonical forms of GS, we found a &gt;5-fold higher <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> /<italic>K<sub>M,glutamate</sub></italic> for scarless GS, and that the His<sub>6</sub>-tagged counterpart has a decoupled reaction whose ADP-release was insensitive to ammonia concentration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). These data demonstrate a significant structural and functional impact of N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tags on GS in addition to the presence of supramolecular architectures.</p>

</fig>
<p>To investigate how differences in oligomeric state might impact the structure and function of GS, we characterized the decamer oligomeric fraction isolated by SEC by cryoEM. We observed GS to be present in decameric form, but also a resolvable population of short filament assemblies of repeating decameric units. These higher order assemblies are consistent with dynamic exchange corresponding to the distribution of SEC peaks with estimated molecular weights of ∼0.3 - 1.5 MDa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We isolated the 2-decameric/di-decameric particles from the decameric particles using 2D classification and non-heterogeneous refinement and reconstructed a high resolution map with FSC 0.143 of 2.38 Å (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Decamers are rotated relative to each other by ∼26 degrees. The minimal five-fold filament interface formed consists of K52, C53, and E55 of adjacent monomers from different decamers. No obvious connecting cryoEM density is observed in the apo map. E) Bifunctional crosslinking with Bis-sulfosuccinimidyl glutarate (BSG; top) or bis-maleimoethane (BMOE; bottom) to covalently attached adjacent primary amines (K52) or cysteines (C53) respectively followed by SDS-PAGE reveals crosslinked species only in the wild-type GS protein sample, but not K52A or C53A indicating presence and disruption of filament formation respectively.</p>
<p>The filament was composed of two decamers (“2-decamer”) bound to each other in a ‘head-to-head’ configuration with one decamer rotated ∼26° to the next (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The decamer-decamer (filament) interface is five-fold symmetric and made up of residues K52, C53, and E55 contributed by both monomeric subunits across the interface. Interestingly, K52 also participates in a binding interface between GS and bestrophilin2 ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Owji et al. 2022</xref>). We observed little to no density at the interface despite the stable relative orientation of both decamers to each other (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These data suggest that the formation of the interface is concentration dependent and driven primarily by electrostatic interactions. Alternatively, the interface could be largely solvent-mediated or be connected by a ligand(s) that occupy only some of the 5 symmetry related interfaces. In both scenarios, any signal is likely to be averaged out and experiments with symmetry expansion and focused classification did not yield any convincing density.</p>
<p>To test the importance of the interface, we used homo-bifunctional crosslinking to probe the contributions of individual contacts. The 2-decameric map suggests that only one pair of lysine residues (K52:K52) and one pair of cysteine residues (C53:C53) are surface exposed and within &lt;10Å across two monomers. To ensure a stringent selection for only K52 and C53 we used either the 7.7Å spacer-arm bifunctional NHS-ester crosslinker (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) glutarate or BSG) or the 8.0Å spacer-arm biofunctional maleimide crosslinker (bismaleimidoethane or BMOE). Crosslinking of two monomers by either crosslinker was observed in the wild-type enzyme and more prevalent at higher enzyme concentrations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). However, mutation of either K52 or C53 to alanine ablated the crosslinking reactivity and did not support filament formation as assessed by negative stain EM (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Together these data support the 2-decameric filament interface assignment whose formation is concentration dependent and driven primarily by electrostatic interactions.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Glutamine stabilizes larger GS filaments</title>
<p>The interface defined by the 2-decameric assembly and the presence of higher molecular weight species in the SEC trace suggested that larger filaments of GS can readily form. Next, we wanted to understand what functional consequence may be conferred by filamentation in human GS. We asked if GS filament formation could be retained under turnover conditions and impact the catalytic function of GS. CryoEM is an ideal tool to investigate structural changes to macromolecules under turnover conditions because substrates can be added to the enzyme immediately before vitrification freeze-quenching to preserve the sample in a near-native context (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Turnover conditions were induced by adding saturating concentrations of substrates immediately prior to vitrification, with reaction times totalling between 49 and 59s initiated by manual mixing prior to blotting. Our initial grid screening of GS under turnover conditions identified filaments at lower GS concentrations (0.1 mg/mL) than we observed for apo GS. Initial reconstruction of these screening data revealed two new structural features in the GS filament: defined EM density between both decamers and missing density for the active site loop region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Given that the only sample preparation differences between the apo-GS datasets and the turnover conditions was the addition of substrates that are converted to products prior to vitrification, we hypothesized that one or multiple substrates (ATP, glutamate, and ammonium) or products (glutamine, PO<sub>4</sub>, and ADP) may be responsible for this additional density. However, at this initial low resolution we could not assign a compound at this interface nor understand if an interface-bound compound had any conformational impact on active site geometry.</p>

<caption><title>Glutamine binds to GS filaments at the interface.</title>
<p>A) Establishment of steady state conditions prior to vitrification with GS at low concentration (0.15 mg/mL) revealed presence of 2-decameric species (red arrows) in addition to decameric species (blue arrows) during cryoEM grid screening. Initial reconstruction of the turnover 2-decameric map demonstrated clear density connecting decamers (red dotted circle) not previously observed in the apo-filament map and loss of E305-loop density (black dotted circle). B) Time-resolved cryoEM demonstrates linear relationship between glutamine and filament formation assessed by independently processing five datasets and quantifying the fraction of decamer and filament present (see Methods) and plotted against the vitrification quench time of the reaction. C) cryoEM screening data demonstrating robust filament seeding from addition of ATP and glutamine to human GS prior to vitrification. D) Turnover-filament 3D reconstruction demonstrates similar overall architecture to apo-filament map (left) but with clear density between decamers with glutamine modeled which forms hydrogen bonds with K52, C53, and E55 (right). E) Steady-state ammonia kinetic constants for wild-type, K52A, and C53A with and without 10 mM glutamine added to reaction to stimulate filament formation. Errors were calculated as S.E.M. from global fitting and were propagated through each Michaelis-Menten parameter (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Equations 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">4</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 8 replicates) see Methods.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="663231v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To discriminate whether the additional filament density corresponded to product or substrate, we performed a time-resolved (tr-)cryoEM experiment. We collected five turnover cryoEM datasets that differed only in the vitrification-quench time of the steady-state reaction with reaction times between 57s and 517s corresponding to high substrate and high product respectively (see methods for details) at a fixed concentration of enzyme (0.3 mg/mL). To understand if there was a trend in the particle populations between the decamer/filament compositions as a function of reaction time, we compared the number of particles in decameric versus filamentous states by 2D classification (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). The same template picking parameters were applied for each tr-cryoEM dataset and 2D classification was performed twice; once with each time-point dataset processed independently and once where all particles were combined and the dataset identity only revealed after 2D classification particle classes were picked (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). We then normalized decamer and filament particle picks to the total number of picked particles (excluding 2D classes that could not be assigned either a decamer or filament) and plotted these as a function of reaction time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The positive linear correlation between fraction of particles in a filament-like assembly and reaction time suggests that a product of the forward reaction of GS acts to stabilize the filament assembly. Subsequent screening with high concentrations of glutamine revealed large &gt;4 decameric unit filament assemblies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that product formation has a positive effect on filament assembly.</p>
<p>To define how products stabilized the GS filament assembly, we next determined a high resolution structure of the filaments imaged under turnover conditions. We performed an additional cryoEM experiment with increased GS concentration (1.5 mg/mL), to bias our particle populations towards filamentous assemblies, and vitrified at 57s, a reaction time that should yield a high concentration of product due to the higher enzyme concentration than previous experiments. The resulting 3D reconstruction of the 2-decameric species had an FSC 0.143 of 2.2Å (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7A</xref>).</p>
<p>Inspection of the ‘filament assembly’ interface between the two decamers revealed a discrete density that was absent from the apo-filament reconstruction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The density is too small for a nucleotide (ATP or ADP) and too large for inorganic phosphate (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref>). Given the association with product formation, we modeled glutamine into this density in a conformation consistent with forming hydrogen bonds that link the filament interface residues and the bound product. The two-fold symmetry at this interface and the averaging inherent in our data processing results in density that likely reflects contributions from glutamine in two orientations. In addition, we note two potential, and not mutually exclusive, reasons we were able to observe filaments in the apo enzyme. First, we used high concentrations of GS, which likely shifts the equilibrium towards the filament form even in the absence of glutamine. Second, there may be a small, unresolved, amount of glutamine that persists during purification that occupies only a minor fraction of interfaces per di-decamer. As discussed above, such contributions would be averaged out during map refinement in the scheme we have used here. Taken together, these data support a model wherein glutamine synthetase filamentation generates a composite binding site for glutamine at the filament interface, which is located over 10Å from the active site.</p>

<title>Glutamine stabilized filaments have lower catalytic efficiency for ammonia</title>
<p>We next examined the functional consequences of GS filamentation on enzymatic activity. To assess steady-state kinetic differences between decameric and filamentous compositions of GS, we assayed different isotropic peak fractions resolved by SEC immediately after separation. We found k<sub>cat</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> for all substrates were completely in agreement between the decamer and 2-decamer fractions at 0.01 mg/mL for wild-type, K52A, and C53A (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). However, this enzyme concentration is 30-fold dilute compared to typical cryoEM conditions and the 2-decameric fraction significantly decomposed into decamer, as assessed by mass photometry (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9A</xref>). Upon increasing enzyme concentration to 0.1 mg/mL, which is within the range of our cryoEM experiments (0.3 mg/mL for all datasets except where indicated) and shown to support filamentation by chemical crosslinking (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), we uncovered a subtle, 2-fold K<sub>M,</sub> <sub>ammonia</sub> defect for the 2-decamer fraction compared to the decamer fraction for wild-type GS (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9B</xref>).</p>
<p>To probe this defect in K<sub>M</sub> further, we took the decameric fraction at 0.1 mg/mL and repeated steady-state assays in the presence or absence of the glutamine concentration used to stabilize filamentation by CryoEM (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). The presence of glutamine increased <italic>K<sub>M,</sub> <sub>ammonia</sub></italic>three-fold for WT, but had smaller effects for the mutations at the interface that directly interact with the ligand (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Given the incomplete filament formation observed in our cryoEM experiments, with a maximum filament formation of ∼50% at 0.3 mg/mL concentration (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), the effective <italic>K<sub>M,</sub> <sub>ammonia</sub></italic> defect upon filamentation is likely at least 2-fold higher than measured.

<p>To understand the structural basis underlying the <italic>K<sub>M,</sub> <sub>ammonia</sub></italic> defect, we inspected the interactions of active site residues and loops for differences across the oligomeric forms of GS. The GS active site forms a bifunnel shape with ATP gaining access to one subsite with glutamate and ammonia accessing the other subsite (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The glutamate/ammonia binding site is gated by a flexible loop that bears two key catalytic residues: R299, which interacts with glutamate substrate carboxyl group, and E305, which is predicted to deprotonate ammonium ions to ammonia, enabling the required nucleophilic attack of the y-glutamyl phosphate intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Owji et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Krajewski et al. 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Previously, crystal structures of human GS revealed a closed loop conformation in the presence of the transition state inhibitor methionine sulfoximine (PDB 2QC8). However, this loop exhibited weak electron density in the ADP-bound state (PDB 2OJW), which potentially indicates mobility of this element throughout the catalytic cycle.</p>
<p>Given the importance of this loop in gating glutamate and ammonia access to the active site, we examined how the E305-loop conformation and dynamics varied upon filament formation and substrate identity. All maps had similar resolution range (FSC<sub>0.143</sub> between 1.95 - 2.27Å) and showed defined secondary structure and amino acid side chains in helix-12 (266-288) and beta sheet-11 (313-316) on either side of the loop at similar density contours (<bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 11). The apo-filament cryoEM map showed well resolved density for the E305-loop with clear side chains, which support building an atomic model in a conformation we call the “closed-active state” (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Loop conformational heterogeneity was also influenced by nucleotide state, as the filament map with ATP only displayed partial density (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). By contrast, the filament map collected during turnover displayed almost no density in the region, which is indicative of a greater degree of disorder. However, the E305-loop was partially restored in the cryoEM map of the turnover-decamer map (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This observation implicates the E305-loop conformational distribution as a potential factor contributing to the observed impaired kinetics of GS filaments. Taken together the E305-loop is sensitive to nucleotide state and also by filament state under turnover conditions.</p>
<p>The changes in density for the loop results from conformational heterogeneity that is ‘averaged out’ upon reconstruction. To provide an atomistic model of the conformational space explored by the E305-loop, we used Bayesian inference to balance experimental cryoEM data with accurate physico-chemical molecular dynamics as implemented in EMMIVox ensemble refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hoff et al. 2024</xref>). Across different conditions, the conformation of the loop was dominated by the closed-active loop conformation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). However, the turnover-filament model displays distended loop conformations diverged from the active-closed state that we turn collectively as the ‘open ensemble’ of loop conformations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The E305-loop (residues 299 - 311) sampled a more diverse ensemble (with root mean square fluctuation values of greater than 10Å) in the turnover filament state, with the turnover decamer and apo-filament displaying reduced variability (<bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 12). By contrast, across all states, the remainder of the active site maintained similar fluctuations (<bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 12).</p>
<p>We next examined the principal contacts that serve to stabilize the ‘active closed’ state of the loop (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D,E</xref>). We observe multiple residue contacts that appear stabilizing including a hydrophobic pocket formed by L300, I285, and I309, a salt-bridge formed between R298 and D239, and a hydrogen bond between H304 and N249 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D,E</xref>). All these interactions displayed favored distances in the decamer-turnover compared to filament turnover ensembles. A major consequence of this increased loop mobility is that Arg299 can “invade” the active site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). We quantified the distance distribution between R299 and E136 in our turnover-decamer and turnover-filament ensembles and found a substantial bias towards R299 infiltration of the active site in the filament ensemble that is absent in the turnover decamer ensemble (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). The conformation of Arg299 could potentially sterically hinder substrate access to the active site and thus contribute synergistically with loop mobility to the observed <italic>K<sub>M,</sub> <sub>ammonia</sub></italic> defect. Collectively, these results suggest that biasing of conformational distribution of the loop is important for tuning activity in GS.</p>

<title>Global conformational change coordinates E305-loop dynamics</title>
<p>We next asked what conformations or structural features underlie these changes to E305-loop conformational space and how filament formation promotes an ‘open ensemble’. Utilizing our EMMIVox refined models as a starting point, we assessed global conformational changes between the turnover-filament and turnover-decamer structures that might influence the local conformation of the loop. First, we found a rotational conformational change (1.2°) apparent about the pentamer-pentamer interface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Given that this conformational change could impact the local conformation at each composite active site by altering monomeric interfaces we explored how this global conformational change related to the overall conformation of each monomer. We observed a ‘crimping’ conformational change per monomer where in the filament structure the β-grasp domain and the catalytic domain are rotated towards each other and away from their respective active sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>We next sought to define the regions within each monomer most altered upon filament formation by performing a Cα-distance matrix subtraction analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; <bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 13). As expected, the E305-loop conformational heterogeneity dominated this analysis, however, we also observed an ∼2Å shift in the tip of the β-grasp domain (residues 70-76) and helix-8 which abuts the active site and immediately precedes the E305-loop (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; <bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 13). We found the largest Cα-distance change between these two regions, specifically, between N74 and E263 displaying a distance change of 2.05Å (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Finally, to understand how prevalent this global conformational change is we quantified this Cα-distance in the full turnover-filament and turnover-decamer ensembles and found persistent distance distribution changes of ∼2Å between these two ensembles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, we propose that this global conformational change serves to influence E305-loop conformational distribution via two primary mechanisms via helix 8 repositioning away from the active site in the filament form which: 1) hinders E305-loop ability to completely close over the ammonia binding site (residues S66, S67, and D76;(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,C</xref>) and 2) disfavors E305-loop contacting closed-state stabilizing residues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D,E</xref>).</p>

<title>E305-loop conformational space is crucial for Michaelis-complex formation</title>
<p>Since all ensembles, including the apo-filament, could sample both the ‘active closed’ and ‘open-ensemble’ states, we next pursued mutagenesis to more directly test the importance of the loop flexibility on catalysis. We created alanine mutants of residues D239, R298, L300, I309, H304, and E305. Each of these residues reside on the E305-loop with the exception of D239 which participates in a salt-bridge interaction with R298 on the loop. E305 was chosen to be an active site control, which does not appear to stabilize the closed state of the loop, but rather, the closed state of the loop positions E305 near the proposed ammonia binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Moreira, Ramos, and Fernandes 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Issoglio et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Frieg et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>We measured the steady-state Michaelis-Menten parameters of all variants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The E305A variant principally impacted <italic>K<sub>M,</sub> <sub>ammonia</sub></italic> (∼10 fold) as would be expected from this residue’s predicted role of deprotonating ammonium ions in preparation for nucleophilic attack.

<p>The <italic>K<sub>M,</sub> <sub>ammonia</sub></italic> was impacted but generally less so than <italic>K<sub>M,</sub> <sub>glutamate</sub></italic> in E305-loop variants. This result likely due to the use of saturating glutamate concentrations required to estimate <italic>K<sub>M,</sub> <sub>ammonia</sub></italic> where the majority of active sites are glutamate bound, or y-glutamyl phosphate formed, which will have had already promoted the closed-active loop state via amino acid carboxylate-R299 interaction, thus restricting the potential scope of loop conformational variability. Even with such a presumed stabilization, the full Michaelis-complex formation is still impacted for the final ammonia substrate binding which is likely a consequence of the biased conformational state of the E305-loop. Taken together, these data indicate that mutations outside the active site to the E305-loop stabilizing interactions have large impacts to the <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> for substrates that bind to half-active sites gated by the loop. These mutations do not have pronounced effects to the overall <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> however, indicating that while Michaelis-complex formation is hindered, the rate-limiting step of catalysis is unimpacted.</p>
<p>To test the model that loop biasing impacts <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> values for GS, we structurally characterized the decameric form of loop variant R298A under turnover conditions. The final reconstruction yielded an overall map of FSC<sub>0.143</sub> of 1.95 Å with high local resolution values across the map (<bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 14). Importantly, this map, despite being the highest global resolution map reconstructed, did not display any appreciable E305-loop density (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), similar to the turnover filament (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).

<title>Loop variants are unable to support glutamine auxotrophy</title>
<p>Since our data suggested that altering loop dynamics via mutation or filamentation could alter <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>, we next wanted to test the effect of perturbing the loop on the overall cellular activity of GS. Most human cells require exogenous glutamine to support growth in tissue culture unless they express GS. Indeed, GS expression has been used as an auxotrophic marker for antibody production HEK293E GLUL-/- cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yu, Lee, and Lee 2018</xref>). Starting from this auxotrophic HEK293E GLUL -/- cell line, we used CRISPR to introduce an attP landing pad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Matreyek, Stephany, and Fowler 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Matreyek et al. 2020</xref>), to facilitate stable cell line generation expressing individual GS variants. To create each mutant line, we transfected with Bxb1 and cognate attB GLUL variant DNA. GS variants were then overexpressed from a pTet promoter driven by doxycycline and tested for growth in the presence and absence of glutamine supplementation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>)</p>
<p>Glutamine prototrophy of this cell line was confirmed as high cell proliferation was observed for wild-type GS in glutamine deplete media while there was a lack of survival for a variant bearing a premature stop codon inserted at P242 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). We assessed glutamine auxotrophy for GS filament interface variants C53A and K52A (<bold>Supplementary</bold> Figure 15). As expected, in the HEK293 model, both variants supported glutamine auxotrophy to similar levels as wild-type. This system is not likely to be sensitive to the feedback inhibition mediated by filamentation to reduce glutamine production as ammonia levels in HEK293 cells typically exceed those levels seen in healthy tissues by up to 100-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rajendra et al. 2011</xref>).

The <italic>K<sub>M,</sub> <sub>glutamate</sub></italic>for R298A and L300A are outside the normal steady state concentrations of intracellular glutamate, suggesting that loop conformational control of the Michaelis-complex can occur in the cell to directly impact metabolic flux through GS.</p>

<p>GS is an ancient enzyme that is found in all domains of life as it serves a critical crossroads between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Given its centrality to numerous metabolic pathways, GS is subject to sophisticated intracellular regulation across the domains of life. E305-loop flexibility has been noted in x-ray crystallographic structures of human GS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Krajewski et al. 2008</xref>) and in other homologs too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Tecson et al. 2025</xref>) supporting a model of functional flexibility of this structural element. The most well studied is type I-beta GS (GSIB) found in gram negative bacteria which contains a ‘regulatory loop’ that abuts the E305-loop at the active site. The regulatory loop can be covalently adenylated by a bifunctional enzyme that is sensitive to glutamine levels and adenylation inhibits GS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Eisenberg et al. 2000</xref>). Given our demonstration of the importance of maintaining optimal E305-loop flexibility in human GS, it is perhaps unsurprising that a large post-translational modification applied to a regulatory loop of GSIB could have a dramatic functional impact. The E305-loop thus is likely a hotspot for GS regulation via multiple distinct routes across evolution.</p>
<p>Here, we observe a connection between the filamentation and E305-loop flexibility. There is evidence that GS homologs from bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes also form a filamentous, head-on-head structure, but their structural and functional consequences are incompletely understood. In E. coli, GS filaments could be formed from supraphysiological levels of select divalent cations that are chelated by adjacent helices across repeating dodecamer units. While high structural resolution was achieved, the catalytic and cellular consequences of filament formation were not explored. Furthermore, E. coli filaments dissolved under turnover conditions leaving the functional relevance unclear. By contrast, in S. cerevisiae, GS filaments were demonstrated to negatively regulate GS activity in the cell and shown to be a crucial adaptation upon starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Petrovska et al. 2014</xref>). Here, we provide a structural rationale describing how filament formation, stabilized by product, can structurally alter GS E305-loop to tune the substrate-limiting Michaelis constant for ammonia. Thus, the glutamine stabilized filament formation model for human GS represents a new mode of product-based allosteric feedback inhibition for this enzyme class.</p>
<p>Human GS is expressed in many tissues to serve different metabolic needs. Translation and subsequent degradation of GS can take multiple hours to achieve robust expression changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arad, Freikopf, and Kulka 1976</xref>; T. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Van Nguyen et al. 2016</xref>; Thang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Van Nguyen et al. 2017</xref>; Thang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Van Nguyen 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhao et al. 2025</xref>) which is potentially insufficient to meet the changing metabolic needs of a given cell. Therefore, regulated enzyme activity through filament formation represents a mode of high temporal control over enzyme activity as it is not reliant on transcription, translation, or degradation of enzymes. Additionally, the Michaelis constant for ammonia report herein (57 μM for decameric GS and 170 μM for filamentous GS) corresponds closely to the concentrations of ammonia measured in cells, which suggests that this modulation of GS activity could have an immediate impact on intracellular turnover rates.</p>
<p>Moreover, our observations support the concept that allostery operates through ensemble redistribution rather than through discrete conformational switches. The filament state of human GS does not simply toggle the E305-loop between rigidly defined “open” and “closed” states, but rather shifts the probability distribution across a spectrum of conformations that collectively impact enzyme activity. This is similar to observations in IMPDH2 and PRPS filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hvorecny et al. 2023</xref>; M. C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Johnson and Kollman 2020</xref>), where assembly modulates the conformational landscape accessible to regulatory elements. Both loop dynamics and filamentation are frequently implicated in tuning activity of enzymes; here a product feedback mechanism links these two concepts together. Collectively, the filament formation of human GS described here is a complex manifestation of ensemble-based allostery to enable timely regulation of enzyme activity.</p>

<title>Details of EMMIVox Simulations</title>
<p>Refined single-structure models and structural ensembles of the GS in the apo-filament, turnover filament, and turnover decamer forms were generated using EMMIVox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hoff et al. 2024</xref>). In brief, EMMIVox is a Bayesian inference approach to determine single-structure models and structural ensembles from 3D cryoEM maps. The direct utilization of experimental cryoEM density and 3D half-maps in the Bayesian framework of EMMIVox automatically balances experimental information with accurate physico-chemical models. Both single structure refinement and ensemble modelling followed the standard EMMIVox protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hoff et al. 2024</xref>). CryoEM maps for each GS system and their associated half-maps were pre-processed prior to EMMIVox simulations. Correlated voxels within the experimental 3D maps were removed. This was achieved by first selecting all voxels within 3.5 Å of the model and removing correlated data points with a correlation greater than a pearson coefficient threshold of 0.8. Next, the difference between voxel density for the two half-maps of each system were used to generate a lower bound for the error parameter associated with each density voxel in the EMMIVox framework. Equilibration and production simulations were performed as follows. First, each system was energy minimized using the steepest gradient descent approach. Next, a 10 ns long NPT equilibration was performed using the Bussi-Donadio-Parrinello thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bussi, Donadio, and Parrinello 2007</xref>) and Berendsen barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berendsen et al. 1984</xref>) set at 300K and 1 atm respectively. Next, 2 ns long NVT simulations were formed using the same thermostat at 300K. Positional restraints were applied to the NPT and NVT equilibration simulations. Next, an optimal scaling factor between the predicted and observed cryoEM maps was determined using the NVT equilibration simulation trajectory and the PLUMED <italic>driver</italic> tool. Scaling factor values between 0.5 and 1.8 were scanned at 0.05 intervals, with the scaling factor resulting in the lowest EMMIVox hybrid energy score selected for use in the production simulations. B-factors for each chain in the GS were optimized independently without the use of symmetry constraints.</p>
<p>Single-structure refinement production simulations were performed in the NVT ensemble using the thermostat conditions of the NVT equilibration run. Each GS system studied was simulated for 10 ns, with B-factor values sampled every 500 MD steps and a maximum MC move of 0.05 nm<sup>2</sup>. To optimize performance, the EMMIVox hybrid energy was calculated every 4 MD timesteps. After single-structure refinement, the conformation with the lowest EMMIVox hybrid energy and the associated B-factor values were extracted. This structure was then energy minimized while the B-factor values were simultaneously sampled using a modified MC sampler allowing only downhill moves. Any discontinuities in the final structure obtained from the energy minimization due to the PBC were then fixed using the PLUMED <italic>driver</italic> tool. We then generated a PDB of the final refined structure and optimized B-factor values. These models represent the final refined single-structure models of each GS system.</p>
<p>EMMIVox ensemble simulations were performed using the same settings as in the single-structure refinement, with the exception of the B-factors, which were fixed, for all residues, at the lowest value obtained from single-structure refinement as a measure of background noise. 20 metainference replicas were used for each system, with each replica run for 20 ns, resulting in 400 ns of total simulation time per system.</p>

Kernel density estimation plots were done using a bandwidth adjustment value equal to 1. Histograms plots were calculated using 150 bins.</p>

<p>This manuscript employs cryo-EM, mutational analysis, and biochemical assays to explore the molecular basis by which glutamine promotes filamentation and regulates the activity of human glutamine synthetase (hGS) by stabilizing interactions between hGS decamers. The studies supporting this mechanism are <bold>solid</bold>, but could be improved by providing more clarity and by addressing methodological issues in the cryoEM data processing workflow. This work will be of particular interest and <bold>useful</bold> to groups interested in understanding the molecular basis of nutrient sensing, cellular metabolism, and structural regulation of enzyme activity.</p>

<p>The authors set out to resolve the high-resolution structure of a glutamine synthetase (GS) decamer using cryo-EM, investigate glutamine binding at the decamer interface, and validate structural observations through biochemical assays of ATP hydrolysis linked to enzyme activity. Their work sits at the intersection of structural and functional biology, aiming to bridge atomic-level details with biological mechanisms - a goal with clear relevance to researchers studying enzyme catalysis and metabolic regulation.</p>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses of methods and results:</p>
<p>A key strength of the study lies in its use of cryo-EM, a technique well-suited for resolving large, dynamic macromolecular complexes like the GS decamer. The reported resolutions (down to 2.15 Å) initially suggest the potential for detailed structural insights, such as side-chain interactions and ligand density. However, several methodological limitations significantly undermine the reliability of the results:</p>
<p>(1) Cryo-EM data processing: The absence of critical details about B-factor sharpening - a standard step to enhance map interpretability - is a major concern. For high-resolution maps (&lt;3 Å), sharpening is typically applied to resolve side-chain features, yet the submitted maps (e.g., those in Figures 1D, 2D, and supplementary figures) appear unprocessed, with density quality inconsistent with the claimed resolutions. This makes it difficult to evaluate whether observed features (e.g., glutamine binding) are genuine or artifacts of unsharpened data.</p>
<p>(2) Modeling and density consistency: The structural models, particularly for glutamine binding at the decamer interface, do not align with the reported resolution. The maps shown in Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure S7 lack sufficient density to confidently place glutamine or even surrounding residues, conflicting with claims of 2.15 Å resolution. Additionally, fitting a non-symmetric ligand (glutamine) into a symmetry-refined map requires justification, as symmetry constraints may distort ligand placement.</p>
<p>(3) Biochemical assay controls: While the enzyme activity assays aim to link structure to function, they lack essential controls (e.g., blank reactions without GS or substrates, substrate omission tests) to confirm that ATP hydrolysis is GS-dependent. The use of TCEP, a reducing agent, is also not paired with experiments to rule out unintended effects on the PK/LDH system, further limiting confidence in activity measurements.</p>
<p>Achievement of aims and support for conclusions:</p>
<p>The study falls short of convincingly achieving its goals. The claimed high-resolution structural details (e.g., side-chain densities, ligand binding) are not supported by the provided maps, which lack sharpening and show inconsistencies in density quality. Similarly, the biochemical data do not robustly validate the structural claims due to missing controls. As a result, the evidence is insufficient to confirm glutamine binding at the decamer interface or the functional relevance of the observed structural features.</p>
<p>Likely impact and utility:</p>
<p>If these methodological gaps are addressed, the work could make a meaningful contribution to the field. A well-resolved GS decamer structure would advance understanding of enzyme assembly and ligand recognition, while validated biochemical assays would strengthen the link between structure and function. Improved data processing and clearer reporting of validation steps would also make the structural data more reliable for the community, providing a resource for future studies on GS or related enzymes.</p>
<p>Additional context:</p>
<p>Cryo-EM has transformed structural biology by enabling high-resolution analysis of large complexes, but its success hinges on rigorous data processing and validation steps that are critical to ensuring reproducibility. The challenges highlighted here are not unique to this study; they reflect broader issues in the field where incomplete reporting of methods can obscure the reliability of results. By addressing these points, the authors would not only strengthen their current work but also set a positive example for transparent and rigorous structural biology research.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors propose a product-dependent negative-feedback mechanism of human glutamine synthetase, whereby the product glutamine facilitates filament formation, leading to reduced catalytic specificity for ammonia. Using time-resolved cryo-EM, the authors demonstrate filament formation under product-rich conditions. Multiple high-quality structures, including decameric and di-decameric assemblies, were resolved under different biochemical states and combined with MD simulations, revealing that the conformational space of the active site loop is critical for the GS catalysis. The study also includes extensive steady-state kinetic assays, supporting the view that glutamine regulates GS assembly and its catalytic activity. Overall, this is a detailed and comprehensive study. However, I would advise that a few points be addressed and clarified.</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure 7, the extra density observed between the two decamers does not appear to have the defining features of a glutamine. A less defined density may be expected given the nature of the complex, but even though mutagenesis assays were performed to support this assignment, none of these results constitutes direct and conclusive evidence for glutamine binding at this site. I would thus suggest showing the density maps at multiple contour thresholds to allow readers to also better evaluate the various small molecules under turnover conditions that cannot be well fitted based on this density map, helping to provide a more balanced interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>(2) On the same point regarding the density for the enzyme under turnover conditions, more details should be provided about the symmetry expansion and classification performed, and also show the approximate ratio of reconstructions that include this density. Did you try symmetry expansion followed by focused classification, especially on the interface region?</p>
<p>(3) The interface between the two decamers of the model needs to be double-checked and reassigned, especially for the residues surrounding the fitted glutamine. For example, the side chain of the Lys residue shown in the attached figure is most likely modeled incorrectly.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the summary and noting of the strengths. We agree that the evolutionary divergence of metabolic feedback in GS homologs is a fruitful avenue for future studies. With regard to the weaknesses, the di-decamer in the absence of glutamine only forms under high (higher than physiological) concentrations of enzyme. Our primary evidence for the mutant behavior was the lack of crosslinking (Figure 1E), with supplementary support from the negative stain. In the revised version we will soften the language to say “reduced” rather than “did not support” filament formation.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We disagree with the reviewer’s overall assessment.</p>
<p>With regard to sharpening and resolution: we examined sharpened maps and in a revised version will present additional supplementary figures showing these maps side by side. We note that the resolutions reported are global and that the most interesting features are, of course, in the periphery and subject to conformational and compositional heterogeneity. We will include supplementary figures of core side chain densities that are more like what are expected by the reviewer in the revision.</p>
<p>With regard to modeling: the apo filament and turnover filament datasets were handled nearly identically. The additional density is therefore likely not artefactual to the symmetry operator - however, the lower resolution in this region noted by the reviewer is worthy of further exploration. The maps are public and we think this is the most plausible interpretation of the density, which we based primarily on the biochemical data and will include more speculation in the version.</p>
<p>With regard to the biochemical controls: we point the reviewer to Figure S1, which shows that omission of ammonia or glutamate in the wild-type (tagless) system removes any coupling of the reactions. We will perform the additional controls to publication quality in the revised version along with the TCEP control. We note that the reducing agent is present across all experiments, ruling out an effect on any specific result. The inclusion of TCEP is also very standard in other published uses of the Coupled ATPase assay (e.g. PMID: 31778111 and PMID: 32483380 by our first author)</p>

<p>(1) In Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure 7, the extra density observed between the two decamers does not appear to have the defining features of a glutamine. A less defined density may be expected given the nature of the complex, but even though mutagenesis assays were performed to support this assignment, none of these results constitutes direct and conclusive evidence for glutamine binding at this site. I would thus suggest showing the density maps at multiple contour thresholds to allow readers to also better evaluate the various small molecules under turnover conditions that cannot be well fitted based on this density map, helping to provide a more balanced interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>(2) On the same point regarding the density for the enzyme under turnover conditions, more details should be provided about the symmetry expansion and classification performed, and also show the approximate ratio of reconstructions that include this density. Did you try symmetry expansion followed by focused classification, especially on the interface region?</p>
<p>(3) The interface between the two decamers of the model needs to be double-checked and reassigned, especially for the residues surrounding the fitted glutamine. For example, the side chain of the Lys residue shown in the attached figure is most likely modeled incorrectly.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the feedback. As noted above, we will include supplemental figures that show maps at multiple thresholds and sharpening schemes. We noted in the manuscript and above that our interpretation here is based on integrating biochemical evidence alongside the density and will make that even more clear in the revised manuscript. The filaments +/- the putative glutamine density were processed nearly identically, but we will attempt various schemes of focused classification/symmetry expansion in the revision as well. However, we point out that there is extensive averaging there that makes modeling a bit trickier than expected given the global resolution.</p>
