<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR) and (full-length) prolactin (PRL) receptor (PRLR) are transmembrane class I cytokine receptors that co-exist in various normal and cancerous cells. Both receptors respond to their associated ligands predominantly by activating the Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways, and both are also known to initiate receptor-specific JAK2-independent signaling. Together with their cognate ligands, these receptors have been associated with pro-tumorigenic effects in various cancers, including breast cancer (BC). Human GH is known to bind GHR and PRLR, while PRL can only bind PRLR. A growing body of work suggests that GHR and PRLR can form heteromers in BC cells, modulating GH signal transduction. However, the dynamics of PRLR and GHR on the plasma membrane and how these could affect their respective signaling still need to be understood.</p>
<p>To this end, we set out to unravel the spatiotemporal dynamics of GHR and PRLR on the surface of human T47D breast cancer cells and γ2A-JAK2 cells. We applied direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) and quantified the colocalization and availability of both receptors on the plasma membrane at the nanometer scale at different time points following treatment with GH and PRL. In cells co-expressing GHR and PRLR, we surprisingly observed that not only GH but also PRL treatment induces a significant loss of surface GHR. In cells lacking PRLR or expressing a mutant PRLR deficient in JAK2 binding, we observed that GH induces downregulation of cell surface membrane-bound GHR, but PRL no longer induces loss of surface GHR. Colocalizations of GHR and PRLR were confirmed by proximity ligation (PL) assay.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that PRLR-GHR interaction, direct or indirect, is indispensable for PRL- but not GH- induced loss of surface GHR and for both GH-induced and PRL-induced increase of surface PRLR, with potential consequences for downstream signaling. Furthermore, our results suggest that JAK2 binding via the receptor intracellular domain’s Box1 element is crucial for the observed regulation of one class I cytokine receptor’s cell surface availability via ligand-induced activation of another class I cytokine receptor. Our findings shed new light on the reciprocal and collective role that PRLR and GHR play in regulating cell signaling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) are hormones emanating mainly from the anterior pituitary. The primary function of GH is regulating anabolism and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], while PRL has important roles in breast development and lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. There is mounting evidence pointing at both hormones and their receptors playing roles in various types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], including breast cancer (BC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], where GHR is frequently present and PRLR is often found overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. While they have been mostly associated with pro-tumorigenic effects, PRL has also been reported to show anti-tumor effects and, like PRLR, has been associated with good prognosis in certain BC subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. However, a humanized neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of PRLR showed no anti-tumor effect when administered in patients with PRLR-positive metastatic BC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. This suggests that PRLRs’ pro-tumorigenic function may not be as relevant as previously thought or depends on other circumstances such as the presence or absence of other hormone receptors, with which they may interact.</p>
<p>Both GH receptor (GHR) and PRL receptor (PRLR) are structurally similar transmembrane glycoproteins and belong to the class I cytokine receptor superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. As is characteristic of the majority of their superfamily members, both receptors contain a proline-rich Box1 motif in the membrane-proximal region of their intracellular domains (ICDs), which is followed by a short inter-box region, and a less conserved Box2 motif that is rich in acidic and aromatic residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. For both receptors different isoforms have been identified: GHR has three additional isoforms two of which are created through alternative splicing events and lack the Box1-Box2 motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] and the third is the exon 3 deleted GHR (d3-GHR). Aside from the PRLR long (or full length) isoform (LF), other membrane-bound isoforms have been identified, including a long form lacking domain D1 (ΔS1), an intermediate form (IF), and the short forms S1a, S1b, and S1c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. All isoforms except for S1b and S1c contain the Box1-Box2 motif, but S1b and S1c still contain the Box1 motif. If not specifically stated otherwise, we will refer here by default to the receptors’ full-length (or long) isoforms.</p>
<p>GH can bind and introduce a conformational change to both GHR and PRLR, allowing receptor activation and downstream signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], but, unlike GH, PRL can only bind to PRLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Both GHR and PRLR lack intrinsic kinase activity. Following ligand binding, downstream signal transduction involves predominantly activating the associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), bound to the receptors’ Box1 elements. This is followed by phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5a and STAT5b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], although other receptor-specific JAK2-independent signal transduction pathways may also be activated. Of note, JAK2 is not only activating the canonical JAK2- STAT5 pathway, but it can also signal via STAT1 and STAT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] and activate non-canonical kinase pathways such as Ras/Raf/MAPK/ERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] and PI3K/Akt/mTOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>], as well as influence gene expression through histone modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Moreover, activation of PRLR downstream pathways is isoform-specific, with the short isoforms activating the MAPK and PI3K pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. For comprehensive reviews of JAK2-independent signaling pathways, we refer the reader to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>].</p>
<p>Increasing evidence indicates that GHR and PRLR interact. Two decades ago, it was shown that ovine GHR (oGHR) and PRLR (oPRLR) can tightly associate with each other following stimulation with placental lactogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. These studies utilized chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular domain (ECD) of human granulocyte and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) receptor (hGM-CSFR) along with a part of either oGHR ICD or oPRLR ICD. After hGM-CSF treatment of cells co-expressing oGHR chimera and oPRLR chimera, JAK2 was effectively activated, and protein-protein interaction of both chimeric receptors was detected via co-immunoprecipitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Additionally, our previous work revealed a specific ligand-independent human GHR (hGHR) - human PRLR (hPRLR) association in human T47D breast cancer cells, which endogenously express both receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Further, the use of split luciferase complementation assays has suggested that hGHR homodimers and hPRLR homodimers form hGHR/hPRLR multimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] and extracellular subdomain 2 of the hGHR or hPRLR determines the dimerization partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. Although biochemical studies and luciferase complementation assays strongly support the notion that an interplay between hGHR and hPRLR exists, the observed outcomes are ascribed to total receptors within cells, irrespective of subcellular localization.</p>
<p>In the present study, we directly visualized the cell surface interaction of hGHR and hPRLR and how it changes upon ligand treatment. Specifically, we used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>] to visualize single receptor clusters of hGHR and hPRLR on cell surfaces. In dSTORM, a super-resolution microscopy technique, individual fluorophores cycle through reversible transitions between a dark and a fluorescent state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. Thus, a fluorophore emits photons multiple times before permanently being photobleached. These blinking events and their localizations are recorded and, although the exact number of proteins in clusters is difficult to determine, the number of localizations is strongly correlated with the number of receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. Thus, the dSTORM approach can deliver high-resolution images to reveal the localization or arrangement of individual membrane receptor systems providing valuable insight into their interactions with other proteins at the cell surface. Given that receptors are highly trafficked to and from the cell surface and to avoid signal detection from cytosolic receptors, we used monoclonal antibodies to distinctly label the extracellular S2 domain of GHR and PRLR on non-permeabilized cells. Descriptive spatial analysis using Ripley’s K- and L-function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>] indicates that both hGHR and hPRLR are organized in nanometer-scale clusters on the T47D cell surface. To further gain quantitative information about GHR and PRLR nanoclusters, we applied DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. Subsequently, individual cluster contours were delineated, individual clusters were assigned a cluster ID, and receptor abundance was analyzed separately for each cluster and receptor. By doing so, we detected and calculated homomeric and heteromeric hGHR and hPRLR clusters on cell surfaces. Colocalizations of GHR and PRLR were also confirmed by proximity ligation (PL) assay. Lastly, we explored which receptor domains determine the interaction of hGHR and hPRLR by creating different truncated or modified hPRLR variants. Our findings indicate that the intracellular Box1 region is an essential determinant of hGHR and hPRLR association, suggesting JAK2 may play an important role in the observed ligand-induced and PRLR-mediated downregulation of cell surface GHR – which could also elicit or add to PRLR’s observed anti-tumor effect.</p>

<title>Ligands induce an increase in PRLR localizations and a decrease in GHR localizations at the surface of T47D cells</title>
<p>To investigate the dynamic spatial distribution of endogenous hGHR and hPRLR on the surface of breast cancer cells, we used dSTORM under the total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) illumination mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. The dSTORM images show that hGHR and hPRLR form nanometer-scale clusters and are broadly distributed on the surface of T47D cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To assess the ligands’ effects on the spatial distribution of hGHR and hPRLR on the cell surface, we conducted time-course experiments using T47D cells with human GH or human PRL (500 ng/ml each). Such stimulation is known to induce rapid and substantial STAT5 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. We first analyzed the cell surface localization density (number of localizations per μm<sup>2</sup>) of hGHR or hPRLR in both resting and ligand-stimulated conditions. The abundance of surface-hPRLR was rapidly increased, reaching its maximum after 3 min of GH or PRL treatment with a ∼5.6-fold and ∼4.5- fold increase compared to the basal value, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). This increase was followed by a rapid decline: after GH treatment for 5 min, the localization density dropped from 200.6 ± 14.7 per μm<sup>2</sup> to 57.2 ± 3.6 per μm<sup>2</sup>; after PRL treatment for 5 min, the density fell from 159.4 ± 16.2 per μm<sup>2</sup> to 94.8 ± 16.0 per μm<sup>2</sup>. In contrast to hPRLR, the density of hGHR significantly decreased from 43.3 ± 5.5 per μm<sup>2</sup> basally to 25.8 ± 2.7 per μm<sup>2</sup> after 3min of GH stimulation. After 5 min and 10 min of GH stimulation, the density of hGHR remained relatively low at 26.6 ± 2.3 per μm<sup>2</sup> and 19.3 ± 1.5 per μm<sup>2</sup>, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Surprisingly, PRL, which does not bind to hGHR, also induced a loss of surface hGHR on T47D cells. After 1 min of PRL treatment, only 36% of hGHR remained on the cell surface compared to the basal state, and hGHR density remained low for at least 10 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). A schematic illustration of GH- and PRL- induced hGHR and hPRLR density changes is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>. We previously observed that hGHR and hPRLR specifically co-immunoprecipitate in the absence of added ligands in T47D cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]; thus, we postulate that the propensity of hGHR and hPRLR to physically interact underlies our observed loss of hGHR in response to PRL stimulation.</p>

<title>GH or PRL stimulation induces a redistribution of hGHR and hPRLR clusters</title>

<p>To gain a better understanding of the changes in GHR-PRLR colocalizations, we obtained and analyzed the corresponding bivariate cluster size distributions. Their median values are summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>. As can be seen, hGHR responds quickly and transiently to GH stimulation by forming larger clusters. After GH treatment for 1 min, the median number of hGHR blinking events in a cluster reaches its peak and amounts to 85.6 ± 20.9 localizations in comparison with 33.3 ± 1.7 localizations per cluster in the basal state (P value = 0.0035). After 5 min, this number is reduced approximately to its pre-stimulation value (29.1 ± 2.2) but appears to continue to fluctuate for at least another 25 minutes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). In turn, hPRLR responds to GH in a less prominent manner: The median number of hPRLR blinking events in a cluster in the basal state is 16.5 ± 0.7. After 3 min of GH stimulation, the median of PRLR cluster size reaches its maximum, which is 22.5 ± 3.9 (P value = 0.1496), and afterward declines to its basal level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Like the response to GH, hGHR reacts also quickly to PRL treatment. The median number of hGHR blinking events in a cluster culminates at 1 min of PRL treatment with 45.8 ± 5.0 (compared with basal level, P value = 0.0098). In distinction, hPRLR response to PRL is slower. The median number of hPRLR blinking events in a cluster reaches its peak at 5 min of PRL treatment with a median number of 23.3 ± 2.8 (compared with basal level, P value = 0.0233), and after 10 min the median is only slightly less than that maximum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Together, these results indicate that upon ligand stimulation hGHR cluster sizes increase transiently and significantly, while changes of hPRLR cluster sizes occur slowly and more subtly.</p>

<title>Spatial proximity of hGHR and hPRLR upon ligand stimulation</title>
<p>Nanoscale interactions of hGHR and hPRLR on the cell surface have yet to be well established. To evaluate the extent of hGHR and hPRLR surface colocalization on T47D cells, we utilized proximity ligation assays (PLAs). In PLAs, a positive signal appears only when two target proteins are in proximity (&lt;40 nm). Notably, individual treatment with GH or PRL for 5 min decreased the PLA signal observed in untreated cells by 34.4% and 28.1%, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), suggesting either ligand caused a reduction in the total number of colocalized hGHR and hPRLR clusters. To further validate these observations, we calculated the ratio of colocalized clusters in dSTORM images. Treatment with GH or PRL for 1 min reduced the proportion of colocalized clusters by nearly 50% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). To analyze their compositions, we plotted 3D distributions for the colocalized clusters after ligand treatments (Fig. S1A and S1B). The probability of observing co-localized clusters with numbers of hGHR and hPRLR that fall into certain bins is identified by color and by the height of the bar on the z-axis. Following GH treatment for 1 min and 3 min, the number of smallest clusters decreased, and the number of medium-sized clusters increased, suggesting a shift of the bivariate distribution of co-localized cluster sizes toward medium-sized clusters (Fig. S1A). The distribution of colocalized clusters after 5 min of GH treatment is similar to that at the basal state. In contrast, after treatment with PRL for 3 min or more, the number of medium to large-sized clusters, majoritarily containing either GHR or PRLR, decreased, while the number of smallest clusters increased (Fig. S1B). Together, these results demonstrate that hGHR and hPRLR are spatially accessible to each other and form receptor complexes on the T47D cell surface and that the nature of these complexes changes differentially depending on the stimulating ligand.</p>

<title>Reduction of hGHR induced by PRL on the cell surface is dependent on the presence of PRLR</title>
<p>PRL strongly binds PRLR but not GHR. Yet, PRL induces a decrease of hGHR on the surface of cells expressing both hGHR and hPRLR. Thus, we sought to investigate the effect of PRL on hGHR in the absence of hPRLR. We utilized CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate hPRLR knockout T47D cells (termed T47D<sub>ΔPRLR</sub>). In addition, to evaluate isolated hPRLR responses to ligands, we also generated hGHR knockout T47D cells (termed T47D<sub>ΔGHR</sub>). Immunoblot analysis with specific GHR and PRLR antibodies confirmed the absence of hPRLR in T47D<sub>ΔPRLR</sub> cells and hGHR in T47D<sub>ΔGHR</sub> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Similar to our results with parental T47D cells, GH treatment of T47D<sub>ΔPRLR</sub> cells rapidly reduces the density of surface hGHR, suggesting that hPRLR need not be present to allow this GH-induced effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). However, contrary to findings in parental T47D cells, PRL treatment of T47D<sub>ΔPRLR</sub> cells fails to modulate hGHR surface density (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Like parental T47D cells, treatment of T47D<sub>ΔGHR</sub> cells with GH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>) or PRL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>) yielded increased hPRLR surface localizations. Thus, we conclude that the PRL-induced decrease of hGHR in T47D cells is dependent on the presence of hPRLR, but the ability of both GH and PRL to increase surface hPRLR in T47D cells is independent of hGHR’s presence.</p>

<p>To extend our observations, we next examined the GH and PRL responses in a cellular reconstitution system: γ2A-JAK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>] is a human JAK2-deficient fibrosarcoma cell line reconstituted with JAK2 that stably expresses JAK2 but lacks hGHR and hPRLR. To independently study the role of each receptor in this setting, we used our previously generated stable transfectants of γ2A-JAK2 cells that harbor either hGHR or hPRLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>] and verified the presence of the indicated receptor by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Consistent with the observation in T47D<sub>ΔPRLR</sub> cells, γ2A-JAK2-hGHR cells responded with a loss of surface hGHR density to GH stimulation but not to PRL stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Interestingly, as in T47D<sub>ΔGHR</sub> cells, treatment of γ2A- JAK2-hPRLR cells with either GH or PRL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>) promotes increased surface hPRLR. Thus, our findings in both cell systems suggest that hPRLR-hGHR interaction, direct or indirect, is indispensable for PRL-induced but not for GH-induced loss of surface hGHR.</p>

<title>Box 1 region in hPRLR contributes to PRL-induced cell surface GHR downregulation</title>
<p>The hPRLR-dependent PRL-induced downregulation of cell surface hGHR indicates that hPRLR can modulate the density of hGHR on the cell surface in response to PRL. To investigate this interaction, we generated a set of truncation or deletion mutants of hPRLR: (1) hPRLR-tr292, which truncates the intracellular domain of hPRLR distal to the membrane-proximal intracellular domain box 1 element; (2) hPRLR-tr238, which contains only 4 amino acids (aa) of the proximal intracellular domain and does not include box 1; and (3) hPRLR-Δbox1, in which the box 1 region (243aa-251aa) is internally deleted (shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Expression of hPRLR-tr292, hPRLR-tr238, and hPRLR-Δbox1, as well as wild-type hPRLR, was detected by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies targeting the ECD of PRLR (mAb<sub>ext-1.48</sub>). Since hPRLR-tr238 contains only 4 aa in its ICD, no immunoblot signal was detected using a polyclonal antibody (Ab<sub>AL-84</sub>) targeting the hPRLR ICD. In contrast, the expression of hPRLR-tr292 was easily detected by Ab<sub>AL-84</sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). We then transiently transfected each hPRLR construct into the γ2A-JAK2-hGHR cells, which stably express hGHR, and analyzed the changes of cell surface hGHR localizations. In cells expressing wild-type hPRLR (hPRLR-WT), the localizations of hGHR significantly decreased 3 min post-exposure to GH and PRL (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Similarly, under the same treatment, in cells expressing hPRLR-tr292, the localization of hGHR on the cell membrane was reduced in response to each ligand (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). However, in hPRLR-tr238- expressing cells, the localization of hGHR was diminished by GH stimulation but slightly increased by PRL stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). To further investigate the role of the box1 region for hGHR and hPRLR functional interaction, we studied hPRLR-Δbox1 expressing cells and found that upon PRL treatment, hGHR localizations did not decrease on the cell surface (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). As a negative control, we transfected the cells with vector (pcDNA3.1). hGHR localization decreased upon GH stimulation but remained at basal levels upon PRL stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). In addition, in hPRLR-ΔBox1 and hGHR expressing cells, the JAK2 and STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation levels were assessed in response to GH and PRL stimulations. Treatment of 500ng/ml GH induces a dramatic increase in both JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation. In contrast, 500ng/ml PRL treatment does not cause JAK2 or STAT5 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>), consistent with PRLR Box1 being required for effective coupling of PRL occupancy of PRLR to activation of JAK2 and phosphorylation of STAT5 and the inability of PRL to signal via GHR.</p>

<p>From our observations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), we concluded that the JAK2 binding site, i.e., the box 1 region, in hPRLR is required for PRL-induced hGHR down-regulation from the cell surface.

For a detailed description of the buffer, we refer the reader to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>].</p>
<p>The cell membrane was focused using TIRF excitation, which selectively images within 100-150 nm of the cell membrane, making it an excellent method to study surface distribution of membrane proteins. Of note, TIRFM exploits the unique properties of an induced evanescent field in a limited specimen region immediately adjacent to the interface between two media having different refractive indices. It thereby dramatically reduces background by rejecting fluorescence from out-of-focus areas in the detection path and illuminating only the area right near the surface.</p>
<p>Moreover, we reduced auto-fluorescence by ensuring that (a) cells are grown in phenol-red-free media, (b) imaging is performed in STORM buffer which reduces autofluorescence, and (c) our immunostaining protocol includes a quenching step aside from using blocking buffer with different serum, in addition to BSA (5%). Moreover, we employed extensive washing steps following antibody incubations to eliminate non-specifically bound antibodies. Ensuring that the TIRF illumination field is uniform helps reduce scatter. Additionally, an extended bleach step prior to the acquisition of frames to determine localizations helped further reduce the probability of non-bleached fluorescent molecules.</p>
<p>For dual color STORM imaging, the sample was illuminated with alternating 561 nm or 647 nm lasers and 40,000 frames of images were acquired per channel (9ms/frame). The chromatic offset associated with the different acquisition wavelengths was corrected using 0.1 μm microspheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>]. Imaging captured the fluorophores’ blinking events. Localizations were counted as true localizations, when at least 5 consecutive blinking events had been observed. Moreover, coordinates were filtered using a threshold radius of 25nm. dSTORM images were reconstructed using the built-in STORM module in NIS-Elements (Nikon). Nikon software was used for Gaussian fitting, and each dot represents the peak of a Gaussian. The localizations list was exported and further analyzed in <italic>Matlab</italic>. In particular, for the DBSCAN cluster analysis, we employed Clus-DoC directly on the list of localizations, utilizing the parameters of a minimum of 4 neighbors within a cluster radius of 20nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>].</p>

<title>Generating hGHR knockout and hPRLR knockout T47D cells</title>
<p>We utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to generate T47D<sub>ΔPRLR</sub> and T47D<sub>ΔGHR</sub>. Two single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and Cas9 nickase (Cas9n) were designed to create sticky-end double-strand breaks in DNA at the targeted locus, triggering DNA repair via the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEL) pathway, which introduces insertions, deletions or frameshift mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>]. Each sgRNA was expressed using plasmid #62987 pSpCas9n(BB)- 2A-Puro(PX462) V2.0 (purchased from Addgene), which also expressed Cas9n when transfected into cells. Two vectors, built on pSpCas9n(BB)-2A-Puro(PX462) V2.0 backbone, containing a pair of sgRNAs targeting either the hGHR or hPRLR gene for knockout, as well as a built-in Cas9n gene, were transfected into newly purchased T47D cells. The transfected cells were plated at serial dilutions and selected with puromycin. Single clones were picked and expanded. The vector backbone pSpCas9n(BB)-2A-Puro(PX462) V2.0 was also used for transfection into T47D cells as a control cell line.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA was extracted from each clone. Primers were designed 200-400 bp upstream and downstream of the targeted locus of the hGHR or hPRLR gene to amplify the genomic DNA via PCR, which was subsequently cloned into the pUC19 vector for sequencing. Clones with mutations on both alleles were identified, and the western blot was used to confirm the absence of expression of the targeted genes.</p>

<title>Design of sgRNAs for hGHR or hPRLR knockout</title>
<p>A pair of 20 bp sequences located 10-25 bp apart at the target locus was chosen using the Feng Zhang lab’s Target Finder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>]. This tool identified the best pair of guide RNA sequences with theoretically zero off-target effects. One sequence targeted the top strand, and the other targeted the bottom strand, enabling the introduction of a sticky-end double-strand DNA break. Each guide RNA sequence was synthesized as double-stranded oligonucleotides with a CACC at 5’ overhand of the 20-nt guide sequence and an AAAC at the 5’ overhand of the complementary strand, allowing insertion into the backbone plasmid pSpCas9n(BB)-2A-Puro(PX462) V2.0 using the Bbsl restriction enzyme. An extra nucleotide ‘G’ was added to the 5’ end of the 20-nt guide if the sequence did not begin with ‘G’, which is the preferred first base following the U6 RNA Polymerase III promoter.</p>
<p>The target locus for introducing mutations in the hGHR gene was located at exon 4. Exon 4 was chosen because many naturally occurring pathological mutations in Laron Syndrome are located in this region. Additionally, deletion of the 3’ end of exon 4 and its adjacent intron has been shown to successfully generate GHR knockout mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>]. The hPRLR gene has seven isoforms; exon 5 is included in six of these isoforms, except for the ΔS1 PRLR isoform, in which both exons 4 and 5 are skipped by alternative splicing. Therefore, we selected the end of exon 5 and the adjacent intron as the target locus for introducing mutations. The goal was to knock out all six isoforms containing exon 5, as well as the ΔS1 PRLR isoform, by interrupting alternative splicing. This was achieved by deleting the initial GU dinucleotide sequence at the 5’ end of the intron, which is required for the binding of the U1 protein of the spliceosome.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The non-ligand-bound states of hGHR and hPRLR have been extensively investigated. Pre-homodimerization of hGHR and hPRLR has been reported using structural and biochemical methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>]. At the same time, a recent study supports the notion that GHR, at physiological densities, exists as monomers on the cell surface and becomes activated by a ligand-induced dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>]. The current study uses a highly precise and sensitive single-molecule localization microscopy approach to study the formation of hGHR and hPRLR nanoclusters and the cell surface receptor availability. Our super-resolution images reveal that in human T47D breast cancer cells and the γ2A-JAK2 cell exogenous expression system, the cluster size of hGHR and hPRLR in the basal state range from a few localizations per cluster up to a thousand localizations per cluster.</p>
<p>With GH or PRL treatment, the number of hGHR on both T47D and γ2A-JAK2 cell surfaces is decreased, indicating the removal of surface hGHR. Moreover, the distribution curve of hGHR shifts toward larger cluster sizes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting a ligand-induced aggregation of receptors. In turn, hPRLR numbers dramatically increase on the cell surface in response to ligand stimulation. The newly presented hPRLR clusters may impact the distribution of cluster sizes, which may explain why the median of hPRLR cluster sizes does not change much with ligand treatment.</p>
<p>Our PL assay data indicate that distances between hGHR and hPRLR are small (less than 40nm). This implies that hGHR and hPRLR form co-localized clusters in unstimulated states, suggesting hGHR and hPRLR are physically accessible to one other. With GH stimulation, the fraction of co-localized receptors is decreased. Given that GH treatment enhances the coimmunoprecipitation of total cellular hGHR and hPRLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>], the decrease in co-localized surface receptors can likely be attributed to removing co-localized receptors from the cell surface.</p>
<p>It is well documented that hPRLR is engaged by both PRL and GH, while hGHR only responds to GH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Unexpectedly, we found that PRL induces a down-regulation of cell surface hGHR in cells that co-express hGHR and hPRLR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), indicating that hPRLR directly or indirectly interacts with hGHR. Interestingly, PRL was unable to induce hGHR down-regulation in cells either lacking hPRLR or expressing hPRLR without its Box1 region (hPRLR-tr238 or hPRLR-ΔBox1), suggesting that JAK2 and PRLR association is required for hGHR-hPRLR interaction that in turn allows PRL-induced downregulation of cell surface hGHR. Notably, previous work showed that GHR and JAK2 association is necessary for JAK2 to stabilize cell surface GHR and inhibit constitutive GHR down-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>]. Furthermore, single-particle tracking studies showed that, in the presence of JAK2, a higher level of ligand-induced dimerization of GHR was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>]. Moreover, JAK2 with intact kinase activity is required for GH-induced GHR down-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>]. Similarly, the box1 region of PRLR also associates with JAK2, and deletion or modulation of the last proline residue of box1 abrogates PRLR function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>]. Collectively, these findings suggest that the box1 regions in hGHR and hPRLR play a crucial role in the transduction of the individual signaling cascades and hGHR-hPRLR association.</p>
<p>Here we found that, in the resting state, the degree of hGHR-hPRLR colocalization is higher in cells expressing hPRLR with the box1 motif. This suggests JAK2 may not only stabilize GHR but also support the formation of hGHR-hPRLR-containing clusters. Previously, it has been suggested that such clusters are comprised of hGHR homodimers and hPRLR homodimers that together form (hGHR-hGHR) – (hPRLR- hPRLR) hetero-multimers or higher order oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Indeed, because the intracellular domains (ICD) of both hGHR and hPRLR are highly disordered, the flexibility of their ICDs may provide room for recruiting JAK2 and stabilizing the hGHR-hPRLR association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref>]. Moreover, a study of the crystal structure of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and leptin receptor (LEPR), which also belong to the class I cytokine receptor family, revealed recently that JAK2/EPOR and JAK2/LEPR complexes contained four JAK2 and four EPOR or LEPR molecules, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>]. Hence, it is possible that hGHR-hGHR homodimers and hPRLR-hPRLR homodimers form complexes in a similar fashion (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). We propose that this JAK2/Box1-mediated interaction of receptors is not limited to hGHR and hPRLR but may generalize to other receptors of the class I cytokine receptor family. We note, however, that determinants within particular receptors (perhaps residing in their extracellular and/or transmembrane domains) and their intracellular JAK2 association domains may facilitate, to varying degrees, their propensity to form multimeric aggregates. GHR and PRLR, for example, may tend to do so more avidly with each other than either one does with other cytokine receptors. Additional studies are required to determine and understand the modes and functions of the hGHR-hPRLR association.</p>

<p>An obvious question is to what extent our observed regulation is biologically relevant. While our work does not provide an answer to this question, one could argue that, generally speaking, such a mechanism could provide a means for crosstalk and feedback between the two cytokine receptors and allow for a more fine-tuned signaling response. In particular high levels of PRL could reduce GH signaling thereby prioritizing PRL’s function over GHR-mediated growth processes. PRLR’s ability to modulate GHR cell surface availability might also contribute to tissue-specific responses to hormonal signals. For instance, in situations with high PRL levels in circulation such as during lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref>], downregulation of mammary gland cell surface GHRs could prevent GH from counteracting PRL’s effects. Also, PRL and GH have important roles in metabolism, often with opposing effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref>]. PRL promotes lipogenesis and energy storage, while GH promotes lipolysis and energy mobilization. By downregulating GHRs, PRL could shift the metabolic balance in favor of energy storage. Moreover, this regulation may also have disease implications: hPRL/hPRLR-mediated downregulation of cell surface hGHR could be a relevant factor in the observed anti-tumor effect of PRLR signaling, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) expressing PRLR but lacking other interfering hormone receptors. As previously shown, the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB- 231 and MDA-MB-453 show significantly increased GHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] while expressing no or only endogenous levels of PRLR, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. PRL treatment significantly decreased cell viability and invasive capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells following the restoration of PRLR expression. In MDA-MB-453 cells, PRL caused a significant reduction in cell viability. A xenograft model with inoculated MDA-MB-453 cells confirmed the growth inhibitory effect of PRL treatment <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting PRLR expression as an indicator of a favorable prognosis. However, several studies have reported the contrary, namely that PRL promotes breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], presenting a conundrum that so far has not been resolved. Among the observations supporting a role of PRL in promoting breast cancer are: (1) frequent PRLR overexpression in BC tissues, (2) association of elevated (serum) PRL with increased BC risk – in particular for estrogen receptor (ER) positive BC – and increased risk for metastatic progression from epidemiologic data, and (3) PRL stimulation modulating the cytoskeleton and inducing motility of human breast cancer cells (including T47D) in vitro, which has been associated with mammary carcinoma progression in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Of note, our hypothesis of PRL-mediated down-regulation of GHR presence on the cell surface being protective does not mean that other effects cannot also be involved or cancel this positive effect out. Moreover, timing could be a decisive element: while PRL might have a protective effect (depending on other factors) at the time of tumorigenesis, it may actually facilitate BC metastasis. But given the lack of experimental data indicating a clear protective effect through Jak2-mediated receptor interactions in PRLR+ GHR+ BC at any BC stage, our hypothesis remains speculative.</p>
<p>Besides, observations in MCF-7, a human breast cancer cell line, where binding of PRL causes internalization and downregulation of PRLR expression seem to contradict our observations in T47D cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref>]. Recently, a competition between two kinases (JAK2 and LYN) for binding hGHR at the box1-box2 region was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref>], indicating that hGHR nanocluster formation at the cell membrane is regulated also by kinases. It is conceivable that similar kinase-dependent competition mechanisms could regulate also PRLR cell surface availability. Thus, differences in cells’ expression of such kinases could then play a role in the perceived inconsistency. Moreover, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref>] focuses on the downregulation of the long PRLR isoform in response to PRL, while all other isoforms were undetectable in MCF-7 cells. So, this and other differences between the cell lines may be the reason for the perceived contradiction.</p>
<p>We note that a limitation of our study is the focus on T47D and γ2A-JAK2 cells. It remains to be seen, if we can observe and replicate the same effect also in other cell lines, for instance mammary epithelial cells or other hGHR+ PRLR+ cancer cell lines. Also, the roles of the different membrane PRLR isoforms have not been fully addressed and our study lacks isoform specific data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. The anti-PRLR antibody that we used does not only recognize the long form PRLR but also the intermediate form and the short forms, all of which have ECDs. All these forms contain the box1 motif. Importantly, form S1b is almost identical to hPRLR-tr292, but behaves similarly to LF (i.e. our hPRLR WT) in terms of normalized GHR cell surface localization and PRLR co-localization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). So, while we do not have experimental confirmation, we would expect that these other isoforms behave somewhat similarly to LF with respect to GHR surface membrane interactions – while still inducing different downstream effects as well as playing different roles in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref>].</p>
<p>As part of future research, we plan to study the observed effect in cell lines other than T47D. We would also like to investigate if the mechanism is PRLR-GHR specific, or if there are other cytokine receptors that can interact in a similar asymmetric, ligand-dependent manner, such that one regulates the other receptor’s surface availability. Importantly, we would like to elucidate any biological relevance of the observed effect, analyze roles and consequences of PRLR isoforms, and investigate our hypothesis that PRLR-mediated downregulation of cell surface GHR contributed to the anti-tumoral effect of PRL treatment in PRLR-positive TNBC.</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study that characterizes a surprising interaction between two different cytokine/hormone receptors using nanoscale resolution (dSTORM) microscopy. The study provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence that the interaction is ligand-dependent, and is mediated by the receptor-associated intracellular signalling molecule JAK2. While at present limited to growth hormone and prolactin receptors in a limited number of cell lines, there are potentially broad implications for cytokine signalling, as such JAK2-mediated interactions could occur between a range of different cytokines. Moreover, the specific hormone interactions shown in the manuscript may have significant implications for understanding how these hormones can have differential effects in breast cancer, under different conditions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors are interested in the relative importance of PRL versus GH and their interactive signaling in breast cancer. After examining GHR-PRLR interactions in response to ligands, they suggest that a reduction in cell surface GHR in response to PRL may be a mechanism whereby PRL can sometimes be protective against breast cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the study include the interesting question being addressed and the application of multiple complementary techniques, including dSTORM, which is technically very challenging, especially when using double labeling. Thus, dSTORM is used to analyze co-clustering of GHR and PRLR, and, in response to PRL, rapid internalization of GHR and increased cell surface PRLR. Conclusions from Proximity ligation assays are that some GHR and PRLR are within 40 nm (≈ 4 plasma membranes) of each other and that upon ligand stimulation, they move apart. Intact receptor knockin and knockout approaches and receptor constructs without the Jak2 binding domain demonstrate a) a requirement for the PRLR for there to be PRL- driven internalization of GHR, and b) that Jak2-PRLR interactions are necessary for stability of the GHR-PRLR colocalizations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although improved over the first version, the manuscript still suffers from a lack of detail, which in places makes it difficult to evaluate the data and would make it very difficult for the results to be replicated by others.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>Points for improvement of the manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) There is still insufficient detail about the proximity ligation assay. For example, PLAs that use reagents from Sigma (as now reported) require primary antibodies from two different species and yet both the anti-PRLR and anti-GHR used for dSTORM were mouse monoclonals. On line 356 it says that the ECD antibodies were used for microscopy and the PLA is microscopy. Were instead the ICD antibodies used for the PLA? If so, how do we know that one or more of the proteins in the very strong &quot;non-specific&quot; bands seen on Figure 5A are not what is being localized? Could you do a Western blot of just cell membrane proteins? There needs to be further clarity/explanation.</p>
<p>(2) Although the manuscript now shows a Western blot using the antibodies against intracellular regions of the receptor, a full Western blot is not provided for the antibodies against the S2 extracellular domain used for the dSTORM. While I haven't checked the papers showing characterization of the anti-GHR, I did re-check reference 70, which the authors say shows full characterization of the PRLR antibody, and this does not show a full Western (only portions of gels). How do we know that this antibody is not recognizing some other cell surface molecule, the surface expression of which increases upon stimulation of the cells with PRL? Is there only one band when blotting whole cell extracts with either the GHR or PRLR ECD antibodies so we can be sure of specificity? Figure S2 helps some, but these are different cells and the relative expression of the PRLR versus some other potential cell surface protein in these engineered cells may well be completely different.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The questions after reading this manuscript are what novel insights have been gained that significantly go beyond what was already known about the interaction of these receptors and, more importantly, what are the physiological implications of these findings? The proposed significance of the results in the last paragraph of the Discussion section is speculative since none of the receptor interactions have been investigated in TNBC cell lines. Moreover, no physiological experiments were conducted using the PRLR and GH knockout T47D cells to provide biological relevance for the receptor heteromers. The proposed role of JAK2 in the cell surface distribution and association of both receptors as stated in the title was only derived from the analysis of box 1 domain receptor mutants. A knockout of JAK2 was not conducted to assess heteromers formation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. The novel insight is that two different cytokine receptors can interact in an asymmetric, ligand-dependent manner, such that one receptor regulates the other receptor’s surface availability, mediated by JAK2. To our knowledge this has not been reported before. Beyond our observations, there is the question if this could be a much more common regulatory mechanism and if it has therapeutic relevance. However, answering these questions is beyond the scope of this work.</p>
<p>Along the same line, the question regarding the biological relevance of our receptor heteromers and JAK2’s role in cell surface distribution is undoubtfully very important. Studying GHR-PRLR cell surface distributions in JAK2 knockout cells and certain TNBC cell lines as proposed by the reviewer could perhaps be insightful. However, most TNBCs down-regulate PRLR [1], so we would first have to identify TNBC cell lines that actually express PRLR at sufficiently high levels. Moreover, knocking out JAK2 is known to significantly reduce GHR surface availability [2,3], such that the proposed experiment would probably provide only limited insights.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our team is currently not in the position to perform any experiments (due to lack of funding and shortage of personnel). However, to address the reviewer’s comment as much as possible, we have revised the respective paragraph of the discussion section to emphasize the speculative nature of our statement and have added another paragraph discussing shortcoming and future experiments (see revised manuscript, pages 23-24).</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Except for some investigation of γ2A-JAK2 cells, most of the experiments in this study were conducted on a single breast cancer cell line. In terms of rigor and reproducibility, this is somewhat borderline. The CRISPR/Cas9 mutant T47D cells were not used for rescue experiments with the corresponding full-length receptors and the box1 mutants. A missed opportunity is the lack of an investigation correlating the number of receptors with physiological changes upon ligand stimulation (e.g., cellular clustering, proliferation, downstream signaling strength).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. While we are confident in the reproducibility of our findings, including those obtained in the T47D cell line, we acknowledge that testing in additional cell lines would have strengthened the generalizability of our results. We also recognize that performing a rescue experiment using our T47D hPRLR or hGHR KO cells would have been valuable. Furthermore, examining physiological changes, such as proliferation rates and downstream signaling responses, would have provided additional insights. Unfortunately, these experiments were not conducted at the time, and we currently lack the resources to carry them out.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) An obvious shortcoming of the study that was not discussed seems to be that the main methodology used in this study (super-resolution microscopy) does not distinguish the presence of various isoforms of the PRLR on the cell surface. Is it possible that the ligand stimulation changes the ratio between different isoforms? Which isoforms besides the long form may be involved in heteromers formation, presumably all that can bind JAK2?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very good point. We fully agree with the reviewer that a discussion of the results in the light of different PRLR isoforms is appropriate. We have added information on PRLR isoforms to the Introduction (see revised manuscript, page 2) and Discussion sections (see revised manuscript, pages 23-24).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Changes in the ligand-inducible activation of JAK2 and STAT5 were not investigated in the T47D knockout models for the PRL and GHR. It is also a missed opportunity to use super-resolution microscopy as a validation tool for the knockouts on the single cell level and how it might affect the distribution of the corresponding other receptor that is still expressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for his comment. We fully agree that such additional experiments could be very valuable. We are sorry but, as already mentioned above, this is not something we are able to address at this stage due to lack of personnel and funding. However, we do hope to address these and other proposed experiments in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Why does the binding of PRL not cause a similar decrease (internalization and downregulation) of the PRLR, and instead, an increase in cell surface localization? This seems to be contrary to previous observations in MCF-7 cells (J Biol Chem. 2005 October 7; 280(40): 33909-33916).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It has been recently reported for GHR that not only JAK2 but also LYN binds to the box1-box2 region, creating competition that results in divergent signaling cascades and affects GHR nanoclustering [1]. So, it is reasonable to assume that similar mechanisms may be at work that regulate PRLR cell surface availability. Differences in cells’ expression of such kinases could perhaps play a role in the perceived inconsistency. Also, Lu et al. [2] studied the downregulation of the long PRLR isoform in response to PRL. All other PRLR isoforms were not detectable in MCF-7 cells. So, differences between MCF-7 and T47D may lead to this perceived contradiction.</p>
<p>At this stage, we can only speculate about the actual reasons for these seemingly contradictory results. However, for full transparency, we are now mentioning this apparent contradiction in the Discussion section (see page 23) and have added the references below.</p>

<p>(6) Some figures and illustrations are of poor quality and were put together without paying attention to detail. For example, in Fig 5A, the GHR was cut off, possibly to omit other nonspecific bands, the WB images look 'washed out'. 5B, 5D: the labels are not in one line over the bars, and what is the point of showing all individual data points when the bar graphs with all annotations and SD lines are disappearing? As done for the y2A cells, the illustrations in 5B-5E should indicate what cell lines were used. No loading controls in Fig 5F, is there any protein in the first lane? No loading controls in Fig 6B and 6H.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have amended Fig. 5A to now show larger crops of the two GHR and PRLR Western Blot images and thus a greater range of proteins present in the extracts. Please note that the bands in the WBs other than what is identified as GHR and PRLR are non-specific and reflect roughly equivalent loading of protein in each lane.</p>
<p>We also made some changes to Figures 5B-5E.</p>

<p>(7) The proximity ligation method was not described in the M&amp;M section of the manuscript.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have added a description of the PL method to the Methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p>
<p>A final suggestion for future investigations: Instead of focusing on the heteromer formation of the GHR/PRLR which both signal all through the same downstream effectors (JAK2, STAT5), it would have been more cancer-relevant, and perhaps even more interesting, to look for heteromers between the PRLR and receptors of the IL-6 family since it had been shown that PRL can stimulate STAT3, which is a unique feature of cancer cells. If that is the case, this would require a different modality of the interaction between different JAK kinases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We highly appreciate the reviewer’s recommendation and hope to follow up on it in the near future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) I could not fully evaluate some of the data, mainly because several details on acquisition and analysis are lacking. It would be useful to know what the background signal was in dSTORM and how the authors distinguished the specific signal from unspecific background fluorescence, which can be quite prominent in these experiments. Typically, one would evaluate the signal coming from antibodies randomly bound to a substrate around the cells to determine the switching properties of the dyes in their buffer and the average number of localisations representing one antibody. This would help evaluate if GHR or PRLR appeared as monomers or multimers in the plasma membrane before stimulation, which is currently a matter of debate. It would also provide better support for the model proposed in Figure 8.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s comment. In our experience, the background signal is more relevant in dSTORM when imaging proteins that are located at deeper depths (&gt; 3 μm) above the coverslip surface. In our experiments, cells are attached to the coverslip surface and the proteins being imaged are on the cell membrane. In addition, we employed dSTORM’s TIRF (total internal reflection fluorescence) microscopy mode to image membrane receptor proteins. TIRFM exploits the unique properties of an induced evanescent field in a limited specimen region immediately adjacent to the interface between two media having different refractive indices. It thereby dramatically reduces background by rejecting fluorescence from out-of-focus areas in the detection path and illuminating only the area right near the surface.</p>
<p>Having said that, a few other sources such as auto-fluorescence, scattering, and non-bleached fluorescent molecules close to and distant from the focal plane can contribute to the background signal. We tried to reduce auto-fluorescence by ensuring that cells are grown in phenol-red-free media, imaging is performed in STORM buffer which reduces autofluorescence, and our immunostaining protocol includes a quenching step aside from using blocking buffer with different serum, in addition to BSA. Moreover, we employed extensive washing steps following antibody incubations to eliminate non-specifically bound antibodies. Ensuring that the TIRF illumination field is uniform helps reduce scatter. Additionally, an extended bleach step prior to the acquisition of frames to determine localizations helped further reduce the probability of non-bleached fluorescent molecules.</p>
<p>In short, due to the experimental design we do not expect much background. However, in the future, we will address this concern and estimate background in a subtype dependent manner. To this end we will distinguish two types of background noise: (A) background with a small change between subsequent frames, which mainly consists of auto-fluorescence and non-bleached out-of-focus fluorescent molecules; and (B) background that changes every imaging frame, which is mainly from non-bleached fluorescent molecules near the focal plane. For type (A) background, temporal filters must be used for background estimation [1]; for type (B) background, low-pass filters (e.g., wavelet transform) should be used for background estimation [2].</p>

<p>(2) Since many of the findings in this work come from the evaluation of localisation clusters, an image showing actual localisations would help support the main conclusions. I believe that the dSTORM images in Figures 1 and 2 are density maps, although this was not explicitly stated. Alexa 568 and Alexa 647 typically give a very different number of localisations, and this is also dependent on the concentration of BME. Did the authors take that into account when interpreting the results and creating the model in Figures 2 and 8?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I believe that including this information is important as findings in this paper heavily rely on the number of localisations detected under different conditions.</p>
<p>Including information on proximity labelling and CRISPR/Cas9 in the methods section would help with the reproducibility of these findings by other groups.</p>
<p>Figures 1 and 2 show Gaussian interpolations of actual localizations, not density maps. Imaging captured the fluorophores’ blinking events and localizations were counted as true localizations, when at least 5 consecutive blinking events had been observed. Nikon software was used for Gaussian fitting. In other words, we show <italic>reconstructed</italic> images based on identifying true localizations using gaussian fitting and some strict parameters to identify true fluorophore blinking. This allowed us to identify true localizations with high confidence and generate a high-resolution image for membrane receptors.</p>
<p>Indeed, Alexa 568 and 647 give different numbers of localization. This is dependent on the intrinsic photo-physics of the fluorophores. Specifically, each fluorophore has a different duty cycle, switching cycle, and survival fraction. However, we note that we focused on capturing the relative changes in receptor numbers over time, before and after stimulation by ligands, not the absolute numbers of surface GHR and PRLR. We are not comparing the absolute numbers of localizations or drawing comparisons for localization numbers between 568 and 647. For all these different conditions/times, the photo-physics for a particular fluorophore remains the same. This allows us to make relative comparisons.</p>
<p>As far as the effect of BME is concerned, the concentration of mercaptoethanol needs to be carefully optimized, as too high a concentration can potentially quench the fluorescence or affect the overall stability of the sample. However, we are using an optimized concentration which has been previously validated across multiple STORM experiments. This makes the concerns relating to the concentration of BME irrelevant to the current experimental design. Besides, the concentration of BME is maintained across all experimental conditions.</p>

<p>(4) Exposure time used for image acquisition to put 40 000 frames in the context of total imaging time and clarify why you decided to take 40 000 images per channel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our Nikon Ti2 N-STORM microscope is equipped with an iXon DU-897 Ultra EMCCD camera from Andor (Oxford Instruments). According to the camera’s manufacturer, this camera platform uses a back-illuminated 512 x 512 frame transfer sensor and overclocks readout to 17 MHz, pushing speed performance to 56 fps (in full frame mode). We note that we always tried to acquire STORM images at the maximal frame rate. As for the exposure time, according to the manufacturer it can be as short as 17.8 ms. We would like to emphasize that we did not specify/alter the exposure time.</p>
<p>See also: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://andor.oxinst.com/assets/uploads/products/andor/documents/andor-ixon-ultra-emccd-specifications.pdf">https://andor.oxinst.com/assets/uploads/products/andor/documents/andor-ixon-ultra-emccd-specifications.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p>The decision to take 40,000 images per frame was based on our intention to identify the true population of the molecules of interest that are localized and accurately represented in the final reconstruction image. The total number of frames depends on the sample complexity, density of sample labeling and desired resolution. We tested a range of frames between 20,000 and 60,000 and found for our experimental design and output requirements that 40,000 frames provided the best balance between achieving maximal resolution and desired localizations to make consistent and accurate localization estimates across different stimulation conditions compared to basal controls.</p>

<p>(7) Minor corrections to the text:</p>
<p>It appears as though there is a large difference in the expression level of GHR and PRLR in basal conditions in Figure 1. This can be due to the switching properties of the dyes, which is related to the amount of BME in the buffer, or it can be because there is indeed more PRL. Would the authors be able to comment on this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestions. According to expression data available online there is indeed more PRLR than GHR in T47D cells. According to CellMiner [1], T47D cells have an RNA-Seq gene expression level log2(FPKM + 1) of 6.814 for PRLR, and 3.587 for GHR, strongly suggesting that there is more PRLR than GHR in basal conditions, matching the reviewer’s interpretation of our images in Fig. 1 (basal). However, we would advise against using STORM images for direct comparisons of receptor expression. First, with TIRF images, we are only looking at the membrane fraction (~150 nm close to the coverslip membrane interface) that is attached to the coverslip. Secondly, as discussed above, our data represent relative cell surface receptor levels that allow for comparison of different conditions (basal vs. stimulation) and does not represent absolute quantifications. Everything is relative and in comparison to controls.</p>
<p>Also, BME is not going to change the level of expression. The differences in growth factor expression as estimated by relative comparison can be attributed to the actual changes in growth factors and is not an artifact of the amount of BME in the buffer or the properties of dyes. These factors are maintained across all experimental conditions and do not influence the final outcome.</p>

<p>(8) I would encourage the authors to use unspecific binding to characterize the signal coming from single antibodies bound to the substrate. This would provide a mean number of localizations that a single antibody generates. With this information, one can evaluate how many receptors there are per cluster, which would strengthen the findings and potentially provide additional support for the model presented in Figure 8. It would also explain why the distributions of localisations per cluster in Fig. 3B look very different for hGHR and hPRLR. As the authors point out in the discussion, the results on predimerization of these receptors in basal conditions are conflicting and therefore it is important to shed more light on this topic.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestions. While we are unable to perform this experiment at this stage, we will keep it in mind for future experiments.</p>

<p>(9) Minor corrections to the figures:</p>
<p>Figure 1:</p>
<p>In the legend, please say what representation was used. Are these density maps or another representation? Please provide examples of actual localisations (either as dots or crosses representing the peaks of the Gaussians). Most findings of this work rely on the characterisation of the clusters of localisations and therefore it is of essence to show what the clusters look like. This could potentially go to the supplemental info to minimise additional work. It's very hard to see the puncta in this figure.</p>
<p>If the authors created zoomed regions in each of the images (as in Figure 3), it would be much easier to evaluate the expression level and the extent of colocalisation. Halfway through GHR 3 min green pixels become grey, but this may be the issue with the document that was created. Please check. Either increase the font on the scale bars in this figure or delete it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described above, Figure 1 does not show density maps. Imaging captured the fluorophores’ blinking events and localizations were counted as true localizations, when at least 5 consecutive blinking events had been observed. Nikon software was used for Gaussian fitting and smoothing.</p>
<p>We have generated zoomed regions. In our files (original as well as pdf) we do not see pixels become grey. We increased the font size above one of the scale bars and removed all others.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3:</p>
<p>In A, the GHR clusters are colour coded but PRLR are not. Are both DBSCN images? Explain the meaning of colour coding or show it as black and white. Was brightness also increased in the PRLR image? The font on the scale bars is too small. In B, right panels, the font on the axes is too small. In the figure legend explain the meaning of 33.3 and 16.7</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our document, both GHR and PRLR are color coded but the hGHR clusters are certainly bigger and therefore appear brighter than the hPRLR clusters. Both are DBSCAN images. The color coding allows to distinguish different clusters (there is no other meaning). We have kept the color-coding but have added a sentence to the caption addressing this. Brightness was increased in both images of Panel B equally. 33.3 and 16.7 are the median cluster sizes. We have added a sentence to the caption explaining this. We have increased the font on the axes in B (right panels).</p>

<p>Figure 4:</p>
<p>I struggled to see any colocalization in the 2nd and the 3rd image. Please show zoomed-in sections. In the panels B and C, the data are presented as fractions. Is this per cell? My interpretation is that ~80% of PRL clusters also contain GHR.</p>
<p>Is this in agreement with Figures 1 and 2? In Figure 1, PRL 3 min, Merge, colocalization seems much smaller. Could the authors give the total numbers of GHR and PRLR from which the fractions were calculated at least in basal conditions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have provided zoom-in views. As for panels B and C, fractions are number of clusters containing both receptors divided by the total number of clusters. We used the same strategy that we had used for calculating the localization changes: We randomly selected 4 ROIs (regions of interest) per cell to calculate fractions and then calculated the average of three different cells from independently repeated experiments. We did not calculate total numbers of GHR/PRLR. The numbers are fractions of cluster numbers.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reviewer interprets results in panels B and C that ~80% of PRLR clusters also contain GHR. We assume the reviewer refers to Basal state. Now, the reviewer’s interpretation is not correct for the following reason: ~80% of clusters have both receptors. How many of the remaining (~20%) clusters have only PRLR or only GHR is not revealed in the panels. Only if 100% of clusters have PRLR, we can conclude that 80% of PRLR clusters also contain GHR.</p>
<p>Also, while Figures 1 and 2 show localization based on dSTORM images, Figure 3 indicates and quantifies co-localization based on proximity ligation assays following DBSCAN analysis using Clus-DoC. We do not think that the results are directly comparable.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The manuscript suffers from a lack of detail, which in places makes it difficult to evaluate the data and would make it very difficult for the results to be replicated by others. In addition, the manuscript would very much benefit from a full discussion of the limitations of the study. For example, the manuscript is written as if there is only one form of the PRLR while the anti-PRLR antibody used for dSTORM would also recognize the intermediate form and short forms 1a and 1b on the T47D cells. Given the very different roles of these other PRLR forms in breast cancer (Dufau, Vonderhaar, Clevenger, Walker and other labs), this limitation should at the very least be discussed. Similarly, the manuscript is written as if Jak2 essentially only signals through STAT5 but Jak2 is involved in multiple other signaling pathways from the multiple PRLRs, including the long form. Also, while there are papers suggesting that PRL can be protective in breast cancer, the majority of publications in this area find that PRL promotes breast cancer. How then would the authors interpret the effect of PRL on GHR in light of all those non-protective results? [Check papers by Hallgeir Rui]</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for such thoughtful comments. We have added a paragraph in the Discussion section on the limitations of our study, including sole focus on T47D and γ2A-JAK2 cells and lack of PRLR isoform-specific data. Also, we are now mentioning that these isoforms play different roles in breast cancer, citing papers by Dufau, Vonderhaar, Clevenger, and Walker labs.</p>
<p>We did not mean to imply that JAK2 signals only via STAT5 or by only binding the long form. We have made this point clear in the Introduction as well as in our revised Discussion section. Moreover, we have added information and references on JAK2 signaling and PRLR isoform specific signaling.</p>
<p>In our Discussions section we are also mentioning the findings that PRL is promoting breast cancer. We would like to point out that it is well perceivable that PRL is protective in BC by reducing surface hGHR availability but that this effect may depend on JAK2 levels as well as on expression levels of other kinases that competitively bind Box1 and/or Box2 [1]. Besides, could it not be that PRL’s effect is BC stage dependent? In any case, we have emphasized the speculative nature of our statement.</p>
