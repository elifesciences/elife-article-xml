<title>Abstract</title><p>The myometrium plays a critical component during pregnancy. It is responsible for the uterus’ structural integrity and force generation at term, Emerging studies in mice indicate a dynamic change of the myometrial epigenome and transcriptome during pregnancy to ready the contractile machinery for parturition. However, the regulatory systems underlying myometrial gene expression patterns throughout gestation remain largely unknown. Here we investigated the human term pregnant nonlabor myometrial biopsies for transcriptome, enhancer histone mark cistrome, and chromatin conformation pattern mapping. More than thirty-thousand putative enhancers with H3K27ac and H3K4me1 double positive marks were identified in the myometrium. Enriched transcription factor binding motifs include known myometrial regulators AP-1, STAT, NFkB, and PGR among others. Putative myometrial super enhancers are mostly colocalized with progesterone receptor occupying sites and preferentially associated with highly expressing genes, suggesting a conserved role of PGR in regulating the myometrial transcriptome between species. In human myometrial specimens, inferred PGR activities are positively correlated with <italic>PLCL2</italic> mRNA levels, supporting that PGR may act through this genomic region to promote <italic>PLCL2</italic> expression. PGR overexpression facilitated <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene expression in myometrial cells Using CRISPR activation the functionality of a PGR putative enhancer 35-kilobases upstream of the contractile-restrictive gene <italic>PLCL2</italic>.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The myometrium is the muscular component of the uterus. Throughout gestation, the myometrium maintains contractile quiescence until labor, where uterine contractility facilitates parturition. Pre-term birth, often characterized by aberrant myometrial activity before term, results in the termination of pregnancy prior to 37 weeks gestation. Complications associated with pre-term birth account for 35% of neonatal death and contribute to lifelong physical and socioeconomic multi-morbidities to surviving neonates and mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chawanpaiboon, Vogel et al. 2019</xref>). It is therefore critical to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance and shift of myometrial quiescence throughout gestation.</p>
<p>The myometrium undergoes extensive structural and functional remodeling preparing for parturition through genomic regulatory mechanisms which influence gene expression throughout pregnancy. Major transcription factor families have been identified to contribute throughout the remodeling process. Studies on the role of steroid hormone receptors in myometrial remodeling have provided evidence that the withdrawal of functional progesterone signaling at term is due to a stoichiometric increase of progesterone receptor (PGR) A to B isoform related estrogen receptor (ESR) alpha expression activation at term. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mesiano, Chan et al. 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Merlino, Welsh et al. 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nadeem, Shynlova et al. 2016</xref>). Activator protein 1 (AP-1) complex subunits have been observed to act as a PGR coregulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dai, Litman et al. 2003</xref>) and also have dynamic expression patterns throughout gestation in both humans and rodent models, for example, FOS:JUN heterodimers are implicated to be critical for the initiation of labor through transcriptional regulation of gap junction proteins such as Cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nadeem, Farine et al. 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Balducci, Risek et al. 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Contributing to the dynamic nature of the myometrial transcriptome during term is the epigenome and its reprogramming. Studies investigating epigenetic markers related to gene activation in the mouse myometrium have revealed that the promoters for contractility-driving genes, such as Cx43, are epigenetically activated well before the onset of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shchuka, Abatti et al. 2020</xref>). Considering this, the myometrial epigenome’s role in parturition disorders, such as preterm birth, has thus been under investigation. For example, it is known that altered DNA methylation is linked with preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barcelona de Mendoza, Wright et al. 2017</xref>), including at the promoters of genes associated with myometrial contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Erickson, Myatt et al. 2023</xref>) and fetal membrane rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wang, Ogawa et al. 2008</xref>). However, the role of differential myometrial DNA methylation at contractility-driving gene promoter CpG islands in preterm birth is not thought to be major (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mitsuya, Singh et al. 2014</xref>), but given that DNA methylation mediated gene regulation often occurs outside of CpG islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Irizarry, Ladd-Acosta et al. 2009</xref>), there is still work to be done at this interface. Regardless, whether through epigenetic or transcriptomic gene regulatory programs, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of genes critical for myometrial reprogramming and quiescent maintenance are still poorly understood.</p>
<p>In this study, we aim to improve our understanding of the cellular processes involved in shaping the myometrium’s dynamic state of quiescence throughout pregnancy through the epigenetic and transcriptomic profiling of the human myometrium. Because of the relevance of genomic regulatory mechanisms in coordinating myometrial activity, we identified candidate cis-acting regulatory regions using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) assays of surrogate histone enhancer markers H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Creyghton, Cheng et al. 2010</xref>) and H3K4me1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Heintzman, Stuart et al. 2007</xref>) alongside chromatin conformation capture assays in term pregnant myometrial tissues. Putative enhancers upstream of the <italic>PLCL2,</italic> a gene encoding for the protein PLCL2 which has been implicated in the modulation of calcium signaling (Uji, Matsuda et al. 2002) and maintenance of myometrial quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Peavey, Wu et al. 2021</xref>), transcriptional start site were subject to functional assessment using CRISPR activation based assays. Here, we identified a genomic region 35-kilobases upstream of the <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcriptional start site involved in <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we aimed to characterize this genomic region through the identification of candidate <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcriptional regulators co-localizing with this cis-acting element using integrative cistrome and transcriptome analysis and have demonstrated PGR to be a direct regulator for <italic>PLCL2</italic> expression. These findings build upon our understanding of myometrial remodeling throughout gestation and will be pertinent for the development of medical interventions aiming to address pre-term birth.</p>

<title>Epigenomic Landscape in Term Pregnant Myometrial Specimens</title>
<p>The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay identified an average of 44238 H3K27ac and 74325 H3K4me1 positive genomic regions in three term-pregnant, nonlabor myometrial biopsies (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). An RNA-Seq assay revealed an average of 12157 active genes in these specimens that manifested expression levels of fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) greater or equal to 1 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A high throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) assay further found a total of 27162 chromatin loops from two of the three myometrial specimens (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, subject 1 and 3). We failed to identify chromatin loops in the second subject’s biopsy due to limited sample availability. Together, these results reveal an epigenomic landscape in the human term pregnant myometrial tissue before the onset of labor which we use as a resource to investigate the molecular mechanisms that prepare the myometrium for subsequent parturition.</p>

<p>When comparing the present study to previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dotts, Reiman et al. 2023</xref>), 8563 genomic regions carry common H3K27ac-positive histone marks. However, significant variations on the number and location of H3K27ac-positive intervals are present across the six samples among these two studies (Figure S1). Depending on the number of mapped intervals, the 8563 common regions constitute between 20.7% to 71.5% of total H3K27ac-positive intervals across the six myometrial specimens (Figure S1). Notably, the fraction of intervals commonly identified in the present study’s three specimens ranges between 56.4% and 70.0% of each of their total H3K27ac-positive regions, while the Dotts dataset has a wider range between 28.0% and 74.0%. With a less stringent criterium, most the H3K27ac-positive intervals are found in at least two samples, ranging between 75.4% and 98.3% (Figure S1). These data together highlight the degree of variation on mapping the epigenome among specimens and datasets.</p>

<title>Putative Enhancers for Gene Regulation in the Human Myometrium</title>
<p>Since H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marked genome regions are associated with enhancers for gene regulation (Creyghton, Cheng et al. 2010) (Heintzman, Stuart et al. 2007), we define the regions that have overlapping H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marks as putative myometrial enhancers at the term pregnant nonlabor stage (Dataset S1). Among the three specimens, 13114 putative enhancers are commonly present (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). A significant variance on the location of myometrial putative enhancers is also seen among biopsies as evident by the observation that these common putative enhancers make up less than half of the total putative enhancers in each individual specimen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). More than one-third of these 13114 common putative enhancers are located within a 100-kilobase vicinity of actively high-expressing genes (FPKM &gt;= 15), while a much smaller fraction of them (13.3%) are associated with actively low-expressing genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Motif enrichment analysis on these common putative enhancers further reveals an overrepresentation of binding motifs for myometrial transcription factors AP-1, STAT5, and NFκB, steroid hormone receptors PGR and NR3C1, and smooth muscle transcription regulators SRF and ELK1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and Dataset S2). These findings collectively suggest that the putative myometrial enhancers bring together smooth muscle and hormonal control programs for the regulation of myometrial gene expression at term pregnancy.</p>

Across the three human subjects, 540 putative super enhancers are commonly identified in the term pregnant nonlabor myometrial specimens (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and Dataset S3). More than 40% of the 540 putative super enhancers are located within a 100-kilobase distance to high-expressing genes, while only 7.3% of putative myometrial super enhancers are found near low-expressing genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Compared with the regular putative enhancers, the putative myometrial super enhancers are found more frequently near active genes that are expressed at relatively higher levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, 76% of the putative super enhancers are co-localized with known PGR-occupied regions in the human myometrial tissue (Figure S2). This is significantly higher than the 20% co-localization in the regular enhancer group (Figure S2). Further examining the myometrial active genes that are associated with putative super enhancers revealed an enrichment of gene functions in intercellular and cell-matrix interactions, hormonal responses, and mRNA stability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, these results establish the association among the putative myometrial enhancers, the potential regulatory program within these super enhancers, and the cellular functions of the genes they may control.</p>

<title>Cis-acting elements for the control of the contractile gene <italic>PLCL2</italic></title>
<p>Next, we take advantage of this myometrial epigenome map to identify cis-acting elements that regulate the <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene expression. The Hi-C assay identified a chromatin loop with one end at the <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcription start site (TSS) and the other end at approximately 90-kilobases upstream of the TSS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Within this chromatin loop, ChIP-Seq results revealed seven genomic regions that are marked with H3K27ac in all three myometrial specimens (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Six of the seven regions are also co-localized with previously published genome occupancy of transcription regulators curated by the ReMap Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hammal, de Langen et al. 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). For the purpose of functional screening, we focus on H3K27ac signals instead of using H3K27ac/H3K4me1 double positive criterium to cast a wider net. Eight guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed to target these seven candidate regions for CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) based screening of <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene regulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The two previously reported gRNAs (PLCL2-7 and PLCL2-8) were able to elevate the endogenous <italic>PLCL2</italic> mRNA levels significantly higher than the non-targeting gRNA in immortalized human myometrial cells (hTERT-HM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) (Peavey, Wu et al. 2021). gRNAs PCLC2-1, PLCL2-3, PLCL2-5, and PLCL2-6 also significantly increased <italic>PLCL2</italic> expression above the levels of the non-targeting group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, results from the Perturb-Seq assay found that the PLCL2 gene ranks high in the differentially expressed gene list of the PLCL2-5 gRNA expressing cells compared with the non-targeting gRNA expressing cells (Dataset S4), in line with the qRT-PCR assay finding in which the gRNA PLCL2-5 induced <italic>PLCL2</italic> expression to the greatest extent among the upstream non-coding genome targeted gRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, gRNA PLCL2-5 was capable of mediating the increase of the <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcript abundance in another uterine mesenchymal cell type T-HESC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Collectively, these findings support the PLCL2-5 targeted genomic region as a cis-acting element for regulation of the <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene.</p>

<title>PGR as an upstream regulator for the <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene in the human myometrium</title>
<p>After determining its cis-acting element role, the PLCL2-5 targeted genomic region was further examined to identify upstream regulators that control myometrial <italic>PLCL2</italic> expression. This was achieved by first identifying transcription factor occupancy in this genome region in any tissues/cells that are documented in public databases (ReMAP Atlas) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hammal, de Langen et al. 2022</xref>), followed by filtering for factors that have known mRNA and/or protein expression in hTERT-HM cells and tissues using publicly available transcriptomic and histological data including the Human Protein Atlas (Human Protein Atlas <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://proteinatlas.org">proteinatlas.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Uhlen, Fagerberg et al. 2015</xref>) and published RNA-Seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Stanfield, Amini et al. 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wu, Anderson et al. 2020</xref>). The resulting candidate upstream regulators for the myometrial <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene are documented in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Since the <italic>PLCL2</italic> mRNA abundance is much lower in the hTERT-HM cells than in the myometrial tissues, these candidate upstream regulators were further grouped into candidate activators and repressors based on an assumption that a candidate activator would be expressed higher in human myometrial tissue, and a candidate repressor being expressed higher instead in the hTERT-HM cells, holding the <italic>PLCL2</italic> mRNA levels down. Candidate activators for the <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene include known myometrial regulators such as PGR, ESR1, and AP-1 (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, the mediator complex protein subunit MED1, cohesion complex members RAD21 and SMC3, and many epigenomic modifiers are among the list of the candidate repressors (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These findings not only provide candidates for subsequent functional assessment, but also highlight potential pathways for future investigations on the regulation of the contractile gene <italic>PCLC2</italic> expression in the myometrium.</p>

<p>We previously demonstrated the regulation of mouse <italic>Plcl2</italic> gene by the myometrial PGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wu, Wang et al. 2022</xref>). To further test whether such a regulatory mechanism is also present in the human, the CRISPRa technology was employed to increase the expression of PGR mRNA and proteins in hTERT-HM cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Given that the PGR640 gRNA led to higher PGR protein production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), this gRNA was utilized to stimulate myometrial <italic>PGR</italic> expression for subsequent experiments. Indeed, RT-qPCR results showed that PGR overexpression increased <italic>PLCL2</italic> mRNA abundance in hTERT-HM cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), demonstrating a consistent finding with the mouse model.</p>

<p>To further explore this regulatory relationship in the human myometrial tissue, we examined the degree of correlation between the inferred PGR activity and the <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcript abundance in myometrial biopsies. Gene expression profiles of myometrial specimens from 13 proliferative-phase, 6 secretory-phase, 14 post-menopausal, and 10 Provera-treated human subjects were determined by the RNA-Seq assay (Dataset S5) to take advantage of the wide spectrum of progesterone signaling activities in these samples. Inferred myometrial PGR activities, represented as T-scores (Dataset S5), were derived from this normalized gene expression matrix of 43 human myometrial specimens with the previously published mouse myometrial <italic>Pgr</italic> gene signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wu, Wang et al. 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li, Bushel et al. 2021</xref>).

Together, these in vitro and in vivo findings collectively support that PGR is a <italic>PLCL2</italic> activator, likely acting through the 35-kb upstream cis-acting element.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Temporally and spatially regulated gene expression is the foundation of tissue phenotype manifestation. Shchuka and colleagues utilize the mouse model to show that the myometrial epigenome is readily programed for parturition-associated gene induction days ahead of the term pregnancy (Shchuka, Abatti et al. 2020), laying the ground for subsequent laboring event. We chose to study the human myometrium at the term pregnant nonlabor stage in order to examine the association between the epigenome landscape and the gene expression pattern not only for preparing the myometrium for parturition, but also for maintaining myometrial quiescence. We also performed a mullti-omic study on a myometrial specimen from each individual human subject to better align all the datasets together, reflecting specimen and subject individuality. While the variation among specimens is substantial, we were able to identify myometrial cis-acting elements commonly shared among three individuals. As a proof of principle, we subsequently used this information to functionally screen for genomic regions that may mediate the regulation of the contractile-suppressing gene <italic>PLCL2</italic>. The H3K27ac marked 35-kilobase upstream region as a result of the screening then serves as a bridge to identify PGR as one of the upstream regulators for modulating <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene expression in human myometrium. These findings showcase the value of these datasets as a resource for future investigations on the mechanisms of myometrial gene regulation.</p>
<p>Variations across cistromic datasets for the human myometrium are significant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and Figure S1) (Dotts, Reiman et al. 2023). Contributing factors likely include but are not limited to subject-to-subject differences and batch effects from sample preparations. Taking the H3K27ac marked genomic regions as an example, regions commonly identified in the specimens of this study’s three subjects account for 55.9%, 67.7%, and 57.9% of total H3K27ac-positive intervals in each individual sample, despite our best attempt to reduce the batch effect. Heterogeneity on cell type compositions, likely due to the sampling location, could be a major contributing factor to the variation. It is also speculated that the genomic regions with subject-to-subject variances could be transiently present and thus the signal could not be captured across samples. In addition, the underlying health conditions, medications, and environmental challenges among others may also affect the epigenomic profile. Variations could also arise from differences in the detection threshold. We identified an average of 44238 H3K27ac marked regions per specimen, while Dotts and colleagues found nearly 19000 per sample (Dotts, Reiman et al. 2023). Reagent and sample handling could confound with biological variances of specimens leading to this difference. Future investigations using standardized sample preparation protocols at the single cell resolution may help to reduce this variation.</p>
<p>Results from the CRISPRa-based Perturb-Seq assay demonstrate the capability of this technology to screen for cis-acting elements that are in topological vicinity of the gene of interest. This assay is particularly useful on genes that are expressed at low levels in the screening platform, i.e., the cells. The dCas9VPR activator can generate satisfactory signal-to-noise ratios to be detected by single cell RNAseq. The advantage of assaying with this system is that each individual cell serves as a container to generate data points instead of relying on multiple wells on cell culture plates. Multiplexing with multiple gRNAs can be achieved by using the gRNA sequence as a unique barcode of the cell, enabling the simultaneous collection of numerous data points for each individual gRNA. In the present study, 56.7% of tested cells carried one species of detectable gRNAs, permitting the study of the resulting effect under a single gRNA. Moreover, another 27.0% of assayed cells have more than one species of detectable gRNAs, which open the possibility to study interactions between different cis-acting elements. However, we failed to use this approach for the purpose of identifying target genes of a putative enhancer of interest (Dataset S4). Challenges such as difficulties on defining the criteria of the associated genes and unsatisfactory signal-to-noise ratios on genes already at high baseline levels should be considered in future experimental designs. Taking together, results of the present study support the use of the CRISPRa-based Pertub-Seq assay under a defined scope.</p>
<p>PLCL2 and its paralog PLCL1 are catalytically inactive members of the phospholipase C family functioning as negative regulators of calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kanematsu, Takeuchi et al. 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Takenaka, Fukami et al. 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Uji, Matsuda et al. 2002</xref>). Both of them are expressed in human myometrial tissues and are able to attenuate oxytocin-induced muscle cell contraction (Peavey, Wu et al. 2021). <italic>PLCL1</italic> mRNA abundance is higher in the myometrium at term pregnancy than the non-gravid stage, while <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcript levels remain comparable between the two stages (Wu, Anderson et al. 2020). Data from cultured human endometrial stromal cells and the genetically engineered mouse model reveal progesterone signaling as the upstream regulator of <italic>PLCL1</italic> and <italic>Plcl2</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Muter, Brighton et al. 2016</xref>) (Peavey, Wu et al. 2021). The present study further demonstrates the PGR-dependent regulation of the <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene in the human myometrial cells, suggesting that this pathway is conserved between human and mouse. Importantly, the identification of the cis-acting element 35-kilobase upstream of the <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene opens a venue to investigate the impact of interactions between PGR and other myometrial transcription regulators on the mechanism of action that controls the myometrial contractile machinery. The future findings in this space could provide insight on progesterone signaling modification and identify progesterone signaling modifiers for the development of novel therapy that targets parturition disorders.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The use of a multi-omics approach to elucidate the regulatory mechanism underlying parturition and myometrial quiescence adds novelty to the study. The identification of myometrial cis-acting elements and their association with gene expression, particularly the regulation of the PLCL2 gene by PGR opens the door to further investigate the impact of PGR and other regulators.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Multi-Omic Approach: The paper employs a comprehensive multi-omic approach, combining ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and CRISPRa-based Perturb-Seq assays, which allow for a thorough investigation of the regulatory mechanisms underlying myometrial gene expression.</p>
<p>(2) Clinical Relevance: Investigating human myometrial specimens provides direct clinical relevance, as understanding the molecular mechanisms governing parturition and myometrial quiescence can have significant implications for the management of pregnancy-related disorders.</p>
<p>(3) Functional work: For functional screening, They have used CRISPRa-based screening of PLCL2 gene regulation using immortalized human cell-line hTERT-HM and T-hESC to add more dimension to the work which strengthens their finding of PGR-dependent regulation of the PLCL2 gene in the human myometrial cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
(1) Variability in epigenomic mapping: The significant variations in the number and location of H3K27ac-positive intervals across different samples and studies suggest potential challenges in accurately mapping the myometrial epigenome. This variability may introduce uncertainty and complicate the interpretation of results.</p>
<p>(2) Sample specificity: The study focuses on term pregnant nonlabor myometrial specimens, limiting the generalizability of the findings to other stages of pregnancy or labor.</p>
<p>(3) Limited Understanding of Regulatory Mechanisms: While the study identifies potential regulatory programs within super-enhancers, the exact mechanisms by which these enhancers regulate gene expression and cellular functions in the myometrium remain unclear. Further mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate these processes.</p>
<p>(4) Discordant analysis: Why are regular enhancers being understood in terms of motif enrichment of transcription factors and super-enhancers in terms of pathways enriched for active genes? This needs a clear reason.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In &quot;Assessment of the Epigenomic Landscape in Human Myometrium at Term Pregnancy&quot; the authors generate a number of genome-wide data sets to investigate epigenomic and transcriptomic regulation of the myometrium at term pregnancy. These data provide a useful resource for further evaluation of gene regulatory mechanisms in the myometrium and include the first Hi-C data published for this tissue. There is a comprehensive comparison to previously published histone modification data and integration with RNA-seq to highlight potential enhancer-gene regulatory relationships. The authors further investigate putative enhancers upstream of the PLCL2 gene and identify a candidate region that may be regulated by the PGR (progesterone receptor) signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this study are in the multi-omics nature of the design as several genome-wide data sets are generated from the same patient samples. Extending this type of approach in the future to a larger number of samples will allow for additional investigation into gene regulation as the correlation between epigenomic features and gene expression across a larger number of samples can reveal regulatory relationships.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of this study is the generation of the first Hi-C data for the human pregnant myometrium, however, there is a minimal description in the results section of the Hi-C data analysis and the only data shown are the number of loops identified and one such loop that includes the PLCL2 promoter shown in Figure 3A. The manuscript would benefit from a more extensive analysis of the Hi-C data, for example, the analysis of TADs (topological associating domains) would be interesting to add and could be used to evaluate to what extent H3K27ac domains and putative regulated genes fall within the same TAD.</p>
<p>The authors present some convincing evidence on the transcriptional regulation of the PLCL2 gene using Perturb-Seq to identify putative upstream enhancer regions and PGR over-expression showing PGR can act as an activator. These two experiments on their own are interesting, however, they are not as mechanistically integrated as they could be to clarify the molecular mechanisms. Deletion of the putative enhancer upstream of PLCL2 followed by over-expression of PGR would clarify the mechanistic relationship between the proposed enhancer, PGR, and PLCL2 expression. Does PGR act through the proposed enhancer? In addition, reporter assays using this proposed enhancer region with and without increased expression of PGR and mutation of any PRE sequences would also provide mechanistic insight. Although CRISPRa and Perturb-Seq can be used to identify potential regulatory regions, the best approach to verify the requirement for a particular enhancer in regulating a specific gene is a deletion approach.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Wu et al. investigate active H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marks in term pregnant nonlabor myometrial biopsies, linking putative-enhancers and super-enhancers to gene expression levels. Through their findings, they reveal the PGR-dependent regulation of the PLCL2 gene in human myometrial cells via a cis-acting element located 35-kilobases upstream of the PLCL2 gene. By targeting this region using a CRISPR activation system, they were able to elevate the endogenous PLCL2 mRNA levels in immortalized human myometrial cells.</p>
<p>This research offers novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing gene expression in myometrial tissues, advancing our understanding of pregnancy-related processes.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) A more comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic and transcriptomic data would have strengthened the paper, moving beyond basic association studies. Currently, it is challenging to assess the quality and significance of the data as much of the information is lacking.</p>
<p>(2) The rationale for and connections between experiments, as well as results, could be bolstered to underscore the significance of this research.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The combination of ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and CRISPRa Perturb-Seq approaches to investigate gene regulation and expression in myometrial cells.</p>
<p>- The use of CRISPR activation system to specifically target cis-acting elements.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The manuscript would strongly benefit from a deeper analysis of the Omic datasets. Furthermore, expanding figures/graphs to effectively contextualize these datasets would be greatly beneficial and would add more value to this research. Currently, it is difficult for us to assess and appreciate the quality of these data sets across the manuscript, which is mostly correlative.</p>
<p>- Limited sample size, coupled with variability in results and overall lack of details, compromises the robustness of result interpretation.</p>
<p>- For most parts of the results section, a better description is needed, including rationale, approach, and presentation of data. As it stands, it is challenging to assess the quality of the data and appreciate the results.</p>
<p>- Additional efforts are needed to dissect the proposed regulatory mechanisms.</p>
<p>- While the discussion provided helpful context for understanding some of the experiments performed, it lacked interpretation of the results in relation to the existing literature.</p>
