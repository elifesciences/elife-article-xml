<title>Abstract</title><p>Ubiquitin (Ub), a central regulator of protein turnover, can be phosphorylated by PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) to generate S65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb). Elevated pUb levels have been observed in aged human brains and in Parkinson’s disease, but the mechanistic link between pUb elevation and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that pUb elevation is a common feature under neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, aging, and ischemic injury. We show that impaired proteasomal activity leads to the accumulation of sPINK1, the cytosolic form of PINK1 that is normally proteasome-degraded rapidly. This accumulation increases ubiquitin phosphorylation, which then inhibits ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal activity by interfering with both ubiquitin chain elongation and proteasome-substrate interactions. Specific expression of sPINK1 in mouse hippocampal neurons induced progressive pUb accumulation, accompanied by protein aggregation, proteostasis disruption, neuronal injury, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline. Conversely, <italic>pink1</italic> knockout mitigated protein aggregation in both mouse brains and HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the detrimental effects of sPINK1 could be counteracted by co-expressing Ub/S65A phospho-null mutant but exacerbated by over-expressing Ub/S65E phospho-mimic mutant. Together, these findings reveal that pUb elevation, triggered by reduced proteasomal activity, inhibits proteasomal activity and forms a feedforward loop that drives progressive neurodegeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurodegeneration, a hallmark of aging and neurodegenerative diseases, is characterized by irreversible loss of neurons, ultimately leading to cognitive and motor impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wilson et al., 2023</xref>). A common feature of neurodegeneration is the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, often resulting from the impairment of protein degradation machineries, particularly the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Davidson and Pickering, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kinger et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McDade et al., 2024</xref>). The UPS is essential for maintaining cellular proteostasis, as it not only eliminates misfolded and toxic proteins but also dynamically regulates neuronal structure and function through controlled protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Costa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Krishna et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Soykan et al., 2021</xref>). Substrate proteins targeted for proteasomal degradation are typically conjugated with K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, which interact non-covalently with ubiquitin receptors in the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pohl and Dikic, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Swatek and Komander, 2016</xref>). However, UPS activity can be compromised in neurodegeneration in multiple ways, including proteasome modifications, reduced ATP level, direct inhibition by amyloid fibrils, and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kinger et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McDade et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tseng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wilson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wojcik and Di Napoli, 2004</xref>). While these factors have been extensively studied in order to preserve proteasomal function, the dynamic changes of ubiquitin have been largely overlooked in the context of neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>Ubiquitin itself undergoes post-translational modifications that can alter its structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Herhaus and Dikic, 2015</xref>). One such modification is phosphorylation at residue S65, installed by the kinase PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Koyano et al., 2014</xref>). PINK1 can exist in two forms: the full-length PINK1 localized to the mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Okatsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Okatsu et al., 2013</xref>), and sPINK1, a cytosolic fragment cleaved from full-length PINK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Takatori et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yamano and Youle, 2013</xref>). Full-length PINK1 is activated in response to mitochondrial damages, subsequently phosphorylating ubiquitin and Parkin to initiate mitophagy—a neuroprotective process for the selective removal of damaged mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Koyano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Okatsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wilson et al., 2023</xref>). However, severe and persistent mitochondrial stress can also lead to mitophagy failure and sustained elevations of S65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pollock et al., 2024</xref>). Given the prevalence of mitochondrial dysfunction under neurodegenerative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wilson et al., 2023</xref>), pUb accumulation may result from the activation of full-length PINK1 but without effective mitophagy.</p>
<p>Alternatively, elevated pUb levels may arise from inhibited proteasomal degradation. The cytosolic sPINK1, processed from the full-length PINK1 by mitochondrial proteases, is normally rapidly degraded by the proteasome via the N-end rule pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Takatori et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yamano and Youle, 2013</xref>). As the UPS function is often compromised in neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wilson et al., 2023</xref>), sPINK1 may accumulate and phosphorylate ubiquitin, contributing to the increased pUb levels.</p>
<p>Elevated levels of pUb have been observed in aged human brain and in Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fiesel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Shiba-Fukushima et al., 2017</xref>). While pUb elevation has been proposed as a potential biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fiesel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hou et al., 2018</xref>), its functional role remains poorly understood. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have suggested that phosphorylation alters ubiquitin’s structural dynamics and may affect its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tang and Zhang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wauer et al., 2015a</xref>). Moreover, PINK1 phosphorylation has been shown to inhibit ubiquitin chain elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wauer et al., 2015b</xref>), and the phosphomimic mutant Ub/S65E has been show to inhibit protein turnover and reduce cell viability under stress conditions in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Swaney et al., 2015</xref>). As such, elevated pUb levels may actively contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>In the current study, we demonstrate that pUb levels are elevated in various neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), aging, and ischemic injury. Furthermore, we reveal that elevated pUb levels inhibit proteasomal activity, leading to protein aggregation and neuronal damages. Upon investigating the underlying mechanism at molecular, cellular and animal levels, we have uncovered a general pathogenic pathway involving pUb that operates across a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<title>Elevated pUb levels are a pervasive feature of neurodegeneration</title>
<p>Elevated pUb levels have been observed in the brains of individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fiesel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Shiba-Fukushima et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, we extend this observation to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative dementia. We found a marked elevation of both PINK1 and pUb in brain samples from AD patients in the cingulate gyrus brain regions with Aβ plaques, when compared to age- and sex-matched controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>; <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 1—table supplementary 1</xref>). This finding was corroborated in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, where increased PINK1 and pUb levels could be detected in neocortex of mouse brains with Aβ compared to wildtype mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref>). On the other hand, PINK1 and pUb levels in neocortex of wildtype and <italic>pink1</italic>-knockout mice (<italic>pink1-/-</italic>) differ little (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref>), which can be attributed to the low expression of PINK1 in normal mouse brains under physiological conditions.</p>

<p>Beyond the specific neurodegenerative diseases, pUb elevation also appears to be associated with aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fiesel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hou et al., 2018</xref>), a special pathological condition that is often accompanied by gradual neurodegeneration. The difference of PINK1 expression between young and aged mouse cortex was not distinguishable due to the low expression level and probably also due to specificity of PINK1 antibody used. However, we observed a significant increase in neuronal pUb levels in aged wildtype mouse compared to young mouse in neocortex of the brains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F</xref>). As a control, pUb levels in <italic>pink1</italic>-/- mice remained unchanged with age and were notably lower than those in aged wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F</xref>). As such, although the pUb antibody may not be highly specific, the observed increase in immunofluorescence and protein band intensities, when comparing across different <italic>pink1</italic> genetic background, can only be attributed to elevated pUb levels during aging.</p>
<p>We further showed that acute neurodegenerative conditions, such as cerebral ischemia, are also associated with elevated pUb levels. Using mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, we observed a marked increase in both PINK1 and pUb levels in the penumbra of mouse brains compared to the contralateral cortex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">figure 1—figure supplementary 1</xref>). To further explore the relationship between pUb and ischemic stress, we subjected HEK293 cells to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), a cellular model mimicking ischemic conditions. OGD followed by reperfusion caused a time-dependent increase in PINK1, sPINK1, and pUb levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Additionally, we observed an increase of protein aggregation, as evidenced by the accumulation of ubiquitin in the insoluble protein fraction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings demonstrate that elevated pUb levels are a common feature across a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative conditions, both chronic and acute. While our observation support the notion of pUb as a biomarker, the diverse functions of ubiquitin suggest that elevated pUb levels may actively contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration.</p>

<title>Ubiquitin phosphorylation by sPINK1 impairs proteasomal function in HEK293 cells</title>
<p>Elevated pUb levels can result from either elevated level of full-length PINK1 or sPINK1. PINK1 increase can occur upon mitochondrial injuries with the treatment of CCCP and O/A, and sPINK1 increase can occur upon proteasomal inhibition with the treatment of MG132 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The treatment of MG132 caused a concentration- and time-dependent increase in sPINK1 and pUb levels in wildtype HEK293 cells, with sPINK1 levels plateaued at 6 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B-E</xref>). In contrast, PINK1 and pUb levels remained low in <italic>pink1</italic>-knockout HEK293 cells upon the treatment of MG132 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B-E</xref>).</p>

<p>While PINK1 activation typically involves its dimerization at mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Okatsu et al., 2013</xref>), we investigated whether cytoplasmic sPINK1 retains activity of phosphorylating ubiquitin. We transiently transfected HEK293 cells with several PINK1 constructs: full-length PINK1, a cytoplasmic variant of sPINK1 that is more resistant to UPS degradation (sPINK1*, PINK1/F101M/L102-L581, differing from the native sequence by the N-terminal Met instead of Phe), a kinase-dead version of this stable variant (sPINK1*-KD, with K219A/D362A/D384A mutations introduced) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Beilina et al., 2005</xref>), and Ub<sup>GG</sup>-sPINK1, a short-lived version of native-sequence sPINK1 with a ubiquitin appended at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yamano and Youle, 2013</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of PINK1, sPINK1* and sPINK1*-KD following transfection, while Ub<sup>GG</sup>-sPINK1 was undetectable due to its rapid degradation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). The analysis also showed elevated pUb levels upon the transfection of full-length PINK1 and sPINK1*, with the latter more pronounced. In contrast, transfection with sPINK1*-KD or Ub<sup>GG</sup>-sPINK1 had little effect on pUb levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining revealed a diffuse cytoplasmic ubiquitin distribution in non-transfected or eGFP-transfected control cells. In contrast, ubiquitin-positive puncta were observed following MG132 treatment or upon the transfection of sPINK1* (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Weak ubiquitin-positive puncta were also visible in Ub<sup>GG</sup>-sPINK1-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, 5<sup>th</sup> row, indicated by arrows), likely due to a slight elevation in sPINK1 level. Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed that MG132 treatment and sPINK1* transfection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), but not sPINK1*-KD or Ub<sup>GG</sup>-sPINK1 transfection, increased ubiquitin levels in the insoluble protein fraction. These findings suggest a positive correlation between PINK1 and pUb levels and the aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins, which likely results from an impairment of proteasomal activity, akin to the effect of MG132.</p>

<p>To confirm the inhibitory effect of pUb on proteasomal activity, we transfected cells with Ub-R-GFP, a model substrate for the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dantuma et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Samant et al., 2018</xref>). GFP was rapidly degraded by functional proteasomes but accumulated upon the administration of MG132. Transfection with sPINK1* also caused GFP accumulation, but the transfection of sPINK1*-KD did not (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). Thus, sPINK1* transfection leads to increased pUb levels and impairs proteasomal degradation.</p>
<p>Elevated pUb levels may also lead to protein aggregation by inhibiting autophagic degradation. To assess the involvement of this pathway, we treated HEK293 cells with puromycin to increase ubiquitinated protein level, which can be degraded through both autophagic and UPS pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). The ubiquitin signal was significantly lower in the sPINK1*-transfected cells compared to neighboring non-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>), indicating that sPINK1* promotes the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. However, when we blocked autophagic degradation using BALA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mauvezin and Neufeld, 2015</xref>), ubiquitin signal was higher in the sPINK1*-transfected cells compared to non-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>), indicating sPINK1* inhibits the degradation of ubiquitinated protein. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that while sPINK1* can enhance autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, potentially through p62 phosphorylation as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gao et al., 2016</xref>), elevated PINK1 and pUb levels cause an inhibition of proteasomal degradation.</p>

<title>pUb impairs proteasomal activity through both covalent and noncovalent mechanisms</title>
<p>To elucidate how elevated pUb levels inhibit UPS activity, we first assessed ubiquitin chain formation <italic>in vitro</italic>. While the unmodified ubiquitin efficiently formed di-, tri-, and higher-order chains catalyzed by E1 and E2 enzymes, pUb predominantly formed di-Ub chains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wauer et al., 2015b</xref>). The introduction of S65A (phospho-null) and S65E (phospho-mimetic) ubiquitin mutants further confirmed the impact of phosphorylation—Ub/S65A mutation did not affect chain elongation, producing a polyUb ladder similar to unmodified ubiquitin, while Ub/S65E mutation only formed di-Ub (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we examined ubiquitin chain formation in HEK293 cells by expressing FLAG-Ub/48K, a ubiquitin mutant that can only form K48-linked ubiquitin chain. Upon proteasomal inhibition with MG132, K48-linked chains were observed in wildtype and <italic>pink1-/</italic>- cells, but were absent in cells over-expressing full-length PINK1 or sPINK1* (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), This further confirms the inhibitory effect of S65 phosphorylation on ubiquitin chain elongation.</p>
<p>Since PINK1 can phosphorylate both ubiquitin monomers and polyUb chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shiba-Fukushima et al., 2014</xref>), we next investigated how polyUb phosphorylation impacts proteasomal degradation. Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> degradation assay using purified proteasomes, we found that the degradation of K48-linked pUb-chain-modified GFP (pK48-polyUb-GFP) was slower compared to its unmodified counterpart (K48-polyUb-GFP) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">figure 3—figure supplementary 1, 2</xref>). Additionally, we employed total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, following an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lu et al., 2015</xref>), to assess interactions between ubiquitinated substrate proteins and immobilized proteasomes. The assay revealed fewer GFP puncta for pK48-polyUb-GFP compared to K48-polyUb-GFP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref><italic>, E,</italic> <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">figure 3—figure supplementary 3</xref>). Furthermore, the GFP puncta for pK48-polyUb-GFP dissociated more rapidly from the proteasomes, reflecting a shorter dwell time of the proteasome-substrate complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-I</xref>, <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">figure 3—figure supplementary 4</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation impairs the noncovalent interactions between polyUb chains conjugated to substrate proteins and the ubiquitin receptors residing in the proteasome.</p>
<p>Together, these findings demonstrate that elevated pUb levels disrupt proteasomal function through two distinct mechanisms: impairing covalent ubiquitin chain elongation and substrate ubiquitination, as well as weakening non-covalent interactions between ubiquitinated substrates and the proteasome. Both mechanisms collectively contribute to the inhibition of ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal activity.</p>

<title><italic>pink1</italic> knockout mitigates protein aggregation under neurodegenerative conditions</title>
<p>Having established the causative link between elevated pUb levels and proteasomal inhibition, we further explored the relationship with protein aggregation and whether <italic>pink1</italic> knockout mitigates this process. We treated wildtype and <italic>pink1-/-</italic> HEK293 cells with MG132, which increased insoluble ubiquitin levels in both cell types in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>). However, insoluble ubiquitin levels accumulated significantly slower in <italic>pink1-/-</italic> cells, though eventually reaching levels comparable to those in wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). This not only confirms that PINK1/pUb operates within the same pathway as MG132—the proteasome—but also demonstrates that PINK1 deficiency delays the accumulation of protein aggregates. MG132 treatment also elevated the levels LC3-II, a marker of autophagy, in wildtype cells, indicating either autophagy activation or reduced LC3 degradation in response to proteasomal inhibition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>). However, LC3-II levels did not increase in <italic>pink1-/-</italic> cells following MG132 treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>). This confirms the critical role of PINK1 in the activation of for autophagy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, <italic>pink1</italic> knockout mitigated protein aggregation in animal models. In young wildtype mouse brains, ubiquitin was evenly distributed in the neurons in neocortex, but formed ubiquitin positive puncta in aged wildtype mouse brains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed elevated levels of insoluble ubiquitin in the cortex of aged mice compared to young mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), further supporting age-related protein aggregation. In contrast, aged <italic>pink1-/-</italic> mice showed no such age-related changes in neuronal ubiquitin distribution or insoluble ubiquitin levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E, F</xref>). Following MCAO, insoluble ubiquitin levels were significantly elevated in the ipsilateral hemisphere of wildtype mice compared to sham and contralateral hemisphere, but remained unchanged in <italic>pink1-/-</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>
<p>Protein aggregation is a hallmark of aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hegde et al., 2023</xref>); it arises from perturbed proteostasis and can impair proteasomal activity in return. Acute proteasomal inhibition can also result from ischemia or pharmacological treatments. Since sPINK1 is rapidly degraded by functional proteasomes, impaired proteasomes can lead to the accumulation of sPINK1 and pUb, leading to further proteasomal inhibition. Together, our results reveal that <italic>pink1</italic> knockout disrupts this cycle, thereby alleviating proteasomal inhibition and mitigating protein aggregation under these conditions, further demonstrating the critical role of pUb in this process.</p>

<p>To extend our findings, we over-expressed sPINK1*, sPINK1* with Ub/S65A (sPINK1*+Ub/S65A), Ub/S65E, or GFP control in mouse hippocampal neurons using AAV2/9. Specific expression was confirmed through GFP co-localization with NeuN fluorescence in the CA1 region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure 5—figure supplementary 2</xref>). While no visible changes were observed at 10 days post-transfection, significant neuronal loss, based on NeuN immunofluorescence staining, was evident at 30 and 70 days in mice expressing Ub/S65E, but not in other three groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure 5—figure supplementary 2</xref>). Additionally, Ub/S65E induced glial responses at 30- and 70-days post-transfection, based on GFAP/Iba1 immunofluorescence staining and GFAP/CD11b Western blot bands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure 5—figure supplementary 3 and 4</xref>, respectively). In contrast, the sPINK1* and sPINK1*+Ub/S65A groups showed an increase in GFAP levels at 70-days post-transfection with no changes in Iba1or CD11b levels, suggesting potential neuronal injury (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure 5—figure supplementary 3, 4</xref>).</p>
<p>To explore the underlying mechanism for neuronal injury, we conducted proteomic analysis of mouse hippocampus at 30- and 70-days post-transfection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure 5—dataset supplementary 1</xref>). Although the total number of proteins identified was similar between the GFP and sPINK1* groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure 5—figure supplementary 5A-D</xref>), notable differences were observed. For example, the neuronal injury and neuroinflammation marker HMGB1 was elevated at both time points following sPINK1* over-expression, while the mitochondrial marker Tom20 showed a delayed decrease at 70 days, indicative of mitochondrial loss.</p>
<p>We also conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and found a time-dependent effect of sPINK1* over-expression on mitochondrial function. At 30-days, changes in proteins associated with mitophagy, mitochondrial organization, and respiratory electron transport were observed, suggesting an initial injury and compensatory response to mitochondrial stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure 5—figure supplementary 5E</xref>). By 70-days, these changes expanded to include broader mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic processes, ultimately leading to mitochondrial loss and neuronal injury (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure 5—figure supplementary 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed extensive proteomic dysregulation upon sPINK1* over-expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure 5—figure supplementary 5F-H</xref>). At 70-days post-transfection, a large number of proteins were either upregulated or downregulated, indicative of disrupted proteostasis. This can be attributed to proteasomal inhibition or stress response to increased protein aggregates. For example, we observed a significant up-regulation of RNA-binding and RNA-processing proteins. Significantly, many of the up-regulated proteins were associated with impaired synaptic functions and neuronal projections, while down-regulated proteins were linked to myelination, synaptic maturation, and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure 5—figure supplementary 5F-H</xref>). As these changes were insignificant at 30-days post-transfection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure 5—figure supplementary 5F-H</xref>), the proteomics data indicate a systemic and time-dependent impact upon sPINK1* over-expression on neuronal structure and function, leading to cumulative neuronal injury that mirrors the progressive pathogenesis of neurodegeneration.</p>

<title>Elevated pUb levels promote protein aggregation in mouse hippocampal neurons</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of sPINK1* over-expression on protein homeostasis, we measured the levels of PINK1 and pUb in the mouse hippocampus and evaluated protein aggregation at 30- and 70-days post-transfection. At 30-days following sPINK1* transfection, a distinct band for sPINK1 was observed, accompanied by a significant increase in pUb levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). At 70-days following sPINK1* transfection, three distinct bands could be observed that likely correspond to sPINK1, full-length PINK1, and ubiquitinated PINK1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The presence of full-length PINK1 indicates mitochondrial injury, and ubiquitinated PINK1 indicates compromised proteasomal activity. The pUb levels were increased by 43.8 % and 59.9 % compared to the control at 30- and 70-days following sPINK1* transfection, respectively. In comparison, the pUb level remained at the control level with the Ub/S65A mutant co-expressed with sPINK1* (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, Ub/S65A counteract the proteasomal inhibition induced by sPINK1*, thereby promoting the degradation of sPINK1* and prevent pUb accumulation.</p>
<p>Immunofluorescence staining revealed the formation of ubiquitin-positive puncta in hippocampal neurons over-expressing sPINK1*, sPINK1+Ub/S65A, or Ub/S65E (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The increase of ubiquitin levels in the soluble protein fraction of the hippocampus of brains from the sPINK1*+Ub/S65A group but not in the other groups likely reflects the antibody detection of over-expressed Ub/S65A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). On the other hand, the levels of ubiquitin in the insoluble protein fraction were significantly elevated in the sPINK1*, sPINK1*+Ub/S65A, and Ub/S65E groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Notably, proteins smaller than 70 kDa accumulated in the sPINK1* and Ub/S65E groups, indicating an inhibition of ubiquitin chain elongation, consistent with our findings obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), but not in the sPINK1*+Ub/S65A group. Furthermore, over-expression of Ub/S65E resulted in significant neuronal death and glial proliferation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 5-supplementary 2, 3, 4</xref>), despite that the overall pUb levels appear unchanged at 70 days post-transfection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>It should note that over-expression of sPINK1*, sPINK1*+Ub/S65A, or Ub/S65E had minimal effects on autophagic flux at the animal level, as evidenced by unchanged LC3-II and p62 levels in both soluble and insoluble protein fractions (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 5—figure supplementary 6</xref>). This contrasts with the findings in cultured cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, 4G</xref>), and suggests that, mechanistically, protein aggregation driven by elevated pUb levels primarily results from the inhibition of proteasomal degradation in the brains of animal or human with neurodegenerative conditions.</p>

<title>Elevated pUb levels impair neuronal integrity and cognitive function</title>
<p>At 70 days post-transfection with sPINK1*, we observed protein aggregation, mitochondrial injury, neuroinflammation and proteome-wide changes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 5-supplemenatary 2, 3, 4, 5</xref>). To assess the impact of elevated pUb levels on neuronal integrity and cognitive function, we performed behavioral tests on mice at 70-days post-transfection. Over-expression of sPINK1* or Ub/S65E significantly reduced the number of sniffs toward the novel object in novel object recognition test compared to the control mice or the old object (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>). In the fear conditioning test, over-expression of sPINK1* or Ub/S65E also significantly reduced freezing time compared to control mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C, D</xref>). These findings indicate that both sPINK1* and Ub/S65E over-expression impaired cognitive functions of mice. Moreover, co-expression of Ub/S65A with sPINK1* ameliorated sPINK1*-induced cognitive deficits, suggesting a protective effect against pUb-caused impairments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-D</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with the proteomics analysis (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 5—figure supplementary 5D</xref>), Western blot analysis showed decreased levels of Tom20, a mitochondrial marker, in brains over-expressing sPINK1* (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Notably, the mitochondrial deficit induced by sPINK1* over-expression could be reversed by co-expressing Ub/S65A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Furthermore, we observed reduced levels of MAP2, a dendritic marker, and PSD95, a postsynaptic density marker, in the hippocampus of mice over-expressing sPINK1* and Ub/S65E. The reductions could be restored by co-expressing Ub/S65A with sPINK1* (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F, G</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that sPINK1* over-expression induced neuronal injury originating from the nerve terminals, recapitulating neurodegenerative changes.

<title>sPINK1 over-expression inhibits CamKII-CREB pathway in the hippocampus</title>
<p>The inhibition of proteasomal activity not only impairs protein degradation but also disrupts protein activation by preventing the controlled removal of inhibitory proteins. Notably, our proteomics analysis revealed a &gt;54-fold increase in CamK2n1 (Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1, Uniprot Q6QWF9) upon sPINK1* over-expression. CamK2n1 is an endogenous inhibitor of CamKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gouet et al., 2012</xref>), and CamKII is essential for synapse formation, neuronal plasticity, and long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">O’Day, 2022</xref>). As illustrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, the activation of CamKII requires the targeted degradation of CamK2n1 by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Buard et al., 2010</xref>). Then, the increase of phosphorylated CamKII subsequently initiate the CREB signal pathway, representing a key mechanism in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Davidson and Pickering, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ortega-Martínez, 2015</xref>). The over-expression of sPINK1* increases pUb level, which can inhibit CamK2n1 degradation and suppress the activation of CamKII-CREB signal pathway.</p>

<p>Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the elevated CamK2n1 levels in hippocampus CA1 neurons at 70 days post-transfection of sPINK1* compared to the controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that elevated pUb levels are a common feature in both chronic and acute neurodegenerative conditions. While mitochondrial injury has been established as a mechanism that causes pUb elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lambourne et al., 2023</xref>), we have identified an additional pathway—the inhibition of proteasomal degradation leads to the stabilization of sPINK1 in the cytoplasm, where it remains active and phosphorylates ubiquitin.</p>
<p>Proteasomal inhibition can arise from many different pathological factors associated with neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wilson et al., 2023</xref>). For example, cerebral ischemia can cause ATP deficiency, and hypoxia and other secondary effect from oxidative stress can further modify the proteasome and impair its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wojcik and Di Napoli, 2004</xref>). In AD, amyloid fibrils can impair proteasomal activities by obstructing the proteasome’s substrate entry channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McDade et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tseng et al., 2008</xref>). Declined proteasomal activity slows the degradation of sPINK1, leading to the elevation of pUb levels in the cytoplasm. Indeed, the elevated pUb levels have been proposed as a biomarker of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fiesel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hou et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Using both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models, we demonstrate that elevated pUb levels, driven by sPINK1* over-expression, inhibit proteasomal activity and exacerbate protein aggregation. Conversely, <italic>pink1</italic> knockout reduced protein aggregation in aged mouse brains, brains subjected to MCAO, and HEK293 cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor. Mechanistically, we show that ubiquitin phosphorylation disrupts two critical processes: (1) the covalent elongation of ubiquitin chains, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wauer et al., 2015b</xref>), and (2) the non-covalent interaction between K48-linked polyUb chains and the proteasome, a novel finding in this study. This dual inhibitory mechanism interferes with the ubiquitination of substrate proteins, the recruitment of ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, and ultimately, the proteasomal degradation of substrate proteins. Impaired proteasomal activity further impedes sPINK1 degradation, creating a self-amplifying cycle that drives pUb elevation and progressive proteasomal dysfunction. Although cells have built-in stress responses to perturbation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hegde et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rai et al., 2025</xref>), the disruption caused by elevated pUb levels targets ubiquitin—the central player in the system—and is self-amplifying as proteasomal function deteriorates.</p>
<p>Extensive literature has reported that pUb plays a neuroprotective role, wherein PINK1 activation in response to mitochondrial damage results in the phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Parkin, initiating mitophagy to remove damaged mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwal and Muqit, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shiba-Fukushima et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, PINK1 deficiency has been linked to neurodegeneration, prompting the development of small-molecule activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hertz et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li et al., 2023</xref>). However, in the current study, over-expression of sPINK1 resulted in chronic neuronal injury, driven by the reciprocal relationship between proteasomal inhibition and pUb elevation. The progressive decline of proteasomal activity disrupts cellular proteostasis, leading to the accumulation of protein aggregates. In addition to the mechanism of causing mitochondrial damage and inflammation by the protein aggregates, impaired proteasomal activity hinders the degradation of inhibitory proteins and consequently block the activation of key signaling pathways essential for neurogenesis and memory formation. Collectively, our findings reveal that PINK1 can function beyond the established role in mitophagy, and elevated pUb levels are not simply a biomarker of neurodegeneration but a driving force behind progressive neuronal injury and neuroinflammation.</p>
<p>The neurotoxic effect upon sPINK1 over-expression is mediated through the ubiquitin phosphorylation. Co-expression of the phospho-null mutant Ub/S65A restored proteasomal activity and even promoted the degradation of the rather stable sPINK1 variant used in the current study. Additionally, Ub/S65A co-expression permitted the formation of longer polyUb chains, further supporting its role in antagonizing ubiquitin phosphorylation. In contrast, over-expression of the phospho-mimetic Ub/S65E mutant caused more severe neuronal damage than sPINK1* over-expression. The difference can be attributed to the 100% increase in pUb mimicry with Ub/S65E, whereas sPINK1*-induced pUb levels are relatively low and subjected to dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Similar toxic effects of Ub/S65E over-expression has been reported in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Swaney et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, sPINK1* can phosphorylate both free and substrate-conjugated Ub, whereas Ub/S65E only mimics monomeric pUb, further contributing to the heightened detrimental effects of the Ub/S65E mutant.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings have revealed a novel pathogenetic mechanism of neurodegeneration, driven by a self-amplifying cycle of elevated pUb levels and proteasomal inhibition. This cycle leads to the progressive decline of proteasomal activity and the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates, which may underlie both the sequelae of acute insults and the chronic progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Our results demonstrate that pUb is not merely a consequence of this process but also a critical driver of disease progression. Therefore, targeting the pUb-mediated self-amplifying cycle represents a promising therapeutic strategy to slow or halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<title>The construction of Ub-R-GFP plasmid</title>
<p>The Ub-R-GFP is used for the <italic>in vivo</italic> measurement of proteasomal degradation activity, and constructed according to a previous report(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dantuma et al., 2000</xref>). Briefly, the ubiquitin open reading frame was amplified by PCR with the following primers:</p>
<p>Sense primer: 5’-GCG GAATTCACCATGCAGATCTTCGTGAAGACT-3’</p>
<p>Antisense primer:</p>
<p>5’-GCG GGATCCTGTCGACCAAGCTTCCCGCGCCCACCTCTGAGACGGAGTAC-3’</p>
<p>The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the EGFP-N2 vector. Beside the R residue, a 12 amino acid peptide was inserted between ubiquitin and GFP to increase the proteasomal degradation. Thus, the final product is Ub-R-GKLGRQDPPVAT-GFP. The accumulation of GFP protein was determined using Western blot, reflecting proteasomal degradation activity.</p>

K48-linked di-ubiquitin and tetra-ubiquitin were prepared following an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pickart and Raasi, 2005</xref>), with the conjugation reaction catalyzed by 2.5 μM ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (Uniprot P22314) and 20 μM ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25K (Uniprot P61086), in 20 mM pH 8.0 Tris-HCl buffer. Ub/K48R mutant was incorporated as the distant Ub, and Ub/77D mutant was incorporated as the proximal ubiquitin to prepare ubiquitin chain of the desired length. The residue D77 at the C-terminus was removed with hydrolase YUH1. The fusion protein His-TEV-Ub-GFP was prepared recombinantly based on the design previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dantuma et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Inobe et al., 2011</xref>).

The proteasome activity was assessed with a fluorogenic peptide, N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin (Sigma, Massachusetts, USA; S6510). A final concentration of 100 nM proteasome and 100 μM proteasome peptide substrate was prepared in the reaction buffer, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 4 mM ATP (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# A6559) and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The fluorescence intensity of the product was measured by a fluorometer (Horiba Scientific, FluoroMax-4) at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm.</p>
<p>For Western blot analysis of GFP, 200 nM proteasomal substrate and 10 nM human 26S proteasome were prepared in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 buffer, with 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM ATP, and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The mixture was incubated at 37 ° C for 0, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. At each time point, 20 µL samples were taken for Western blot analysis.

<title>TIRF analysis of ubiquitin-proteasome interaction</title>
<p>The coverslips were prepared following an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Roy et al., 2008</xref>). Each coverslip was divided into multiple lanes with double-sided tape for parallel detection of the transient association of K48-polyUb-GFP or pK48-polyUb-GFP in the TIRF experiments, thus to ensure repeatability with different proteins added to the same slide. Streptavidin (VWR Life Science, Cat# 97062-808) in imaging buffer at a concentration of 50 µg/ml was loaded; excess unbound streptavidin was washed away. The imaging buffer contains 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 40 mM imidazole, 5 m/mL BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), 2.5 mM ADP (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.5 mM ATP-γ-S (Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lu et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The purified human 26S proteasome at 20 nM in the imaging buffer was added to the streptavidin-immobilized coverslip, with excess unbound proteins washed away with the imaging buffer. The substrate protein, either K48-polyUb-GFP or pK48-polyUb-GFP, was then added to the coverslip to a final concentration of 400 pM. The imaging was performed on a Nikon A1 TIRF microscope equipped with a 488 nm laser and an EMCCD camera (Andor DU-897). The time series were acquired at 300 ms per frame for a total duration of 2 min for each time series. The view area was 512 pixels by 512 pixels (16 by 16 µm), and the experiments were repeated four times on four different proteasome-immobilized cover slides.</p>
<p>Only when K48-polyUb-GFP or pK48-polyUb-GFP is associated with the immobilized proteasome, the green puncta can be observed. The puncta density was counted in iSMS software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Preus et al., 2015</xref>) with default settings. The time series of puncta with brightness above a certain threshold (≥ 3000 a.u.) was captured and the dwell time of more than three consecutive frames are selected for counting the overall number of puncta.

The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected as whole tissue extract. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford protein assay. Extracts from the protein sample (2 g) were trypsin digested.</p>
<p>The enriched peptides sample were precipitated in solution A (0.1% formic acid), and was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min. The peptides were separated on a reverse-phase nano-HPLC C18 column (Precolumn, 3 µm, 120 Å, 2×100 i.d.; analysis column, 1.9 µm 120 Å, 30 cm x150 µm, i.d.) at a flow rate of 600 nL/min with a 150 min gradient of 7-95% solution B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). For peptide ionization, 2100 V was applied, and a 320 °C capillary temperature was used. For detection with Q Exactive HF, peptides were analyzed with one full scan (350–1400 m/z, R = 120,000 at 200 m/z) with an automatic gain control target of 3×10<sup>6</sup> ions, with max injection time of 80 ms, followed by up to 30 data-dependent MS/MS scans with high-energy collision dissociation (target 5 x10<sup>4</sup> ions, max injection time 19 ms, isolation window 1.6 m/z, normalized collision energy of 27%), detected in the Orbitrap (R = 15,000 at 200 m/z). Dynamic exclusion time was set as 30 sec.</p>
<p>Raw MS data were searched against the mouse National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Refseq protein database (updated on 2013/07/01, 29764 entries) by the software Thermo Proteome Discoverer 2.1 using Mascot 2.3. The mass tolerances were 20 ppm for precursor and 50 mmu for product ions for Q Exactive HF. The search engine set Acetyl(Protein N-term), oxidation(M), Phospho(ST), Phospho(Y) as variable modifications. Trypsin digestion of up to two missed cleavages was allowed. The peptide identifications were accepted at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. Using a label-free approach, a unique peptide was used to represent the absolute abundance of a particular peptide across the sample.</p>
<p>For the proteomic data analysis, quantile normalization was applied to eliminate batch effect, and missing values were imputed using the minimum value observed in the dataset. The differentially expressed proteins were defined with the following these criteria: an increase by more than two-fold or decrease by more than 50%. For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was conducted by GSEApy (version 0.10.5) Python package to evaluate the enriched GO terms. The association of proteins with GO terms was derived from the DAVID database. For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), the ranking metric used was the fold change, and significantly enriched GO terms were filtered with a cutoff <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.05.</p>

The study shows that increased pUb impairs proteasomal degradation, leading to protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. The authors also demonstrate that PINK1 knockout can mitigate protein aggregation in aging and ischemic mouse brains, as well as in cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor. While this study provided some interesting data, several important points should be addressed before being further consideration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Reveals a novel pathological mechanism of neurodegeneration mediated by pUb, providing a new perspective on understanding neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>(2) The study covers not only a single disease model but also various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, aging, and ischemic injury, enhancing the breadth and applicability of the research findings.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>This study, through a systematic experimental design, reveals the crucial role of pUb in forming a positive feedback loop by inhibiting proteasome activity in neurodegenerative diseases. The data are comprehensive and highly innovative. However, some of the results are not entirely convincing, particularly the staining results in Figure 1.</p>
<p>In Figure 1A, the density of DAPI staining differs significantly between the control patient and the AD patient, making it difficult to conclusively demonstrate a clear increase in PINK1 in AD patients. Quantitative analysis is needed. In Fig 1C, the PINK1 staining in the mouse brain appears to resemble non-specific staining.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript discusses the role of phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb) by PINK1 kinase in neurodegenerative diseases. It reveals that elevated levels of pUb are observed in aged human brains and those affected by Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as in Alzheimer's disease (AD), aging, and ischemic injury. The study shows that increased pUb impairs proteasomal degradation, leading to protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. The authors also demonstrate that PINK1 knockout can mitigate protein aggregation in aging and ischemic mouse brains, as well as in cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor. While this study provided some interesting data, several important points should be addressed before being further considered.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Reveals a novel pathological mechanism of neurodegeneration mediated by pUb, providing a new perspective on understanding neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>(2) The study covers not only a single disease model but also various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, aging, and ischemic injury, enhancing the breadth and applicability of the research findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) PINK1 has been reported as a kinase capable of phosphorylating Ubiquitin, hence the expected outcome of increased p-Ub levels upon PINK1 overexpression. Figures 5E-F do not demonstrate a significant increase in Ub levels upon overexpression of PINK1 alone, whereas the evident increase in Ub expression upon overexpression of S65A is apparent. Therefore, the notion that increased Ub phosphorylation leads to protein aggregation in mouse hippocampal neurons is not yet convincingly supported.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, overexpression of sPINK1 alone resulted in minimal changes in Ub levels in the soluble fraction (Figure 5E), which is expected given that the soluble Ub pool remains relatively stable and buffered. However, sPINK1* overexpression led to a marked increase in Ub levels in the insoluble fraction, indicative of increased protein aggregation (Figure 5F). The molecular weight distribution of Ub in the insoluble fraction was predominantly below 70 kDa, suggesting that phosphorylation inhibits Ub chain elongation.</p>
<p>To further validate this mechanism, we utilized the Ub/S65A mutant to antagonize Ub phosphorylation and observed a significant reduction in the intensity of aggregated bands at low molecular weights, indicating restored proteasomal activity. The observed increase in Ub levels in the soluble fraction upon Ub/S65A overexpression is likely due to enhanced ubiquitination driven by elevated Ub-S65A, and notably, Ub/S65A was also detectable using an antibody against wild-type Ub.</p>
<p>Consistent with these findings, overexpression of Ub/S65E resulted in a further increase in Ub levels in the insoluble fraction, with intensified low molecular weight bands. The effect was even more pronounced than that observed with sPINK1 transfection, likely resulting from the complete phosphorylation mimicry achieved by Ub/S65E, compared to the relatively low levels of phosphorylation by PINK1.</p>
<p>These findings collectively support the conclusion that sPINK1 promotes protein aggregation via Ub phosphorylation. We have updated the Results and Discussion sections to more clearly present the data and explain the various controls.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The specificity of PINK1 and p-Ub antibodies requires further validation, as a series of literature indicate that the expression of the PINK1 protein is relatively low and difficult to detect under physiological conditions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the challenges in achieving high specificity with commercially available and customgenerated antibodies targeting PINK1 and pUb, particularly given their low endogenous expression under physiological conditions. However, in our study, we observed robust immunofluorescent staining for PINK1 (Figures 1A, 1C, and 1G) and pUb (Figures 1B, 1D, and 1G) in human brain samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as well as in mouse models of AD and cerebral ischemia. The clear visualization can be partly attributed to the pathological upregulation of PINK1 and pUb under disease conditions. Importantly, the images from pink1<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit much weaker staining.</p>
<p>Additionally, we detected a significant elevation in the pUb levels in aged mouse brains compared to younger ones (Figures 1E and 1F). In contrast, pink1<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed no change in pUb levels with aging, despite some background signals, demonstrating that pUb accumulation during aging is PINK1dependent. Collectively, these results support the specificity of the antibodies used in detecting pathophysiological changes in PINK1 and pUb levels.</p>
<p>For cultured cells, pink1<sup>-/-</sup> cells served as a negative control for both PINK1 (Figures 2B and 2C) and pUb (Figures 2D and 2E). While the pUb Western blot exhibited some nonspecific background, pUb levels in pink1<sup>-/-</sup> cells remained unchanged across all MG132 treatment conditions (Figures 2D and 2E), further attesting the usability of the antibodies in conjunction with appropriated controls.</p>
<p>We have updated the manuscript with higher-resolution images; individual image files have been uploaded separately.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 6, relying solely on Western blot staining and Golgi staining under high magnification is insufficient to prove the impact of PINK1 overexpression on neuronal integrity and cognitive function. The authors should supplement their findings with immunostaining results for MAP2 or NeuN to demonstrate whether neuronal cells are affected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We included NeuN immunofluorescent staining at 10, 30, and 70 days post transfection in Figure 5— figure supplement 2. The results clearly demonstrate a significant loss of NeuN-positive cells in the hippocampus following Ub/S65E overexpression, while no apparent reduction was observed with sPINK1 transfection alone.</p>
<p>We have also quantified MAP2 protein levels via Western blotting and examined morphology of neuronal dendrite and synaptic structure using Golgi staining. These analyses revealed a significant reduction in MAP2 levels and synaptic damage upon sPINK1 or Ub/S65E overexpression (Figures 6F and 6H), consistent with the proteomics analysis (Figure 5—figure supplementary 5). Notably, these detrimental effects could be rescued by co-expression of Ub/S65A, reinforcing the role of pUb in mediating these structural changes.</p>
<p>Together, our findings from NeuN immunostaining, MAP2 protein analysis, proteomics analysis, and Golgi staining provide strong evidence for the impact of PINK1 overexpression and pUb elevation on neuronal integrity and synaptic structure.</p>

<p>(4) The authors should provide more detailed figure captions to facilitate the understanding of the results depicted in the figures.</p>

<p>Figure captions have been updated with more details incorporated in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) While the study proposes that pUb promotes neurodegeneration by affecting proteasomal function, the specific molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways remain to be elucidated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways through which pUb promotes neurodegeneration are likely multifaceted and interconnected. Our findings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role following sPINK1* overexpression. This is supported by (1) an observed increase in full-length PINK1, indicative of impaired mitochondrial quality control, and (2) proteomic data showing enhanced mitophagy at 30 days post-transfection, followed by substantial mitochondrial injuries at 70 days post-transfection (Figure 5—figure supplement 5 and Supplementary Data). The progressive mitochondrial damage caused by protein aggregates would exacerbate neuronal injury and degeneration.</p>
<p>Additionally, reduced proteasomal activity may lead to the accumulation of inhibitory proteins that are normally degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our proteomics analysis identified a &gt;50fold increase in CamK2n1 (UniProt ID: Q6QWF9), an endogenous inhibitor of CaMKII activation, following sPINK1* overexpression. The accumulation of CamK2n1 suppresses CaMKII activation, thereby inhibiting the CREB signaling pathway (Figure 7), which is essential for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. This disruption can further contribute to neurodegenerative processes.</p>
<p>Thus, our findings underscore the complexity of pUb-mediated neurodegeneration and call for further investigation into downstream consequences.</p>

<p>Suggestions for improved or additional experiments, data or analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have performed additional experiments to investigate how the impairment of ubiquitinproteasomal activity contributes to neurodegeneration. Specifically, we investigated CamK2n1, an endogenous inhibitor of CaMKII, which is normally degraded by the proteasome to allow CaMKII activation. Our proteomics analysis revealed a significant (&gt;50-fold) elevation of CamKI2n1 following sPINK1 overexpression (Figure 5—figure supplement 5 and Supplementary Data).</p>
<p>To validate this mechanism, we conducted immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses, demonstrating reduced levels of phosphorylated CaMKII (pCaMKII) and phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), as well as reduced levels of downstream proteins such as BDNF and ERK. These results have been incorporated into the revised manuscript (Figure 7).</p>
<p>As the proteasome is crucial in maintaining proteostasis, its dysregulation would trigger neurodegeneration through multiple pathways, contributing to a broad cascade of pathological events.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript makes the claim that pUb is elevated in a number of degenerative conditions including Alzheimer's Disease and cerebral ischemia. Some of this is based on antibody staining which is poorly controlled and difficult to accept at this point. They confirm previous results that a cytosolic form of PINK1 accumulates following proteasome inhibition and that this can be active. Accumulation of pUb is proposed to interfere with proteostasis through inhibition of the proteasome. Much of the data relies on over-expression and there is little support for this reflecting physiological mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is poorly written. I appreciate this may be difficult in a non-native tongue, but felt that many of the problems are organizational. Less data of higher quality, better controls and incision would be preferable. Overall the referencing of past work is lamentable. Methods are also very poor and difficult to follow.</p>
<p>Until technical issues are addressed I think this would represent an unreliable contribution to the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) Antibody specificity and detection under pathological conditions</p>
<p>We recognize the limitations of commercially available antibodies for detecting PINK1 and pUb. Nevertheless, our findings reveal a significant elevation in PINK1 and pUb levels under pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and ischemia. Additionally, we observed an increase in pUb level during brain aging, further demonstrating its relevance and a potentially causative role for this special pathological condition. Similarly, elevated pUb levels were observed for cultured cells following pharmacological treatment or oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD).</p>
<p>In contrast, in pink1<sup>-/-</sup> mice and HEK293 cells used as negative controls, PINK1 and pUb levels remained consistently low. Therefore, the observed elevation of PINK1 and pUb are associated with special pathological conditions, rather than an antibody-detection anomaly.</p>
<p>(2) Overexpression as a model for pathological conditions</p>
<p>To investigate whether the inhibitory effects of sPINK1 on the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) depend on its kinase activity, we employed a kinase-dead version of sPINK1* as a negative control. Given that PINK1 targets multiple substrates, we also investigated whether its effects on UPS inhibition were specifically mediated by ubiquitin phosphorylation. To this end, we used Ub/S65A (a phospho-null mutant) to block Ub phosphorylation by sPINK1, and Ub/S65E (a phospho-mimetic mutant) to mimic phosphorylated Ub. These well-defined controls ensured the robustness of our conclusions.</p>
<p>Although overexpression does not perfectly replicate physiological conditions, it provides a valuable model for studying pathological scenarios such as neurodegeneration and brain aging, where pUb levels are elevated. For example, we observed a 30.4% increase in pUb levels in aged mouse brains compared to young brains (Figure 1F). Similarly, in our sPINK1 overexpression model, pUb levels increased by 43.8% and 59.9% at 30- and 70-days post-transfection, respectively, compared to controls (Figures 5A and 5C). Notably, co-expression of sPINK1* with Ub/S65A almost entirely prevented sPINK1* accumulation (Figure 5B), indicating that an active UPS can efficiently degrade this otherwise stable variant of sPINK1.</p>
<p>Together, our findings demonstrate that sPINK1 accumulation inhibits UPS activity, an effect that can be reversed by the phospho-null Ub mutant. The overexpression model mimics pathological conditions and provides valuable insights into pUb-mediated proteasomal dysfunction.</p>
<p>(3) Organization of the manuscript</p>
<p>Following your suggestion, we have restructured the manuscript to present the key findings in a more logical and cohesive sequence:</p>
<p>(a) Evidence for elevated PINK1 and pUb levels across a broad spectrum of pathological and neurodegenerative conditions;</p>
<p>(b) The effects of pUb elevation in cultured cells, focusing on the proteasome;</p>
<p>(c) Mechanistic insights into how pUb elevation inhibits proteasomal activity;</p>
<p>(d) The absence of PINK1 and pUb alleviates protein aggregation;</p>
<p>(e) Evidence for the causative relationship between elevated pUb levels and proteasomal inhibition;</p>
<p>(f) Demonstration that pUb elevation directly contributes to neuronal degeneration;</p>
<p>(g) Give an additional evidence to explain the mechanism of neuronal degeneration post sPINK1* over-expression. The downstream effects of elevated CamK2n1, an inhibitor of CaMKII, resulting from proteasomal inhibition.</p>
<p>This reorganization should ensure a clear and progressive narrative, and enhance the overall coherence and impact of the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>(4) Revisions to writing, referencing, and methodology</p>
<p>We have made a great effort to enhance the clarity and flow of the manuscript, including the addition of references to appropriately acknowledge prior work. We have also expanded the Methods section with additional details to improve readability and ensure reproducibility. We believe these revisions effectively address the concerns raised and strengthen the overall quality of the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Figure 1: PINK1 is a poorly expressed protein and difficult to detect by Western blot let alone by immunofluorescence. I have direct experience of the antibody used in this study and do not consider it reliable. There are much cleaner reagents out there, although they still have many challenges. The minimal requirement here is for the PINK1 antibody staining to be compared in wild-type and knockout mice. One would also expect to see a mitochondrial staining which would require higher magnification to be definitive, but it does not look like it to me. This is a key foundational figure and is unreliable. The pUb antibody also has a high background, see for example figure 2E.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Under physiological conditions, PINK1 and pUb levels are indeed low, making their detection challenging. However, under pathological conditions, their expression is significantly elevated, correlating with disease severity. Given the limitations of available reagents, using appropriate controls is a standard approach in biological research.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we observed robust immunofluorescent staining for PINK1 (Figures 1A, 1C, and 1G) and pUb (Figures 1B, 1D, and 1G) in human brain samples from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and mouse models of AD and cerebral ischemia. Compared to healthy controls, the significant elevation of PINK1 and pUb under these pathological conditions accounts for their clear visualization. To validate antibody specificity, we have included images from pink1<sup>-/-</sup> mice as negative controls (Figure 1C and 1D, third panel).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we analyzed pUb levels in both young and aged mice, using pink1<sup>-/-</sup> mice as controls.</p>
<p>Our results revealed a significant increase in pUb levels in aged wild-type mice (Figures 1E and 1F), In contrast, pink1<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited relatively low pUb levels, with no notable change between young and aged groups. These findings reinforce the conclusion that pUb accumulation during aging is dependent on PINK1.Furthermore, we analyzed pUb levels in both young and aged mice, using pink1<sup>-/-</sup> mice as controls.</p>
<p>For HEK293 cells, pink1<sup>-/-</sup> cells were used as a negative control for assessing PINK1 (Figures 2B and 2C) and pUb levels (Figures 2D and 2E). While the pUb Western blot did show some nonspecific background, as you have noted, pUb levels significantly increased following MG132 treatment of the wildtype cells. In contrast, no such increase was observed in pink1<sup>-/-</sup> cells (Figure 2D and 2E). These results further validate the reliability of our findings.</p>
<p>Regarding mitochondrial staining, we recognize that PINK1 localization can vary depending on the pathological context. For example, in Alzheimer’s disease, PINK1 exhibits relatively high nuclear staining, while in cerebral ischemia and brain aging, it is predominantly cytoplasmic and punctate. In contrast, in young, healthy mouse brains, PINK1 is more uniformly distributed. The observed elevation in pUb levels could arise from mitochondrial PINK1 or soluble sPINK1 in the cytoplasm, and it remains unclear whether nuclear PINK1 contributes to pUb accumulation. Investigating the role of PINK1 in different forms and subcellular localizations will be an important avenue for future research.</p>
<p>To enhance clarity, we have updated our images and replaced them with higher-resolution versions in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Please also confirm that the GAPDH loading controls represent the same gels, to my eye they do not match.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have reviewed all the bands, and confirmed that the GAPDH loading controls correspond to the same gels. For different gels, we use separate GAPDH loading controls. There are two experimental scenarios to consider:</p>
<p>(1) When there is a large difference in molecular weight between target proteins, we cut the gel into sections and incubate each section with different antibodies separately.</p>
<p>(2) When the molecular weight difference is small and cutting is not feasible, we first probe the membrane with one antibody, strip it, and then re-incubate the membrane with a second antibody.</p>
<p>These approaches ensure accurate and reliable detection of target proteins with various molecular weights relative to GAPDH.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, the elevation of sPINK1 and pUb upon proteasomal inhibition has been previously reported, and these studies have been acknowledged (Gao, et al, 2016; Dantuma, et al, 2000). In the present study, we expand on these findings by conducting a detailed analysis of the time- and concentrationdependent effects of MG132 on sPINK1 and pUb levels, establishing a causative relationship between pUb accumulation and proteasomal inhibition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that sPINK1 overexpression and MG132-induced proteasomal inhibition exhibit no additive effect, indicating that both converge on the same pathway, resulting in the impairment of proteasomal activity.</p>
<p>It has been established that ubiquitin phosphorylation inhibits Ub chain elongation (Wauer, et al, 2015). However, our study provides novel insights by identifying an additional mechanism: phosphorylated Ub also interferes with the noncovalent interactions between Ub chain and Ub receptors in the proteasome, which further contributes to the impairment of UPS function.</p>
<p>The PINK1 kinase-dead mutant construction (Figure 2F) and the use of Ub-GFP as a proteasomal substrate were based on established methodologies, which have been appropriately cited in the manuscript (Beilina, etal 2005 for KD sPINK1; Yamano, et al for endogenous PINK1; Samant, et al, 2018 and Dantuma, et al, 2000 for Ub-GFP probe). Similarly, our use of puromycin and BALA treatments follows previously reported protocols (Gao, et al, 2016), which allowed us to dissect the relative contributions of sPINK1* overexpression to proteasomal vs. autophagic dysfunction.</p>
<p>As you have noted, our study has built upon prior findings while introducing new mechanistic insights into sPINK1 and pUb-mediated proteasomal dysfunction.</p>

<p>2C 24h MG132 not recommended, most cells are dead by then.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used MG132 treatment for 24 hours to evaluate the time-course effects of proteasomal inhibition on PINK1 and pUb levels in HEK293 cells (Figures 2C and 2E). We did observe some decrease in both PINK1 and pUb levels at 24 hours compared to 12 hours, which may result from some extend of cell death at the longer treatment duration.</p>
<p>In SH-SY5Y cells, we collected cells at 24 hours after MG132 administration (Figure 5—figure supplementary 1). Though protein aggregation was evident in these cells, we did not observe pronounced cell death under these conditions, justifying our treatment.</p>
<p>Our findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that MG132 at 5 µM for 24 hours effectively induces proteasomal inhibition without substantial cytotoxicity. For example, studies using human esophageal squamous cancer cells have reported that this treatment condition inhibits cell proliferation while maintaining cell viability, with cell viability &gt;70% after 24-hour treatment with 5 µM MG132 (Int J Mol Med 33: 1083-1088, 2014).</p>
<p>MG132 has been commonly used at concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 µM for durations of 1 to 24 hours, as stated at the vendor’s website （<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cellsignal.com/products/activatorsinhibitors/mg-132/2194">https://www.cellsignal.com/products/activatorsinhibitors/mg-132/2194</ext-link>）.</p>

<p>2I what is BALA do they mean bafilomycin. This is a v-ATPase inhibitor, not just an autophagy inhibitor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment regarding the use of BALA in Figure 2I. To clarify, BALA refers to bafilomycin A1, a well-established v-ATPase inhibitor that blocks lysosomal acidification. While bafilomycin A1 is commonly used as an autophagy inhibitor, its primary mechanism involves inhibiting lysosomal function, which is critical for autophagosome-lysosome fusion and subsequent degradation of autophagic cargo.</p>
<p>In our study, we used bafilomycin A1 in conjunction with puromycin to dissect the relative contributions of sPINK1 overexpression on proteasomal and autophagic activities. Puromycin induces protein misfolding and aggregation, causing stress on both degradation pathways. By inhibiting lysosomal function with bafilomycin A1 and blocking the protein degradation load at various stages, we can tell the relative contributions of autophagy and UPS pathways.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that bafilomycin A1’s effects extend beyond autophagy, as it also inhibits v-ATPase activity. However, its inhibition of lysosomal degradation is integral to distinguishing autophagy’s contribution under the experimental conditions, and BALA treatment has been used in extensively in previous studies (Mauvezin and Neufeld, 2015).</p>
<p>We have further clarified this treatment in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Figure 3. Legend or text needs to be more explicit about how chains have been produced. From what I can gather from methods only a single E2 has been trialed. Authors should use at least one of the criteria used by Wauer et al. (2014) to confirm the stoichiometry of phosphorylation. The concept that pUb can interfere with E2 discharging is not new, but not universal across E2s.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have cited in the manuscript that PINK1-mediated ubiquitin phosphorylation can interfere with ubiquitin chain elongation for certain E2 enzymes (Wauer et al., 2015).</p>
<p>To clarify, the focus of our current work is on how elevation of Ub phosphorylation impacts UPS activity, rather than exploring the broader effects of Ub phosphorylation on Ub chain elongation. For this reason, we have used the standard E2 that is well-established for generating K48-linked polyUb chain (Pickart CM, 2005). Moreover, our findings go further and by demonstrate that phosphorylated K48-linked polyubiquitin exhibits weaker non-covalent interactions with proteasomal ubiquitin receptors. This dual effect—on both covalent chain elongation and non-covalent interactions— contributes to the observed reduction in ubiquitin-proteasome activity, a novel aspect of our study.</p>
<p>To address the reviewer’s concerns, we have added details in the Methods section and figure legends regarding the generation of ubiquitin chains. Specifically, we used ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (UniProt ID: P22314) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25K (UniProt ID: P61086) to generate K48-linked ubiquitin chains.</p>
<p>Our ESI-MS analysis showed that only 1–2 phosphoryl groups were incorporated into the K48-linked tetra-ubiquitin chains (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). This is consistent with our in vivo findings, where pUb levels increased by 30.4% in aged mouse brains compared to young brains (Figure 1F). Notably, even sub-stoichiometric phosphorylation onto the K48-linked ubiquitin chain significantly weakens the non-covalent interactions with the proteasome (Figures 3E and 3H).</p>

<p>Figure 4. I could find no definition of the insoluble fraction, nor details on how it is prepared.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The insoluble fraction primarily contains proteins that are aggregated or associated with hydrophobic interactions and cannot be solubilized by RIPA buffer. We have provided more details in the Methods of the revised manuscript about how the insoluble fraction was prepared. Our approach was based on established protocols for fractionating soluble and insoluble proteins from brain tissues (Wirths, 2017). Here is an outline of the procedure, which enables the separation and subsequent analysis of distinct protein populations:</p>
<p>• Lysis and preparation of soluble fraction: Cells and brain tissues were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, cat# P0013B) containing protease (P1005) and phosphatase inhibitors (P1081) on ice for 30 minutes, with gentle vortexing every 10 minutes. Brain samples were homogenized using a precooled TissuePrep instrument (TP-24, Gering Instrument Company). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was collected as the soluble protein fraction.</p>
<p>• Preparation of insoluble fraction: The pellet was resuspended in 20 µl of SDS buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and subjected to ultrasonic pyrolysis at 4°C for 8 cycles (10 seconds ultrasound, 30 seconds interval). The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant obtained after this step was designated as the insoluble protein fraction.</p>

<p>Figure 5. What is the transfection efficiency? How many folds is sPINK1 over-expressed? Typically, a neuron will have only a few hundred copies of PINK1 at the basal state. How much mutant ubiquitin is expressed relative to wild type, seeing the free ubiquitin signals on the gels might be helpful here, but they seem to have been cut off.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's insightful comments regarding transfection efficiency, the extent of sPINK1 overexpression, and the expression levels of mutant ubiquitin relative to wild-type ubiquitin. Below, we provide detailed responses to each point:</p>
<p>Transfection Efficiency: Our immunofluorescent staining for NeuN, a neuronal marker, demonstrated that over 90% of NeuN-positive cells were co-localized with GFP (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), indicating a high transfection efficiency in our neuronal cultures.</p>
<p>Extent of sPINK1 Overexpression: Quantifying the exact fold increase of sPINK1 upon overexpression is inherently difficult due to its low basal expression under physiological conditions, making the relative increase difficult to measure (small denominator effect). However, our Western blot analysis shows that ischemic events can cause a substantial elevation of PINK1 levels, including both full-length and cleaved forms (Figure 1H). This suggests that our overexpression model recapitulates the pathological increase in PINK1, making it a relevant system for studying disease mechanisms.</p>
<p>From Figure 5B, it is evident that sPINK1 levels differ significantly between neurons overexpressing sPINK1 alone and those co-expressing sPINK1 + Ub/S65A (70 days post-transfection). Overexpression of sPINK1 alone results in multiple PINK1 bands, consistent with sPINK1, endogenous PINK1 (induced by mitochondrial damage), and ubiquitinated sPINK1. In comparison, co-expressing Ub/S65A leads to faint PINK1 bands, suggesting that in the presence of a functionally restored proteasome, overexpressed sPINK1 is rapidly degraded. Therefore, actual accumulation of sPINK1 depends on proteasomal activity, and the “over-expressed” PINK1 level can be comparable to levels observed under native, pathological conditions.</p>
<p>Expression Levels of Mutant Ubiquitin Relative to Wild-Type: Assessing the expression levels of mutant versus wild-type ubiquitin is indeed valuable. In Figure 5E, we observed a 38.9% increase in high-molecular-weight ubiquitin conjugates in the soluble fraction when comparing the sPINK1+Ub/S65A group to the control. This increase suggests that mutant ubiquitin is actively incorporated into polyubiquitin chains.</p>
<p>Regarding free monomeric ubiquitin, its low abundance and rapid incorporation into polyubiquitin chains make it difficult to visualize in Western blots. Additionally, its low molecular weight and lower antibody binding valency further reduce its visibility.</p>

<p>General: a number of effects are shown following over-expression but no case is made that these levels of pUb are ever attained physiologically. I am very unconvinced by these findings and think the manuscript needs to be improved at multiple levels before being added to the record.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewer’s concerns regarding the relevance of pUb levels observed in our overexpression model. To clarify, our study is not focused on physiological levels of pUb, but rather on pathologically elevated levels, which have been documented in various neurodegenerative conditions. While overexpression is not a perfect replication of pathological states, it provides a valuable tool to investigate mechanisms that become relevant under disease conditions. Moreover, we have taken steps to ensure the validity of our findings and to address potential limitations associated with overexpression models:</p>
<p>Pathological Relevance: Besides several reported literatures, we observed significant increases in PINK1 and pUb levels in human brain samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as well as in mouse models of AD, cerebral ischemia (including mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion ischemic model and oxygen glucose deprivation cell model), and aging (e.g., Figures 1E, 1F, and 1H). All these data show that pUb levels are elevated under pathological conditions. Our overexpression model mimics these pathological scenarios by recreating the high levels of pUb, which lead to the impairment of proteasomal activity and subsequent disruption of proteostasis.</p>
<p>Use of Robust Controls: To ensure the reliability of our results and interpretations, we employed multiple controls for our experiments. We have used pink1<sup>-/-</sup> mice and cells to confirm that pUb accumulation is PINK1-dependent (Figures 1C and 2C). We have also included kinase-dead sPINK1 mutant and Ub/S65A phospho-null mutants to negate/counteract the specific roles of PINK1 activity and pUb in proteasomal dysfunction. On the other hand, we have used Ub/S65E for phosphomimetic mutant, corresponding to a 100% Ub phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Importantly, we have compared sPINK1 overexpression with both baseline and disease-mimicking conditions, thus to ensure that the observed effects are consistent with pathological changes. Furthermore, our findings are supported by complementary evidences from human brain samples, model animals, cell cultures, and molecular assays. Integrating the different controls and various approaches, we have provided mechanistic insights into how elevated pUb levels causes proteasomal impairment and contributes to neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>Our findings elucidate how elevated pUb level contributes to the disruption of proteostasis in neurodegenerative conditions. While overexpression may have limitations, it remains a powerful tool for dissecting pathological mechanisms and testing hypotheses. Our results align with and expand upon previous studies suggesting pUb as a biomarker of neurodegeneration (Hou, et al, 2018; Fiesel, et al, 2015), and provide mechanistic insights into how elevated pUb and sPINK1 drive a viscous feedforward cycle, ultimately leading to proteasomal dysfunction and neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>We hope these clarifications highlight the relevance and rigor of our study, and welcome additional suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study aims to explore the role of phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb) in proteostasis and its impact on neurodegeneration. By employing a combination of molecular, cellular, and in vivo approaches, the authors demonstrate that elevated pUb levels contribute to both protective and neurotoxic effects, depending on the context. The research integrates proteasomal inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein aggregation, providing new insights into the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The integration of proteomics, molecular biology, and animal models provides comprehensive insights.</p>
<p>- The use of phospho-null and phospho-mimetic ubiquitin mutants elegantly demonstrates the dual effects of pUb.</p>
<p>- Data on behavioral changes and cognitive impairments establish a clear link between cellular mechanisms and functional outcomes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- While the study discusses the reciprocal relationship between proteasomal inhibition and pUb elevation, causality remains partially inferred.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It has been well-established that protein aggregates, particularly neurodegenerative fibrils, can impair proteasomal activity (McDade, et al., 2024; Kinger, et al., 2024; Tseng, et al., 2008). Other contributing factors, including ATP depletion, reduced proteasome component expression, and covalent modifications of proteasomal subunits, can also lead to declined proteasomal function. Additionally, mitochondrial injury serves as an important source of elevated PINK1 and pUb levels. Recent studies have demonstrated that efficient mitophagy is essential to prevent pUb accumulation, whereas partial mitophagy failure results in elevated PINK1 levels (Chin, et al, 2023; Pollock, et al. 2024).</p>
<p>While pathological conditions can impair proteasomal function and slow sPINK1 degradation, leading to its accumulation, our results demonstrate that overexpression of sPINK1 or PINK1 can initiate this cycle as well. Once this cycle is initiated, it becomes self-perpetuating, as sPINK1 and pUb accumulation progressively impair proteasomal function, leading to more protein aggregates and mitochondrial damages.</p>
<p>Importantly, we show that co-expression of Ub/S65A effectively rescues cells from this cycle, which further illustrates the pivotal role of pUb in driving proteasomal inhibition and the causality between pUb elevation and proteasomal inhibition. At the animal level, pink1 knockout prevents protein aggregation under aging and cerebral ischemia conditions (Figures 1E and 1G).</p>
<p>Together, by controlling at protein, cell, and animal levels, our findings support this self-reinforcing and self-amplifying cycle of pUb elevation, proteasomal inhibition, protein aggregation, mitochondrial damage, and ultimately, neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>- The role of alternative pathways, such as autophagy, in compensating for proteasomal dysfunction is underexplored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, previous studies have shown that elevated sPINK1 can enhance autophagy (Gao, et al., 2016,), potentially compensating for impaired UPS function. One mechanism involves PINK1mediated phosphorylation of p62, which enhances autophagic activity.</p>
<p>In our study, we observed increased autophagic activity upon sPINK1 overexpression, as shown in Figure 2I (middle panel, without BALA). This increase in autophagy may facilitate the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins induced by puromycin, partially mitigating proteasomal dysfunction. This compensation might also explain why protein aggregation, though statistically significant, increased only slightly at 70 days post-sPINK1 transfection (Figure 5F). Additionally, we detected a mild but statistically insignificant increase in LC3II levels in the hippocampus of mouse brains at 70 days postsPINK1 transfection (Figure 5—figure supplement 6), further supporting the notion of autophagy activation.</p>
<p>However, while autophagy may provide some compensation, its effect is likely limited. The UPS and autophagy serve distinct roles in protein degradation:</p>
<p>• Autophagy is a bulk degradation pathway, primarily targeting damaged organelles, intracellular pathogens, and protein aggregates, often in a non-selective manner.</p>
<p>• The UPS, in contrast, is highly selective, degrading short-lived regulatory proteins, misfolded proteins, and proteins tagged for degradation via ubiquitination.</p>
<p>Thus, while sPINK1 overexpression enhances autophagy-mediated degradation, it simultaneously impairs UPS-mediated degradation. This suggests that autophagy partially compensates for proteasomal dysfunction but is insufficient to counterbalance the UPS's selective degradation function. We have incorporated additional discussion in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>- The immunofluorescence images in Figure 1A-D lack clarity and transparency. It is not clear whether the images represent human brain tissue, mouse brain tissue, or cultured cells. Additionally, the DAPI staining is not well-defined, making it difficult to discern cell nuclei or staging. To address these issues, lower-magnification images that clearly show the brain region should be provided, along with improved DAPI staining for better visualization. Furthermore, the Results section and Figure legends should explicitly indicate which brain region is being presented. These concerns raise questions about the reliability of the reported pUb levels in AD, which is a critical aspect of the study's findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have taken steps to address the concerns regarding clarity and transparency in Figure 1A-D. We have already addressed the source of tissues at the left of each images. For example, we have written “human brain with AD” at the left side of Figure 1A, and “mouse brains with AD” at the left side of Figure 1C.</p>
<p>Briefly, the human brain samples in Figure 1 originate from the cingulate gyrus of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. Our analysis revealed that PINK1 is primarily localized within cell bodies, whereas pUb is more abundant around Aβ plaques, likely in nerve terminals. For the mouse brain samples, we have now explicitly indicated in the figure legends and Results section that the images represent the neocortex of APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model relevant to AD pathology, as well as the corresponding regions in wild-type and pink1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We have ensured that the brain regions and sources are clearly stated throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>Regarding image clarity, we have uploaded higher-resolution versions of the images in the revised manuscript to improve visualization of key features, including DAPI staining. We believe these revisions enhance the reliability and interpretability of our findings, particularly in relation to the reported pUb levels in AD.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>- Expand on the potential compensatory role of autophagy in response to proteasomal dysfunction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Upon proteasomal inhibition, cells may activate autophagy as an alternative pathway of degradation to help clear damaged or misfolded proteins. Autophagy is a bulk degradation process that targets long-lived proteins, damaged organelles, and aggregated proteins for lysosomal degradation. While this pathway can provide some compensation, it is distinct from the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which specializes in the selective degradation of short-lived regulatory proteins and misfolded proteins.</p>
<p>In our study, we observed increased autophagic activity following sPINK1 overexpression (Figure 2J, middle panel, without BALA) and a slight, though statistically insignificant, increase in LC3II levels in the hippocampus of mouse brains at 70 days post-sPINK1 transfection (Figure 5—figure supplement 6). These findings suggest that autophagy is indeed upregulated as a compensatory response to proteasomal dysfunction, potentially facilitating the degradation of aggregated ubiquitinated proteins. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed similar enrichment of autophagy pathways at 30 and 70 days post-sPINK1 overexpression (Figure 5—figure supplement 5).</p>
<p>However, the compensatory capacity of autophagy is likely limited. While autophagy can reduce protein aggregation, it is an inherently non-selective process and cannot fully replace the targeted functions of the UPS. Moreover, as we illustrate in Figure 7 of the revised manuscript, UPS is essential for degrading specific regulatory and inhibitory proteins and plays a critical role in cellular proteostasis, particularly in signaling regulation, cell cycle control, and stress responses.</p>
<p>Together, while autophagy activation provides some degree of compensation, it cannot fully restore cellular proteostasis. The interplay between these two degradation pathways is an important area for future investigation. For the present study, our focus is on how pUb elevations impact proteasomal activity and elicits downstream effects.</p>

<p>- NeuN expression in Figure 4B differs between wildtype and pink-/- mice. Additional validation is needed to determine whether pink-/- enhances NeuN expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The difference in NeuN immunofluorescence intensity between wild-type and pink1<sup>-/-</sup> mice in Figure 4B may simply result from variations in image acquisition rather than an actual difference in NeuN expression.</p>
<p>Our single nuclei RNA-seq analyses of wild-type and pink1<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 3 and 18 months of age reveal no significant differences in NeuN expression at the transcript level (data provided below). This confirms that the observed variation in fluorescence intensity is unlikely to reflect an authentic upregulation of NeuN expression. Thus, factors like the concentration of antibody, image exposure and processing may contribute to differences in staining intensity.</p>
