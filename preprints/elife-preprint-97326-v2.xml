<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The striatum, the central hub of cortico-basal ganglia loops, contains functionally heterogeneous subregions distinguished by the topographic patterns of structural connectivity. These subregions mediate various processes of procedural learning. However, it remains unclear when and how striatal subregions engage in the acquisition of sensory stimulus-based decision-making. A neuroimaging of regional brain activity shows that the anterior dorsolateral striatum (aDLS) and posterior ventrolateral striatum (pVLS) in rats are activated in a different temporal pattern during the acquisition phase of auditory discrimination. Chronic and transient pharmacologic manipulations show that the aDLS promotes the behavioral strategy driven by the stimulus-response association while suppressing that by the response-outcome association, and that the pVLS contributes to forming and maintaining the stimulus-response strategy. Electrophysiological recording indicates that subpopulations of aDLS neurons predominantly represent the outcome of specific behaviors at the initial period of discrimination learning, and that pVLS subpopulations encode the beginning and ending of each behavior according to the progress of learning. In addition, other subpopulations of striatal neurons indicate sustained activation after obtaining reward with distinct patterns reflecting the stimulus-response associations. Our findings demonstrate that aDLS and pVLS neurons integrate the new learning of auditory discrimination in spatiotemporally and functionally different manners.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The neural network connecting the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus forms functionally heterogeneous loops distinguished by the topographic patterns of connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, and is implicated in various learning processes by the integration of cognitive, sensorimotor, and reward information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The striatum is a key node in the cortico-basal ganglia loops, and its segregated subregions are considered to mediate procedural learning, such as motor skills and instrumental behavior, through parallel processing via different loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Previous studies in humans and non-human primates have reported that the neural activity within the striatum shifts from the associative subregions (caudate and anterior putamen) to the sensorimotor subregions (posterior putamen) as motor learning progresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In rodents, an instrumental behavior initiates as goal-directed actions and then transits to stimulus-response habits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, requiring the dorsomedial striatum (DMS; a homologue to the caudate in primates) and the dorsolateral striatum (DLS; a homologue to the putamen in primates), respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Based on these results, a model of procedural learning has been proposed, in which the functional dominance changes from the associative to sensorimotor subregions in the striatum during the learning phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In contrast, deviations from the prior model are evident in other behavioral tasks on decision-making based on external sensory cues. For example, the neural activity in the caudate in humans is associated with learning of a visuomotor association task and the execution of learned behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The tail of the caudate in non-human primates contributes to the automatic, habitual behavior in decision-making task using complex visual stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In rodents, the DLS is involved in the acquisiton and execution of the discrimination task with visual and auditory cues, wheras the DMS madiates the performance of learned behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, other striatal subregions, such as the posterior striatum and ventrolateral striatum in rodents are also engaged in the auditory discrimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Based on these results, a hypothesis has arisen that the acquisition of sensory cue-based decision-making requires wide-range spatiotemporal processing within the striatum. However, the neural mechanism by which the functional circuits linked to striatal subregions change throughout learning processes is not yet fully understood.</p>
<p>To investigate a large-scale striatal reorganization in accordance with the acquisition of external cue-dependent decisions, we conducted a two-alternative auditory discrimination task with rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Using a small-animal neuroimaging technique, we found that the anterior dorsolateral striatum (aDLS) and posterior ventrolateral striatum (pVLS) are activated to the highest level at the middle and late stages during the acquisition phase of auditory discrimination, respectively. Then, chronic pharmacologic manipulations confirmed that the aDLS and pVLS are necessary for discrimination learning, and the transient manipulations also indicated the function of these subregions in the learning at the corresponding stages. The resultant effects of the manipulations on the behavioral strategy showed that the aDLS promotes the strategy based on the stimulus-response association, while suppressing that based on response-outcome associations. Additionally, the pVLS engages in the formation and maintenance of the stimulus-response association strategy.</p>
<p>Electrophysiological data of striatal neurons indicated the presence of aDLS subpopulations, mainly representing the outcome of specific behaviors at the initial period of auditory discrimination and pVLS subpopulations encoding the beginning and ending of behavior in association with the development of the discrimination. There were other subpopulations in the aDLS and pVLS showing long-term increased activity following reward with different patterns of the combination between the stimulus and response. These findings revealed that the two striatal subregions are involved in the acquisition of auditory discrimination through distinct spatiotemporal and functional fashions, challenging the prior model which proposed a transition from the associative to sensorimotor striatal subregions during learning.</p>

<title>Leaning processes of auditory discrimination</title>
<p>We employed a two-alternative auditory discrimination task, in which rats are required to make new associations between a tone instruction cue (2 or 10 kHz) and a response (pressing the left or right lever)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, setting the interval between the stimulus presentation and lever insertion to 3 s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The success rate gradually increased, reaching a plateau around Day 13, which persisted through Day 24 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on changes observed in the success rate, we categorized the learning processes into two phases: the acquisition phase, which lasted until Day 13; and the learned phase, which began after Day 13 and then continued at least until Day 24. In addition, we divided the acquisition phase into three stages depending on the success rate that included the early (&lt; 60%), middle (60â80%), and late (80â100%) stages. We chose Days 2, 6, and 10 at the early, middle, and late stages in the acquisition phase, respectively, as well as Days 13 and 24 in the learned phase for statistical comparison of the success rate. There were significant differences between Days 2 and 6, Days 6 and 10, as well as Days 10 and 13, showing no significant difference between Days 13 and 24 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, the response time and omission rate did not vary among the training days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>), and the variation of response bias decreased along with the progress of auditory discrimination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Distinct brain activity patterns in striatal subregions during learning processes</title>
<p>To investigate dynamic changes in regional brain activity in the entire striatum during auditory discrimination in the same animals, we conducted the positron emission tomography (PET) for small animals with 2-deoxy-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-<sub>D</sub>-glucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG), which measures cerebral glucose metabolism correlated to brain activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Before the auditory discrimination task, we performed the single lever press task, in which a lever pseudorandomly presented on either the left or right side, and the rats learned to press a lever associated with receiving a reward. This task was used as a control that does not require the decision process based on the auditory stimulus. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET scanning was carried out on Day 4 of the single lever press task, and then during a series of training sessions including the acquisition (Days 2, 6, and 10) and learned (Day 24) phases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The average number of lever presses in the single lever press task exceeded 80 times (81.6 Â± 1.3, mean Â± s.e.m.) on Day 2 and maintained that level until Day 4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In the following auditory discrimination task, the success rate gradually increased along with the training days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), showing a significant difference among sessions in which we performed the <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET scanning (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The response time and omission rate were consistent among the days, and the variation of response bias became smaller as the task progresses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These performances were similar to those in the intact rats (compared to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>â<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>), suggesting that the procedure for <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET scans does not affect the acquisition of discrimination.</p>

<p>We investigated the brain regions, in which <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake significantly increased or decreased during the learning processes, applying a statistical significance threshold (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, uncorrected) and an extent threshold, by using a voxel-based statistical parametric analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We first analyzed task-related brain activity by comparing <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake on either day of the discrimination task with that on Day 4 of the single lever press task (summarized in Table S1). In the striatal subregions, there were significant increases of the activity in the unilateral aDLS and the bilateral pVLS on Days 6 and 10, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). However, no significant change was observed in the DMS during the acquisition phase except a unilateral decrease on Day 24 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Next, to evaluate the activity related to the progress of learning, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake on Days 6, 10, and 24 was compared with that on Day 2. The learning-dependent brain activity was significantly increased in the bilateral aDLS and the unilateral pVLS on Days 6 and 10, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), whereas the activity decreased in the bilateral DMS on Day 24 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). This decrease was also detected when <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptakes were compared between Days 10 and 24 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting the down-regulation of the DMS activity in the learned phase.</p>
<p>To quantitatively validate changes in the brain activity in striatal subregions, we analyzed the amount of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in the voxel of interest of these subregions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). The <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in the bilateral aDLS reached a peak on Day 6, and it decreased during the subsequent days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>), whereas the uptake in the bilateral pVLS gradually increased along with the progress of learning, showing the maximal value on Day 10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). The uptake in the DMS did not alter during the acquisition phase, and it decreased on Day 24 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>). These results suggest that the aDLS and pVLS contribute to learning processes in a different temporal pattern during the acquisition phase, whereas the DMS may be engaged to the behavior in the learned phase.</p>

<title>Excitotoxic lesion of the aDLS and pVLS, but not the DMS, disrupts the acquisition of auditory discrimination</title>
<p>To study whether the changed activity of striatal subregions is involved in learning processes, rats received a bilateral injection of solution containing ibotenic acid (IBO; 8 mg/mL, 0.3 Î¼L/site) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into the subregions, and we conducted for the behavioral study. The range of IBO lesion in the subregions was analyzed by immunostaining with a neuronal marker NeuN after the behavioral tests (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>â<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). The number of single lever presses increased similarly along with the training in both the PBS- and IBO-injected groups into the aDLS, pVLS, or DMS along with the training (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref>â<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). For the aDLS injections, increases in success rate were impaired during the acquisition phase in the IBO group, compared to the PBS group, and the impairments were mainly observed at the middle stage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3G</xref>). For the pVLS injection, success rate impairments were observed in the IBO group showed compared to the PBS group, although the period showing a significant difference was unclear (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). The response time in the aDLS-lesioned group did not alter during the discrimination training, whereas that in the pVLS-lesioned group was continuously prolonged (Figure. S1A and S1B), and the omission rate and response bias were similar between the lesioned and the corresponding control groups (Figures S1D/S1G for aDLS lesion and Figures S1E/S1H for pVLS lesion). In contrast, for the DMS injection the success rate in the discrimination task was comparable between the PBS and IBO groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). The DMS lesion lengthened the response time through the learning (Figure S1C), whereas it did not alter the omission rate and response bias (Figures S1F and S1I). These results indicate that the aDLS and pVLS are necessary for the acquisition of auditory discrimination, and that the aDLS appears to be mainly involved in the learning process at the middle stage. The results also reveal that the DMS contributes to the execution, but not learning, of discriminative behavior.</p>

<p>Previous studies have reported that the dorsal striatum is involved in both behavioral strategies based on the stimulus-response association and the response-outcome association and during instrumental learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. To assess the impact of striatal lesions on the behavioral strategies, we analyzed the proportions of responses attributed to two strategies in all responses of each session. One is the âwin-shift-winâ strategy, which is considered to reflect the behavioral strategy based on the stimulus-response association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In this strategy, after a correct response in the previous trial, the rats press the opposite lever in the current trial in response to a shift of the instruction cue, resulting in the correct response. Another strategy is the âlose-shift-loseâ strategy, which is considered to appear as a consequence of the behavioral strategy based on the response-outcome association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In this strategy, after an error response in the previous trial, the rats press the opposite lever in the current trial, despite a shift of the instruction cue, leading to another error response. In the control group into either of three striatal subregions, the proportions of win-shift-win and lose-shift-lose strategies increased and decreased, respectively, during the acquisition phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3J</xref>â<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3L</xref>). The changes in the proportion of the two strategies were similar to those in the intact rats (Figure S2). For the aDLS injection, the increases in the win-shift-win proportion were markedly impaired in the IBO group compared to the PBS group with significant differences mainly at the middle stage, and the decrease in the lose-shift-lose proportion was delayed compared to the same group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). For the pVLS-injection, the increasing win-shift-win proportion was also impaired in the IBO group compared to the PBS group, although the change in the lose-shift-lose proportion was comparable between the two groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). In contrast, for the DMS lesion both win-shift-win and lose-shift-lose proportions in the IBO group did not show significant differences from the corresponding values in their control group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>). These results indicate that the aDLS promotes the win-shift-win strategy through stimulus-response association and suppresses the lose-shift-lose strategy rooted in response-outcome association, and that the pVLS selectively facilitates the win-shift-win strategy acquisition. Thus, these two subregions not only play roles in the acquisition of auditory discrimination but also control distinct behavioral strategies during the learning processes.</p>
<p>After the completion of discrimination training, we tested locomotion and feeding behavior of rats with aDLS and pVLS lesions. There was no difference in locomotor activity in the open field and the amount of food intake in both lesioned groups (Figures S1J-S1M), suggesting that learning deficits following excitotoxic lesions of the striatal subregions cannot be attributable to abnormalities in these general motor behaviors.</p>

<title>Inhibiting aDLS and pVLS activity impairs discriminative behavior at different stages of the acquisition phase</title>
<p>Our <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET imaging study indicated that the brain activity in the aDLS and pVLS was increased in a different temporal pattern during the acquisition phase of auditory discrimination. To examine whether neuronal activity in striatal subregions is linked with the processes at different stages, we temporarily inhibited the activity in each subregion by the treatment with a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist muscimol (MUS). In a pilot study, we tested the effect of the bilateral injection of several doses of MUS (0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 Î¼g/Î¼L) into the aDLS or pVLS on the single lever press behavior and confirmed that the administration of the lowest dose of MUS did not affect the frequency of single lever presses and the quantity of food intake (Figures S3AâS3D). In addition, to achieve the stage-specific inactivation of the aDLS or pVLS neurons, rats were given bilateral injections of MUS or saline (SAL) at three different timings during a series of the training. The first injection was conducted on Day 2 to target the early stage. The second and third injections were conducted on the day after the success rate had reached 60% and 80% for the first time through the training, respectively, to target the middle or late stage. After the injections, the rats were used for the behavioral test. Placement locations of the injection cannula into the striatal subregions were assessed by cresyl violet staining after the behavioral tests (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). The success rates on the day before the injection (day N-1) at the early, middle, and late stages were similar between the two groups that received the bilateral injections of MUS or SAL (Figures S3E and S3F). Rats were then administered injections into the aDLS on the next day (Day N), and the success rate in the MUS-injected groups significantly decreased at the middle stage compared to the corresponding SAL-injected groups, but not at the early and late stages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, left). In contrast, the success rate in the MUS groups into the pVLS significantly decreased at the late stage, but not at the early and middle stages, compared with the respective SAL groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, left). To normalize the variation of learning speed in the individual animals, we calculated the value by subtracting the success rate on Day N-1 from that on Day N in the individual animals. There were significant reductions in the subtracted rate at the middle stage in the MUS-injected group into the aDLS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, right) and at the late stage in the MUS-injected group into the pVLS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, right). These results indicate that the aDLS and pVLS mainly function at the middle and late stages, respectively, in the acquisition phase of auditory discrimination, supporting the results obtained from our imaging study.</p>

<p>Next, we analyzed the influence of temporal striatal inactivation on the behavioral strategy at the middle and late stages of the acquisition phase. We calculated the proportions of the win-shift-win and lose-shift-lose strategies, and subtracted the values of these proportions on Day N-1 from those on Day N. The proportion of both strategies on Day N-1 were comparable between the MUS-and SAL-injected groups (Figures S3G and S3H). In the aDLS, the subtracted proportion of the lose-shift-lose strategy at the middle stage significantly increased in the MUS group as compared to the SAL group, although the subtracted proportion of the win-shift-win strategy tended to decrease in the MUS group as compared to the control group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), and the subtracted proportions of the win-shift-win or lose-shift-lose strategy at the late stage was similar between both groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). In the pVLS, the subtracted proportions of the win-shift-win and lose-shift-lose strategies at the middle stage were similar between the MUS and SAL groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), and the subtracted win-shift-win proportion at the late stage significantly decreased in the MUS group as compared to the SAL group, although the subtracted lose-shift-lose proportion was comparable between the two groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). Our results show that transient inhibition of aDLS activity at the middle stage affects the lose-shift-lose strategy and has a subtle effect on the win-shift-win strategy, supporting that the aDLS mediates the acquisition process of auditory discrimination at the middle stage at least partly through the suppression of the behavior based on the response-outcome association. Although the impact of inhibition on the win-shift-win strategy was subtle, excitotoxic lesion of the aDLS influenced the win-shift-win strategy in addition to the lose-shift-lose strategy (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>), suggesting that the aDLS acts to enhance the auditory discrimination by promoting the stimulus-response association, together with the suppression of the response-outcome association. The discrepancy in the extent of changes in the win-shift-win strategy between the two treatments may be generated from the difference in the timing or sustainability of drug inhibition of the striatal subregion. In addition, our results show that pVLS inactivation at the late stage selectively impairs the win-shift-win strategy, supporting contribution of the pVLS to the process via progression of the stimulus-response association.</p>

<title>Neuronal activity in the aDLS and pVLS during the acquisition phase</title>
<p>To examine the firing activity in striatal subregions during the acquisition phase of auditory discrimination, we simultaneously recorded neuronal activity in the aDLS and pVLS at the unilateral (left) side by using a multi-unit recording procedure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Using immunostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) after the recordings, we verified the location of electrodes within the striatal subregions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). After the single lever press task, we conducted the auditory discrimination task for the recordings. In correct trials, the delay period (0.5 Â± 0.2 s) was inserted between a lever press and a sound indicating the reward to distinguish neuronal activity related to the two events (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The behavioral data in individual rats were divided into three grouped sessions corresponding to the early, middle, and late stages, based on a sigmoid function analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> of the success rate in the task. The success rates in the grouped sessions were 52.7 Â± 0.8 %, 61.6 Â± 0.7 %, and 85.3 Â± 1.7 % (mean Â± s.e.m.) for the early, middle, and late stages, respectively, and the rate was significantly increased throughout the three stages (Figure S4A). However, the response time, omission rate, and response bias were similar among the stages (Figures S4B-S4D). Thus, these stages corresponded to the timing window defined in the acquisition phase of the transient MUS inhibition experiment of neuronal activity.</p>

<p>We identified 1,062 and 423 well-isolated neurons from the aDLS and pVLS, respectively, across the three stages (Figure S4E) and focused on the major population of striatal neurons, putative medium spiny neurons (MSNs; Figures S4F and S4G). The total numbers of MSNs at the early, middle, and late stages were 295, 364, and 360 neurons for the aDLS, and 87, 110, and 190 neurons for pVLS, respectively. Based on the combinatorial pattern of the tone instruction cue and lever press in our discrimination task, we categorized the electrophysiological data into four trial types: (1) high-frequency tone/right lever press (HR) and (2) low-frequency tone/left lever press (LL) as correct responses; and (3) low-frequency tone/right lever press (LR) and (4) high-frequency tone/left lever press (HL) as error responses (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We identified HR or LL type neurons showing significant changes in firing rate related to the cue onset, choice response, reward sound, or first licking as compared to the baseline firing rate in each of two trials (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). These neurons were further divided into two groups based on increased or decreased activity (Figures S5A and S5B). In the following analyses, we focused on the HR and LL type neurons with increased event-related activity to explore the firing patterns of neurons underlying behavioral processes of auditory discrimination.</p>

<title>Subpopulations of aDLS neurons, but not of pVLS neurons, show firing activity related to the behavioral outcome</title>
<p>Previous studies have reported that neurons in the dorsal striatum show the outcome-related activity in the instrumental conditioning tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We thus investigated whether aDLS and pVLS neurons exhibit a response related to the behavioral outcome during the acquisition of auditory discrimination. In the aDLS, the firing activity of reward sound-related HR type neurons showed a higher extent in the increase during a period, when the reward sound is presented in the correct responses, in the HR trial as compared with the LR, LL, or HL trial throughout the three stages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, top rows). The rate of these neurons also moderately increased during the same period in the LR trial compared to the LL or HL trial across the three stages, although the extent of the increase was lower than that in the HR trial (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, top rows). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC) values revealed a significant difference of the HR trial from the LR trial during the reward sound period, whereas the values of HL and LL trials indicated a significant difference in the opposite direction from the LR trial during the same period (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, bottom rows). The averaged firing rate during the reward sound period in the HR or LR trial appeared to modestly increase at the middle stage, but no significant difference existed among the stages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). To directly compare the number of neurons showing event-related activity among different stages, we calculated the number of reward sound-HR neurons by matching the trial number at each stage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). The proportion decreased progressively from the early to middle stages, and to the late stage. In addition, the firing rate of reward sound-related LL type neurons exhibited a higher increase in the LL trial and a modest increase in the HL trial while the averaged firing rate during the reward sound period was similar among the three stages. Furthermore, the proportion of reward sound-LL neurons reduced progressively through the stages (Figures S6AâS6C). These results indicate that the aDLS contained neurons related to the outcome of choice, showing a greater increase in the firing activity for the correct responses (HR and LL trials) than the error responses (LR and HL trials), and that the proportion of these subpopulations was gradually reduced through the progress of learning. In contrast, during the reward sound period at all stages, the firing rate and auROC values of reward sound-HR and reward sound-LL neurons in the pVLS revealed no significant differences across the four kinds of trial (Figures S6D and S6E), indicating that the firing activity of pVLS neurons did not appear to be associated with the behavioral outcome.</p>

<title>Subpopulations of aDLS and pVLS neurons show sustained firing activity after the reward in different manners</title>
<p>The dorsal striatum is known to demonstrate a response of neuronal activity after the positive outcome in the instrumental behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. We thus examined whether aDLS and pVLS neurons show the response after obtaining the reward during the acquisition phase of auditory discrimination. In the aDLS, the firing rate of the first licking-related HR type neurons indicated a sustained elevation after the first licking in the HR trial as compared with any of the other three trials across the early, middle, and late stages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, top rows). The auROC values revealed a significant difference of the LR, LL, or HL trial from the HR trial across the three stages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, middle rows). In addition, we calculated the averaged firing rate and increased firing period, defined as the total number of time bins above 3 s.d. of the baseline firing rate for 5 s after the first licking in the HR trial. The averaged firing rate was comparable between the early and middle stages, but the rate was significantly lower at the late stage compared to either of the other two stages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). The increased firing period was also comparable between the early and middle stages, showing a significant reduction at the late stage (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). The proportions of first licking-HR neurons were similar between the early and late stages, although they showed a slight decrease at the middle stage (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). There were few neurons with significant correlations between the firing rate and licking performance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). In addition, the firing rate of the first licking-related LL type neurons exhibited the largest increase in the LL trial at the three stages, showing a tendency to reduce the average firing rate and increased firing period after the first licking across the stages (Figures S7A-S7C). The proportion of first licking-LL neurons during the learning processes displayed similar changes as observed in the first licking-HR neurons (Figure S7D). These results indicate that the aDLS contained neurons showing long-lasting, increased activity after the reward in the specific correct combination of the stimulus and response (HR or LL trial), and that the extent of firing activity and length of firing period in the response appeared to be gradually reduced with no correlation between the proportion of neurons and the progress of the learning stages.</p>

<title>Neurons in the pVLS, but not in the aDLS, exhibit firing patterns related to the beginning and ending of the behavior</title>
<p>The dorsal striatum plays a key role in the acquisition and execution of behaviors based on the stimulus-response association, and the association is accompanied by a transient activation of neuronal firing immediately after the stimulus presentation or action in trials, which is considered to represent the beginning and ending of a learned behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. We first examined whether the firing activity of cue onset-related HR type or cue onset-related LL type neurons corresponds to the beginning of the behavior in the auditory discrimination task. In the aDLS, the firing rate of the cue onset-HR and cue onset-LL neurons showed a significant difference at some time points in each trial compared to those in any of the other three trials, with a significant difference of auROC values between the trials (Figures S8A and S8C). However, the transiently increased activity did not emerge at the time points corresponding to the beginning of the behavior. In contrast, the cue onset-HR neurons in the pVLS showed a transient increase in the firing rate immediately after the cue onset, and the activity appeared at the middle and late stages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, top). The transient activation was observed not only in the HR trial but also in the other three trials, being consistent with the results of a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The increased firing rate showed a slight but notable difference between the HR and LL trials with a significant difference in the auROC values between the two trials (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, low), suggesting that different combinations between the stimulus and response may affect the level of firing activity. Differences in the averaged firing rate between the two kinds of trial was observed at the middle and late stages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). The proportion of cue onset-HR neurons increased at the middle and late stages compared to the early stage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition, the firing rate of the cue onset-LL neurons exhibited patterns similar to those observed in the cue onset-HR neurons (Figure S8E). The data indicate that subpopulations of pVLS neurons show firing activity related to the beginning of the behavior, with a rising number of neurons throughout discrimination learning.</p>

<p>Next, we examined the firing activity of choice response-related HR type or choice response-related LL type neurons, corresponding to the ending of a behavior in auditory discrimination. In the aDLS, the firing rate of these neurons did not exhibit the transient increase related to the ending of the behavior, instead, there was a modest increase before the lever press (Figures S8B and S8D). In contrast, the choice response-HR neurons in the pVLS were transiently activated immediately after the lever press in the four kinds of trial at the middle and late stages, and the rate appeared to gradually decline toward the reward sound presentation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). The averaged firing rate was similar between the HR and LL trials though the stages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). The proportion of the choice response-HR neurons increased at the middle and late stages compared to the early stage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). In addition, the rate of choice response-LL neurons displayed similar firing patterns to those observed in the choice response-HR neurons (Figure S8F). Thus, subpopulations of pVLS neurons also represent the activity related to the ending of the behavior in auditory discrimination, increasing the neuron number throughout the learning stages in a similar pattern to neurons relevant to the beginning of the behavior in the task.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that the aDLS and pVLS are required for the acquisition of auditory discrimination at different stages of learning, and that the DMS is not necessary for the acquisition of discrimination, although it appears to contribute to the execution of actions, in particular to the regulation of response time. These results not only support some recent studies reporting no requirement of the DMS in the procedural learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, but also reveal important roles of two different subregions in the lateral striatum in the external cue-dependent decision-making. We propose that aDLS and pVLS neurons act to integrate the new learning of auditory discrimination in spatiotemporally and functionally distinct manners, showing a remarkable difference from the prior learning model that proposes the functional dominance changes from the DMS to DLS subregions during procedural learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET imaging study demonstrated that the brain activity in the aDLS reaches a peak at the middle stage of the acquisition phase of auditory discrimination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). The results of excitotoxic lesion experiment of striatal subregions suggest that the aDLS functions to enhance the acquisition of discrimination through the promotion of behavior based on the stimulus-response association and the suppression of behavior based on the response-outcome association (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). Transient inhibition experiment of neuronal activity confirmed this aDLS function at the middle stage of the learning, although the drug inhibition tended to reduce the stimulus-response behavior (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). In addition, we found subpopulations of aDLS neurons (reward sound-related neurons) which represent the behavioral outcome and differentiate the correct (HR or LL) and incorrect (LR or HL) choices (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D</xref> and S6A). The distinct responses of these neurons may explain the mechanism by which the aDLS regulates the stimulus-response and response-outcome associations through distinct neural circuits leading to a differential control of the two associations. Alternatively, the responses mainly promote the behavior based on the stimulus-response association, thereby secondarily inhibiting the response-outcome association. Indeed, some previous studies have suggested that an action based on either the stimulus-response association or response-outcome association is generated as a result of competition between different striatal subregions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. We also found other subpopulations of aDLS neurons (first licking-related neurons) showing long-lasting increased activity after obtaining reward in response to a specific combination between the stimulus and response (HR or LL trial) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and S7A). This activity may function as the feedback signal to promote the stimulus and response association, resulting in the enhancement of discrimination learning. The proportion of neurons related to the behavioral outcome showed a gradual reduction through the progress of auditory discrimination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E</xref> and S6C), and the extent of the firing activity and the length of the firing period of neurons showing sustained activation after reward were also decreased at the late stage of learning (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). The learning-dependent changes in the properties of these subpopulations in the aDLS may explain the mechanism underlying the earlier acquisition process of the auditory discrimination.</p>
<p>The <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET imaging indicated that the pVLS activity was gradually elevated through the acquisition phase of auditory discrimination, showing the maximal value at the late stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). The lesion experiment suggested that the pVLS drives the formation of discrimination learning via the selective progression of the stimulus-response association (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>), and the transient inhibition experiment ascertained the pVLS function at the late stage of learning (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the stimulus-response association is encoded in the DLS or VLS as the transient neuronal activity representing the beginning and ending of a learned behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. A recent study reported that the VLS is causally related to learned performance based on the auditory stimulus, while the DLS shows a weaker relationship to the behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In the present study, we found subpopulations of pVLS neurons that represent the beginning and ending of a behavior (cue onset- and choice response-related neurons, respectively) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A</xref>, 7D, S8E, and S8F), showing an increased number of neurons along with the progress of discrimination learning (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>). These data suggest that pVLS neurons contribute to the formation of the stimulus-response association through the learning processes. In addition, we found another subpopulation of pVLS neurons (first licking-related neurons) that are continuously activated after the reward outcome in response to two kinds of correct choices (HR and LL trials) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6F</xref> and S7F), and the proportion of neurons was increased at the late stage (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6I</xref> and S7I). This activity may act as a feedback signal to consolidate the stimulus and response association, leading to the maintenance of associative memory at the late stage during the acquisition phase of learning.</p>
<p>In the present study, we identified neurons with four kinds of event-related activity in the aDLS and pVLS, and classified them into the HR and LL type neurons in which their firing activity showed a significant increase in the HR and LL trials, respectively, as compared to the baseline (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>â<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and S6-S8). Parts of these two types of neurons with the respective event-related activity overlapped, and the numbers of overlapping neurons varied between striatal subregions (Figures S9A and S9B). In the pVLS, the overlapping neurons for the same event-related activities were 35.1%, 45.2%, and 67.0% in the cue onset, choice response, and first licking, respectively. In contrast, the aDLS had lower overlaps of 12.6% and 22.7% in the reward sound and first licking, respectively. Thus, distinct neurons in the aDLS tend to have properties of a single trial type while the same neurons in the pVLS seem to possess properties of both types. One possible explanation for the diversity in the proportion of overlapping neurons between the two subregions may be the difference of input patterns into striatal neurons or plastic changes in functional connectivity during learning processes. The detailed mechanism by which aDLS and pVLS neurons react to the events in a different manner should be investigated in the future.</p>
<p>Anatomically, striatal subregions are known to form heterogeneous cortico-basal ganglia loops in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. We examined the neural circuits linked to the aDLS and pVLS in rats by using bidirectional tracers. The results showed that two striatal subregions receive innervations from different subregions in the cerebral cortex, intralaminar thalamus, and substantia nigra pars compacta, and send projections to different subregions in the basal ganglia nuclei, including the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata (Figure S10), confirming that the aDLS and pVLS form the heterogenous cortico-basal ganglia loops in the rat brain. These data suggest that the aDLS and pVLS mediate the acquisition of auditory discrimination via the parallel loops, and cooperate to achieve neural processing related to the dual regulation of the stimulus-response and response-outcome associations. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism by which the two kinds of loops are processed separately and integrate the new learning of discrimination.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>In the <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET neuroimaging study, the brain activity in the aDLS reached a peak at the middle stage of the acquisition phase of auditory discrimination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). In the multi-unit electrophysiological recording experiment, the firing activity of aDLS neuron subpopulations related to the behavioral outcome showed no significant differences among the three stages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), while the proportions of these subpopulations gradually reduced through the progress of learning stages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). The extent of firing activity and length of firing period of other subpopulations showing sustained activation after the reward appeared to show learning-dependent decrease (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>), although the proportions of these subpopulations indicated no correlation to the progress of the learning (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). The patterns of the temporal changes in the brain activity of the striatal subregions during the learning stages did not match completely the time variation in the property and proportion of specific event-related neurons. In our electrophysiological analysis, we identified well-isolated neurons from striatal subregions across the behavioral task, focusing on putative MSNs (Figures S4EâS4G). Based on the combinatorial pattern of the tone instruction cue and lever press, we categorized the electrophysiological data into the four trials, including the HR, LL. LR, and HL. We identified HR or LL type neurons showing significant changes in the firing rate related to specific events compared to the baseline firing rate. These neurons were further divided into two groups with increased or decreased activity relative to the baseline firing (Figures S5A and S5B). In the present study, we focused on event-related neurons with the increased activity. Because the analysis was limited to neuronal subpopulations related to specific events with the increased activity, we consider that it is difficult to explain fully dynamic shifts in the brain activity of the striatal subregions dependent on the progress of learning by the time variation of firing activity of individual event-related neurons. The activity of other subpopulations in the striatum may be involved in shifts in brain activity during the learning processes. In addition, recent studies have reported that the activity of glial cells influences the uptake of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and that these cells regulate spike timing-dependent plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Changes in glial cellular activity, through the control of synaptic plasticity, may partly contribute to the pattern formation of learning-dependent shift of brain activity.</p>

<title>Surgery</title>
<p>The rats underwent a stereotaxic surgery under isoflurane anesthesia (1â5%). For excitotoxic lesion of striatal neurons, IBO was dissolved in PBS (0.8 mg/mL, Wako Pure Chemical), and IBO solution (0.3 Î¼L per site) was injected bilaterally with the coordinates (mm) from bregma and dura for the aDLS (AP +1.6, ML Â±3.3, DV -3.9), pVLS (AP -1.6, ML Â±4.6, and DV -5.6), or DMS (AP -1.6, ML Â±1.4, and DV -4.8) according to the atlas of rat brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Injection was performed through a glass pipette (diameter: 60 Î¼m) at a constant velocity of 0.1 mL/min with the microinfusion pump (EICOM). For transient inactivation of striatal neurons, two guide cannulae (length: 10 mm, outer diameter: 26 gauge) were bilaterally placed on the skull and fixed using four screws and dental cement. The chip of the cannula was placed at 1 mm above the target coordinates. A solution containing MUS (Sigma-Aldrich) in saline (0.1 Î¼g/Î¼L, 0.25 Î¼L per site) was injected into the target coordinates through the internal cannula (outer diameter: 30 gauge) at a constant velocity of 0.25 Î¼L/min. For anterograde and retrograde tracing, a solution containing cholera toxin subunit B (CTb; 1.0 mg/mL) conjugated to Alexa 488 or Alexa 555 (Invitrogen) as a bidirectional tracer was injected into the aDLS and pVLS (0.3 Î¼L/site), respectively. The coordinates for the injection into striatal subregions were the same as described above. For the electrophysiological experiments, surgery was performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. A 64-channel silicon probe (Buzsaki64spl; NeuroNexus) attaching to a 3D-printed microdrive with a movable screw was chronically implanted with the coordinates (mm) from the bregma and dura into the left aDLS (AP +1.6, ML -3.3, and DV -2.5) and pVLS (AP -1.6, ML -4.6, and DV -3.6). A faraday cage composed of copper mesh was secured on the skull with dental cement to reduce electrical noise and avoid damage to the implants. The rats were allowed to recover for 1 week after the surgeries.</p>

<title>Behavioral analysis</title>
<p>Behavioral tasks were conducted in operant conditioning chambers (30.5 Ã 24.1 Ã 29.2 cm; ENV-007CT; MED Associates) equipped with two retractable levers on both sides of a reward port in the front panel (ENV-203M-45, ENV-652AM, and ENV-201A; MED Associates). A multi-tone generator (ENV-223; MED Associates) and room light were mounted on the top of the center and corner panels on the rear side, respectively. For the electrophysical experiment, a 3D printed reward port was used to detect the licking and to prevent contact with the head attachment and front panel. The behavioral experiment in intact rats was performed using grain pellets (F0021, Bioserv) as a food reward. To prevent spillover of radioactivity into the temporal cortex as a consequence of excessive <sup>18</sup>F-FDG accumulation into the muscles by their activity to eat the pellets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, the PET imaging experiments were carried out using 0.02% saccharine solution (B0131, Tokyo Chemical Industry) as a liquid reward. The electrophysiological experiment was also carried out using the saccharine solution. The pharmacological experiment was performed using the pellets.</p>
<p>The rats were subjected to dietary restrictions of 12 g/day (CE-2, CLEA Japan) and water access was limited to 6 to 9 h in accordance with the reward used in the experiments for 3 days before the beginning of the training schedule, and the body weights of the rats were maintained at â¼85% of their normal weights. The training schedule consisted of four continuous steps. In the first step (magazine training), the rats were habituated to the operant conditioning chambers, and the reward was presented with the click every 20 s. Each daily session was started by illumination of the room light, and continued for 30 min. The sessions were conducted for 3 consecutive days. In the second step (shaping), only one lever on the left or right side was inserted. When the rats pressed the lever, they earned a reward accompanied by a click. Each daily session was started by illumination of the light, and lasted 30 min or until the criteria, in which the rats received 90 rewards. When the number of lever presses on either side reached the criteria, the lever was inserted in the opposite side on the next day. When the rats achieved the criteria on both sides for 2 or 3 days, they moved to the following step. In the third step (single lever press task), each trial was started by illumination of the light and insertion of one lever on either the left or right side in a pseudorandom manner with equal frequencies on both sides for every set of four trials. When the rats pressed the lever, the reward was presented with the sound, and the lever was immediately retracted. The room light turned off 4 s after the lever press. When they did not press the lever within 10 s after the start, the trial was terminated when the light turned off. The trial was repeated every 20 s. Each daily session continued for 30 min, and the sessions were conducted for 4 consecutive days. The number of lever presses in each session was counted. In the final step (two-alternative auditory discrimination task), each trial was started by the presentation of a high (10 kHz) or low (2 kHz) frequency tone as an instruction cue in a pseudorandom manner. After three seconds, the room light was illuminated, and two retractable levers were inserted at the same time. The rats were required to press the left or right levers in response to the low or high tone cues, respectively. When the rats pressed the correct lever, the reward was presented with the sound, and the levers were immediately retracted. Correct response allowed the rats to access the reward: the retractable spout delivering water was inserted for 1 s for the PET imaging experiment; a pellet was delivered by a food dispenser for the pharmacological experiment; and three drops of water were delivered through a solenoid valve for the electrophysiological experiment. The room light turned off 4 s after the correct response. On the other hand, error response resulted in the retraction of levers and the turning off of the room light. No response within 10 s after the lever insertion was recorded as an omission response. The success rate in each session was calculated by dividing the number of correct response trials with the number of lever press trials minus the number of omission trials. The trial was repeated every 20 s. Each daily session continued for 60 min, and the sessions were conducted for 14 or 24 days according to the experiments.</p>
<p>To assess the behavioral strategies in the auditory discrimination task, a trial-by-trial analysis was conducted; the win-shift-win strategy was defined as a correct response, in which, after a correct response during the previous trial, the rats press the opposite lever during the current trial in response to the shift of the tone instruction cue; the lose-shift-lose strategy was defined as an error response, in which, after an error response during the previous trial, the rats press the opposite lever during the current trial despite the shift of the instruction cue. The proportion of both strategies was calculated by dividing the number of each strategy with the number of lever press trials minus the number of omission trials.</p>
<p>For the transient inactivation experiment, MUS injections were bilaterally performed 20 min before start of the session. For habituation, all rats were injected with saline bilaterally into the corresponding striatal subregions on the last day (Day 4) of the single lever press task. During the auditory discrimination task, the first injection was conducted on Day 2 of the task. The second and third injections were conducted the next day, after the success rate had exceeded 60% and 80%, respectively. Each session continued for 15 min.</p>
<p>For the electrophysiological experiments, a delay period (0.5 Â± 0.2 s) was added in the auditory discrimination task between the lever press and reward sound to distinguish the motor- and reward-related responses of neurons. When the rats pressed the lever, the lever was immediately retracted. After the delay period, the reward was presented with a sound. The room light turned off 4 s after the lever press. The trial was repeated every 20 s, and each daily session continued for 60 min.</p>

<title>PET imaging analysis</title>
<p>An <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET scan was performed with a microPET Focus220 (Siemens Medical Solutions, Knoxville) designed for high-resolution imaging of small animals (spatial resolution of 1.4 mm in full width at half maximum at the center of the field of view) as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Serial <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET scans were performed on the last day of the single lever press task and on Days 2, 6, 10, and 24 of auditory discrimination task. To administer the <sup>18</sup>F-FDG under the awake rats, an indwelling catheter was attached to the tail under anesthesia with 5% induction and 2.0â2.5% maintenance of isoflurane (median [interquartile range]: 6 [5â8] min). The recovery period was set to at least 2 hours until the beginning of the behavioral session, with the aim of minimizing the impact of anesthesia as much as possible. A solution of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG (ca. 74 MBq/0.4 mL) was intravenously injected just before the beginning of each behavioral session through the indwelling catheter. After the 30-min session, the rats were returned to their home cage, and then a 30-min static PET scan was performed under anesthesia with 2.0â2.5% isoflurane 55-min after the <sup>18</sup>F-FDG injection. During the PET scan, the body temperature of the anesthetized rats was maintained at 37Â°C using a small animal warmer (BWT-100A, Bio Research Center). The acquired emission data were sorted into a single sinogram and reconstructed by a standard 2D filtered back projection (FBP) with a ramp filter and cutoff frequency at 0.5 cycles per pixel or by a statistical maximum a <italic>posteriori</italic> probability algorithm (MAP), 12 iterations with point spread function effect.</p>
<p>Voxel-based analysis of PET images was conducted according to the method described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Briefly, individual MAP-reconstructed FDG (MAP-FDG) images were aligned to a FDG template image of Long Evans rats using PMOD software package (version 3.2, PMOD Technologies), and then the aligned images were transformed into the space of a T2 weighted MRI templates for the Long-Evans rats (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/tpm_rat/">https://www.nitrc.org/projects/tpm_rat/</ext-link>). The transformation parameters obtained from individual MAP-FDG images were used to match the individual FBP-reconstructed FDG (FBP-FDG) images with the MRI templates. The voxel size of the template was magnified by 10 to a size similar to that of a human brain. All FBP-FDG images were resampled with a voxel size of 1.2 Ã 1.2 Ã 1.2 mm and spatially smoothed through an isotropic Gaussian kernel (6-mm FWHM). Voxel-based statistical analysis was performed by using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software (version 8; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link>). For visualization of the results, SPM t-statistic values were overlayed on MRI templates to define the voxels showing significantly increased or decreased brain activity, using a high threshold (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001, uncorrected) and an extent threshold (with the output values from the voxel-based analysis). The voxel of interest (VOI) was determined ass voxels with more than 85% of the maximum T-value within activated areas obtained by voxel-based statistical comparison of FBP-FDG images. The average regional <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake was calculated on the basis of the values of the VOI in FBP-FDG images.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological recording</title>
<p>Extracellular multi-unit recording was conducted at a sampling rate of 20 kHz from the striatum of freely moving rats by using a 512-ch acquisition board (Open Ephys) via 64-ch recording headstages (C3325; Intan Technologies). The tips of the probe were lowered by turning the screw (&gt; 140 Âµm/day) until it reached the target region (the aDLS and pVLS) during the single lever press task. The tips were sometimes lowered by the same procedure (140 to 280 Âµm/day) after the daily recording session to improve cell yield.</p>
<p>Spike sorting was performed automatically by the Kilosort software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cortex-lab/KiloSort">https://github.com/cortex-lab/KiloSort</ext-link>). Clear noise clusters were removed in the first manual sorting using the phy GUI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy">https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy</ext-link>). The remaining clusters were then re-clustered by using the Klusta Kwik (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://klusta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://klusta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</ext-link>), and the clusters were adjusted in the second manual sorting by using the phy GUI again. The sorted clusters satisfying all the following criteria were used for further analysis: L-ratio &lt; 0.05, isolation distance &gt; 15, and ISI index &lt; 0.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Well-isolated single neurons (n = 1,485; aDLS, n = 1,062; pVLS, n = 423) were classified as putative medium spiny neurons (MSNs), fast spiking interneurons (FSIs), tonically active neurons (TANs), and unclassified interneurons (UIs). Putative MSNs and TANs were separated from FSIs and UIs by trough-to-peak duration of mean spike waveform (&gt; 0.6 ms) according to previous studies, with slight modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Putative FSIs were then separated from UIs by utilizing the proportion of time associated with long inter-spike intervals. This was achieved by summing the inter-spike intervals longer than 2 s and subsequently dividing the resulting sum by the total recording time (Prop<sub>ISIs</sub> &gt; 2 s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Neurons with values of Prop<sub>ISIs</sub> &gt; 2 s less than 0.4 were classified as putative FSIs, while neurons with Prop<sub>ISIs</sub> &gt; 2 s greater than 0.4 were classified as putative UIs. The putative MSNs and TANs were separated by measuring the post-spike suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. We measured the length of suppressed time during which the firing rate of a neuron was suppressed following a spike by counting the number of 1-ms bins in its autocorrelation function until the rate of the neuron was equal to or greater than its averaged rate over the 600-ms to 900-ms autocorrelation bins. Putative TANs were separated by post-spike suppression of less than 40 ms, and the remaining neurons were classified as putative MSNs. Because the numbers of FSIs, TANs, and UIs were low (79 out of 1,485, 5.3%), they were excluded from further analysis.</p>
<p>To divide the three stages during the acquisition phase, the sigmoidal function was fitted using the following four-parameter logistic equation:
<disp-formula>

</disp-formula>
Where Î± is the inflection point, Î² is a variable for slope, and Î» and Î³ are parameters related to the lower asymptote (Î³) and upper asymptote (Î») of the learning curve. The function was used to evaluate the day when the success rate reached 20% (t<sub>20%</sub>) or 90% (t<sub>90%</sub>) of the maximum rate change defined by the difference between the Î³ and Î». Three stages were defined according to the following criteria: early stage (up to 3 days before the middle stage); middle stage (3 days including before and after the day of t<sub>20%</sub>); and late stage (3 days including the day of t<sub>90%</sub> and before). One rat learned the discrimination faster, and the success rate reached t<sub>90%</sub> 2 days after the day of t<sub>20%</sub>. One day before the day of t<sub>90%</sub> was assigned to the late stage. For the following analysis, spike data in each striatal subregion were separated into the early, middle, and late stages (<italic>n</italic> = 295, 364 and 360, respectively, for the aDLS; and <italic>n</italic> = 87, 110 and 190, respectively, for the pVLS).</p>
<p>To determine the neurons showing significant changes in firing rate related to the task events, electrophysiological data were grouped into four trial types based on the instruction cue (high or low tone) and the choice (right or left lever); HR, high tone and right lever press; HL, high tone and left lever press; LR, low tone and right lever press; and LL, low tone and left lever press. Neurons with three or more trial data were analyzed. We identified the HR or LL type neurons, detecting significant increases or decreases of the firing rate by applying the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) to trial-by-trial spike number between the baseline period (BL, -1,500 to -500 ms or -1,100 to -500 ms before presentation of the instruction cue) and any of four peri-event periods (cue onset, 0 to +1,000 ms after the onset of the instruction cue; choice response, -700 to +300 ms around the time of lever press; reward sound, -300 to 300 ms around the time of sound onset instructing the reward delivery; and first licking, 0 to +1,000 ms after the time of first licking after the choice response). Any spikes around the events were averaged in 50-ms bins. The event-related activity was shown as averaged firing rate aligned based on the timing of an event for each trial. The auROC values were calculated by using the spike counts between the HR or LR trials and any of the other three trials. Bins showing significant differences in the auROC data were determined by applying the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) to the distribution of 200 ms bin-by-bin auROC values and 0.5.</p>
<p>To compare the number of neurons showing event-related activity among different stages, the number of HR or LL type neurons were calculated by matching the trial number at each stage. Twenty trials were randomly selected for a neuron, and neurons with less than 20 trials were removed from the analysis. The neurons with event-related activity were identified as described above. The proportion (percentage) of neurons relative to the total number of neurons was calculated at each individual stage. The same analysis was repeated 30 times and the distribution of the proportion of neurons with event-related activity at the stage was obtained. The cumulative probability against the proportion was calculated using cumulative distribution function (cdfplot, MATLAB code from Mathworks).</p>
<p>Licking responses were detected with an infrared photobeam sensor placed in the 3D printed reward port, and generated timestamps for the onset of each spout contact according to the analog voltage signal. The licking responses corresponding to four kinds of trial in the first licking-related neurons were shown as averaged rates (50-ms bins) aligned based on the timing of the choice response. To calculate the correlation coefficient between neuronal activity and licking responses, the spikes and licking for 5 s after the first licking were counted every trial for each first licking-related neuron. Trials in which neurons never responded were removed from both the spike and licking data. The correlation coefficients between the two remaining data were calculated for each neuron (corr, MATLAB code from Mathworks), and neurons showing significant differences were determined by applying the Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>After the behavioral experiments, the rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight) and isoflurane (3%), then transcardially perfused 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffer (PB). The brains were post-fixed overnight at 4 â and cryoprotect with 10, 20, and 30% sucrose in PB. Brain tissues were cut into 30-Âµm sections by using a cryostat (Leica). For the lesion experiment, cresyl violet staining or immunostaining were performed to define the lesioned areas in the striatum. The sections were stained with a mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN IgG (1:1000 dilution; Millipore, Cat# MAB377, RRID:AB 2298772), and then with a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:400 dilution; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# A-11029, RRID:AB 2534088). The sections were counterstained with 0.3 Î¼M 4â,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich). For transient inactivation experiment, sections were stained by cresyl violet to visualize the positions of guide cannulae. For the electrophysiological experiments, small lesions were made by applying an electrolytic current (3 Î¼A, 10 s) through top and bottom channels of each shank by using the stimulus isolator (A365, World Precision Instrument). Sections through the striatum were stained with a mouse monoclonal anti-TH IgG (1:1,000 dilution; Millipore, Cat# MAB318, RRID:AB 2201528), and then with a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:400 dilution; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# A-11029, RRID:AB 2534088). The recording sites were verified by the staining with DAPI and red fluorescent Nissl stain solution (1:200 dilution; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# N21482, RRID:AB 2620170). Fluorescence and immunostained signals were visualized under fluorescence microscopes (BZ-X800; Keyence) and confocal microscope (A1R; Nikon).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB (MathWorks) and SPSS Statistics (Ver. 27, IBM). Comparisons of data between two groups were performed using the Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test (paired), the Wilcoxon signed rank test (paired), and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (unpaired). Comparisons of data among three groups were constructed using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA, two-way repeated measures ANOVA, or the Kruskal-Wallis test (without assuming normal distribution and homogeneity of variances). All statistical tests were two-sided. The Bonferroni post-hoc test and MannâWhitney U-test with Bonferroni adjustment were carried out as needed to compare means. For boxplots, the data points below the lower (25th percentile) -1.5 interquartile range (IQR) and above the upper (75th percentile) quartiles +1.5 IQR were regarded as outliers, and they are not included in the boxplots.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Setogawa et al. employ an auditory discrimination task in freely moving rats, coupled with small animal imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and pharmacological inhibition/lesioning experiments to better understand the role of two striatal subregions: the anterior Dorsal Lateral Striatum (aDLS) and the posterior Ventrolateral Striatum (pVLS), during auditory discrimination learning. Attempting to better understand the contribution of different striatal subregions to sensory discrimination learning strikes me as a highly relevant and timely question, and the data presented in this study are certainly of major interest to the field. The authors have set up a robust behavioral task, systematically tackled the question about a striatal role in learning with multiple observational and manipulative techniques. Additionally, the structured approach the authors take by using neuroimaging to inform their pharmacological manipulation experiments and electrophysiological recordings is a strength.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed some concerns raised in the initial review but some remain. In particular it is still unclear what conclusions can be drawn about task-related activity from scans that are performed 30 minutes after the behavioral task. I continue to think that a reorganization/analysis data according to event type would be useful and easier to interpret across the two brain areas, but the authors did not choose to do this. Finally, switching the cue-response association, I am convinced, would help to strengthen this study.</p>

<body>
<p>The study by Setogawa et al. aims to understand the role that different striatal subregions belonging to parallel brain circuits have in associative learning and discrimination learning (S-O-R and S-R tasks). Strengths of the study are the use of multiple methodologies to measure and manipulate brain activity in rats, from microPET imaging to excitotoxic lesions and multielectrode recordings across anterior dorsolateral (aDLS), posterior ventral lateral (pVLS)and dorsomedial (DMS) striatum.</p>
<p>The main conclusions are that the aDLS promotes stimulus-response association and suppresses response-outcome associations. The pVLS is engaged in the formation and maintenance of the stimulus-response association. There is a lot of work done and some interesting findings however, the manuscript can be improved by clarifying the presentation and reasoning. The inclusion of important controls will enhance the rigor of the data interpretation and conclusions.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have made important revisions to the manuscript and it has improved in clarity. They also added several figures in the rebuttal letter to answer questions by the reviewers. I would ask that these figures are also made public as part of the authors' response or if not, included in the manuscript.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Setogawa et al. employ an auditory discrimination task in freely moving rats, coupled with small animal imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and pharmacological inhibition/lesioning experiments to better understand the role of two striatal subregions: the anterior Dorsal Lateral Striatum (aDLS) and the posterior Ventrolateral Striatum (pVLS), during auditory discrimination learning. Attempting to better understand the contribution of different striatal subregions to sensory discrimination learning strikes me as a highly relevant and timely question, and the data presented in this study are certainly of major interest to the field. The authors have set up a robust behavioral task and systematically tackled the question about a striatal role in learning with multiple observational and manipulative techniques. Additionally, the structured approach the authors take by using neuroimaging to inform their pharmacological manipulation experiments and electrophysiological recordings is a strength.</p>
<p>However, the results as they are currently presented are not easy to follow and could use some restructuring, especially the electrophysiology. Also, the main conclusion that the authors draw from the data, that aDLS and pVLS contribute to different phases of discrimination learning and influence the animal's response strategy in different ways, is not strongly supported by the data and deserves some additional caveats and limitations of the study in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs valuable feedback, which has been beneficial for improvement of our manuscript. In response to the reviewerâs comments, we have revised multiple parts of the manuscript, including explanations of electrophysiological data. We have also provided additional data to support our main conclusion and addressed caveats and limitations related to the data in the Discussion section. For more details, please refer to the responses to each comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 1: The authors have rigorously used PET neuroimaging, which is an interesting noninvasive method to track brain activity during behavioral states. However, in the case of a freely moving behavior where the scans are performed ~30 minutes after the behavioral task, it is unclear what conclusions can be drawn about task-specific brain activity. The study hinges on the neuroimaging findings that both areas of the lateral striatum (aDLS and pVLS) show increased activity during acquisition, but the DMS shows a reduction in activity during the late stages of behavior, and some of these findings are later validated with complementary experiments. However, the limitations of this technique can be further elaborated on in the discussion and the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described in our response to the following two comments (a, b) from the reviewer, in the PET imaging study we first analyzed task-related activity by comparing <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake on different days of the auditory discrimination task with that on Day 4 of the single lever press task as a control. Next, we analyzed learning-dependent activity by comparing the uptake on different days of the discrimination task with that on Day 2 of the same task. Based on the results of both analyses, we concluded that the activity in the striatal subregions changes during the progress of discrimination learning. The behavioral significance of striatal subregions was tested by excitotoxic lesion and pharmacological blockade experiments. The explanation of imaging data analysis may have been insufficient to fully communicate dynamic changes in the activity of striatal subregions. Therefore, we have clarified our voxel-based statistical parametric analysis method to better explain the dynamic activity changes in the striatal subregions. Please refer to the following responses to comments 1 (a, b).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 1 (a): In commenting on the unilateral shifts in brain striatal activity during behavior, the authors use the single lever task as a control, where many variables affecting neuronal activity might be different than in the discriminatory task. The study might be better served using Day 2 measurements as a control against which to compare activity of all other sessions since the task structures are similar.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We initially analyzed task-related activity by comparing <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake on one of Days 2, 6, 10, or 24 of auditory discrimination task with that on Day 4 of the single lever press task. This task was used as a control that does not require a decision process based on the auditory stimulus. We observed significant increases in the activity of the unilateral aDLS on Day 6 and in that of the bilateral pVLS on Day 10 of the discrimination task. We also observed a significant decrease in the unilateral DMS on Day 24 (see Figures 2F and 2G). Next, as suggested, we compared the uptake on one of Days 6, 10, or 24 with that on Day 2 as a control to evaluate learning-dependent activity. The activity showed significant increases in the bilateral aDLS on Day 6 and in the unilateral pVLS on Day 10, and a significant decrease in the bilateral DMS on Day 24 (see Figures 2H).</p>
<p>The reviewer has suggested a discrepancy in the activity of the unilateral or bilateral striatal subregions under certain conditions between the image data (shown in Figures 2FâH) and plot data (Figures 2JâL). This discrepancy is also suggested in the following Comment 1 (b). For example, in the image data the brain activity was increased in the unilateral (left) aDLS on Day 6 of the discrimination task as compared to Day 4 of the single lever task (Figure 2F). In the plot data, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake reached a peak on Day 6 in both the left and right sides of the aDLS (Figure 2J), and the uptake in the left aDLS on Day 6 significantly increased relative to the value of the single lever press, whereas the value in the right aDLS on Day 6 tended to increase relative to that of the single lever press with no significant difference. The plot data showing the unilaterality in the aDLS activation relative to the single lever press are consistent with the image data. On the other hand, the <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in the aDLS on Day 6 compared to the value on Day 2 was significantly increased in both sides. Similar observations were made in the activity in the pVLS on Day 10 compared to that on Day 2, as well as in the DMS activity on Day 24 relative to that of the single lever press.</p>
<p>Our analysis of both task-related and learning-dependent activities revealed dynamic changes in striatal subregions during discrimination learning. We investigated the brain regions in which <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake significantly increased or decreased during the learning processes, applying a statistical significance threshold (p &lt; 0.001, uncorrected) and an extent threshold, by using a voxel-based statistical parametric analysis. In the image data, the voxels showing significant differences between two conditions are visualized on the brain template. The plot data show the amount of <sup>18</sup>FFDG uptake in the voxels, which was detected by the voxel-based analysis. The insufficient explanation of the data analysis of PET imaging in the initial manuscript may have led to a misunderstanding regarding the activity in the unilateral or bilateral striatal subregions. Therefore, we have revised the explanation for voxel-based statistical parametric analysis, adding a more detailed description of the thresholds in the text (page 7, lines 143â145) and Methods (page 27, lines 672â675).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 1 (b): From the plots in J, K, and L, it seems that shifts in activity in the different substructures are not unilateral but consistently bilateral, in contrast to what is mentioned in the text. Possibly the text reflects comparisons to the single lever task, and here again, I would emphasize comparing within the same task.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see our response to the first comment (a) regarding our explanation of the consistency in the activity of the unilateral or bilateral striatal subregions between the image and plot data. We have also revised the explanation in the corresponding sections of the manuscript, as described above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: In Figure 2, the authors present compelling data that chronic excitotoxic lesions with ibotenic acid in the aDLS, pVLS, and DMS produce differential effects on discrimination learning. However, the significant reduction in success rate of performance happens as early as Day 6 in both IBO groups in both aDLS and pVLS mice. This would seem to agree with conclusions drawn about the role of aDLS in the middle stages of learning in Figure 2, but not the pVLS, which only shows an increased activity during the late stages of the behavior.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 3 shows the behavioral effects of ibotenic acid injections into striatal subregions in rats. For the aDLS injection, we performed two-way repeated ANOVA, which revealed a significant main effect of group or day and a significant interaction of group Ã day, and added the simple main effects between the treatments to the figure (Figure 3G). We observed significant differences in the success rate mainly at the middle stage of learning. In contrast, for the pVLS injection there was no significant interaction for group Ã day, although the main effects of group or day was significant by two-way repeated ANOVA (Figure 3H). Consequently, it was unclear as to when exactly the significant reduction occurred. These results indicate that the aDLS and pVLS are necessary for the acquisition of auditory discrimination, and that the aDLS is mainly required for the middle stage. Similar results were observed in the win-shift-win strategy in the aDLS and pVLS (Figures 3J and 3K).</p>
<p>Next, we performed temporal inhibition of neuronal activity in striatal subregions by muscimol treatment in order to examine whether the activity in the subregions is linked with learning processes at different stages. In this experiment, muscimol was injected into the aDLS or pVLS at the middle or late stage, and the resultant effects on the success rate were investigated. The success rate in the muscimol-injected groups into the aDLS significantly decreased at the middle stage, but not at the early and late stages (Figure 4C). In contrast, the rate in the muscimol groups into the pVLS significantly decreased at the late stage, but not at the early or middle stages (Figure 4D). The results indicate that the aDLS and pVLS are mainly involved in the processes at the middle and late stages, respectively, and support the PET imaging data showing the activation of two striatal subregions at the various stages.</p>
<p>We have now provided the results of simple main effects analysis for the aDLS lesion (Figures 3G and 3J) and revised the description of the Results section (page 8, lines 174â178, page 8, lines 186â188, and page 9, line 205-206) and Figure legend (page 44, lines 1000â1003, and page 44, lines 1010â1013). We have also added the results of simple main effects analysis in Figure 3J.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3: In Figure 4, the authors show interesting data with transient inactivation of subregions of the striatum with muscimol, validating their findings that the aDLS mediates the middle and the pVLS the late stages of learning, and the function of each area serves different strategies. However, the inference that aDLS inactivation suppresses the WSW strategy &quot;moderately&quot; is not reflected in the formal statistical value p=0.06. While there still may be a subtle effect, the authors would need to revise their conclusions appropriately to reflect the data. In addition, the authors could try a direct comparison between the success rate during muscimol inhibition in the mid-learning session between the aDLS and pVLS-treated groups in Figure 4C (middle) and 4D (middle). If this comparison is not significant, the authors should be careful to claim that inhibition of these two areas differentially affects behavior.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 4E, aDLS inhibition showed a tendency to reduce slightly win-shift-win strategy at the middle stage (t[14] = 2.038, p = 0.061, unpaired Studentâs t-test). In accordance with the reviewerâs comment, we changed the word âmoderateâ to âsubtleâ (page 12, line 272).</p>
<p>In the temporal inhibition of the striatal subregions, the aDLS and pVLS experiments (panels C and D, respectively) were conducted separately. Since it is difficult to directly compare the data obtained from different experiments, we did not carry out a direct comparison of the success rate between the aDLS and pVLS injections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 4: The authors have used in vivo electrophysiological techniques to systematically investigate the roles of the aDLS and the pVLS in discriminatory learning, and have done a thorough analysis of responses with each phase of behavior over the course of learning. This is a commendable and extremely informative dataset and is a strength of the study. However, the result could be better organized following the sequence of events of the behavioral task to give the reader an easier structure to follow. Ideally, this would involve an individual figure to compare the responses in both areas to Cue, Lever Press, Reward Sound, and First Lick (in this order).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We first showed changes in the proportion of event-related neurons during the acquisition phase (Figure S5). Next, we conducted a detailed analysis of the characteristics of aDLS and pVLS neuronal activity. Specifically, we found several types of event-related neurons, including: (1) reward sound-related neurons representing behavioral outcomes in the aDLS; (2) first licking-related neurons showing sustained activity after the reward in the aDLS and pVLS; and (3) cue-onset and cue-response neurons associated with the beginning and ending of a behavior in the pVLS.</p>
<p>Descriptions of the characteristics of event-related neurons according to the sequence of events in a trial, as the reviewer has suggested, is another way to provide an easy structure for understandings on the electrophysiological data. However, we focused on the characteristics of aDLS neurons at the middle stage and pVLS neurons at the late stage of discrimination learning. Therefore, we explained the electrophysiological data based on the order of learning stages rather than the sequence of events in the trial, as described above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 5: An important conceptual point presented in the study is that the aDLS neurons, with learning, show a reduction in firing rates and responsiveness to the first lick as well as the behavioral outcome, and don't play a role in other task-related events such as cue onset. However, the neuroimaging data in Figure 2 seems to suggest a transient enhancement of aDLS activity in the mid-stage of discriminatory learning, that is not reflected in the electrophysiology data. Is there an explanation for this difference?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET imaging study, the brain activity in the aDLS reached a peak at the middle stage of the acquisition phase of auditory discrimination (Figure 2J). In the multi-unit electrophysiological recording experiment, the firing activity of the aDLS neuron subpopulations related to the behavioral outcome showed no significant differences among the three stages (Figure 5E), while the proportion of these subpopulations were gradually reduced through the progress of learning stages (Figure 5F). The extent of the firing activity and length of the firing period of other subpopulations showing sustained activation after the reward appeared to show a learning-dependent decrease (Figures 6B and 6C), although the proportion of these subpopulations indicated no correlation with the progress of the learning (Figure 6D). Patterns of the temporal changes in brain activity in striatal subregions across the learning stages did not match completely the time variation in the property or proportion of specific event-related neurons. In our electrophysiological analysis, we identified well-isolated neurons from the striatal subregions during the auditory discrimination task, focusing on putative medium spiny neurons (Figures S4EâS4G). Based on the combinatorial pattern of the tone instruction cue (high tone/H or low tone /L), and lever press (right/R or left/L), we categorized the electrophysiological data into the four trials, including the HR, LL. LR, and HL. We identified HR or LL type neurons showing significant changes in the firing rate related to specific events, such as cue onset, choice response, reward sound, and first licking compared to the baseline firing rate. These neurons were further divided into two groups with increased or decreased activity relative to the baseline firing (Figures S5A and S5B). In the present study, we focused on event-related neurons with increased activity. Because of the analysis limited to neuronal subpopulations related to specific events with the increased activity, it is difficult to fully explain dynamic shifts in the brain activity of striatal subregions dependent on the progress of learning by the time variation of firing activity of individual event-related neurons. The activity of other subpopulations in the striatum may be involved in the shift in brain activity during the learning processes. In addition, recent studies have reported that the activity of glial cells influences the uptake of <sup>18</sup>FFDG (Zimmer et al., Nat Neurosci., 2017) and that these cells regulate spike timingdependent plasticity (Valtcheva and Venance, Nat Commun, 2016). Changes in glial cellular activity, through the control of synaptic plasticity, may partly contribute to the pattern formation of learning-dependent shifts in brain activity.</p>
<p>To explain the difference in the time course between the brain activity and the firing activity of specific event-related neurons, we have added the aforementioned information to the Limitations section (pages 21 to 22, lines 512â539).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 6: A significant finding of the study is that CO-HR and CO-LL responses are strikingly obvious in the pVLS, but not in the aDLS, in line with the literature that the posterior (sensory) striatum processes sound. This study also shows that responses to the highfrequency tone indicating a correct right-lever choice increase with learning in contrast to the low-frequency tone responses. To further address whether this difference arises from the task contingency, and not from the frequency representation of the pVLS, an important control would be to switch the cue-response association in a separate group of mice, such that high-frequency tones require a left lever press and vice versa. This would also help tease apart task-evoked responses in the aDLS, as I am given to understand all the recording sites were in the left striatum.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not conduct an experiment switching cue-response association in the auditory discrimination task. However, the transient activity of cue onset-related neurons in the pVLS, as the reviewer has suggested, did not appear at the early stage of learning, but was observed in a learning-dependent manner (Figures 7A and S8E). In addition, the cue onset-HR activity showed a slight but notable difference between the HR and LL trials at the middle and late stages (Figure 7B), but there was no difference in activity in the HL and LR incorrect trials at the corresponding stages (Wilcoxon signed rank test; early, p = 0.375, middle, p = 0.931, and late, p = 0.668). These results suggest that the activity of cue onset-related neurons in the pVLS is associated with the stimulus and response association (task contingency) rather than the tone frequency.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Minor comment 1: The readability and appeal of this study would be improved by explaining the various neuronal response types, and task-related events in slightly more detail in the results section, and minimizing the use of non-standard abbreviations wherever possible.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we have replaced the abbreviations related to electrophysiological events (CO, CR, RS, and FL) with the original terms, and improved the explanation for neuronal response types and event-related neurons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor comment 2: It would be helpful to label DLS and VLS recordings more clearly on the figures instead of only in the figure caption.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. The terms âaDLSâ and âpVLSâ have now been added to the panels showing firing pattern of neurons: âaDLSâ in Figures 5D, 6A, S6A, S7A, S8A, S8B. S8C, and S8D; and âpVLSâ in Figures 6F, 7A, 7D, S6D, S6E, S7F, S8E, and S8F.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor comment 3: The authors suggest that aDLS HR- and LL- neurons are more sensitive to the behavioral outcome than those in pVLS (Fig 5 and S5). However, their conclusions are based on sample sizes as low as n=3 for each response type.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We identified event-related neurons from single neurons detected in both the aDLS and pVLS using the same criteria. In the pVLS, we found a small number of neurons that increased their activity during the period when the reward sound is presented (Figures S6D and S6E) (6, 4, and 17 HR type neurons at the early, middle, and late stages, respectively; 3, 5, and 15 LL type neurons at the early, middle, and late stages, respectively). The number of LL type neurons at the early stage was particularly lower, as the reviewer has suggested. However, when we plotted the firing rates of these neurons around the event, their activity did not reflect behavioral outcome. In the aDLS, we detected a large number of reward sound-related neurons representing behavioral outcome (Figures 5 and S6A) (43, 37, and 44 HR type neurons at the early, middle, and late stages, respectively; 49, 62, and 59 LL type neurons at the early, middle, and late stages, respectively). These observations suggest that aDLS neurons are more sensitive to behavioral outcomes than pVLS neurons.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Reviews):</bold></p>
<p>The study by Setogawa et al. aims to understand the role that different striatal subregions belonging to parallel brain circuits have in associative learning and discrimination learning (S-O-R and S-R tasks). Strengths of the study are the use of multiple methodologies to measure and manipulate brain activity in rats, from microPET imaging to excitotoxic lesions and multielectrode recordings across anterior dorsolateral (aDLS), posterior ventral lateral (pVLS)and dorsomedial (DMS) striatum. The main conclusions are that the aDLS promotes stimulus-response association and suppresses response-outcome associations. The pVLS is engaged in the formation and maintenance of the stimulus-response association. There is a lot of work done and some interesting findings however, the manuscript can be improved by clarifying the presentation and reasoning. The inclusion of important controls will enhance the rigor of the data interpretation and conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs valuable feedback, which has been beneficial in our endeavor to improve our manuscript. In response to the comments, we have revised the description of the experimental methods and underlying rationale, as well as the Results section. We have also provided additional data for some of the experiments that support the conclusions. For more details, please refer to the responses to each comment, included below.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1: Generally, the manuscript is hard to read because of the cumbersome sentence structure, overuse of poorly defined acronyms, and lack of clarity on the methods used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to the following comments (a)â(d), we have revised the corresponding text in the manuscript to clarify the sentence structure, definitions of terms, and methodology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 1 (a): For example, the single lever task used as a control for the auditory discrimination task could be introduced better, explaining the reasoning and the strategy for subtracting it from the images obtained during the discrimination phase at the start of the section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We analyzed task-related activity by comparing <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake on Days 2, 6, 10, or 24 of auditory discrimination task with that on Day 4 of the single lever press task. This task was used as a control that does not require a decision process based on the auditory stimulus. For clarification, we have provided a more detailed explanation of the flow of the single lever press task used in the PET experiment, including the rationale for employing this task as a control (page 6, lines 129â135). We have also revised the explanation of voxel-based statistical parametric analysis, adding a more detailed description of the thresholds (page 7, lines 143â145).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 1 (b): Another example is that important methodological information is buried deep in the text and complicates the interpretation of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the following sentences in the manuscript in order to provide clearer methodological information.</p>
<p>(1) As described above, explanations for the single lever task (page 6, lines 129â135) and voxel-based statistical parametric analysis were added (page 7, lines 143â145).</p>
<p>(2) Definition of the early, middle, and late stages were described in the initial behavioral experiment (page 6, lines 113â119).</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: The glucose microPET imaging is carried out 30 mins after the rats performed the task and it is expected to capture activation during the task. Is this correct? This assumption has to be validated with an experiment, which is a control showing a validation of the microPET approach used, and this way can report activation of brain areas during the task completed 20-30 minutes before. For example, V1 or A1 would be a control that we would expect to be activated during the task.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our PET experiment was conducted in accordance with previously established methods (Cui et al, Neuroimage, 2015), where rats received intravenous administration of <sup>18</sup>FFDG solution just before the start of the behavioral session, which lasted for 30 min. The <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in the brain starts immediately and reaches the maximum level until 30 min after the administration, and the level is kept at least for 1 h (Mizuma et al., J Nucl Med, 2010). The rats were returned to their home cages, and a 30-min PET scan started 25 min after the session. The start time of the scan was chosen to allow for sufficient reduction of 18F radioactivity in arterial blood to increase the S/N ratio of the radioactivity (Mizuma et al., J Nucl Med, 2010). As shown in Table S1, we confirmed that the brain activity in the medial geniculate body (auditory thalamus) was increased on Days 6 and 10 in the acquisition phase, although the activity in the auditory cortex was not changed, which is consistent with the results of a previous study reporting that the auditory cortex does not show the causality for the pure-tone discrimination task (Gimenez et al., J Neurophysiol., 2015).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3: Why are Days 2, 6, 10, and 13 chosen and compared for the behavior? Why aren't these the same days chosen in the other part of the study? It is unclear why authors focused on these days and why the focus changed later.</p>

<p>We conducted daily training of the discrimination task. The success rate reached a plateau on Day 13 and was maintained until Day 24 (Figure 1B). Based on these results, we categorized the learning processes into the acquisition and learned phases, and then divided the acquisition phase into the early (&lt; 60%), middle (60â80%), and late (&gt; 80%) stages. In the PET experiment, we selected Days 2, 6, and 10 as the representatives of each stage during the acquisition phase. In addition, we also selected Day 24 for the learned phase.  However, no scan was performed on Day 13 due to the transition between the two phases.</p>

<p>Comment 4: (A) Is the learning and acquisition of the single lever press and discrimination task completed by day 4? Or are rats still learning? The authors claimed no changes in DMS activity between single lever press &amp; discrimination, and therefore DMS isn't involved in learning. But to make this claim we should have measures that the learning has already happened, which I am not sure have been provided. (B) On this same point, the DMS activity is elevated on Day 4 of a single lever press compared to the aDLS and pVLS. So is it possible that the activity in DMS was already elevated on Day 4 of single lever press training? Especially given that DMS is supposedly involved in goal-directed behavior?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(A) In the single lever press task, the number of lever presses plateaued on Day 2 (Figure 1C). In addition, we analyzed response time and its variability, which plateaued from Day 3 and Day 2, respectively (see Author response image 1). These results indicate that the learning in the task was completed by Day 4. In the auditory discrimination task, Day 4 corresponded to the transition period from the early-tomiddle stages of the acquisition phase, suggesting that learning was still progressing.</p>
<p>In the imaging analysis, we examined task-related activity by comparing <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake on either day of the discrimination task with that on Day 4 of the single lever press task, and did not find any changes in the brain activity in the DMS. In addition, we investigated learning-related activity, and the DMS activity did not change during acquisition phase. These results suggest that the DMS is not involved in the acquisition phase of learning. Furthermore, comparisons between Days 10 and Day 24 showed a decrease in DMS activity during the learned phase, suggesting that DMS activity was downregulated during the learned phase. In addition, chronic lesion in the DMS indicated that the success rate in the discrimination task was comparable between the control and lesioned groups (Figure 3I), whereas the response time lengthened throughout the learning in the lesioned group compared to the controls (Figure S1C). These results support our notion that the DMS contributes to the execution, but not learning, of discriminative behavior (Figure 3I and S1C).</p>

<p>(B) We compared <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptakes among striatal subregions on Day 4 of the single lever press task (334.8 Â± 2.86, 299.0 Â± 1.71, and 336.8 Â± 2.18 for the aDLS, pVLS, and DMS, respectively; one-way ANOVA, F[2,41] = 104.767, p = 2.1 Ã 10<sup>-16</sup>). The uptake was comparable between the aDLS and DMS (post hoc Tukey-Kramer test, p = 0.058), but it was significantly lower in the pVLS compared to either of the other two subregions (post hoc Tukey-Kramer test, aDLS vs. pVLS, p = 5.1 Ã 10<sup>-9</sup>, post hoc Tukey-Kramer test, pVLS vs. DMS, p = 5.1 Ã 10<sup>-9</sup>). However, since we did not measure the brain activity in the single lever task outside of Day 4, it is unclear whether there was an increase in DMS activity during the acquisition of the task. Similarly, since we did not confirm the behavioral modes, which include goal-directed and habitual actions, it is difficult to conclude that the lever presses in the task were controlled by the goaldirected mode. However, our chronic lesion experiment suggests that the DMS is involved in the execution of discrimination behavior (Figure S1C). A clearer understanding of the DMS function in discrimination learning is an important challenge in the future.</p>

<p>Comment 5: It seems like the procedure of microPET imaging affects performance on the task. The anesthesia used maybe? Figures 2C and D show evidence that the behavior was negatively affected on the days on which microPET imaging was performed after the training. Can the author clarify/comment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Isoflurane anesthesia may slightly reduce behavioral performance. We carried out anesthesia (median [interquartile range]: 6 [5â8] min) during the insertion of the catheter for FDG injection, and set a recovery period of at least 2 h until the beginning of the behavioral session, to minimize the impact of anesthesia. The performances in Figure 2E were similar to those in the intact rats (compared to Figures 1Câ1F), suggesting that the procedure for PET scans does not affect the acquisition of discrimination.</p>
<p>We have added detailed information on the isoflurane anesthesia to the Methods section (page 26, lines 649â653).</p>

<p>Comment 6: More on clarity. Section 3 of the results (muscimol inactivation) refers a lot to &quot;the behavioral strategies&quot; without really clarifying what these are - are they referring to WSW / LSL (which also could use a better introduction) or goal-directed/habitual or stimulus-response/stimulus-outcome?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The dorsal striatum is involved in both behavioral strategies based on stimulus-response association and the response-outcome association during instrumental learning. To assess the impact of striatal lesions on the behavioral strategies, we analyzed the proportion of response attributed to two strategies in all responses of each session. One is the âwin-shift-winâ strategy, which is considered to reflect the behavioral strategy based on the stimulus-response association. In this strategy, after a correct response in the previous trial, the rats press the opposite lever in the current trial in response to a shift of the instruction cue, resulting in the correct response.  Another strategy is the âlose-shift-loseâ strategy, which is considered to appear as a consequence of the behavioral strategy based on the response-outcome association. In this strategy, after an error response in the previous trial, the rats press the opposite lever in the current trial despite a shift of the instruction cue, leading to another error response.</p>
<p>We have revised the explanations of the behavioral strategies in the section of the Results section (page 9, lines 192â201).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 7: Related to WSW / LSL needing a better introduction, on lines 192/193 authors describe a result where they saw the WSW and LSL strategies increase and decrease, respectively, in saline-injected mice. Is the change in performance expected or an undesired effect of the saline injection? This is not clear now and it should be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The explanations of the win-shift-win and lose-shift-lose strategies have been revised in the Results section on excitotoxic lesion experiment (page 9, lines 192â201) as described in our response to Comment 6. Win-shift-win is an indicator of correct responses, while lose-shift-lose indicates errors. Therefore, win-shift-win is predicted to increase, and lose-shift-lose decrease, as discrimination learning progresses. Indeed, in the results of the behavioral experiments, shown in Figure 1, both indicators change in a similar pattern to those in the results of the lesion experiments (Figure 3).</p>
<p>We have added the explanation of the proportions of both strategies in intact rats (page 9, lines 203â204) with a supplementary figure (Figure S2) and accompanying legend (page 56, lines 1173â1177).</p>

<p>Comment 9: Muscimol experiments. Can the authors comment on the effects on performance vs learning? What happens on the days after Muscimol? Does performance bounce back or is it still impaired?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We conducted a transient inhibition experiment with muscimol to examine whether the neuronal activity in the striatal subregions is linked with the processes at different stages. In this experiment, to lower the possibility that compensation of learning may occur during a session after the muscimol injection (Day N), we limited the session time to 15 min (45 trials) and evaluated the impact of the injection on the success rate at specific stages. The success rate in the muscimol-injected groups into the aDLS significantly decreased at the middle stage compared to the corresponding salineinjected groups, but not at the early and late stages (Figure 4C), and the rate in the muscimol groups into the pVLS significantly decreased at the late stage compared with the respective saline groups, but not at the early and middle stages (Figure 4D). Our results demonstrated that the aDLS and pVLS mainly function at the middle and late stages of the auditory discrimination task, respectively.</p>
<p>In addition, we here reply to comment 10 as for the comparison of success rates before (Day N-1) and after (Day N+1) the injections (see Author response image 3). We focused on two injections into the aDLS at the middle stage and into the pVLS at the late stage, in which the rate was reduced soon after the muscimol injection on Day N. The success rate for the two injections showed no significant main effect regarding group (saline/muscimol) or day (Days N-1/N+1) and no significant interactions for group Ã day. Moreover, the success rate was not significantly increased on Day N+1 as compared to Day N-1, even in the saline-injected control group, probably because of the limited session time soon after the injection. Therefore, we consider that it was difficult to define the effects of drug injection on the learning of auditory discrimination in our behavioral protocol for the transient inhibition experiment, and that the reduced rates observed in the muscimol-injected group on Day N mostly reflect the impacts of muscimol at least partly on the performance of discriminative behavior.</p>

<p>Comment 12: Figure 7B/E - on correct trials, they see a difference in the cue response to high tone / low tone but no difference in the choice. This is the one that seemed like a topography issue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The transient activity of cue onset-related neurons in the pVLS did not appear at the early stage of learning, but was observed in a learning-dependent manner (Figures 7A and S8E). In addition, the cue onset-HR activity showed a slight but notable difference between the HR and LL trials at the middle and late stages (Figure 7B), whereas there was no difference between activities in the HL and LR incorrect trials at the corresponding stages (Wilcoxon signed rank test; early, p = 0.375, middle, p = 0.931, and late, p = 0.668). These results suggest that the cue onset-related neurons in the pVLS represents the stimulus and response association (task contingency) rather than the topography of tone frequency.</p>

<p>Comment 13: Animals were normally trained for 60 minutes but on muscimol days only trained for 15 mins. On PET days only trained for 30 minutes. Ephys sessions were 60 mins. Is this correct? Why?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We determined the session time for each experiment by considering both technical and behavioral aspects. In the initial behavioral experiment, the session time was set to 60 min per day. Under this condition, the rats acquired the discrimination learning within 13 days. In the imaging experiment, the session without a PET scan was conducted for 60 min, while the session with a PET scan was carried out for 30 min as described previously (Cui et al, Neuroimage, 2015). This time schedule produced a learning curve similar to that of the initial behavioral experiment. In the transient inhibition experiment, the sessions without drug injections lasted for 60 min. As described in our response to the comment 2, the time of the session soon after the injection was limited to 15 min to lower the possibility of compensation of learning during the session. In the chronic lesion and electrophysiological experiments, all sessions were conducted for 60 min, corresponding to the initial experiment.</p>
