<abstract>
<p>Viruses rely on host cellular machinery for replication. After entering the nucleus, the HIV genome accumulates in nuclear niches where it undergoes reverse transcription and integrates into neighboring chromatin, promoting high transcription rates and new virus progeny. Despite antiretroviral treatment, viral genomes can persist in these nuclear niches and reactivate upon treatment interruption, raising the possibility that they could play a role in the establishment of viral reservoirs. The post-nuclear entry dynamics of HIV remain unclear, and understanding these steps is critical for revealing how viral reservoirs are established.</p>
<p>In this study, we elucidate the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta and the domains of CPSF6 essential for this process. We also explore the roles of nuclear speckle scaffold factors, SON and SRRM2, in the biogenesis of these puncta. Through genetic manipulation and depletion experiments, we demonstrate the key role of the intrinsically disordered region of SRRM2 in enlarging nuclear speckles in the presence of the HIV capsid.</p>
<p>We identify the FG domain of CPSF6 as essential for both puncta formation and binding to the viral core, which serves as the scaffold for CPSF6 puncta. While the low-complexity regions (LCRs) modulate CPSF6 binding to the viral capsid, they do not contribute to puncta formation, nor do the disordered mixed charge domains (MCDs) of CPSF6. Interestingly, the FG peptide facilitates viral replication. These results demonstrate how HIV evolved to hijack host nuclear factors, enabling its persistence in the host.</p>
<p>Of note, this study provides new insights into the underlying interactions between host factors and viral components, advancing our understanding of HIV nuclear dynamics and offering potential therapeutic targets for preventing viral persistence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the discovery of HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barre-Sinoussi et al., 1983</xref>), the initial stages of the viral life cycle, such as the reverse transcription (the conversion of the viral RNA in DNA) and the uncoating (loss of the capsid), have been understood to mainly occur within the host cytoplasm. Only the pre-integration complex, carrying the fully reverse-transcribed viral DNA, was believed to enter the nucleus for integration into the host chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Suzuki and Craigie, 2007</xref>). Recent studies highlighted that the viral genome is transported in the nucleus via a shuttle that shields it from the hostile cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>). This shuttle is constituted by the viral capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blanco-Rodriguez and Di Nunzio, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blanco-Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Selyutina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yamashita and Emerman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zila et al., 2021</xref>), which comprises 250 hexamers (depending on the size and shape of the capsid) and 12 pentamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pornillos et al., 2009</xref>). Within the structure of the capsid, hydrophobic pockets exist between hexamers, which serve as targets for various nucleoporins, especially the ones carrying FG repeats, facilitating the translocation of the capsid through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buffone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Di Nunzio, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Di Nunzio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lelek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Matreyek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Price et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies suggest that HIV uses multiple FG regions of several nucleoporins to translocate through the NPC, acting as a chaperone by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dickson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fu et al., 2024</xref>). Using a reductionist system of Nup98 condensates, it has been demonstrated that FG-mediated phase partitioning identifies specific sites on the capsid that allow it to interact autonomously with these phases. These findings complement the evolving understanding of the early stages of HIV infection, which has been revisited in recent years. They unveil that crucial stages of early viral infection occur within the host nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burdick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dharan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Francis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Selyutina et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, it has been shown that the pre-integration complex forms within the host nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Muller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>), and incoming viral RNA genomes accumulate in nuclear niches containing, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6 (CPSF6), RNA-binding protein SON and Splicing component, 35 kDa (SC35, also known as serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Francis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>). However, the mechanistic requirements that govern post-nuclear entry phases, which are crucial for a successful viral infection and the establishment of viral reservoirs, remain enigmatic.</p>
<p>Specifically, the mechanism underlying the formation of nuclear niches containing viral components and nuclear speckle (NS) factors, such as SC35—traditionally used as a marker for NS remains unclear. However, recent studies have revealed that SON and serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 2 (SRRM2) are essential for NS biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fu and Maniatis, 1990</xref>). Particularly, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) play a critical role in the NS formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ilik et al., 2020</xref>). These membraneless organelles (MLOs) fulfil various cellular functions besides splicing. Recent evidence indicates a direct role of NSs in cellular transcription regulation, as their spatial proximity correlates with gene expression amplification, as demonstrated by live-cell imaging of heat-shock responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). HIV, being a virus capable of generating new particles through splicing and integrating into active host genes, finds NSs highly conducive for viral replication. HIV particles, along with their RNA genome, accumulate within nuclear MLOs enriched in NS factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ay et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>). Notably, CPSF6, a paraspeckle factor first identified as a viral partner by KewalRamani’s laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), has been clearly detected in HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ay et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Francis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Luchsinger et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>). These puncta serve as hubs for nuclear reverse transcription and the formation of pre-integration complexes, which generate active proviruses detected outside but in close proximity to NSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ay et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In our study, we aim to elucidate how HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta form and identify the NS factors involved in their formation. CPSF6, along with NS factors, contains intrinsically disordered regions that can guide HIV-1 to the correct nuclear location for successful infection or allow the virus to remain sequestered during drug treatment, forming reservoirs. Importantly, viral reservoirs are the major bottleneck for curing the infection.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigate which disordered domain of CPSF6 is responsible for the recruitment of the viral core and generation HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta in the host nucleus. Simultaneously, we elucidate the key component of NSs that, through its IDRs, enable fusion with HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta, likely stabilizing them. Notably, we observed that the virus rebounds when anti-reverse transcription drugs are removed, but only if nuclear niches containing HIV, NS factors, and CPSF6 are present. If these niches are pharmacologically dismantled, viral rebound does not occur.</p>
<p>Overall, studying the biogenesis of HIV-induced nuclear niches is crucial for understanding how the virus navigates and persists in the nucleus of infected cells, and for designing new antiretroviral strategies.</p>

<title>Critical Role of HIV-Induced CPSF6 Puncta in Restoring Nuclear reverse transcription After Anti-Reverse transcriptase (RT) Therapy Discontinuation</title>
<p>Upon nuclear entry, HIV enhances the formation of CPSF6 puncta, where reverse transcription ends. The treatment with the reversible RT inhibitor nevirapine (NVP) can trap the viral RNA genome in these nuclear niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ay et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>). Once NVP is removed, the trapped vRNA can resume RT entirely within the nucleus, a process we term nuclear reverse transcription. Here we demonstrate that this phenomenon depends on the presence of CPSF6 puncta, which are mainly composed of CPSF6 proteins and viral cores. Disruption of these puncta by high doses of PF74 (25 µM) significantly impairs the rebound of the RT, as evidenced by the absence of luciferase expression, similar to what is observed with complete NVP treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>).</p>

<title>CPSF6 FG Domain is Required for HIV-Induced Puncta Formation</title>
<p>Formation of CPSF6 puncta upon HIV-1 infection hinges on two key events: the entry of the HIV-1 core into the nucleus and the binding of CPSF6 to the HIV-1 core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blanco-Rodriguez and Di Nunzio, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blanco-Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buffone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zila et al., 2021</xref>). To determine the contribution of CPSF6’s disordered domains for the formation of CPSF6 puncta upon HIV-1 infection, we correlated the binding of CPSF6 to the HIV-1 core with the formation of CPSF6 puncta. To this end, we first generated CPSF6 knockout (KO) THP-1 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-D</xref>) to eliminate the interference from the endogenous protein, which could affect the interpretation of results regarding the role of the analyzed CPSF6 domains. CPSF6 depletion in THP-1 cells was performed by CRISPR Cas9 technology. To completely eliminate the expression of the CPSF6 gene we selected single clones by limiting dilution. We identified a clone that was completely KO for CPSF6, confirmed through western blot and immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>) and we infected this clone and the control clone with HIV. CPSF6 puncta were detected only in the control-infected cells and not in the KO clone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>; Suppl. Fig.1A). The viral integrase (IN) was observed within CPSF6 puncta, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Francis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>), but absent in CPSF6 KO cells where viral IN was observed in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>; Suppl. Fig.1A). Thus, we used KO cells for CPSF6 to assess the role of selected CPSF6 domains in HIV-induced condensates (Suppl. Fig.1B). We designed various CPSF6 deletion mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) to specifically assess the significance of the main disordered regions of CPSF6 protein (Suppl. Figure 2A) such as the FG (phenylalanine and glycine) motif, the low complexity regions (LCRs), and the mixed charge domain (MCD), in the ability of CPSF6 to bind to the core and facilitate the formation of CPSF6 puncta. We investigated the role of the FG peptide by generating a mutant that exclusively lacks the FG peptide (ΔFG). Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that the FG peptide binds to the hydrophobic pocket formed between capsid hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buffone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Price et al., 2014</xref>).

<p>To further explore this, we developed an alternative plasmid by expanding the FG peptide deletion to include surrounding prion-like LCRs (ΔFG ΔLCR). These regions, outside the CPSF6 context, have been identified as crucial for facilitating strong CPSF6 binding to capsid lattices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wei et al., 2022</xref>). In our study, we aim to evaluate their role within a more physiological setting. Additionally, we assessed a CPSF6 variant that carries the 15-mer FG peptide flanked by non-LCR sequences, such as those derived from Beta-adducin (ADD2), kindly provided by Mamuka Kvaratskhelia (ΔLCR+ADD2). These protein segments are known for their high flexibility, akin to the LCR of CPSF6. Furthermore, to elucidate the contribution of the LCRs of CPSF6 in the formation of CPSF6 puncta, we generated a mutant lacking both LCRs (ΔLCR). Analysis of the MCD contribution to both the ability of CPSF6 to bind to the core and formation of CPSF6 puncta was achieved by deleting the MCD and adding 3 nuclear localization signals (3xNLS ΔMCD) since the deletion of the MCD results in a protein that localizes mainly into the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>; Suppl. Figure 2B).</p>
<p>To correlate the ability of CPSF6 to bind to the HIV-1 core with formation of CPSF6 puncta, we expressed wild type and mutant CPSF6 constructs in THP-1 cells knockout for CPSF6. Subsequently, we infected these cells with HIV-1 and analyzed the presence or absence of CPSF6 puncta at 24 hours post-infection. Importantly, for the imaging experiment we expressed CPSF6 WT and mutants without tags to avoid the formation of aggregates that could interfere with our conclusions. Our data show that HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta can form extremely rarely with the deletion mutant CPSF6 ADD2ΔLCR and with the mutant lacking the FG or both the FG peptide and the LCRs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>; Suppl. Fig.1B). However, when we analyzed the role of the MCD domain in CPSF6 puncta formation, which was indicated to be important for condensing CPSF6 in NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Greig et al., 2020</xref>), comparing the number of CPSF6 WT puncta induced by HIV infection with CPSF6 mutants revealed that the MCD domain does not play a critical role in HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>). In addition, we observed that the majority of analysed CPSF6 3xNLSΔMCD puncta contain vRNA inside, similar to CPSF6 WT puncta (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), thus corroborating the lack of a role for this intrinsically disordered domain in HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. Since the NLS domain from SV40, which replaces the MCD, is highly basic and could potentially induce condensates, we fused CPSF6 with a non-basic NLS (PY-NLS) or removed the NLS entirely. Even though these two proteins do not efficiently enter the nucleus, the few that do manage to reach the nucleus can host viral particles, as evidenced by the presence of IN. Many viruses are typically blocked in the cytoplasm due to the presence of these mutants that are mainly cytoplasmic. However, because we used a high viral dose, the blockage in the cytoplasm was not complete. As a result, the viruses that successfully entered the nucleus induced the formation of puncta associated with CPSF6-deleted mutants, indicating that the MCD is not critical for the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2F</xref>). Similar to the MCD, when we compared CPSF6 truncated for the LCRs with CPSF6 WT, we observed that the LCRs do not contribute to CPSF6 puncta formation. Therefore, the FG peptide alone, without the LCRs, is the only CPSF6 domain required for their formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-F</xref>; Suppl. Fig.1B).</p>
<p>Next, we tested the ability of the different CPSF6 deletion mutants for their ability to bind the viral core using a previously described capsid binding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Selyutina et al., 2018</xref>). Wild type and mutant CPSF6 proteins were expressed in human 293T cells at similar levels (INPUT) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Extracts containing wild type and mutant CPSF6 proteins were incubated with stabilized HIV-1 capsid tubes for 1 h at 25° C in the presence of 10 µM of PF74, which is a small molecule that competes with CPSF6 for binding to the hydrophobic pocket formed between hexamers that constitute the viral core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buffone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Price et al., 2014</xref>). HIV-1 capsid stabilized tubes were washed, and the bound proteins were eluted using Laemli buffer (BOUND). For every construct, the percentage of bound protein relative to input in the presence or absence of PF74 is shown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Our results revealed that the absence of the FG peptide (ΔFG) entirely abolished CPSF6’s ability to bind to the viral core. In agreement, simultaneous deletion of the FG motif and LCRs (ΔFG ΔLCR) resulted in a construct unable to bind to the viral core. Similar outcomes were observed when the LCRs were replaced with sequences derived from ADD2, even if the FG was present.</p>

<p>LCR-FG is notably more disordered than ADD2-FG, containing a high proportion of prolines (48 out of 98 residues), which makes it mostly non-foldable (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-H</xref>). Since proline is a structure-disrupting residue, LRC-FG is not expected to adopt any secondary structure. In contrast, ADD2-FG contains fewer prolines (15 out of 98 residues) but has many charged residues. It is predicted to form two short α helices and a ß strand, arranged as: α helix - FG – ß strand - α helix (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). ADD2-FG may form a flexible collapsed state, as its oppositely charged residues are evenly distributed, potentially allowing polyelectrostatic compaction. This suggests that FG within ADD2-FG may be less accessible for the interaction with the viral core’s hydrophobic pocket due to its involvement in this collapsed conformational ensemble (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-E</xref>, suppl. Fig.3). This aligns with the inability of CPSF6 carrying ADD2 in place of the LCRs to induce CPSF6 puncta (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). On the other hand, the deletion of only the two LCRs, while keeping the FG peptide intact, resulted in unexpected findings. The ΔLCR mutant exhibited a stronger binding affinity for the viral core when compared to the wild-type protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). These results suggest that the LCRs surrounding the FG motif are modulating the affinity of CPSF6 to the viral core, which might be important for function. By contrast, deletion of the MCD (ΔMCD) but retention of other regions, such as the FG peptide and the LCRs, demonstrated a binding affinity to the viral core similar to that of the wild-type protein. These results suggest that the MCD domain is not involved in the binding of CPSF6 to the viral core, which is not surprising since the CPSF6 (1-358), which does not have an MCD, binds to the viral core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the viral capsid, through the FG peptide of CPSF6, constitutes the scaffold of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta.</p>

</fig>
<p>In summary, our results suggest that the FG peptide is the main determinant involved in the binding of CPSF6 to the viral capsid. Interestingly, our work implies that the LCRs may be modulating the affinity of the FG motif for the viral core (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Recognition motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions, such as the FG motif of CPSF6, are usually embedded within longer intrinsically disordered regions that can modulate affinity of the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Karlsson et al., 2022</xref>). Taken together, our data show that the FG peptide coordinates both the binding to the viral core and the induction of CPSF6 puncta. This coordination suggests that the FG peptide plays a critical dual role in recognizing the viral capsid and facilitating the cellular clustering of CPSF6, which may be part of the cellular response to viral entry.</p>

<title>Role of FG domain in viral replication</title>
<p>We aimed to investigate the role of FG domain of CPSF6 in viral infection. To correctly perform the infectivity assay, we generated stable cell clones expressing protein levels comparable to WT cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref> A-B). Importantly, we assessed the reproducibility of our experiments by freezing and thawing these clones. Thus, we performed infectivity assays in THP-1 macrophage-like cells WT, KO for CPSF6 or complemented with CPSF6ΔFG, using both a single-round virus and a replication-competent virus. The results, shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 C-D</xref>, indicate that complete depletion of CPSF6 reduces infectivity, as measured by luciferase expression in a single-round infection (KO: ∼65%; ΔFG: ∼74%; compared to WT: 100% on average). Notably, a more pronounced defect in viral particle production was observed when WT virus was used for infection (KO: ∼21%; ΔFG: ∼16%; compared to WT: 100% on average). According to our results, depletion of full-length CPSF6, or expression of a CPSF6 variant lacking only the FG domain, both reduce viral infection compared to cells expressing full-length CPSF6, indicating that the FG domain plays an important role in HIV-1 infection.</p>

<title>Biogenesis of HIV-Induced CPSF6 Puncta carrying Nuclear Speckle factors</title>
<p>Nuclear speckle factors, particularly those involved in their biogenesis, such as SON and SRRM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ilik et al., 2020</xref>), have been identified as constituents of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. However, the specific role of NSs in these puncta remains unclear. Most of the existing results have been obtained through immunofluorescence experiments conducted several days post-infection. In this study, we conducted a time course experiment to investigate the biogenesis of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta, which contain NS factors. Our goal was to capture the fusion event between the HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta and NS, providing insights into the dynamics of how HIV manipulates host nuclear structures during infection. We hypothesized that NS factors might either be recruited during the initial formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta, shortly after the virus is released from the nuclear basket of the NPC, or later via the fusion between NSs and HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. To investigate this, we performed live imaging to track CPSF6-mNeonGreen and NSs in cells expressing endogenous SRRM2 fused with a Halo tag, using CRISPR Paint (courtesy of Roy Parker) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lester et al., 2021</xref>).We fixed and labeled samples at different time points post-infection, ranging from 6 h.p.i. to 30 h.p.i. (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, Suppl. Fig.4A-B). At 6 h.p.i., 27% of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta were still individual, compared to only 9% at 30 h.p.i. (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Concurrently, 61% of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta were fused with NS at 6 h.p.i., rising to 75% at 30 h.p.i. (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). This indicates a progressive increase in the number of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta fusing with NS over time (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Overall, we detected individual CPSF6 puncta (green) and NSs (red) that quickly fused, confirming that this fusion occurs within the two independent puncta, CPSF6 and SRRM2, rather than during the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-C</xref>, <xref rid="supp2" ref-type="supplementary-file">Movies 1A, 1B</xref>).</p>

We calculated the percentage of CPSF6 puncta in HIV infected THP-1 control cells (approximately 78%) and in HIV infected THP-1 cells depleted for SRRM2 (about 43%) and SON (around 66%). Results from our experimental conditions indicate that the partial depletion of SRRM2 affects the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta, while the depletion of SON slightly reduces their establishment (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>

<title>The IDR of SRRM2 is a crucial element for the fusion of HIV-Induced CPSF6 puncta to the nuclear speckles</title>
<p>CPSF6 contains several disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Di Nunzio et al., 2023</xref>) as well as NS factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ilik et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies have established the role of IDR of SRRM2 in the biogenesis of NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ilik et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we investigate the role of IDRs within NS factors, with a specific emphasis on SRRM2, in the fusion and stabilization of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. To address this inquiry, we utilized previously published HEK293 cell lines generated using the CRISPaint system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lester et al., 2021</xref>), comprising two distinct lines: HaloTag SRRM2, SRRM2 full-length (FL) (1-2748 aa) fused with Halo tag(insertion at amino acid [aa] 2,708), and a cell line lacking the C-terminal IDR of SRRM2, known as ΔIDR HaloTag SRRM2(1-429 aa, with halo insertion at aa 430).</p>
<p>As anticipated, the truncated form of SRRM2 displayed a more diffuse distribution within the nucleus, without recruitment to NS (suppl. Fig.5 A-E), and consequently lacked nuclear puncta (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref> top panels). On the other hand, the number of SON puncta was highly similar between the two cell lines (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>, panels on the bottom, Suppl. Fig.7).</p>
<p>Subsequently, we quantified the formation of CPSF6 puncta in both cell lines infected with HIV-1. No significant difference in HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta formation was observed between HEK293 and HEK293 carrying the SRRM2 halo tag (∼27%). However, a substantial reduction in HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta was evident in the cell line carrying the SRRM2 form that lacks the IDR ( ∼11%) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). Collectively, these results underscore the pivotal role of the SRRM2 IDR in the stabilization of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta through their fusion with NSs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HIV-1 capsid has transformed long-standing assumptions in the field. Previously considered an undruggable viral target due to the belief that it disassembled shortly after HIV entered target cells, whereas recent findings have revealed its essential role in nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ay and Di Nunzio, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blanco-Rodriguez and Di Nunzio, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blanco-Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Taylor and Fassati, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yamashita and Emerman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zila et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, the first-in-class antiretroviral capsid inhibitor, Lenacapavir, has shown remarkable results in patients, demonstrating that the capsid, contrary to previous belief, can indeed be a viable therapeutic target. While Lenacapavir improves patients’ quality of life with only two injections per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Link et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Segal-Maurer et al., 2022</xref>), no current antiretroviral drugs provide a cure. This may be due to our incomplete understanding of certain aspects of HIV biology. In this study, we shed light on the post-nuclear entry steps, a critical phase for the establishment of viral reservoirs, which represent the main barrier to a cure. Recent findings have shown that not only the HIV viral capsid translocates through the NPC, but that the viral nuclear entry also enhances the formation of CPSF6 puncta. Additionally, it has been revealed that RT is completed within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burdick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dharan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Selyutina et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, incoming viral RNA has been observed to be sequestered in nuclear niches in cells treated with the reversible reverse transcriptase inhibitor, NVP. When macrophage-like cells are infected in the presence of NVP, the incoming viral RNA is held within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ay et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>). This scenario could also occur in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Notably, we found that pharmacological dismantling of CPSF6 puncta prevents the restoration of nuclear reverse transcription, indicating that HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta are critical for the viral life cycle. Conversely, THP-1 cells either depleted of CPSF6 or expressing a CPSF6 variant lacking the FG domain exhibit impaired viral replication. Understanding the biogenesis of these puncta could be a significant step towards deepening our knowledge of HIV biology and providing additional tools to combat this pandemic virus.</p>
<p>Here we identify the disordered FG peptide essential for the binding with the viral capsid as the inducer of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. Notably, CPSF6 protein lacking the FG peptide is incapable of forming nuclear puncta. Moreover, we discovered that the two major intrinsically disordered regions of CPSF6, the MCDs and the LCRs, are dispensable for the formation of viral nuclear puncta. The MCDs of CPSF6 have been shown to provide cohesion for NS condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Greig et al., 2020</xref>). A study performed in HEK293T-derived CPSF6 knockout (CKO) cells (clone B8) complemented with a tagged CPSF6 reported that the MCD is critical for CPSF6 cluster formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jang et al., 2024</xref>). In contrast, we chose to work with a more physiologically relevant cell line for HIV infection, macrophage-like cells, and we employed untagged CPSF6 proteins (WT and deletion mutants) to avoid potential artifacts introduced by protein tagging. Under our experimental conditions, the MCD did not appear to play a critical role in the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. CPSF6 puncta induced by CPSF6 depleted for the MCD upon infection are highly similar to those formed by wild-type CPSF6, suggesting that MCDs do not play a significant role in this process. Additionally, the LCRs of CPSF6 also do not appear to influence puncta formation, as their depletion does not reduce the number of CPSF6 puncta. This indicates that neither the MCDs nor the LCRs are involved in CPSF6 puncta formation during HIV infection. Surprisingly, when we assessed the ability of CPSF6 domains to bind to the viral capsid, we observed that the deletion of LCRs increases CPSF6’s ability to bind to the viral capsid. We hypothesize that a change in charges may alter the binding mechanism of CPSF6 when LCRs are absent. In scenarios where the FG motif is depleted, we observed a dramatic inhibition of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta formation and a lack of binding to the viral core <italic>in vitro</italic>. On the flip side, the linkage between CPSF6 entities is facilitated by the FG peptides’ interaction with certain hydrophobic CA pockets along adjoining hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wei et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, it’s conceivable that FG peptides, not involved in the capsid’s binding, could coalesce similarly to FG-Nups. These undergo phase separation, forming condensates with nuclear pore complex-like permeability barrier features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>We have also identified HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta formation independent of NS at early stages post-infection, with a progressive increase in CPSF6 puncta co-localizing with NS over time. These results were obtained by focusing our studies on two scaffold proteins involved in NS biogenesis: SON and SRRM2. Over the past approximately 0.6–1.2 billion years of metazoan evolution, these two factors have undergone significant lengthening, unlike many other proteins involved in splicing. This extension primarily occurred within their IDRs, which are commonly associated with liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and the formation of biomolecular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rai et al., 2018</xref>). Co-depleting SRRM2 with SON, or depleting SON in a cell line where it is deleted the intrinsically disordered C-terminus of SRRM2, abolished the formation of NSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ilik et al., 2020</xref>). However, the depletion of only one factor does not abolish NSs. Consistent with this finding, we observed that the depletion of SRRM2 does not affect the presence of SON nuclear puncta. Similar results were obtained with cells genetically modified to express the truncated form of SRRM2 lacking the IDRs. When the ΔIDR SRRM2-halo tag was detected by the halo ligand, there was no recruitment of the truncated SRRM2 form in NSs. However, if SC35 is used as a target for antibodies, it can still be detected, albeit with a much lower intensity signal than in cells expressing the full-length SRRM2. Additionally, we observed a significant reduction in the detection of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. The few CPSF6 puncta detected in these cells colocalized with the weak SC35 signal. These results suggest that the IDR of SRRM2 plays an important role in HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta stabilization, but rare puncta can appear, likely induced by redundant NS factors. This indicates that further investigation is needed to better understand the hijacking of NS by HIV.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results reveal the intricate interplay between individual CPSF6 domains and the viral capsid in dictating the nuclear fate of the virus. Concurrently, the IDR domain of SRRM2 contributes to the enlargement of particular nuclear speckles with the fusion of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. Lastly, these HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta necessitate of FG peptide to engage the viral core.</p>
<p>Overall, this study could provide insights into the understanding of viral invasion and persistence within the host.</p>

<title>Protein expression and purification</title>
<p>pET-11a vectors were used to express the HIV-1 capsid protein. Point mutations, A14C and E45C were introduced using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All proteins were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> one-shoot BL21star<sup>TM</sup> (DE3) cells (Invitrogen). Briefly, LB medium was inoculated with overnight cultures, which were grown at 30°C until mid log-phase (<italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub>, 0.6-0.8). Protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight at 18°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C, and pellets were stored at −80°C until purification. Purification of capsid was carried out as follows. Pellets from 2 L of bacteria were lysed by sonication (Qsonica microtip: 4420; A=45; 2 minutes; 2 seconds on; 2 seconds off for 12 cycles), in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH=8, 50mM NaCl, 100mM β-mercaptoethanol and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 40,000g for 20 min at 4°C. Proteins from the supernatant were precipitated by incubation with 1/3 of volume of saturated ammonium sulfate containing 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol for 20 min at 4°C and centrifugation at 8,000g for 20 min at 4°C. Precipitated proteins were resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (25mM MES pH6.5, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and sonicated 2-3 times (Qsonica microtip: 4420; A=45; 2 minutes; 1 second on; 2 seconds off). Sample was dialyzed 3 times in buffer A (2 h, overnight, 2 h). The sample was sonicated and diluted in 500 ml of buffer A and was chromatographed sequentially on a 5 ml HiTrap<sup>TM</sup> Q HP column and on a 5 ml HiTrap<sup>TM</sup> SP FF column (GE Healthcare), both pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The capsid protein was eluted from HiTrap<sup>TM</sup> SP FF column using a linear gradient from 0-2 M of NaCl. Absorbance at 280 nm was checked to take the eluted fraction that had higher protein levels. Pooled fractions were dialyzed 3 times (2 h, overnight, 2 h) in storage buffer (25mM MES, 2M NaCl, 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Sample was concentrated using centricons to a concentration of 20 mg/ml and stored at -80°C.</p>

<title>Assembly of stabilized HIV-1 capsid tubes</title>
<p>1 mL of monomeric capsid (3 mg/mL or 1 mg/mL) was dialyzed in SnakeSkin dialysis tubing 10,000 MWCO (Thermo Scientific) against a buffer that is high in salt and contains a reducing agent (buffer 1: 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 M NaCl, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol) at 4°C for 8 hours. Subsequently the protein was dialyzed against the same buffer without the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol (buffer 2: 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 M NaCl) at 4°C for 8 hours. The absence of β-mercaptoethanol in the second dialysis allows formation of disulfide bonds between Cysteine 14 and 43 inter-capsid monomers in the hexamer. Finally the protein is dialyzed against buffer 3 (20 mM Tris, pH 8,0, 40 mM NaCl) at 4°C for 8 hours. Assembled complexes were kept at 4°C up to 1 month.</p>

Cell media was completely removed and cells were lysed in 300 μL of capsid binding buffer (CBB: 10 mM Tris, pH 8,0, 1,5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl) by scrapping off the plate. Cells were rotated at 4°C for 15 min and then centrifuged to remove cellular debris ( 21,000 <italic>x g</italic> ,15 minutes, 4 °C). Cell lysates were incubated with stabilized HIV-1 capsid tubes for 1 h at 25 °C. Subsequently, stabilized HIV-1 capsid tubes were washed by pelleting the complexes by centrifugation at 21,000 x g for 2 min. Pellets were washed using by resuspension in CBB or PBS.

<title>Bioinformatics analysis of CPSF6</title>
<p>Intrinsic disorder propensity of CPSF6 was evaluated using the Rapid Intrinsic Disorder Analysis Online platform (RIDAO) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ridao.app/">https://ridao.app/</ext-link>) designed to predict disordered residues and regions in a query protein based on its amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dayhoff and Uversky, 2022</xref>). RIDAO yields results by combining the outputs of several commonly used per-residue disorder predictors, such as PONDR® VLXT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Romero et al., 2001</xref>), PONDR® VL3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Peng et al., 2006</xref>), PONDR® VLS2B(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Peng et al., 2005</xref>), PONDR® FIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Xue et al., 2010</xref>), as well as IUPred2 (Short) and IUPred2 (Long)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dosztanyi et al., 2005a</xref>, b). RIDAO also computes a mean disorder score for each residue based on these. In the resulting intrinsic disorder profile, the disorder score of 0.5 is the threshold between order and disorder, where residues/regions above 0.5 are disordered, and residues/regions below 0.5 are ordered. The disorder score of 0.15 is the threshold between order and flexibility, where residues/regions with the disorder scores above 0.15 but below 0.5 are flexible, and residues/regions below 0.15 are highly ordered.</p>
<p>Amino acid compositions of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (residues 261-358) of human CPSF6 and its different variants (CPSF6 ΔFG ΔLCR, CPSF6 ΔLCR, CPSF6 ΔFG, and CPSF6 ADD2 ΔLCR) were analyzed to evaluate the relative abundance of prion-like low complexity region (LCR) defining uncharged, charged, and Pro residues in these protein regions. The corresponding values of the relative abundance of these residue groups were calculated by dividing numbers of prion-like LCR defining uncharged (Ala, Gly, Val, Phe, Tyr, Leu, Ile, Ser, Thr, Pro, Asn, Gln), charged (Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg), and Pro residues by total number of amino acids in the corresponding protein fragments. As references, we used the corresponding data for protein sequences deposited to the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database that provides information on the overall distribution of amino acids in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bairoch et al., 2005</xref>); PDB Select 25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berman et al., 2000</xref>), which is a subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank with less than 25% sequence identity, biased towards the composition of proteins amenable to crystallization studies; and DisProt 3.4 that is comprised of a set of consensus sequences of experimentally determined disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sickmeier et al., 2007</xref>). Per-residue intrinsic disorder propensities of the LCR-FG and ADD2-FG sequences were evaluated by PONDR® VLXT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Romero et al., 2001</xref>), which is sensitive to local peculiarities of the amino acid sequences freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pondr.com/">http://www.pondr.com/</ext-link> (accessed on August 03, 2024). Linear distribution of the net charge per residue (NCPR) within the LCR-FG and ADD2-FG sequences were evaluated by CIDER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Holehouse et al., 2017</xref>), which is a webserver for the analysis of a wide range of the physicochemical properties encoded by IDP sequences freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pappulab.wustl.edu/CIDER">http://pappulab.wustl.edu/CIDER</ext-link> (accessed on August 03, 2024).

<title>Imaging and statistical analysis</title>
<p>All images were analysed using Fiji Software. More in detail, for the count of the nuclear speckles a macro was computed to segment cellular nuclei and to select and count the nuclear speckles. For the nuclei segmentation a Gaussian Blur with sigma=2 was used and for the channel related to the nuclear speckles the set threshold was at 7000-46012 (min and max). For the counting, a “size =10 – Infinity summarize” was used for the nuclei, whereas for the nuclear speckles the size was reduced to “size=0-Infinity summarize”.</p>
<p>For live imaging analysis, Arivis software was used to reconstruct the 3D movies.</p>
<p>All data were statistically analyzed with GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>). Calculations were performed and figures were drawn using Excel 365 or GraphPad Prism 8.0. Statistical analysis was performed, with Wilcoxon matched paired t-tests or Mann–Whitney unpaired t-tests. Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were calculated using GraphPad Prism.</p>

<p>In recent years, our understanding of the nuclear steps of the HIV-1 life cycle has made significant advances. It has emerged that HIV-1 completes reverse transcription in the nucleus and that the host factor CPSF6 forms condensates around the viral capsid. The precise function of these CPSF6 condensates is under investigation, but it is clear that the HIV-1 capsid protein is required for their formation. This study by Tomasini et al. investigates the genesis of the CPSF6 condensates induced by HIV-1 capsid, what other co-factors may be required and their relationship with nuclear speckels (NS). The authors show that disruption of the condensates by the drug PF74, added post-nuclear entry, blocks HIV-1 infection, which supports their functional role. They generated CPSF6 KO THP-1 cell lines, in which they expressed exogenous CPSF6 constructs to map by microscopy and pull down assays the regions critical for the formation of condensates. This approach revealed that the LCR region of CPSF6 is required for capsid binding but not for condensates whereas the FG region is essential for both. Using SON and SRRM2 as markers of NS, the authors show that CPSF6 condensates precede their merging with NS but that depletion of SRRM2, or SRRM2 lacking the IDR domain, delays the genesis of condensates, which are also smaller.</p>
<p>The study is interesting and well conducted and defines some characteristics of the CPSF6-HIV-1 condensates. Their results on the NS are valuable. The data presented are convincing.</p>
<p>I have two main concerns.</p>
<p>Firstly, the functional outcome of the various protein mutants and KOs is not evaluated. Although Figure 1 shows that disruption of the CPSF6 puncta by PF74 impairs HIV-1 infection, it is not clear if HIV-1 infection is at all affected by expression of the mutant CPSF6 forms (and SRRM2 mutants), or KO/KD of the various host factors. The cell lines are available, and so it should be possible to measure HIV-1 infection and reverse transcription. Secondly, the authors have not assessed if the effects observed on the NS impact HIV-1 gene expression, which would be interesting to know given that NS are sites of highly active gene transcription. With the reagents at hand, it should be possible to investigate this too.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>HIV-1 infection induces CPSF6 aggregates in the nucleus that contain the viral protein CA. The study of the functions and composition of these nuclear aggregates have raised considerable interest in the field, and they have emerged as sites in which reverse transcription is completed and in the proximity of which viral DNA becomes integrated. In this work, the authors have mutated several regions of the CPSF6 protein to identify the domains important for nuclear aggregation, in addition to the already-known FG-region; they have characterized the kinetics of fusion between CPSF6 aggregates and SC35 nuclear speckles and have determined the role of two nuclear speckle components in this process (SRRM2, SUN2).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work examines systematically the domains of CPSF6 of importance for nuclear aggregate formation in an elegant manner in which these mutants complement an otherwise CPSF6-KO cell line. In addition, this work evidences a novel role for the protein SRRM2 in HIV-induced aggregate formation, overall advancing our comprehension of the components required for their formation and regulation.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors investigate the requirements for the formation of CPSF6 puncta induced by HIV-1 under a high multiplicity of infection conditions. Not surprisingly, they observe that mutation of the Phe-Gly (FG) repeat responsible for CPSF6 binding to the incoming HIV-1 capsid abrogates CPSF6 punctum formation. Perhaps more interestingly, they show that the removal of other domains of CPSF6, including the mixed-charge domain (MCD), does not affect the formation of HIV-1-induced CPSF6 puncta. The authors also present data suggesting that CPSF6 puncta form individual before fusing with nuclear speckles (NSs) and that the fusion of CPSF6 puncta to NSs requires the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of the NS component SRRM2. While the study presents some interesting findings, there are some technical issues that need to be addressed and the amount of new information is somewhat limited. Also, the authors' finding that deletion of the CPSF6 MCD does not affect the formation of HIV-1-induced CPSF6 puncta contradicts recent findings of Jang et al.

<p>We thank the reviewer for her/his valuable feedback on our manuscript. We are pleased to see her/his appreciation of our results, and we did our utmost to address the highlighted points to further improve our work.</p>
<p>To correctly perform the infectivity assay, we generated stable cell clones—a process that required considerable time, particularly during the selection of clones expressing protein levels comparable to wild-type (WT) cells. To accurately measure infectivity, it was essential to use stable clones expressing the most important deletion mutant, ∆FG CPSF6, at levels similar to those of CPSF6 in WT cells (new Fig.5 A-B). Importantly, we assessed the reproducibility of our experiments by freezing and thawing these clones.</p>
<p>Regarding SRRM2, in THP-1 cells we were only able to achieve a knockdown, which still retains residual SRRM2 protein, albeit at much lower levels. Due to the essential role of SRRM2 in cell survival, obtaining a complete knockout in this cell line is not feasible, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from these experiments.</p>
<p>In contrast, 293T cells carrying the endogenous SRRM2 deletion mutant (ΔIDR) cannot be infected with replication-competent HIV-1, as they lack expression of CD4 and either CCR4 or CCR5. These cells were instead used to monitor the dynamics of CPSF6 puncta assembly within nuclear speckles. However, they are not a suitable model for studying the impact of the depletion of SRRM2 in viral infection.</p>
<p>Thus, we performed infectivity assays in a more relevant cell line for HIV-1 infection, THP-1 macrophage-like cells, using both a single-round virus and a replication-competent virus. The new results, shown in Figure 5 C-D, indicate that complete depletion of CPSF6 reduces infectivity, as measured by luciferase expression in a single-round infection (KO: ~65%; ΔFG: ~74%; compared to WT: 100% on average). Notably, a more pronounced defect in viral particle production was observed when WT virus was used for infection (KO: ~21%; ΔFG: ~16%; compared to WT: 100% on average). These findings support the referee’s insightful suggestion that the absence of CPSF6 could also impair HIV-1 gene expression.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>HIV-1 infection induces CPSF6 aggregates in the nucleus that contain the viral protein CA. The study of the functions and composition of these nuclear aggregates have raised considerable interest in the field, and they have emerged as sites in which reverse transcription is completed and in the proximity of which viral DNA becomes integrated. In this work, the authors have mutated several regions of the CPSF6 protein to identify the domains important for nuclear aggregation, in addition to the alreadyknown FG region; they have characterized the kinetics of fusion between CPSF6 aggregates and SC35 nuclear speckles and have determined the role of two nuclear speckle components in this process (SRRM2, SUN2).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work examines systematically the domains of CPSF6 of importance for nuclear aggregate formation in an elegant manner in which these mutants complement an otherwise CPSF6-KO cell line. In addition, this work evidences a novel role for the protein SRRM2 in HIV-induced aggregate formation, overall advancing our comprehension of the components required for their formation and regulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the results presented in this manuscript, in particular the kinetics of fusion between CPSF6aggregates and SC35 speckles have been published before (PMID: 32665593; 32997983).</p>
<p>The observations of the different effects of CPSF6 mutants, as well as SRRM2/SUN2 silencing experiments are not complemented by infection data which would have linked morphological changes in nuclear aggregates to function during viral infection. More importantly, these functional data could have helped stratify otherwise similar morphological appearances in CPSF6 aggregates.</p>
<p>Overall, the results could be presented in a more concise and ordered manner to help focus the attention of the reader on the most important issues. Most of the figures extend to 3-4 different pages and some information could be clearly either aggregated or moved to supplementary data.</p>

<p>First, we thank the reviewer for her/his appreciation of our study and to give to us the opportunity to better explain our results and to improve our manuscript. We appreciate the reviewer’s positive feedback on our study, and we will do our best to address her/his concerns. In the meantime, we would like to clarify the focus of our study. Our research does not aim to demonstrate an association between CPSF6 condensates (we use the term &quot;condensates&quot; rather than &quot;aggregates,&quot; as aggregates are generally non-dynamic (Alberti &amp; Hyman, 2021; Banani et al., 2017; Scoca et al., JMCB 2022), and our work specifically examines the dynamic behavior of CPSF6 puncta formed during infection and nuclear speckles. The association between CPSF6 puncta and NS has already been established in previous studies, as noted in the manuscript (PMID: 32665593; 32997983). The previous studies (PMID: 32665593; 32997983) showed that CPSF6 puncta colocalize with SC35 upon HIV infection and in the submitted study we study their kinetics.</p>
<p>About the point highlighted by the reviewer: &quot;Kinetics of fusion between CPSF6-aggregates and SC35 speckles have been published before.&quot;</p>
<p>Our study differs from prior work PMID 32665593 because we utilize a full-length HIV genome, and we did not follow the integrase (IN) fluorescence in trans and its association with CPSF6 but we specifically assess if CPSF6 clusters form in the nucleus independently of NS factors and next to fuse with them. In the current study we evaluated the dynamics of formation of CPSF6/NS puncta, which it has not been explored before. Given this focus, we believe that our work offers a novel perspective on the molecular interactions that facilitate HIV / CPSF6-NS fusion.</p>
<p>We calculated that 27% of CPSF6 clusters were independent from NS at 6 h post-infection, compared to only 9% at 30 h. This likely reflects a reduction in individual clusters as more become fused with nuclear speckles over time. At the same time, these data suggest that the fusion process can begin even earlier. Indeed, it has been reported that in macrophages, the peak of viral nuclear import occurs before 6 h post-infection (doi: 10.1038/s41564-020-0735-8).</p>
<p>In addition, we have incorporated new experiments assessing viral infectivity in the absence of CPSF6, or in CPSF6-knockout cells expressing either a CPSF6 mutant lacking the FG peptide or the WT protein. As shown in our new Figure 5, these results demonstrate that the FG peptide is critical for viral replication in THP-1 cells.</p>
<p>For better clarity, we would like to specify that our study focuses on the role of SON, a scaffold factor of nuclear speckles, rather than SUN2 (SUN domain-containing protein 2), which is a component of the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex.</p>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have revised the text and combined figures to improve clarity and facilitate reader comprehension. We appreciate the constructive comment of the reviewer.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors investigate the requirements for the formation of CPSF6 puncta induced by HIV-1 under a high multiplicity of infection conditions. Not surprisingly, they observe that mutation of the Phe-Gly (FG) repeat responsible for CPSF6 binding to the incoming HIV-1 capsid abrogates CPSF6 punctum formation.

The authors also present data suggesting that CPSF6 puncta form individual before fusing with nuclear speckles (NSs) and that the fusion of CPSF6 puncta to NSs requires the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of the NS component SRRM2. While the study presents some interesting findings, there are some technical issues that need to be addressed and the amount of new information is somewhat limited. Also, the authors' finding that deletion of the CPSF6 MCD does not affect the formation of HIV-1-induced CPSF6 puncta contradicts recent findings of Jang et al. (doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkae769).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for her/his thoughtful feedback and the opportunity to elaborate on why our findings provide a distinct perspective compared to those of Jang et al. (doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkae769).</p>
<p>One potential reason for the differences between our findings and those of Jang et al. could be the choice of experimental systems. Jang et al. conducted their study in HEK293T cells with CPSF6 knockouts, as described in Sowd et al., 2016 (doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1524213113). In contrast, our work focused on macrophage-like THP-1 cells, which share closer characteristics with HIV-1’s natural target cells.</p>
<p>Our approach utilized a complete CPSF6 knockout in THP-1 cells, enabling us to reintroduce untagged versions of CPSF6, such as wild-type and deletion mutants, to avoid potential artifacts from tagging. Jang et al. employed HA-tagged CPSF6 constructs, which may lead to subtle differences in experimental outcomes due to the presence of the tag.</p>
<p>Finally, our investigation into the IDR of SRRM2 relied on CRISPR-PAINT to generate targeted deletions directly in the endogenous gene (Lester et al., 2021, DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2021.03.026). This approach provided a native context for studying SRRM2’s role.</p>
<p>We will incorporate these clarifications into the discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We clarified the concept as follows: “the initial stages of the viral life cycle, such as the reverse transcription (the conversion of the viral RNA in DNA) and the uncoating (loss of the capsid), have been understood to mainly occur within the host cytoplasm.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 124: the results in Figure 1 are not at all explained in the text. PF74 does not act on CPSF6, it acts on CA and this in turn leads to CPS6 puncta disappearance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>PF74 binds the same hydrophobic pocket of the viral core as CPSF6. However, when viral cores are located within CPSF6 puncta, treatment with a high dose of PF74 leads to a rapid disassembly of these puncta, while viral cores remain detectable up to 2 hours post-treatment (Ay et al., EMBO J. 2024). Here, we simply describe what we observed by confocal microscopy. Said that HIV-Induced CPSF6 Puncta include both CPSF6 proteins and viral cores as we have now specified.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Specific comments that the authors should address are outlined below.</p>
<p>(1) As mentioned in the summary above, the authors' findings seem to be in direct contradiction with recent work published by Alan Engelman's lab in NAR. The authors should address the possible reason(s) for this discrepancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We mention the potential reasons for the differences in the results between our study and Engelman’s lab study in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The major finding here that deletion of the CFSF6 FG repeat prevents the formation of CFSP6 puncta is unsurprising, as the FG repeat is responsible for capsid binding. This has been reported previously and such mutants have been used as controls in other studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our study demonstrates that the FG domain is the sole region responsible for the formation of CPSF6 puncta, rather than the LCR or MCD domains. The unique role of the FG domain in CPSF6 that promotes the formation of CPSF6 puncta without the help of the other IDRs during viral infection is a finding particularly novel, as it has not yet been reported in the literature.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 339, the authors state: &quot;incoming viral RNA has been observed to be sequestered in nuclear niches in cells treated with the reversible reverse transcriptase inhibitor, NEV. When macrophage-like cells are infected in the presence of NEV, the incoming viral RNA is held within the nucleus (Rensen et al., 2021; Scoca et al., 2023). This scenario is comparable to what is observed in patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy&quot;. In what way is this comparable to what is observed in individuals on ART? I see no basis for this statement. Sequestration of viral RNA in the nucleus is not the basis for maintaining the viral reservoir in individuals on therapy.</p>

<p>(4) General comment: analyzing single-cell-derived KO clones is very risky because of random clonal variability between individual cells in the population. If single-cell-derived clones are used, phenotypes could be confirmed with multiple, independent clones.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used a clone completely KO for CPSF6 mainly to investigate the role of a specific domain in condensate formation and it will be difficult that clone selection could have introduced artifacts in this context. Other available clones retain residual endogenous protein, which prevents us from accurately assessing CPSF6 cluster formation in the various deletion mutants. A complete CPSF6 knockout is essential for studying puncta formation, as it eliminates potential artifacts arising from protein tags that could alter the phase separation properties of the protein under investigation.</p>

<p>(5) Line 214. &quot;It is predicted to form two short α helices and a ß strand, arranged as: α helix - FG - ß strand - α helix&quot;. What is this based on? No citation is provided and no data are shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In fact, the statement &quot;It is predicted to form two short α helices and a ß strand, arranged as: α helix - FG - ß strand - α helix&quot; is based on the data shown in Figure 4E presenting data generated by PSIPRED.</p>

<p>(6) Figure 1B. &quot;Luciferase values were normalized by total proteins revealed with the Bradford kit&quot;. What does this mean? I couldn't find anything explaining how the viral inputs were normalized.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The amount of the virus used is the same for all samples, we used MOI 10 as described in the legend of Figure 1. It is important to normalize the RLU (luciferase assay) with the total amount of proteins to be sure that we are comparing similar number of cells. Obviously, the cells were plated on the same amount on each well, the normalization in our case it is just an additional important control.</p>

<p>(8) Figure 5B. The differences seen are very small and of questionable significance. The data suggest that by 6 hpi, around 75% of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta are already fused with NSs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We calculated that 27% of CPSF6 clusters were independent from NS at 6 h post-infection, compared to only 9% at 30 h. This likely reflects a reduction in individual clusters as more become fused with nuclear speckles over time. At the same time, these data suggest that the fusion process can begin even earlier. Indeed, it has been reported that in macrophages, the peak of viral nuclear import occurs before 6 h post-infection (doi: 10.1038/s41564-020-0735-8).</p>

<p>(9) Figure 6. Immunofluorescence is not a good method for quantifying KD efficiency. The authors should perform western blotting to measure KD efficiency. This is an important point, because the effect sizes are small, quite likely due to incomplete KD.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed WB and quantified the results, which correlated with the IF data and their imaging analysis. These new findings have been incorporated into Figure 8A. Of note, deletion of the IDR of SRRM2 does not affect the number of SON puncta (Fig.8C), but significantly reduces the number of CPSF6 puncta in infected cells compared to those expressing full-length SRRM2 (Fig.8D).</p>

<p>(10) There are a variety of issues with the text that should be corrected.</p>
<p>The authors use &quot;RT&quot; to mean both the enzyme (reverse transcriptase) and the process (reverse transcription). This is incorrect and will confuse the reader. RT refers to the enzyme (noun, not verb).</p>
<p>The commonly used abbreviation for nevirapine is NVP, not NEV.</p>
<p>In line 60, it is stated that the capsid contains 250 hexamers. This number is variable, depending on the size and shape of the capsid. By contrast, the capsid has exactly 12 pentamers.</p>
