<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Predator-prey arms races have led to the evolution of finely-tuned disguise strategies. While the theoretical benefits of predator camouflage are well established, no study has yet been able to quantify its consequences for hunting success in natural conditions. We used high-resolution movement data to quantify how barn owls (<italic>Tyto alba</italic>) conceal their approach when using a sit-and-wait strategy. We hypothesized that hunting barn owls would modulate their landing force, potentially reducing noise levels in the vicinity of prey. Analysing 87,957 landings by 163 individuals equipped with GPS tags and accelerometers, we show that barn owls reduce their landing force as they approach their prey, and that landing force predicts the success of the following hunting attempt. Landing force also varied with the substrate, being lowest on man-made poles in field boundaries. The physical environment therefore affects the capacity for sound camouflage, providing an unexpected link between predator-prey interactions and land-use. Finally, hunting strike forces in barn owls were the highest recorded in any bird, relative to body mass, highlighting the range of selective pressures that act on landings and the capacity of these predators to modulate their landing force. Overall, our results provide the first measurements of landing force in a wild setting, revealing a new form of motion-induced sound camouflage and its link to hunting success.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Predation represents one of the strongest forms of selection in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). As a result, animals have evolved sophisticated adaptations to modify the sensory information they emit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Camouflage has been widely studied as an anti-predator defence, with mechanisms including background matching, disruption, and self-shadow concealment facilitating predator avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Predators also show adaptations to reduce detection by prey e.g. in their colour, markings and/or behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). However, in general, predator camouflage is far less understood due to the challenges of simulating predation in controlled settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) and observing predation attempts in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). This has hindered our understanding of the evolutionary forces driving predator camouflage and explains why predator cues have yet to be linked to prey capture success.</p>
<p>Predation typically requires movements of a predator towards its prey, either during a pursuit or an ambush, which usually exposes chasing predators to detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Indeed, motion makes individuals more conspicuous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). But motion also produces sound through the generation of vibrations and turbulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), which can be detected by prey with acute hearing. Many predators alter their movements accordingly, for instance, by moving slowly during the pursuit, which may provide both acoustic and visual camouflage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), particularly when combined with a background colour matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). While the direct link to hunting success remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), selection should favour camouflage strategies that reduce sound emission in quiet environments. The resulting arms race may explain why many nocturnal species have acute senses of hearing, which they rely on to detect danger or prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<p>The silent flight of owls is one of the most iconic examples of noise camouflage. Quiet flight is achieved through comb-like serrations on the leading edge of owls’ wing feathers that break up the turbulent air and minimize associated sound production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). This should provide advantages when hunting on the wing. However, most owls also launch attacks from perches, which involves moving from one perch to the next as they approach their prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Landing also produces vibrations, and hence sound, with the intensity being proportional to the landing force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). In this dynamic sit-and-wait strategy, landing likely becomes a key element of prey approach. We use high-frequency GPS and accelerometer data to investigate the landing dynamics of this sit-and-wait strategy in wild barn owls (<italic>Tyto alba</italic>). Specifically, we quantify whether the landing force varies with (i) the time until the hunting strike (i.e. hunting motivation), (ii) perch type (i.e. environmental context), and (iii) body mass, which varies between males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Finally, we test the extent to which the magnitude of the landing force affects hunting success.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We used GPS loggers and accelerometers to record high resolution movement data during two consecutive breeding seasons (May to August in 2019 and 2020) from 163 wild barn owls (79 males and 84 females) breeding in nest boxes across a 1,000 km² intensive agricultural landscape in the western Swiss plateau. Of these individuals, 142 belonged to pairs for which data were recovered from both partners (71 pairs in total, 40 in 2019, 31 in 2020). The remaining 21 individuals belonged to pairs with data from one partner (11 females and 1 male in 2019; 4 females and 5 males in 2020).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Measurement of landing force</title>
<p>We used the acceleration data to identify 84,855 landings. These were further categorized into perching events (n = 56,874) and hunting strikes (n = 27,981), depending whether barn owls were landing on a perch or attempting to strike prey on the ground (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A and B</xref>, see methods for specific details on behavioural classification). We extracted the peak vectorial sum of the raw acceleration during each landing and converted this to ground reaction force (hereafter “landing force”, in Newtons) using measurements of individual body mass (see methods for detailed description).</p>

<p>A) GPS tracks (black line) during one complete foraging trip (duration = 73 minutes) performed by a female barn owl, with perching events (squares), unsuccessful (circles) and successful (triangles) hunting strikes. Black arrows indicate the flight direction. Successful hunting strikes were identified by the presence of self-feeding events (identified from the acceleration data), or by the direct return to the nest box (identified from the acceleration data and validated with the nest box camera footage). Inset panels show an example of the tri-axial acceleration signals corresponding to both nest-box return and self-feeding behaviours (see <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3</xref> for detailed representations). B) The heave acceleration and the associated force during a perching event (highlighted in orange) and a hunting strike (highlighted in dark purple). C) Variation in peak landing force for perching events (orange dots, n = 56,874) and hunting strikes (dark dots, n = 27,981).

<p>Hunting strikes had landing forces over four times higher than perching events (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2a" ref-type="table">Tables S2</xref>; ratio: 4.5, z-ratio: 486.3, p &lt; 0.001). When converted to multiples of body weight, hunting strikes had peak forces that were equivalent to approximately 13 times body weight, whereas perching events involved forces roughly three times body weight.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Determinants of landing force</title>
<p>We conducted two sets of analyses to investigate factors that influence the variation in landing force in different landing contexts: perching events and hunting strikes.</p>
<p>Barn owls employing a sit-and-wait strategy land on multiple perches before initiating an attack, with successive landings reducing the distance to the target prey (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We analysed the landing forces involved in sequences of perching events in relation to perch type (poles, buildings, and trees: identified using GPS data) and the time before an attack (i.e. pre-hunt time: an indication of hunting motivation). The most important predictor of landing force in perching events was perch type. Perching events on buildings were associated with the highest forces (8.96 N, CI: 8.90 – 9.01 N; <xref rid="tbls3a" ref-type="table">Tables S3</xref>), closely followed by landing on trees (8.86 N, CI: 8.81– 8.90 N; <xref rid="tbls3a" ref-type="table">Tables S3</xref>). Poles were associated with the lowest landing force (8.33 N, CI: 8.28 – 8.38 N, <xref rid="tbls3a" ref-type="table">Tables S3</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="531523v3_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Importantly, within perch types, there was a reduction in landing force with time until the next hunting attempt, with the pattern differing with perch type (EDF<sub>poles</sub> = 4.22, p &lt; 0.001; EDF<sub>buildings</sub> = 1.00, p &lt; 0.001; EDF<sub>trees</sub> = 1.50, p = 0.005; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>, <xref rid="tbls3a" ref-type="table">Tables S3</xref>; n<sub>tot</sub> = 40,306 perching events; see <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig.S4</xref> for the full representation and derivative plot). When barn owls perched on poles, the landing force showed a marked decrease in the last 30 minutes before the hunting strike, whereas landing force only showed a marginal linear reduction with time before strike for landings on buildings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4</xref>). Landing force did not show any significant reduction with time for perching events on trees (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig.S4</xref>, <xref rid="tbls3a" ref-type="table">Tables S3</xref>). Our analysis also revealed a clear temporal pattern in the birds’ use of perch types: owls launched more attacks from poles than from trees, with the fewest attacks launched from buildings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). The pattern of variation in landing force according to perch type and hunting motivation, and the pattern of perch use, were consistent for both males and females, despite females consistently exhibiting greater landing forces than males (<xref rid="tbls3a" ref-type="table">Tables S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, our analysis of hunting strike force showed that both hunting strategy and success were related to strike force (<xref rid="tbls4a" ref-type="table">Tables S4</xref>). When hunting on the wing, successful strikes involved greater forces than unsuccessful strikes (n<sub>tot</sub> = 24,464; successful strikes: n<sub>succ</sub> = 5,830, 40.3 N, CI: 39.5 – 41.2 N; unsuccessful strikes: n<sub>unsucc</sub> = 18,634, 38.4 N, CI: 37.7 – 39.2 N). This was not the case when barn owls hunted from a perch (n<sub>tot</sub> = 3,517; successful strikes: n<sub>succ</sub> = 1,042, 38.8 N, CI: 37.7 – 40.0 N; unsuccessful strikes: n<sub>unsucc</sub> = 2,475, 38.5 N, CI: 37.6 – 39.5 N).</p>

<title>Sexual dimorphism and foraging behaviour</title>
<p>Sexual dimorphism in body mass was marked among our sampled individuals. Males were lighter than females (84 females, average body mass: 322 ± 22.6 g; 79 males, average body mass 281 ± 16.5 g, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig S6</xref>) and provided almost three times more prey per night than females (males: 8 ± 5 prey per night; females: 3 ± 3 prey per night; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig.S7</xref>). Males also displayed higher nightly hunting effort than females (Males: 46 ± 16 hunting attempts per night, n= 79; Females: 25 ± 11 hunting attempts per nights, n=84; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig S8</xref>). However, females were more likely to use a sit-and-wait strategy than males (females: 24% ± 15%, males: 13% ± 10%, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig.S9</xref>). As a result, the number of perching events per night was similar between males and females (Females: 76 ± 23 perching events per nights; Males: 69 ± 20 perching events per night; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig S8</xref>).</p>

<p>We conducted two different analyses to assess whether hunting strategies differed in success and efficiency (i.e. foraging trip duration). To assess the influence of strategy on foraging trip duration, we extracted the number of sit-and-wait hunting attempts and divided this by the total number of hunting attempts and analysed this in relation to the trip duration (min) and sex. Our analysis showed that trip duration increased with the use of the sit-and-wait strategy (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref>, <xref rid="tbls8" ref-type="table">Table S8</xref>): barn owls that only used the sit-and-wait strategy (sit-and-wait frequency =1) took an average of 15 minutes longer to provide prey to the nest than those that only hunted on the wing (sit-and-wait frequency = 0). Nonetheless, barn owls were more successful when using a sit-and-wait strategy, with success also varying with sex. Males were more successful than females, both for the sit-and-wait strategy (males: 34.5%, CI: 31.6% – 37.5%; females: 26.8%, CI: 24.4% – 29.2%, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref rid="tbls5a" ref-type="table">Tables S5</xref>) and hunting on the wing (males: 26.1%, CI: 24.7% – 27.6%; females: 19.1%, CI: 17.7% – 20.5%, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref rid="tbls5a" ref-type="table">Tables S5</xref>).</p>
<p>Landing force also varied with sex, with females generating landing forces that were 26% higher than males on average during perching events (<xref rid="tbls2a" ref-type="table">Tables S2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) (females: 9.94 N, CI: 9.63 N – 10.27 N; males: 7.91 N, CI: 7.65 N – 8.18 N; ratio F/M: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.2–1.31; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Males and females had similar landing forces during hunting strikes, with females generating forces that were only 6% higher than males on average (females: 40.8 N, CI: 39.49 N – 42.18 N; males: 38.41 N, CI: 37.14 N – 39.71 N; ratio F/M: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01–1.11; <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig S10</xref>). However, when considered per unit of body mass (see methods), males exhibited lower forces than females when perching (males: 28.2 N/Kg, CI: 27.4 N/Kg – 29.0 N/Kg; females: 30.9 N/Kg, CI: 30.1 N/Kg – 31.8 N/Kg; <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig S10</xref>), but higher forces than females in hunting strikes (males: 136.2 N/kg, CI: 132.3 N/Kg – 140.2 N/Kg; females: 126.4 N/kg, CI: 122.8 N/Kg – 130.1 N/Kg, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig S10</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally. we performed two additional analyses to investigate potential variation in landing force and flight speed between sexes. We extracted the median ground speed (in m s<sup>-1</sup>) of each flight prior to each hunting attempt and analysed this in relation to the sex of the individual. This showed that males flew slightly more slowly than females when searching for prey on the wing. Males flew slower than females by 0.23 ms-1 (Average flight speed males: 5.24 ms<sup>-1</sup>, CI: 5.15 ms<sup>-1</sup> – 5.33 ms<sup>-1</sup>; average flight speed females: 5.47 ms<sup>-1</sup>, CI: 5.38 ms<sup>-1</sup> – 5.56 ms<sup>-1</sup>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref rid="tbls7" ref-type="table">Table S7</xref>).</p>

<title>Pre-hunt landing force predicts hunting success for sit-and-wait strategy</title>
<p>Finally, we analysed whether the landing force in the last perching event before each hunting attempt (i.e. pre-hunt perching force) predicted variation in hunting success. Our results showed that hunting strategy was the strongest predictor of success (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, <xref rid="tbls6a" ref-type="table">Table S6</xref>, n = 3,040 hunting strikes from 151 individuals, see methods for details on data filtering). When hunting from the wing, the force applied during pre-hunt perching events had no effect on hunting success (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="tbls6a" ref-type="table">Tables S6</xref>, odds ratio: 1.07, CI: 0.97 – 1.17, p = 0.19). However, during sit-and-wait hunts, where the distance between the last perch and the prey is rather short (median distance 6.5 m, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig.S5</xref>), pre-hunt perching force predicted hunting success (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4</xref>, <xref rid="tbls6a" ref-type="table">Tables S6</xref>). When barn owls hunted directly from a perch, the chance of success decreased by 15% for every 1 N increase in pre-hunt perching force (odds ratio: 0.85, CI: 0.79 – 0.99, p = 0.04). Perch type and wind speed were dropped from the final model after model selection (<xref rid="tbls6a" ref-type="table">Table S6b</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Silent flight is considered crucial for owls hunting on the wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). But these predators also use a sit-and-wait strategy, with owls in this study achieving greater hunting success when launching attacks from a perch. Here, owls typically approach prey by moving between multiple perches. They must therefore avoid detection both in flight and as they land, as the benefits of silent flight may be negated if owls are detected during touchdown. We found that barn owls hunting from pasture poles reduced their landing force as they got closer to their prey. This suggests that soft landings are a novel form of acoustic camouflage, with predators reducing their motion-induced sound production in response to information on prey presence, which they gather as they move between perches in the final phase of the hunt. The landing force also affected the success of the subsequent strike, demonstrating the link between the predator camouflage and hunting success. However, the relatively low R-squared value (<xref rid="tbls6a" ref-type="table">Table S6a</xref>) suggests that hunting success is affected by additional factors such as prey behaviour, substrate type and grass length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>
<p>Owls appeared to vary their perch use in relation to their motivation to hunt. For instance, barn owls that landed on a perch 30 to 90 minutes before a strike may have done so without the immediate intention of hunting. This phase was associated with greater use of buildings and trees, which are much higher structures than poles. Owls may therefore preferentially use these perches to rest or gather information over a wider area. The shift in predominant perch type to pasture poles 5-10 minutes before hunting strikes appears to represent a shift to periods of active prey searching. In some systems, the choice to hunt from pasture poles may be driven by prey availability, as pasture poles may be embedded in hedgerows or area with longer grass where prey density might be higher. However, this is unlikely to be the case in our system as pasture poles generally occur in the middle of short-cropped grass (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). Instead, poles may offer advantages in being close to the ground, enhancing opportunities for owls to refine their estimates of prey location, prey type or size. Indeed, the opportunity to gather information from perches could help explain the greater overall hunting success in attacks launched from a perch, compared to hunting on the wing.</p>
<p>In birds, landings are primarily governed by the need to maintain flight control and minimize the risk of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). For instance, Harris’ hawks (<italic>Parabuteo unicinctus</italic>) landing in controlled conditions postponed the stall until they were as close to the landing perch as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Such a strategy could serve two functions in barn owls using sit-and-wait hunting; minimizing both the energy dissipated on impact and the associated sound production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). This raises the question of why owls would ever land with anything above the minimal force. To date, almost all studies have examined landings in controlled conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), yet in the wild, birds are faced with a range of perch types and landing conditions. Perch characteristics are likely to play a pivotal role, as forces tend to be absorbed to a greater degree by compliant substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). In support of this, landings on buildings were associated with the highest mean forces, and higher forces than tree branches (<xref rid="tbls5a" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>), which would be more compliant, with the extent varying with branch type and diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). It was therefore notable that forces were lowest for landings on poles, which, like buildings, are rigid. However, poles occur in open habitat (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>), providing a predictable landing surface that can be approached from all directions, facilitating control through optimal use of the wind vector. Landing force may therefore be influenced by the access options as well as the substrate type. There may also be greater incentive to reduce landing force on poles, since they are close to the ground and sound attenuates with distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>).</p>
<p>The biggest difference in landing force was observed between perching events and hunting strikes. Strike forces in our study are the highest recorded in any bird, relative to body mass, with maximal force reaching more than 34 times the bodyweight (100N). This exceeds estimates previously reported for captive barn owls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), and the kicking strike of the secretary bird (<italic>Sagittarius serpentarius</italic>) that reached an average of 5.1 times body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Unlike secretary birds, whose kicking strength depends solely on the muscular power of their lower limbs, owls use the dynamics of their entire body in flight. While this likely minimizes the chances of prey escape, it is also associated with a potential risk of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Our results likely underestimate the true peak forces, as acceleration was recorded at 50 Hz (for reference, data on force development in controlled car crashes are typically recorded at &gt; 2 kHz). Nonetheless, our data can still provide new insight on the selective pressures that have influenced owl morphology. Indeed, the lower limbs of owls allow for the dual function of absorbing shock during pre-hunt perching and generating extremely powerful hunting strikes.</p>
<p>We find that males and females had very similar strike forces, despite their substantial difference in body mass. This indicates that there might be a selective pressure for a minimum strike force, which males may generate by increasing or maintaining their flight speed prior to a strike to a greater extent than females. Males had a lower flight speed during prey searching, most likely due to their lower body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). While the difference in flight speed was relatively small, slower flight could still have advantages in (i) providing additional time to localize prey, and (ii) enabling birds to manoeuvre into the strike phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). This may help explain why males have higher success when hunting on the wing. Males also showed greater hunting success than females in the sit-and-wait strategy. Here, a lower body mass could also provide advantages by facilitating lower impact, and hence quieter landings.</p>
<p>Given that sit-and-wait hunting is associated with higher success, why do male barn owls not use this strategy more (it was associated with less than 10% of hunting attempts)? Male barn owls engage in intense hunting activity in the breeding season, providing over 15 prey per night in our study. Our results showed that foraging duration increases with the use of the sit-and-wait strategy. Thus, the time required to capture prey appears to be the key element influencing the choice of hunting strategy in males. Females provide fewer prey items and the additional time required for sit-and-wait hunting may therefore be less of a constraint. Furthermore, sit-and-wait hunting may require less flight time and hence effort, which is likely to be particularly advantageous for females due to their greater body mass (and higher flight costs per unit mass).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we use high-frequency movement data to propose a novel form of acoustic camouflage and demonstrate that the magnitude of predator cues can influence hunting success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Minimizing landing force, and associated sound production is likely to be particularly pertinent for nocturnal predators, which operate in quiet environments and target prey with an acute sense of hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Importantly, the ability to minimize landing force was modulated by the perch characteristics, providing a potential link between landing impact and habitat characteristics. This suggests there could be spatial patterns in the effectiveness of acoustic camouflage and, ultimately, hunting success. The availability of different perch types could therefore be an additional, and previously unrecognized, aspect of habitat and territory quality, and, in this case, one that is strongly linked to land-use practices.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Study area and tag deployment</title>
<p>Data were collected from wild barn owls breeding in nest boxes across the Western Swiss plateau, an area of 1,000 km<sup>2</sup> characterized by open and largely intensive agricultural landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Over 380 nest boxes were checked for barn owl clutches between March and August in 2019 and 2020, following Frey and colleagues’ protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). During the two breeding seasons, 163 breeding barn owls (84 females; 79 males) were equipped with data-loggers (2019: 43 males and 49 females; 2020: 36 males and 35 females, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig.S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Adult barn owls were captured at their nest sites approximatively 25 days after the first egg hatched using automatic sliding traps that are activated when birds enter the nest box. AXY-Trek Mini loggers (Technosmart, Italy) were attached as backpacks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>) using a Spectra ribbon harness (Bally Ribbon Mills, USA). These units include a GPS, set to record animal location at 1 Hz, 30 minutes before sunset until 30 minutes after sunrise, to get the full nightly activity period. The loggers also include a tri-axial accelerometer, which recorded acceleration continuously at 50 Hz (recording range ± 16g, 10-bit resolution). After 10 days (± 2days), loggers were recovered by recapturing adults barn owls at their nest sites, again using automatic sliding traps, with data recorded for 5 nights on average (± 1 night). Owls were weighed at both visits and the averaged body mass from the two measurements was used for later analysis. Each device weighed on average 12.4 ± 0.1 g, which corresponds on average to 4% of the barn owl’s total body mass (min = 3%, max = 5%, female average body mass: 322 ± 22.6 g; males average body mass 281 ± 16.5 g) and therefore never exceeded the limit of 5% of the bird’s body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>).</p>
<p>In parallel to each logger deployment, motion sensitive camera traps (Reconyx HC500 hyperfire, resolution of 3.1 megapixel) were positioned at the entrance of all nest boxes to document when animals returned to the nest with prey (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>). Camera traps were scheduled to record burst of three pictures when motion was detected. Moreover, wind data were collected using portable weather stations (Vantage Vue, Davis Instruments corp.) mounted 2.0 m from the ground (standard anemometer measurement height) within 100 m of each nest. Wind speed and direction were recorded every 10 minutes.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Behavioural classification</title>
<p>We used Boolean-based algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>) to classify flight, landing, hunting strikes, and self-feeding from the onboard acceleration and GPS data (see below). Behaviours were summarized in one-second intervals and linked to the closest GPS location in time. Flight, hunting, and self-feeding behaviours were ground-truthed using video footage of 2 captive barn owls equipped with the same data loggers. Further validations were undertaken for hunting behaviour (detailed below).</p>
<p>Behavioural classifications used the raw acceleration data, the vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) (a summary metric of body motion) and body pitch angle (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig.S3</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). VeDBA was derived by smoothing the raw acceleration data over 0.5 s (the period of two complete wingbeat cycles), to estimate the static/gravitational component, subtracting this from the raw acceleration in each of the three acceleration channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), and calculating the vectorial sum from the resulting “dynamic” components. Pitch angle was derived using the arcsine of the static acceleration in the heave axis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) and smoothed over 1 second.</p>
<p>Flights were identifiable from the acceleration data as periods of take-off, travelling and landing (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig.S3A</xref>). Take-offs were characterized by a switch from a standing to a horizontal posture (Δ pitch angle &gt; -10 °) and high-amplitude VeDBA (&gt; 1 g) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Travelling flight was associated with smoothed VeDBA values &gt; 0.1 g, and body pitch values &lt; 30 °. Finally, landings were identifiable as changes from low to high pitch angles (Δ pitch angle &gt; 10 °) and a typical final spike in all three acceleration axes (VeDBA &gt; 1 g). Periods that did not correspond to flight were categorized as stationary behaviour.</p>
<p>Landings were further classified as either perching event, where owls landed on a perch prior to a hunting attempt or hunting strikes/prey capture attempts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>). Landing types were categorized using the rate of change in pitch angle (strikes: Δ pitch angle &gt; 6 °) and the amplitude of the peak acceleration (strikes: Δ VeDBA &gt; 1.3 g) generated by the impact with the prey/ground, which were both much greater for hunting strikes than perching events (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig.S3B</xref>). Hunting strikes were classified using the Boolean-based classification algorithm (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>), whereas perching events were identified as the termination of flights that did not end with a hunting strike.</p>
<p>Owls hunt to provision themselves and their offspring. Self-feeding was evident from multiple and regular acceleration peaks in the surge and heave axes (resulting in peaks in VeDBA values &gt; 0.2 g and &lt; 0.9 g, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig.S3D</xref>), with each peak corresponding to the movement of the head as the prey was swallowed whole. Prey provisioning events were identified from variations in the sway, corresponding to the owl walking inside the nest box (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig.S3C</xref>). Both start and end phases of the nest box visits were characterized by a rapid change in the pitch angle (enter: Δ pitch angle &lt; -1.5 °; exit: &lt; 0.5 °) along with an increase in the heave and VeDBA values (enter: Δ VeDBA &gt; 0.5 g; exit: Δ VeDBA &lt; -0.9), as owls leapt in/out of the nest box. Successful provisioning hunts were further confirmed using nest box camera data when available and, in all cases, by manually checking that the GPS data matched the nest site to identify cases where the owls returned with a single prey for their offspring. Unsuccessful strikes were therefore inferred from identified hunting strikes that were not followed by a provisioning to the nest and/or self-feeding event (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Data processing</title>
<p>Data from the onboard accelerometers can be used to estimate landing force during perching and hunting strikes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>), as force is equal to the product of mass and acceleration. To estimate landing force, we extracted the peak vertical component of the ground reaction force in Newtons (N) for every landing event, taking the maximum value of the vectorial sum of the raw acceleration (in units of gravitational acceleration, <italic>g</italic>), multiplying this by the body mass of the bird (in kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>).</p>
<p>Hunting strikes were categorized according to whether owls hunted on the wing or from a perch to assess factors affecting the landing force of perching events involved in the sit-and-wait strategy. We therefore considered that owls were using the sit-and-wait strategy if they flew for a maximum of 1 second before the strike (corresponding to c.a. 6.5 m from the last perch). Hunting on the wing was defined as cases when birds flew for at least 5 seconds prior to the strike (c.a. 81.7 m from the last perch). Hunting strikes that did not fit into either category (8% of all hunting strikes) were excluded from the dataset. When barn owls were hunting on the wing, we also estimated foraging flight speed by extracting the median ground speed (in ms<sup>-1</sup>) over the last 20 seconds preceding each hunting strikes.</p>
<p>Finally, perch type was estimated by extracting the median location of each perching event. The habitat within 2 m was then classified according to the main perch type available: trees, roadsides, and pasture poles (hereafter referenced as “poles”), and buildings, and assigned as the perch type for each perching event. Habitat categories (roads, settlements, single trees, forest) were provided by the Swiss TLM3d catalogue (Swiss Topographic Landscape Model, resolution 1-3 m depending on the habitat feature) and habitat data were provided by the “Direction générale de l’agriculture, de la viticulture et des affaires vétérinaires (DGAV)” and the “Direction des institutions, de l’agriculture et des forêts (DIAF)”, for states of Vaud and Fribourg respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>We first assessed how landing force varied between hunting strikes and perching events, before evaluating the factors that explained variation within each category. This excluded perching events made when owls were loaded with prey, where the landing force will likely be influenced by the extra mass carried.</p>
<p>We fitted a linear mixed model (LMM) of the landing force (log-transformed) where fixed factors included the landing context (a two-level factor: hunting strike or perching event), the sex of the individual (a two-level factor: Female and Male) and their interaction. Sex was included in the model to control for sexual differences in foraging strategy as well as a sexual dimorphism in body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The model included bird ID as a random intercept to account for repeated measurements of the same individual over multiple nights, and night ID (nested in bird ID) to account for repeated measurement of the same individual within the same night. The same random effect structure was applied to all the following LMs and GLMs as they were fitted to dataset of similar grouping structure. We also fitted a LMM of the landing force during hunting strikes (log-transformed). Fixed factors in the model included hunting success (a two-level factor: successful and unsuccessful), the hunting strategy (a two-level factor: perching and flying) and their interaction. Sex was also included as a fixed factor.</p>
<p>We next fitted a generalized additive mixed-effects model (GAMM) to assess how the landing force (log-transformed) varied between perching events. Specifically, we examined whether this was affected by the physical environment (perch type, wind), or motivation (owls can perch for long periods between hunts, and the most pertinent currency determining landing force may therefore vary between periods of resting and active searching). Time until the next hunting strike was extracted for every perching event and included as a continuous fixed covariable in the model. An interaction between a smoothed function of the time until the next hunting strike and perch type was also included, using a thin plate regression spline and the “by” condition, with the number of bases per smooth term (k) set at a conservative value of 9. The sex of the individual, windspeed and perch type (a three-level factor: pole, tree, building) were included as linear predictors in the model. The model included the random intercept effect of bird ID (included with bs=”re” in a smooth function).</p>
<p>Our GAMM of landing force showed that owls perched more softly the closer they came to the next hunting strike. To identify periods when there was a significant change in landing force, we calculated the first derivative <italic>f′(x)</italic> of the estimated smoothed relationship between the time to the next strike and the peak landing force, according to each perch type, to highlight significant periods of positive or negative relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Periods of significant change were identified as those time points where the simultaneous confidence interval on the first derivative does not include zero.</p>
<p>Finally, we performed a set of analyses to investigate how hunting success varied with sex and hunting strategy, and most specifically whether success might be influenced by the landing force involved during perching events. To study how hunting success overall varied with sex and hunting strategy, we ran a first generalized linear mixed-effect model (GLMM) with hunting success as binary response variable (1 = successful, 0 = unsuccessful). In this first model, the sex of each individual, the hunting strategy and their interaction were included as fixed effects.</p>
<p>Then, we fitted a second GLMM with hunting success as a binary response variable to specifically investigate whether the landing force applied in the last perching events would influence the success of the following hunting attempts. Hypothesizing that landing force might affects barn owl detectability, we only selected hunting strikes that were immediately preceded by a perching event (hereafter pre-hunt perching). We also selected hunting strikes that occurred &lt; 90 seconds after the last perching event to maximize the probability of capturing a response to the pre-hunt perching force. The threshold of 90 seconds corresponded to the lower tercile of the distribution of time differences between perching and hunting strikes. The fixed effects included in this second model were pre-hunt perching force (i.e the force applied during perching events directly preceding each hunting attempt), hunting strategy and their interaction. The sex of the individual, windspeed and the interaction between sex and hunting strategy were also included as fixed effects in the model.</p>
<p>In birds, body mass usually influences flight speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the sexual dimorphism in body mass present in barn owls’ population might influence the speed at which males and females would fly when foraging on the wing. This could in turn impact on their ability to locate and target prey on the ground and therefore ultimately influence hunting success when hunting on the wing. To test this hypothesis, we fitted a second LMM with foraging flight speed as continuous response variable and the sex of each individual as fixed effect.</p>
<p>Finally, we fitted a LMM to assess how preferences of a given hunting strategy might affect barn owls foraging trip duration. The model included the foraging trip duration (min) as response variable. The model also included the frequency of use of the sit-and-wait strategy (number of hunting attempts in the sit-and-wait per trip divided by the total number of hunting attempts per trip), the total number of hunting attempts per trip, and the sex as predictors.</p>
<p>All statistical analyses were conducted with R 4.0.5 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria), with RStudio (RStudio Team, 2020) as graphic user interface. LMMs and GLMMs were fitted with the functions <italic>lmer</italic> and <italic>glmer</italic>, respectively, implemented in the package ‘lme4’ (R package v1.1-27.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>) and we used the package ‘lmerTest’ (R package v3.1-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) to estimate p-values. GAMM model was fit using the <italic>gam</italic> function from the package ‘mgvc’ (R package v1.8-34) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). For all models, linear predictors were centered and scaled to mean zero and units of standard deviation (i.e., z-scores) to ensure comparability among variables. We selected the optimal structure of the fixed component of each models using a multi-model selection framework ranking the selected models according to the Akaike information criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), using an automated stepwise model selection procedure in which models are fitted through repeated evaluation of modified calls extracted from the model containing all the meaningful variables, corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). The final models were chosen as the best models among the candidate models within ΔAICc &lt; 2, that was always relatively low (between 1 and 4) (see selection model tables that are reported in Supplementary Materials). Additionally, we performed pairwise comparisons using the <italic>emmeans</italic> function from the package ‘emmeans’ (R package v1.6.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>) to further assess differences between predictors level. Models were fitted, checked for collinearity between predictors and assumptions were verified by visually inspecting residual diagnostic plots. Descriptive statistics are reported as Mean ± SD, unless specified otherwise.</p>

<title>Ethical statements</title>
<p>This study meets the legal requirements of capturing, handling, and attaching Animal tracking devices to barn owls in Switzerland from the Department of the consumer and veterinary affairs (legal authorizations: VD, FR and BE 3213 and 3571; capture and ringing permissions from the Federal Office for the Environment). The 5% weight limit of the GPS-ACC loggers was considered acceptable because of the short period during which the tracking devices were deployed on birds. Tagged birds survived and reproduced with similar annual fitness output than non-tagged individuals.</p>

<p>In this paper, Schalcher et al. examined how barn owls' landing force affects their hunting success during two hunting strategies: strike hunting and sit-and-wait hunting. They tracked tens of barn owls that raised their nestlings in nest boxes and utilized high-resolution GPS and acceleration loggers to monitor their movement. In addition, camcorders were placed near their nest boxes and used to record the prey they brought to the nest, thus measuring their foraging success.</p>
<p>This study generated a unique dataset and provided new insights into the foraging behavior of barn owls. The researchers discovered that the landing force during hunting strikes was significantly higher compared to the sit-and-wait strategy. Additionally, they found a positive relationship between landing force and foraging success during hunting strikes, whereas, during the sit-and-wait strategy, there was a negative relationship between the two. This suggests that barn owls avoid detection by generating a lower landing force and producing less noise. Furthermore, the researchers observed that environmental characteristics affect barn owls' landing force during sit-and-wait hunting. They found a greater landing force when landing on buildings, a lower landing force when landing on trees, and the lowest landing force when landing on poles. The landing force also decreased as the time to the next hunting attempt decreased. These findings collectively suggest that barn owls reduce their landing force as an acoustic camouflage to avoid detection by their prey.</p>
<p>The main strength of this work is the researchers' comprehensive approach, examining different aspects of foraging behavior, including high-resolution movement, foraging success, and the influence of the environment on this behavior, supported by impressive data collection.</p>
<p>The results presented support the authors' conclusion that lower landing force during sit-and-wait hunting increases hunting success, likely due to a decreased probability of detection by their prey, resulting in acoustic camouflage. The authors also hypothesized that hunting success is crucial for survival, and thus, acoustic camouflage has a direct link to fitness. This paper provides an unprecedented dataset and the first measurement of landing force during hunting in the wild. It is likely to inspire many other researchers currently studying animal foraging behavior to explore how animals' movement affects foraging success.</p>

<p>In this paper, Schalcher et al. examined how barn owls' landing force affects their hunting success during two hunting strategies: strike hunting and sit-and-wait hunting.

<p>This study generated a unique dataset and provided new insights into the foraging behavior of barn owls. The researchers discovered that the landing force during hunting strikes was significantly higher compared to the sit-and-wait strategy. Additionally, they found a positive relationship between landing force and foraging success during hunting strikes, whereas, during the sit-and-wait strategy, there was a negative relationship between the two. This suggests that barn owls avoid detection by generating a lower landing force and producing less noise. Furthermore, the researchers observed that environmental characteristics affect barn owls' landing force during sit-and-wait hunting.

The landing force also decreased as the time to the next hunting attempt decreased. These findings collectively suggest that barn owls reduce their landing force as an acoustic camouflage to avoid detection by their prey.</p>
<p>The main strength of this work is the researchers' comprehensive approach, examining different aspects of foraging behavior, including high-resolution movement, foraging success, and the influence of the environment on this behavior, supported by impressive data collection. The weakness of this study is that the results only present a partial biological story contained within the data. The focus is on acoustic camouflage without addressing other aspects of barn owls' foraging strategy, leaving the reader with many unanswered questions. These include individual differences, direct measurements of owls' fitness, a detailed analysis of the foraging strategy of males and females, and the collective effort per nest box. However, it is possible that these data will be published in a separate paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate your recognition of the comprehensive approach and extensive data collection. Our primary objective was to study the role of acoustic camouflage. Nonetheless, the manuscript now includes a detailed analysis of the foraging strategy and hunting success of males and females (lines 164-225).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The results presented support the authors' conclusion that lower landing force during sit-andwait hunting increases hunting success, likely due to a decreased probability of detection by their prey, resulting in acoustic camouflage. The authors also argue that hunting success is crucial for survival, and thus, acoustic camouflage has a direct link to fitness. While this statement is reasonable, it should be presented as a hypothesis, as no direct evidence has been provided here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comment. We agree and thus have edited the language accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, since information about nestling survival is typically monitored when studying behavior during the breeding period, the authors' knowledge of the effect of acoustic camouflage on owls' fitness can probably be provided. Furthermore, it will be interesting to further examine the foraging strategies used by different individuals during foraging, the joint foraging success of both males and females within each nest box, and the link between landing force and foraging success if the data are available.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are currently writing a manuscript on these topics. We are aware that several scientific questions regarding the foraging ecology of the barn owl still need our attention. Regarding the link between landing force and foraging success, we believe that our revised manuscript addresses this specific topic, please see specific responses below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, even without this additional analysis on survival, this paper provides an unprecedented dataset and the first measurement of landing force during hunting in the wild. It is likely to inspire many other researchers currently studying animal foraging behavior to explore how animals' movements affect foraging success.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors provide new evidence for motion-induced sound camouflage and can link the hunting approach to hunting success (detailing the adaptation and inferring a fitness consequence).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Strong evidence by combining high-resolution accelerometer data with a ground-truthed data set on prey provisioning at nest boxes. A good set of co-variates to control for some of the noise in the data provides some additional insights into owl hunting attempts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is a disconnect between the hypotheses tested and the results presented, and insufficient detail is provided on the statistical approach. R2 values of the presented models are very small compared to the significance of the effect presented. Without more detail, it is impossible to assess the strength of the evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we changed the way results are presented and we improved the link between the hypotheses and the results. The R2 values are indeed small. It is however important to keep in mind that we are assessing the outcome of one specific behavior (i.e. landing force during sit-and-wait hunts) on hunting success in a wild environment, where many complex ecological interactions likely influence hunting success. Nonetheless, the coefficients (as reported in the results) show that for every 1 N increase in landing force, there is a 15% reduction in hunting success, which is substantial. In the discussion we also note that 50 Hz is a relatively low sampling frequency for estimating the peak ground reaction force. We have gone back over the presentation of our results and made our discussion more nuanced to acknowledge this aspect.</p>
<p>We have also added a detailed description about our model selection process in the methods section and provide a model selection table for each analysis in the supplementary materials.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors seem to overcome persisting challenges associated with the validation and calibration of accelerometer data by ground-truthing on-board measures with direct observations in captivity, but here the methods are not described any further and sample sizes (2 owls - how many different loggers were deployed?) might be too small to achieve robust behavioural classifications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comment. Details of our methods of behavioural identification are provided in lines 385 – 429. There are two reasons why our results should not be limited by the sample size. First, we used the temporal sequence of changes in acceleration, and rates of change in acceleration data, which make the methods robust to individual differences in acceleration values. Furthermore, our methods for behavioural identification were not based on machine learning. Instead, we use a Boolean based approach (as described in Wilson et al. 2018. MEE), which is more robust to small differences in absolute values that might occur e.g. in relation to slight changes in device position.</p>

<p>Comment 4. In addition, although I find your statement about the link between acoustic camouflage and fitness reasonable, it should be described as a hypothesis or examined if you want to keep the direct link statement.

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the relationship between hunting success and barn owl fitness is an important topic, but it necessitates a consideration of both hunting strategies, including hunting on the wing, which extends beyond the limits of our current study. Indeed, our primary objective was to conduct a detailed examination of the interplay between acoustic camouflage and the success of the sit-and-wait technique.</p>
<p>However, we have edited the manuscript to explicitly describe the link between acoustic camouflage and fitness as a hypothesis. We believe this adjustment provides a more accurate representation of our approach. We hope this clarifies the specific emphasis of our work and its contribution to the understanding of barn owl hunting behavior.</p>

<p>The revised manuscript now includes detailed information about the collected dataset (i.e. study area, reproductive state, etc…). “We used GPS loggers and accelerometers to record high resolution movement data during two consecutive breeding seasons (May to August in 2019 and 2020) from 163 wild barn owls (79 males and 84 females) breeding in nest boxes across a 1,000 km² intensive agricultural landscape in the western Swiss plateau.” Results section, lines 79 – 82</p>
<p>Details about the number of foraging trips per individuals and per night are now presented in the results: “Sexual dimorphism in body mass was marked among our sampled individuals. Males were lighter than females (84 females, average body mass: 322 ± 22.6 g; 79 males, average body mass 281 ± 16.5 g, Fig S6) and provided almost three times more prey per night than females (males: 8 ± 5 prey per night; females: 3 ± 3 prey per night; Fig.S7). Males also displayed higher nightly hunting effort than females (Males: 46 ± 16 hunting attempts per night, n= 79; Females: 25 ± 11 hunting attempts per nights, n=84; Fig. 3A, Fig S8). However, females were more likely to use a sit and wait strategy than males (females: 24% ± 15%, males: 13% ± 10%, Fig.S9). As a result, the number of perching events per night was similar between males and females (Females: 76 ± 23 perching events per nights; Males: 69 ± 20 perching events per night; Fig S8).” (lines 165 – 174)</p>

<p>Measurement of landing force: “Barn owls employing a sit-and-wait strategy land on multiple perches before initiating an attack, with successive landings reducing the distance to the target prey (Fig. 2C).</p>
<p>We used the acceleration data to identify 84,855 landings. These were further categorized into perching events (n = 56,874) and hunting strikes (n = 27,981), depending whether barn owls were landing on a perch or attempting to strike prey on the ground (Fig. 1A and B, see methods for specific details on behavioral classification).” (lines 88 – 95)</p>
<p>Pre-hunt perching force predicts hunting success: “Finally, we analyzed whether the landing force in the last perching event before each hunting attempt (i.e. pre-hunt perching force) predicted variation in hunting success” (lines 229 – 230)</p>

<p>Comment 11. Line 104: The results so far suggest that the difference in landing force between males and females is an outcome of their different body masses. However, it is not clear what is the reason for the difference in the number of hunting strike attempts between males and females (Lines 104-106). Can you compare the difference in landing force between males and females with similar body mass (females from the lower part of the distribution and males from the upper part)? Is there still a difference?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you, following your comment we made some new analyses that clarified the situation around landing force involved in perching and hunting strike events between sexes. But firstly, we wanted to clarify why there is a difference in number of hunting attempts between males and females. During the breeding season, females typically perform most of the incubation, brooding, and feeding of nestlings in the nest, while the male primarily hunts food for the female and chicks. The female supports the male providing food in a very irregular way, and this changes from pair to pair (paper in prep.). The differences in number of hunting attempts between males and females reflects this asymmetry in food provisioning between sexes during this specific period. We specified this in the revised version of the manuscript (lines 164 – 174).</p>
<p>We also provide a new analysis to investigate sex differences in mass-specific landing force (force/body mass). We found that males and females produce similar force per unit of body mass during perching events. This demonstrates that the overall higher perching force in females (see Fig. 4C in the manuscript) is therefore driven by their higher body mass. (lines 194 – 199)</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, this is indeed the most likely explanation for the fact that owls land more on buildings and trees than on poles until the last period (about 6 minutes) before hunting. In these last minutes, barn owls preferentially use poles, as we showed in figure 2B. The revised manuscript now includes this explanation in the discussion (lines 269 – 284).</p>

<p>Comment 6. At this stage, the reader does not even know yet that we are presented with a size-dimorphic species that also has very different parental roles during the breeding season.

<p>We edited the way the objectives are outlined in the introduction to cover the size dimorphism (lines 70 – 76). We also completely changed the way the sex differences are presented in the results, including a new analysis that we believe provides a better comprehensive understanding of barn owl foraging behavior (lines 164 – 206).

<p>Comment 11. Methods</p>
<p>Please provide a justification for the very high weight limit (5%; line 256). This limit is outdated and does not fulfill the international standard of 3% body weight. I assume the ethics clearance went through because of the short nature of the study (i.e., the birds were not burdened for life with the excess weight? But a line is needed here or under the ethics considerations to clarify this).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The 5% weight limit was considered acceptable due to the short deployment period, and we now edited the ethics statement to emphasize this point. However, it is important to note that there is no real international standard, with both 3% and 5% weight limits being commonly used. Both limits are arbitrary and the impact of a fixed mass on a bird varies with species and flight style. All owls survived and bred similarly to the non-tagged individuals in the population (lines 373 – 376 &amp; lines 558 – 561)</p>
<p>EDITORIAL COMMENT: We strongly encourage you to provide further context and clarification on this issue, as suggested by the Reviewer. On a related point, the ethics statement refers to GPS loggers, rather than GPS and ACC devices; we encourage you to clarify wording here.</p>
<p>Thank you for highlighting this point that indeed needed some clarifications.</p>
<p>Although we have used the terminology &quot;GPS recorders&quot;, the authorization granted by the Swiss authorities for this study effectively covers the entire tracking system, which combines both GPS and ACC recorders in the same device. We have therefore changed the wording used in the ethics statement to avoid any misunderstanding (lines 373 – 376 &amp; lines 558 – 561)</p>

<p>Comment 12. Please provide more information on the model selection approach, what does &quot;Non-significant terms were dropped via model simplification by comparing model AIC with and without terms.&quot; mean? Did the authors use a stepwise backward elimination procedure (drop1 function)? Or did they apply a complete comparison of several candidate models? I think a model comparison approach rather than stepwise selection would be more informative, as several rather than only one model could be equally probable. This might also improve model weights or might require a model averaging procedure - current reported R2values are very small and do not seem to support the results well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the lack of details about this important aspect of the statistical analysis. We applied an automated stepwise selection using the <italic>dredge</italic> function from the R package “MuMin”, therefore applying a complete comparison of several candidate models. The final models were chosen as the best models since the number of candidate models within ∆AIC&lt;2 was relatively low in each analysis and thus a model averaging was not appropriate here. We edited the methods section to ensure clarity, and added model selection tables for each analysis, ranked according to AICc scores, in the supplementary materials (lines 532 – 552)</p>
<p>In addition, we agree that the reported R-squared values in our analyses are quite low, specifically regarding the influence of pre-hunt perching force on hunting success (cond R2 = 0.04). Nonetheless, landing impact still has a notable effect size (an increase of 1N reduces hunting success by 15%). The reported values are indicative of the inherent complexity in studying hunting behavior in a wild setting where numerous variables come into play. We specifically investigated the hypothesis that the force involved during pre-hunt landings, and consequently the emitted noise, influences the success of the next hunting attempt in wild barn owls. Factors such as prey behavior and micro-habitat characteristics surrounding prey (such as substrate type and vegetation height) are most likely to be influential but hard, or nearly impossible, to model. We now cover this in a more nuanced way in the discussion (lines 266 – 268)</p>
