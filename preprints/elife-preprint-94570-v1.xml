<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The specific role that prolactin plays in lactational infertility, as distinct from other suckling or metabolic cues, remains unresolved. Here, deletion of the prolactin receptor (Prlr) from forebrain neurons or arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in failure to maintain normal lactation-induced suppression of estrous cycles. Kisspeptin immunoreactivity and pulsatile LH secretion were increased in these mice, even in the presence of ongoing suckling stimulation and lactation. GCaMP6 fibre photometry of arcuate kisspeptin neurons revealed that the normal episodic activity of these neurons is rapidly suppressed in pregnancy and this was maintained throughout early lactation. Deletion of Prlr from arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in early reactivation of episodic activity of kisspeptin neurons prior to a premature return of reproductive cycles in early lactation. These observations show dynamic variation in arcuate kisspeptin neuronal activity associated with the hormonal changes of pregnancy and lactation, and provide direct evidence that prolactin action on arcuate kisspeptin neurons is necessary for suppressing fertility during lactation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In mammals, lactation is accompanied by a period of infertility. This adaptive change establishes appropriate birth spacing to enable maternal metabolic resources to be directed towards caring for the new-born offspring, rather than supporting another pregnancy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Lactational infertility is characterized by a lactation-induced suppression of pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, and the temporary loss of the reproductive cycle (in rodents this is exhibited as an extended period of diestrus or anestrus) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Lactation is also characterised by chronically elevated levels of the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin, which is essential for milk production and promotes adaptive changes in maternal physiology and behaviour <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Despite hyperprolactinaemia being a well-recognized cause of infertility, the specific role that prolactin plays in lactational infertility, as distinct from other suckling- or metabolic-related cues, is currently unclear <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have confirmed that kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are responsible for the periodic release of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and subsequent pulsatile luteinising hormone (LH) secretion that drives reproductive function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Studies using GCaMP6 fibre photometry in conscious mice have demonstrated that the arcuate kisspeptin neuronal population exhibits episodes of increased intracellular calcium levels coincident with, and immediately preceding, each pulse of LH secretion in intact and gonadectomised male and female mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Miniscope investigation showed that individual kisspeptin neurons within the arcuate population act in a coordinated, synchronised, and episodic manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Loss of pulsatile LH secretion during lactation and consequent lactational infertility may be caused by the loss of kisspeptin-mediated stimulation of GnRH secretion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Kisspeptin expression is markedly suppressed in lactation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and when exogenously stimulated, kisspeptin neurons are unable to activate GnRH neurons during lactation, likely due to a lack of kisspeptin synthesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>It is well established that hyperprolactinemia causes infertility, and thus, the elevated prolactin present in lactation seems a likely candidate to be involved in suppressing fertility during lactation. Prolactin administration acutely suppresses LH secretion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and chronic exposure to elevated prolactin reduces <italic>Kiss1</italic> mRNA expression in the arcuate nucleus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In lactating mice, suppressing endogenous prolactin secretion shortens the period of infertility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, suggesting that prolactin is important for maintaining the suppression of pulsatile LH secretion during lactation. Such a role for prolactin is controversial <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, however, with studies in a number of species suggesting that the neural stimulation of suckling may be more important in maintaining lactational infertility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. However, it has previously been difficult to disentangle the specific role of prolactin, as suckling, prolactin, and milk production are so tightly linked that manipulating one ultimately impacts the others, making it difficult to determine the contribution of any one element. Here, using a conditional deletion strategy, we have blocked prolactin action in the brain leaving suckling, lactation, and maternal behaviour intact. Using GCaMP fibre photometry techniques, we have also documented arcuate kisspeptin neuron activity across pregnancy and lactation transitions in the same mice and established that prolactin directly acts on these neurons to suppress fertility in lactation.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>All experiments were performed using adult female mice on a C57BL/6J background (8-20 weeks of age). Mice were housed under controlled temperature (22 °C ± 2°C) and lighting (12-hour light/12-hour dark schedule, with lights on at 0600 hours) with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water (Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet 2918; Envigo, Huntingdon, United Kingdom). Daily body weight was recorded and vaginal cytology was used to monitor the estrous cycle stage. All experiments were carried out with approval from the University of Otago Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>Mice were mated with male wild-type C57BL/6J mice (presence of sperm plug = day 1 pregnancy). The first day a litter was seen was counted as day 1 of lactation and maternal mice were left undisturbed till day 3 of lactation, when vaginal monitoring would resume and litter size was normalised to 6 pups per animal, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>To monitor pulsatile secretion of LH, serial tail tip blood sampling and measurement of LH by ELISA was undertaken as reported previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. As novel exposure and restraint stress has been shown to suppress pulsatile LH secretion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, all mice were habituated to the tail tip blood sampling procedure in a gentle restraint device (soft cardboard tube) or hand, for at least 3 weeks prior to experimentation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Sequential whole blood samples (4μl) were collected in 6 minute intervals for 3 hours between 0900 and 1200 hours unless otherwise stated. Samples were immediately diluted in 48ul 0.01M PBS/0.05% Tween 20, and frozen on dry ice before being stored at −20°C for subsequent LH measurement.</p>

<title>Effect of neuron-specific deletion of the prolactin receptor gene on the maintenance of lactational infertility</title>
<p>To investigate whether prolactin action in the brain is required for lactational infertility, neuron-specific <italic>Prlr</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup>) and their respective Cre-negative controls (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>) were generated, as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. We have previously shown that while <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice do not have a complete Prlr deletion in the forebrain, there are areas of extensive deletion (as measured by reduced prolactin-induced pSTAT5), such as the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and areas where Prlr is reduced by about 50% such as the medial pre-optic area <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. RNAscope in-situ hybridization was done to confirm knockdown. Briefly, intact diestrous mice and 14 day OVX mice (all aged 8-16 weeks) were perfused with 2% PFA to enable visualisation of kisspeptin cell bodies in both the RP3V and ARC regions (as kisspeptin cell bodies are only visible in the RP3V of intact mice and in the ARC of OVX mice, due to estradiol regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>). Brain sections (14μm-thick) were prepared, thaw mounted onto superfrost-plus microscope slides and then stored at −80°C. RNAscope in-situ hybridization was performed using the RNAscope 2.5 High definition Duplex Detection kit – chromogenic (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA) largely in accordance with manufacturer’s instruction. The channel 1 Prlr probe was custom designed to pick up only the long form of the prolactin receptor. It was designed to transcript NM_011169.5 with a target sequence spanning nucleotides 1107-2147 (Ref: 588621; Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA). The channel 2 Kiss1 probe was custom designed to transcript NM_178260.3 with a target sequence spanning nucleotides 5 to 485 (Ref: 500141-C2; Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA). Sections were thawed at 55°C, postfixed for 3 minutes in 2% PFA, washed in 0.01M PBS for 5 minutes, and endogenous peroxidases were blocked with a hydrogen peroxidase solution for 10 minutes. Tissue was washed in distilled water (dH2O) (3x 2 minutes), then immersed in 100% ethanol briefly, air dried for 5 minutes, and a hydrophobic barrier was applied. Tissue was permeabilized with RNAscope protease plus for 30 minutes at 40°C. Sections were washed (2x 2 minutes) and were hybridized with the Prlr and Kiss1 probes (1:300 dilution, Prlr:Kiss1) or negative control probe (Cat#320751; Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA) at 40°C for 2 hours. Amplification (Amp 1-6) was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were then hybridized with a Fast-RED (1:60, Fast-RED B:Fast-RED A) for 10 minutes at room temperature, before undergoing further amplification steps (Amp 7-10) in accordance to manufacturer’s instructions. The final positive hybridization was detected by incubation with the secondary detection reagents (1:50, Fast-GREEN B:Fast-GREEN) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Sections were washed, counterstained with haematoxylin (25% Gills), dried at 60°C for 20 minutes, and cover-slipped with VectaMount (Vector laboratories, H-5000) before imaging as previously described. Quantification of the proportion of kisspeptin neurons co-expressing <italic>Prlr</italic> mRNA was undertaken in FIJI software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) following image acquisition. The total number of <italic>Kiss1</italic>-expressing cells and the total number of these that showed <italic>Prlr</italic> mRNA expression were counted. <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice showed a significant decrease in the percentage of <italic>Kiss1</italic>- expressing cells co-expressing <italic>Prlr</italic> compared to controls in both the RP3V (p = &lt;0.0001) and arcuate nucleus (p = 0.0009) (unpaired two-tailed t tests, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A-D</xref>). The <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice are hyperprolactinaemic due to impaired negative feedback of prolactin on hypothalamic dopamine neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and therefore show disrupted estrous cycles (showing recurrent pseudopregnancy-like cycles with long periods of diestrus of approximately 14 days between estrus stages). However, these mice are able to become pregnant and have normal pregnancies. All mice were given a 250μl subcutaneous injection of bromocriptine (5mg/kg, 5% ethanol/saline; Tocris Bioscience Cat#0427) prior to being mated. This treatment was designed to reinstate an estrous cycle in <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice. Bromocriptine is an agonist for the type 2 dopamine receptor and inhibits prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, thereby terminating the pseudopregnancy-like state and bringing the mice into proestrus the following day. Following treatment, all mice were then housed with a stud male.</p>
<p>For <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice, estrous cycles were monitored from day 3 of lactation until the first day of diestrus following a day of estrus (proestrus and estrus had to be observed prior to transcardial perfusion on the first day of diestrus). Brains were collected following transcardial perfusion for assessment of kisspeptin immunoreactivity. For every lactating <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mouse (n = 8), the brain of a <italic>Prlr<sup>l</sup></italic><sup>ox/lox</sup> control mouse (n = 8) of the equivalent day (±1) of lactation was also collected. A group of non-lactating (NL) mice of both genotypes (n = 5-6) was also perfused for immunohistochemistry on diestrus.</p>
<p>To evaluate pulsatile LH secretion in early lactation (prior to the return of estrous cycles) and to determine whether progesterone played any role in regulating pulsatile LH secretion in lactation, additional groups of lactating <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> and <italic>Prlr<sup>l</sup></italic><sup>ox/lox</sup> control mice were generated and treated with either the progesterone receptor antagonist, mifepristone (4mg/kg in sesame oil, s.c.; AK Scientific Inc Cat#J10622), or vehicle (n = 7-8 per group) on the morning of day 4 of lactation and on day 5 of lactation, 30 minutes prior to blood sampling that day. This dose was selected as it was found to be sufficient to cause termination of pregnancy in wild-type C57BL/6J mice (p = 0.0072, Chi-squared test, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>; pilot study) and neither vehicle nor mifepristone treatment had an effect on litter weight gain (interaction of time x genotype &amp; treatment p = 0.5322, two-way repeated measures ANOVA, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Measurement of LH concentrations</title>
<p>An established sandwich ELISA method was used to determine LH concentration in diluted whole blood samples collected from mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Briefly, a 96-well high plate was incubated with bovine monoclonal antibody (LHβ518b7, 1:1000 in 1xPBS; Dr. L. Sibley, UC Davis, CA, USA) for 16 h at 4°C. Following incubation of standards, controls and experimental samples for 2 hours, plates were incubated in rabbit polyclonal LH antibody (AFP240580Rb; 1:10,000; National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIH) for 90 minutes, followed by incubation with polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG/HRP antibody (1:1000; DAKO Cytomation) for 90 minutes. Finally, plates were incubated in OPD (o-phenylenediamine capsules; Sigma-Aldrich Cat#P7288) for 30 minutes. A standard curve for the detection of LH concentration was generated using serial dilutions of mouse LH-reference preparation peptide (National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIH). Luteinizing hormone levels were read using a standard absorbance plate reader (SpectraMax ABS Plus; Molecular Devices) at 490nm and 630nm wavelengths.</p>
<p>PULSAR Otago was used to define LH pulses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Parameters used; Smoothing 0.7, Peak split 2.5, Level of detection 0.04, Amplitude distance 3, Assay variability 0, 2.5, 3.3, G(1)=3.5, G(2)=2.6, G(3)=1.9, G(4)=1.5, G(6)=1.2. Mean LH levels were calculated by averaging all LH levels collected during the experiment. The assay had a sensitivity of 0.04ng/ml to 4ng/ml, with an intra-assay coefficient of variation of 4.40% and an inter-assay coefficient of variation of 8.29%. See supplementary information, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>, for all individual LH profiles.</p>

Brains were removed, postfixed in the same solution, and cryoprotected overnight in 30% sucrose before being frozen at −80°C. Two sets of 30μm thick coronal brain sections were cut using a sliding microtome, from Bregma 1.10mm to −2.80mm.

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Immunohistochemistry for kisspeptin in the RP3V and arcuate nucleus was performed as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Briefly, sections were incubated in polyclonal rabbit anti-kisspeptin primary antibody (AC 566, 1:10,000; gift from A. Caraty, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Paris, France) for 48 hours at 4°C. Sections were then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Vector biolabs, Peterborough, GK) for 90 min at room temperature, followed by incubation in an avidin-biotin complex (Elite vectastain ABC kit, Vector laboratories). The bound antibody-peroxidase complex was visualised using a nickel-enhanced diaminobenzidine (DAB) reaction, to form a black cytoplasmic precipitate.</p>
<p>Brain sections were imaged using an Olympus BX51 light microscope and Olympus UPlanSApo 10/20x lenses. Quantification of kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V, was undertaken by manually counting all labelled neurons present in all three subdivisions, the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), rostral preoptic periventricular nucleus (rPVpo), and caudal preoptic periventricular nucleus (cPVpo, bregma 0.02) (2 sections per brain region per mouse) and then averaging this for each animal. As kisspeptin cell bodies in the arcuate nucleus were not easily observed, as previously reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, kisspeptin fibre immunoreactivity was imaged using a Gryphax NAOS colour camera (Jenoptik) and evaluated using FIJI software and the voxel counter function (National Institutes of Health). Kisspeptin fibre density was measured in the arcuate nucleus across the three subdivisions; rostral arcuate (rARC), middle arcuate (mARC), and caudal arcuate (cARC) with two sections of each area per animal counted, and then averaged across each animal to get total number and reported as total amount of voxels per ROI (voxel fraction).</p>

<p>Adult <italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> or <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice (2-3 months old) were anaesthetised with 2% Isoflurane, given local Lidocaine (4mg/kg, s.c.) and Carprofen (5mg/kg, s.c.) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A custom-made unilateral Hamilton syringe apparatus holding one Hamilton syringe was used to perform unilateral injections into the arcuate nucleus. The needles were lowered into place (−0.14mm A/P, +0.04mm M/L, −0.56mm DV) over 2 minutes and left in situ for 3 minutes before injection was made. 1μl AAV9-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6s-WPRE-SV40 (1.3×10<sup>-13</sup> GC/ml, University of Pennsylvania Vector Core, Philadelphia, PA, USA) was injected into the arcuate nucleus at a rate of ∼100nl/min with the needles left in situ for 3 minutes prior to being withdrawn over a period of 6 minutes.

<title>GCaMP6 fibre photometry</title>
<p>Photometry was performed as reported previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Fluorescence signals were acquired using a custom-built fibre photometry system made primarily from Doric components. Violet (405nm) and blue (490nm) fibre-coupled LEDs were sinusoidally modulated at 531 and 211 Hz, respectively, and focused into a 400μm, 0.48 numerical aperture fibre optic patch cord connected to the mouse. Emitted fluorescence was collected by the same fibre and focused onto a femtowatt photoreceiver (2151, Newport). The two GCaMP6s emission signals were collected at 10 Hz in a scheduled 5s on/15s off mode by demodulating the 405nm (non-calcium dependent) and 490nm (calcium dependent) signals. The power output at the tip of the fibre was set at 50μW. Fluorescent signals were acquired using a custom software acquisition system (Tussock Innovation, Dunedin, New Zealand) and analysed using custom templates created by Dr Joon Kim (University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand) based on mathematics and calculations similar to those previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Briefly, the fluorescent signal obtained after stimulation with 405nm light was used to correct for movement artefacts as follows: first, the 405nm signal was filtered using a savitzky-golay filter and fitted to the 490nm signal using least linear square regression. The fitted 405nm signal was then subtracted and divided from the 490nm signal to obtain the movement and bleaching corrected signal. The output of these templates is 490-adjusted405/adjusted405, which was multiplied to get the final ΔF/F as a percentage increase (all photometry data reported as ΔF/F(%)).</p>
<p>All recordings were obtained from freely behaving mice for up to 24 hours and occurred between the hours of 0800 hours and 1200 hours (apart from 24 hours post weaning recording (0900 hours to 1700 hours), and day 18/19 pregnancy recording (1800 hours to 0800 hours the following day). Synchronized events (SE) were defined as when ΔF/F exceeds 3 standard deviations (SD) above the trace mean. Manual event shape analysis was performed in addition to standard deviation method for certain datasets where necessary. Events were counted manually to determine frequency of events per 60 minutes. The between animal variability in total signal means that changes in SE amplitude can only be reported as relative changes within an animal. Relative SE amplitude was calculated by using normalised ΔF/F data and then subtracting the peak of an SE from the nearest nadir to the rise of the SE and averaging that for the number of SEs in a recording. To obtain normalised ΔF/F, three pre-pregnancy datasets from each mouse were used to find the average maximum ΔF/F for that mouse. All datasets were then divided by that normalisation value to get normalised ΔF/F for each trace for each individual mouse.</p>

Monitoring of vaginal cytology and weights was continuous from 1 week pre-surgery till day 19 of pregnancy and resumed on day 3 of lactation (with all handling stopped on day 19 to avoid potential compromise of parturition and onset of maternal behaviour).

In addition, blood sample collection for paired LH measurement was done in virgin (diestrus) state, on day 14 of pregnancy (in 4 mice, maximum of 6 samples were collected around small “peaks” in baseline), day 7 of lactation, and day 14 of lactation. Blood sampling was not carried out at additional time points as blood sampling was undertaken at least a week apart, and stress from repeated sampling was attempted to be kept at a minimum e.g., not blood sampling around the time of birth. Fibre photometry recordings were usually between 2-4 hours in length. The only longer recordings were undertaken on day 18/19 of pregnancy (14 hours) and 24 hours after weaning (8 hours). These particular recording sessions were extended to determine whether there were any longer-term changes occurring in the activity of the arcuate kisspeptin population in the lead up to parturition or following weaning of pups (states closely followed by postpartum estrus and resumption of normal estrous cycles, respectively).</p>

<title>Prolactin action on forebrain neurons is necessary to maintain lactational infertility</title>
<p>Lactation has previously been associated with a marked decrease in <italic>Kiss1</italic> mRNA levels in both rostral periventricular region of the third ventricle (RP3V) and arcuate nucleus populations during lactation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.

<p>Estrous cycles during lactation were significantly altered by deletion of Prlr in the forebrain, with all <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice showing a return to estrus between day 6 and day 10 of lactation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), while, as normal, estrus did not occur until day 20 in control <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice (p = &lt;0.0001, log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). No differences in litter weight gain from day 3 to day 8 of lactation were observed in either group (p = 0.3282, mixed analysis test, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), indicating that the suckling stimulus that mice received was maintained in the absence of <italic>Prlr</italic> expression in <italic>Camk2a</italic> expressing neurons.

<p>In a separate cohort of mice, pulsatile LH secretion in <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice was monitored in early lactation, prior to the return of estrous cycles.

Vehicle-treated <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> control mice showed the expected near complete absence of pulsatile LH secretion during lactation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). In contrast, nearly all <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice showed a lack of the normal lactation-induced suppression of pulsatile LH secretion demonstrated by a significant increase in frequency of LH pulses compared to controls (effect of genotype p = 0.0024, two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). There was no effect of mifepristone on this pattern of LH secretion, suggesting that progesterone action is not required for the suppression of LH secretion (LH pulse frequency (interaction genotype x treatment p = 0.2807; treatment p = 0.8588; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), mean LH levels (interaction genotype x treatment p = 0.8697; treatment p = 0.8586; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test).

<p>The activity of the arcuate kisspeptin population in <italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice dynamically changed depending on the reproductive state of the mouse (p = 0.0012, mixed-effect analysis, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). On day 4 of pregnancy, SE frequency had markedly decreased (0.297±0.136/hr; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), indicating an early reduction in activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons during pregnancy. By day 14 of pregnancy, no SEs were seen (0±0/hr; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>) and this was confirmed by a lack of pulsatile LH secretion (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).

This unusual pattern of activity is illustrated in more detail in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> where alongside the resurgence of low amplitude SEs, there was a marked increase in baseline activity observed, relative to other stages. This activity was reminiscent of the miniature SEs observed to be caused by activation of subgroups of cells in a brain slice technique <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, but we are unable to resolve such events using the present methods. Since our aim was to continue longitudinal assessment of the arcuate kisspeptin population into lactation and weaning, mice were not disrupted by blood sampling immediately prior to parturition as we were concerned that this additional stressor might interfere with establishment of maternal behaviour.

<p>To determine whether the prolactin-induced suppression of estrous cycles and LH pulsatile secretion was specifically mediated by kisspeptin neurons, mice were generated with an arcuate-specific deletion of the Prlr from kisspeptin neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Similar to the data from forebrain neuron-specific deletion of Prlr, there was early resumption of estrous cycles in <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice during lactation (63% showing estrus by day 10 of lactation and 83% by day 19 lactation) compared to <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> controls (4% by day 19 lactation) (p = &lt;0.0001, log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). No difference in litter weight gain during lactation (day 3-20 of lactation weight gain) was observed in either group (p = 0.6404, two-way ANOVA, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1H</xref>) indicating that suckling and/or lactation itself was not impaired. <italic>In vivo</italic> GCaMP6 fibre photometry in <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice showed early reactivation of the arcuate kisspeptin population between day 3 and 5 of lactation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). This was accompanied by a clear return to estrous within this early lactation window in 4/5 mice. These data demonstrate that prolactin action specifically on arcuate kisspeptin neurons is responsible for maintaining suppression of those neurons, and thereby fertility, during lactation in mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We demonstrate here that prolactin action in arcuate kisspeptin neurons is necessary for the maintained suppression of fertility during lactation in mice. Neuron-specific Prlr deletion (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup>) resulted in premature return to estrus in early lactation, even in the presence of ongoing suckling stimulus and the full metabolic consequences of milk production. Accompanying the resumption of estrus was an absence of the normal lactation-induced reduction in kisspeptin immunoreactivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and pulsatile LH secretion was also observed on day 5 of lactation prior to the premature estrus when it would normally have been completely absent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. To evaluate the specific role of kisspeptin neurons in mediating the prolactin-induced suppression of fertility, we have comprehensively mapped the activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons throughout a full reproductive cycle: pregnancy, lactation, and after weaning in individual animals. The data show an immediate suppression of activity of arcuate kisspeptin neuronal activity during pregnancy, and this is maintained throughout most of lactation, apart from a brief window of reactivation immediately prior to parturition. Deleting Prlr specifically from arcuate kisspeptin neurons prevented the suppression of activity in early lactation, resulting in premature induction of episodic activation of kisspeptin neurons, and early onset of estrus. Combined, these data provide direct evidence that prolactin action on kisspeptin neurons is necessary for lactation-induced infertility in mice.</p>
<p>It is now well established that the arcuate kisspeptin neurons form the GnRH “pulse generator”, and hence drive pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus and consequent pulses of LH form the pituitary that is required for fertility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. This is the first study to monitor activity of the GnRH “pulse generator” across different reproductive states in the same animal, and the data largely match previously described patterns of LH secretion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. The frequency and dynamics of the synchronised events changed dramatically, initially due to the pregnancy-induced changes in ovarian hormones. The abrupt decrease in “pulse generator” activity in early gestation is likely caused by rising levels of progesterone, known to profoundly suppress activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons and LH secretion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Progesterone is elevated throughout pregnancy, gradually increasing until luteolysis and progesterone withdrawal occurs in the lead up to parturition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we observed a transient reactivation of the arcuate kisspeptin neurons in the night between days 18 and 19 of pregnancy. This was characterised by frequent, low amplitude episodes of activity, and increased baseline activity that may represent the intermittent synchronized activity of small subsets of arcuate kisspeptin neurons that have not yet transitioned to full synchronization of the whole population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. It seems likely that this pattern of activity is associated with progesterone withdrawal in late pregnancy and may be important in stimulating follicular growth leading up to a postpartum ovulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In early lactation, episodic activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons was absent, with sporadic low-amplitude activity returning around day 14 of lactation. There was another period of increased baseline activity in late lactation, similar to that seen in late pregnancy, potentially representing a signature of reactivation of synchronized activity of the arcuate kisspeptin neurons. Overall patterns of activity rapidly returned to normal diestrous levels soon after weaning. This increase in “pulse generator” activity during late lactation mirrors the increase in LH levels that has been reported as lactation progresses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. In the absence of Prlr in arcuate kisspeptin neurons, however, synchronized episodic activity re-appeared as early as 3 days after birth, even in the presence of ongoing suckling. These data clearly show that prolactin action in the arcuate kisspeptin neurons is necessary to sustain lactational infertility in mice. The observed disruption of lactational infertility in <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice is particularly remarkable given that Prlr deletion is restricted to arcuate kisspeptin neurons in this model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and prolactin action on RP3V kisspeptin neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> and on gonadotrophs in the pituitary gland <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> are unaffected.</p>
<p>The indispensable role for prolactin in mediating lactation-induced infertility in the mouse is surprising, given the consensus of much work in other species concluding that other factors may be more important (see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>). This may reflect a level of redundancy amongst contributing factors across all species, including ovarian hormones, metabolic cues and neural inputs of suckling. Notably, the conditional deletion approach described here distinguishes prolactin action from the neurogenic effects of suckling without altering the process of lactation itself. Moreover, this approach avoids the potential confounding effects of using dopamine agonists to suppress prolactin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, given that dopamine can directly inhibit GnRH neuronal activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While the effects of widespread neuronal deletion (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup>) on fertility were largely recapitulated by the arcuate kisspeptin-specific model, it was apparent that the global deletion was more effective at inducing the return to estrus during lactation (in 100% of animals by day 10), compared to the arcuate kisspeptin-specific model (63% by day 10, and 83% by day 19). This may be due to the absence of lactation-induced suppression of <italic>Kiss1</italic> expression in RP3V kisspeptin neurons of <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice. Similarly, we cannot rule out the possibility that other populations of prolactin-sensitive neurons, such as GABA or dopamine neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, may contribute to suppressing estrous cycles during lactation. Nevertheless, our data collectively provide strong evidence that prolactin action on arcuate kisspeptin neurons is the primary factor mediating lactation-induced infertility in mice. Given that hyperprolactinemia induces infertility in humans and many other species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>, it is likely that a conserved mechanism will be contributing to lactational infertility in all mammalian species.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Hackwell and colleagues performed technically impressive, long-term, GCaMP fiber photometry recordings from Kiss1 neurons in the arcuate nucleus of mice during multiple reproductive states. The data show an immediate suppression of activity of arc Kiss1 neuronal activity during pregnancy that is maintained during lactation. In the absence of any apparent change in suckling stimulus or milk production, mice lacking prolactin receptors in arcuate Kiss1 neurons regained Kiss1 episodic activity and estrous cyclicity faster than control mice, demonstrating that direct prolactin action on Kiss1 neurons is at least partially responsible for suppressing fertility in this species. The effect of loss of prolactin receptors from CamK2a expressing neurons was even greater, indicating either that prolactin sensitivity in Kiss1 neurons of the RP3V contributes to lactational infertility or that other prolactin-sensitive neurons are involved. These data demonstrate the important role of prolactin in suppressing Kiss1 neuron activity and thereby fertility during the lactational period in the mouse.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is the first study to monitor the activity of the GnRH pulse-generating system across different reproductive states in the same animal. Another strength in the study design is that it isolated the effects of prolactin by maintaining normal lactation and suckling (assessed indirectly using pup growth curves). The study also offers insight into the phenomenon of postpartum ovulation in mice. The results showed a brief reactivation of arcuate Kiss1 activity immediately prior to parturition, attributed to falling progesterone levels at the end of pregnancy. This hypothesis will be of interest to the field and is likely to inspire testing in future studies. With the exceptions mentioned below, the conclusions of the paper are well supported by the data, and the aims of the study were achieved. This paper is likely to raise the standard for technical expectations in the field and spark new interest in the direct impact of prolactin on Kiss1 neurons during lactation in other species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness in the approach is the use of genetic models that do not offer complete deletion of the prolactin receptor from targeted neuronal populations. A substantial proportion of Kiss1 neurons in both models retain the receptor. As a result, it is not clear whether the partial maintenance of cyclicity during lactation in the genetic models is due to incomplete deletion or to the involvement of other factors. This weakness should be more fully discussed in the text. In addition, results showing no impact of progesterone on LH secretion during lactation are surprising, given the effectiveness of progesterone-containing birth control in lactating women. The progesterone-related experiments were not well justified or discussed in the text. While the authors assert their findings may reflect an important role for prolactin in lactational infertility in other mammalian species, that remains to be seen. Hyperprolactinemia is known to suppress GnRH release, but its importance in the suppression of cyclicity during lactation is controversial. Indeed, in several species, the stimulus of suckling is considered to be the main driver of lactational fertility suppression. Data from rats shows that exogenous prolactin was unable to suppress LH release in dams deprived of their pups shortly after birth; both suckling and prolactin were necessary to suppress a post ovariectomy rise in LH levels. The duration of amenorrhea does not correlate with average prolactin levels in humans, and suckling but not prolactin was required to suppress the postpartum rise in LH in the rhesus monkey. The authors should discuss more thoroughly whether the protocol of this or other studies might result in discordant results and whether mice are likely to be an outlier in their mechanism of cycle suppression.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The overall goal of Eleni et al. is to determine if the suppression of LH pulses during lactation is mediated by prolactin signaling at kisspeptin neurons. To address this, the authors used GCaMP fiber photometry and serial blood sampling to reveal that in vivo episodic arcuate kisspeptin neuron activity and LH pulses are suppressed throughout pregnancy and lactation. The authors further utilized knockout models to demonstrate that the loss of prolactin receptor signaling at kisspeptin cells prevents the suppression of kisspeptin function and results in early reestablishment of fertility during lactation. The work demonstrates exemplary design and technique, and the outcomes of these experiments are sophistically discussed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript demonstrates exemplary skill with powerful techniques and reveals a key role for arcuate kisspeptin neurons in maintaining lactation-induced infertility in mice. In a difficult feat, the authors used fiber photometry to map the activity of arcuate kisspeptin cells into lactation and weaning without disrupting parturition, lactation, or maternal behavior. The authors used a knockout approach to identify if prolactin inhibition of fertility is mediated by direct signaling at arcuate kisspeptin cells. Although the model does not perfectly eliminate prolactin receptor expression in all kisspeptin neurons, results from the achieved knockdown support the conclusion that prolactin signaling at kisspeptin neurons is required to maintain lactational infertility. The methods were advanced and appropriate for the aims, the studies were rigorously conducted, and the conclusions were thoughtfully discussed. Overall, the aims of this study were achieved.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Grattan and colleagues were trying to establish the neural mechanism underlying lactational infertility, in particular trying to establish the relative importance of the neurogenic effects of the suckling stimulus versus prolactin per se. They have shown that in the mouse it is rather prolactin and more specifically its action on the hypothalamic arcuate kisspeptin neuronal system, which is the key neural construct underlying gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generation and central to the neuroendocrine control of reproduction, that mediates lactational infertility. The authors have taken a measured tone to emphasise the data pertaining to the mouse without extravagant extrapolation to humans. Nevertheless, the key findings provide a substantial foundation to facilitate interpretation of studies in other species.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strength of this study is the use of a combination of cutting-edge technologies, which of course underlie the majority of scientific advances rather than intellectual prowess favoured by the majority of scientists. Their approach avoided the major confounding effects of using pharmacological strategies to suppress prolactin action that has complicated the vast majority of previous studies. The study also provides an elegant and comprehensive contiguous description of GnRH pulse generator frequency across the ovarian cycle, through pregnancy and lactation, and into weaning in individual animals.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are no significant weaknesses.</p>

<p>Response to reviewer 1 comments on “weaknesses”:</p>
<p>“A weakness in the approach is the use of genetic models that do not offer complete deletion of the prolactin receptor from targeted neuronal populations...”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that neither model used provided a complete deletion of the prolactin receptor (Prlr) from the targeted neuronal populations.  We suspect that incomplete deletion of targeted genes is not uncommon in these sort of studies, but this remains the best approach to addressing our question, and we believe we have been thorough and transparent in reporting the degree of deletion observed. We thought we had appropriately discussed the implications of the low proportion of Kiss1 cells still expressing Prlr, but will certainly revisit to ensure it is discussed thoroughly.  This does not detract, however, from the key conclusion that prolactin action is necessary for full suppression of fertility in lactation in the mouse.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“Results showing no impact of progesterone on LH secretion during lactation are surprising, given the effectiveness of progesterone-containing birth control in lactating women...”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think that this comment misrepresents what has been done in our study. We did not report a lack of impact of progesterone, as exogenous progesterone was never administered to mice. We did, however, give mifepristone as a progesterone receptor antagonist to determine whether endogenous progesterone contributed to the suppression of kisspeptin neuronal activity. We found that mifepristone, at levels sufficient to terminate pregnancy, had no effect on pulsatile LH secretion in lactating mice. This is consistent with our prior observation that progesterone levels are low in mouse lactation, suggesting that progesterone does not contribute significantly to the suppression of kisspeptin neuronal activity during lactation in the mouse. We agree with the reviewer that if we had given exogenous progesterone, it likely would result in suppression of pulsatile LH secretion (as it does in women).  Indeed, in other work, we have found that progesterone administration profoundly suppresses activity of the kisspeptin neurons in mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2019-00193">https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2019-00193</ext-link>). But this was not the point of the present experiment.  We will review how we have described this experiment to ensure that this is absolutely clear.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that our study cannot address whether prolactin is necessary for the suppression of lactation in other mammalian species.  We hope our data may stimulate a re-examination of this question in other species, however, as some of the prior methodology (such as using pharmacological suppression of prolactin) may have had off target effects that confound interpretation. We thought that this point was discussed appropriately in the manuscript but we will certainly check and make sure this is addressed suitably.</p>
