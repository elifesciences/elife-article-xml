<title>Summary</title>
<p>Dopamine is a crucial neuromodulator, which is involved in many brain processes, including learning and the formation of memories. Dopamine acts through multiple receptors and controls an intricate signaling network to regulate different tasks. While the diverse functions of dopamine are intensely studied, the interplay and role of the distinct dopamine receptors to regulate different processes is less well understood. An interesting candidate is the dopamine receptor Dop1R2 (also known as Damb), as it could connect to different downstream pathways. Dop1R2 is reported to be involved in forgetting and memory maintenance, however, the circuits requiring the receptors are unknown. To study Dop1R2 and its role in specific spatial and temporal contexts, we generated a conditional knock-out line using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique. Two FRT sites were inserted, allowing flippase-mediated excision of the dopamine receptor in neurons of interest. To study the function of Dop1R2, we knocked it out conditionally in the Mushroom body of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a well-studied brain region for memory formation. We show that Dop1R2 is required for later memory forms but not for short-term memories for both aversive and appetitive memories. Moreover, Dop1R2 is specifically required in the the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe but not in the γ-lobe of the Mushroom body. Our findings show a spatially and temporally restricted role of Dop1R2 in the process of memory formation highlighting the differential requirement of receptors during distinct phases of learning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The neuromodulator dopamine is involved in a plethora of brain functions. Among them are learning and memory, reinforcement signaling, reward, arousal, and motor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Klein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Missale et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tritsch &amp; Sabatini, 2012</xref>). Perturbations in the dopaminergic system are associated with diseases like Parkinson’s disease, addiction, Depression, Schizophrenia, and many more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Klein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Missale et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tritsch &amp; Sabatini, 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is important to understand dopamine signaling in greater detail allowing to develop more effective therapeutics or preventive measures.</p>
<p>Dopamine is synthesized from tyrosine in dopaminergic neurons and binds to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Klein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Missale et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yamamoto &amp; Seto, 2014</xref>). These dopamine receptors have seven transmembrane domains, with an intracellular C-terminus and an extracellular N-terminus. The receptors interact with different G-Proteins, which are heterotrimeric protein complexes consisting of an α-, β-, and γ-subunit. The G-protein complex binds to the third intracellular loop and the C-terminus of the receptors. Humans and other mammals express five different dopamine receptors, separated into two types. Type 1 dopamine receptors elevate protein kinase A (PKA) signaling and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels via the alpha subunit Gα<sub>s</sub>, whereas type 2 receptors inhibit PKA activity via Gα<sub>i/o</sub> thus reducing cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Klein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Missale et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tritsch &amp; Sabatini, 2012</xref>). Downstream of cAMP and PKA, transcriptional activation mediated by c-AMP response element-binding protein leads to the expression of immediate early genes as a response to dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carlezon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Neves et al., 2002</xref>). This pathway is a key regulator of long-term memory (LTM) formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alberini &amp; Kandel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kaldun &amp; Sprecher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kandel, 2012</xref>). Moreover, Dopamine receptors are able to modulate internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels by engaging the Phospholipase C signaling pathway. Furthermore, the G-Protein β and γ subunits can directly modulate voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Klein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ledonne &amp; Mercuri, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Missale et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nishi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tritsch &amp; Sabatini, 2012</xref>). However, the coordination of the receptors and the different dopamine mediated processes in specific circuits is still a mystery. Therefore, an accessible and well-characterized model is required, like the olfactory circuit of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. The connectome of this circuit is known, and it can be manipulated with the sophisticated genetic tools of the fly [Takemura, 2017 #383; Li, 2020 #1015][Owald, 2015 #200]. Similar to mammals, the fly uses dopamine in learning, memory, forgetting, negative and positive reinforcement, locomotion, and sleep and arousal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Karam et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sabandal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sabandal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Siju et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Siju et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sitaraman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tomita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Waddell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yamamoto &amp; Seto, 2014</xref>). Additionally, L-Dopa, the precursor for dopamine and a powerful receptor agonist, as well as other pharmaceutics have been shown to function in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yamamoto &amp; Seto, 2014</xref>). Thus, the dopaminergic system can be studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, taking advantage of the available genetic tools.</p>
<p>The fly uses four different dopamine receptors. Dop1R1 (Dumb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sugamori et al., 1995</xref>) and Dop1R2 (Damb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Feng et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Han et al., 1996</xref>) are type 1 receptors. Dop2R is a type 2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hearn et al., 2002</xref>), and dopEcR is a type 1 dopamine receptor that also uses ecdysone as a ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Srivastava et al., 2005</xref>). All four receptors were shown to be involved in learning, memory and forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Karam et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lark et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Qi &amp; Lee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Qin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Scholz-Kornehl &amp; Schwarzel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). While it is well established that Dop1R1 is crucial for learning and short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Qin et al., 2012</xref>), the role of the other receptors is less clear. Dop1R2 is an interesting candidate to study, due to its ability to couple to two different G-proteins, Gα<sub>s</sub>, which engages the cAMP pathway and Gα<sub>q</sub>, which couples to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Han et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). This could allow Dop1R2 to modulate learning and memory in a complex fashion. The receptor is mainly expressed in the Mushroom body (MB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Crocker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Han et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lark et al., 2017</xref>), an important brain region for olfactory associative learning (Aso, Hattori, et al., 2014; Aso, Sitaraman, et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>). Work on a mutant line suggests that Dop1R2 is involved in forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berry et al., 2012</xref>). However, a study using an RNAi-line suggests that the receptor plays a role in memory maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). As these studies used different learning assays – aversive and appetitive respectively as well as different methods, it is unclear if Dop1R2 has different functions for the different reinforcement stimulus. To resolve this problem, we generated a transgenic line to conditionally knock down Dop1R2, in a spatial and temporal specific manner. Using CRISPR-Cas9 and homology-directed repair (HDR), we included FRT sites in the endogenous locus of <italic>Dop1R2</italic> for flippase-mediated excision. In addition, we inserted an HA-Tag, to monitor the spatial localization of the receptor. This also allows us to visualize the efficiency of the flip-out. We used this line to study the role of the receptor in learning and memory in the MB for both aversive and appetitive conditioning. Upon flip out of the receptor in the MB, 2h memory and long-term memory (LTM) are impaired. Similar results are obtained when we flip out Dop1R2 specifically in the α/β-lobes and α’/β’-lobes of the MB, which are involved in those memory phases. Therefore, Dop1R2 is required in the α/β-lobes and α’/β’-lobes for later memory forms.</p>

<title>Generation of the Dop1R2 conditional knock-out line</title>
<p>To be able to study both the requirement of Dop1R2 in specific neurons as well as the localization of the receptor we generated a transgenic line that allows defined spatial and temporal knock-out of the receptor. In short, we inserted two FRT sites for flippase-mediated excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Golic &amp; Lindquist, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gratz et al., 2014</xref>) as well as a 3xHA-tag to study the localization of the receptor. The Ha-Tag was chosen to minimize interference with the receptor structure. A representation of the receptor is depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. The 3<sup>rd</sup> intracellular loop between transmembrane domains (TMDs) five and six as well as the C-terminal tail are required for G-protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Missale et al., 1998</xref>). The position of the FRT sites and the HA-tag is indicated. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> gives an overview of the strategy. The endogenous locus is cut twice by CRISPR-Cas9 to replace it with the Dop1R2 sequence carrying the FRT sites and the HA-Tag, using a donor plasmid as template for homolog-directed repair. The donor plasmid also contains the region directly upstream and downstream of the exchange site as homology arms to align the plasmid. The plasmid carrying the sequence for the two gRNAs as well as the donor plasmid were injected into embryos with maternal Cas9 expression (<italic>nos&gt;Cas9</italic>). Using the Gal4-UAS system to express flippase in neurons of interest the receptor can be flipped out in those neurons while keeping it functional in the rest of the brain. The first FRT site was placed in the intron before the first coding exon, which contains all seven TMDs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Since Dop1R2 has three transcript isoforms with differences in the C-terminus the second FRT site was placed at the end of the last common exon. Thus, FLP-mediated recombination will lead to deletion of the two common coding exons including all TMDs. Successful insertion was verified by sequencing.</p>

<title>Dop1R2<sup>cko</sup> is in the Mushroom body</title>
<p>To monitor the localization of the tagged dopamine receptors we first stained brains with an antibody against the HA-Tag in one-week-old flies. In the control line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) the HA-tag does not show any specific staining. In the dop1R2<sup>cko</sup> line, we see a clear signal in the entire MB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). This matches previous reports as well as single-cell RNAseq data showing that <italic>Dop1R2</italic> is expressed in the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Han et al., 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Short-term memory is not affected by the loss of Dop1R2</title>
<p>We wanted to see if flipping out Dop1R2 in the MB affects memory acquisition and STM by using classical olfactory conditioning. In short, a group of flies is presented with an odor coupled to an electric shock (aversive) or sugar (appetitive) followed by a second odor without stimulus. For assessing memory flies can freely choose between the odors either directly after training (STM) or at a later timepoint.</p>
<p>To ensure that the introduced genetic changes to the Dop1R2 locus do not interfere with behavior we first checked the sensory responses of that line (Sup A-D). The Dop1R2<sup>cko</sup> line shows comparable odor responses (Sup A+B) as well as sugar and shock response (Sup C+D) to the control line. Aversive STM (Sup E), as well as aversive 2h memory (Sup F), are not significantly different from the control line. Moreover, appetitive STM is also comparable to the control (Sup G). Thus, the introduced changes to dop1R2 do not interfere with normal receptor function.</p>
<p>To test the requirement of dop1R2 for short-term memory we assessed memory performance directly after training for flies with flipped-out dop1R2 in the whole MB or in individual lobes along with the parental controls. The flies were aged for a week before undergoing classical olfactory conditioning. Both aversive STM and appetitive STM were tested. But first, we ensured that the whole MB flip-out line responds normally to the used odors and stimuli. Flp/+;; Dop1R2<sup>cko</sup>; OK107-Gal4/+ flies show comparable responses as the parental controls to both odors (Sup H+I), shock (Sup J) and sugar (Sup K).</p>
<p>For aversive STM flipping out Dop1R2 in the whole MB does not change STM compared to parental controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Next, we flipped Dop1R2 in the γ-lobe using 5HTR1B-Gal4. This MB lobe is involved in STM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Trannoy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zars et al., 2000</xref>). Matching the results for the whole MB flip out, we do not see a change in the performance score (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar results are obtained when we flip the receptor in the α/β-lobes using c739-Gal4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) or α’/β’-lobes using c305a-Gal4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Reward STM is also not changed when Dop1R2 is flipped out in the whole MB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) in the γ-lobe (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), the α/β-lobes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>) or the α’/β’-lobes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Taken together the results indicate that Dop1R2 is not required for STM in the MB lobes.</p>

<title>2h memory is impaired by loss of Dop1R2</title>
<p>As Dop1R2 was previously described to be involved in forgetting and/or memory maintenance we wanted to assess later time points after training.</p>
<p>First, we looked at two hours after aversive training. Flip-out in the whole Mushroom body leads to a reduced performance score (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, we wondered which MB lobe might cause this reduction. Therefore, we flipped out Dop1R2 in γ-lobe using 5HTR1B-Gal4, in the α/β-lobes using c739-Gal4 or α’/β’-lobes using c305a-Gal4. Loss of Dop1R2 in the γ-lobe does not reduce the memory performance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>However, loss of Dop1R2 in both the α/β-lobes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) or the α’/β’-lobes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) impaired 2h memory after aversive training.</p>
<p>We tested the same for reward memory using sugar as reinforcement. Flip out of Dop1R2 in the whole MB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) results in a reduced performance score. Loss of Dop1R2 in the γ-lobe does not affect memory performance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). As for aversive training, flip out of Dop1R2 in the α/β-lobes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>) or the α’/β’-lobes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>) impaired 2h memory after reward training. However, the reduction is not as severe as for aversive training. Taken together the results indicate that Dop1R2 is required for aversive 2h memory as well as reward 2h memory in the α/β-lobes and the α’/β’-lobes but is dispensable in the γ-lobe.</p>

<p>Next, we wanted to see if later memory forms are also affected. One cycle of reward training is sufficient to create LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Krashes &amp; Waddell, 2008</xref>), so we looked at 24h appetitive memory.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have generated a conditional knock-out line for the dopamine receptor Dop1R2 following a similar approach as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Widmer et al. 2018</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Widmer et al., 2018</xref>). To achieve this, FRT sites were inserted in front of the start codon and in the C-Terminus of Dop1R2 using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated homology-directed repair. In addition, an HA- Tag was inserted to be able to visualize the dopamine receptor expression as well as verify successful flip out. Using an anti-HA-Tag antibody we were able to visualize Dop1R2 in the MB of the generated line. This matches previous reports for the expression of <italic>Dop1R2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Crocker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Han et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, upon knocking out Dop1R2 with an MB-specific driver, the HA-tag labeling disappears indicating that the conditional knock-out system works. The HA-Tag could also be useful to study the localization of Dop1R2 within the MB lobes, for example if it is close to synapses of dopaminergic neurons.</p>
<p>To get a better overview of Dop1R2’s role in the Mushroom body we analyzed appetitive memory at different timepoints after training in the individual MB lobes. Loss of <italic>Dop1R</italic>2 in the whole MB as well as the α/β-lobe or the α’/β’-lobe impairs 24h reward memory. This observation matches previous studies. Using <italic>Dop1R2-RNAi</italic> in the MB, Sun et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sun et al., 2020</xref>) showed, that STM is intact, while LTM is impaired. When knocking down the Raf/MAPK pathway they get a similar phenotype. Moreover, expression of a constitutive active <italic>Raf</italic> allele rescues the Dop1R2 dependent LTM deficit and Dop1R2 seems to be required for the phosphorylation of the MAPK. Therefore, Dop1R2 dependent activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway is required for stabilization of reward LTM memory. Another study shows that reward LTM requires food with a high energetic value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Musso et al., 2015</xref>). This signal seems to be relayed by the dopaminergic neuron (DAN) MB-MP1, that showed temporally restricted oscillating activity early post-training(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Musso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pavlowsky et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, knock-down of Dop1R2 using RNAi impaired reward LTM while leaving STM intact. Therefore, dopaminergic signaling through MB-MP-1 and Dop1R2 could indicate the energetic value of the reward and decide if LTM should be formed or not. Interestingly, the MB-MP1 DAN arborizes in the spur of the γ-lobe as well as the inner core of the pedunculus, which consists of the axons of the α/β Kenyon Cells (KCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>), which according to our results require Dop1R2 for reward LTM. Loss of Dop1R2 in the Mushroom Body Output neuron (neuron) MVP2 also impaired reward LTM while leaving STM intact(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pavlowsky et al., 2018</xref>). This GABAergic MVP2 MBON forms a feedback circuit with the MB-MP1 DAN. After training, the oscillatory activity of MB-MP1 is enhanced, while MVP2 is inhibited. After 30min, MVP2 gets activated and MB-MP1 is inhibited. Moreover, Dop1R2 seems to be required for modulating this feedback loop.</p>
<p>The MBONs are an important contributor to memory. Moreover, MBONs receive dopaminergic input and seem to express dopamine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Crocker et al., 2016</xref>) We showed that Dop1R2 is required in the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe for reward LTM formation. Interestingly, MBONs which are involved in reward LTM(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Plaçais et al., 2013</xref>), have arborization in the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe. Thus, Dop1R2 could modulate these connections as well.</p>
<p>All in all, Dop1R2 is required for reward LTM formation and loss of the receptor impairs LTM. Dop1R2 seems to influence reward LTM in different ways. Firstly, by acting on the Raf-MAPK pathway to stabilize memory, secondly by relaying the energetic content of the reward and third, by modulating the MB-MP1-MVP2 loop.</p>
<p>For aversive conditioning, we observe that loss of Dop1R2 in the MB leads to impaired 2h memory, whereas STM is intact. Moreover, Dop1R2 seems to be required in the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe. A previous study using a mutant for Dop1R2, that also affects the neighboring gene GC1907, observed higher memory retention(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berry et al., 2012</xref>). Further, lack of Dop1R2 impairs reversal learning. It is proposed that Dop1R2 acts on the RAC-forgetting pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shuai et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, Dop1R2 can act on two different downstream second messenger systems by using two different G-Proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>). By coupling to G<sub>αs</sub> the cAMP pathway is activated. By coupling to G<sub>αq</sub> the Ca<sup>2+</sup> messenger system is activated. Furthermore, knocking down G<sub>αq</sub> pan-neuronally or in the MB leads to memory enhancement 3h after training, but not 6h after training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, Dop1R2 could regulate the RAC forgetting pathway through G<sub>αq</sub>. However, also other receptors could use G<sub>αq</sub> and mediate forgetting.</p>
<p>Berry et al. also observed that blocking output of DANs inhibits forgetting, while activating DANs accelerates forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berry et al., 2012</xref>). This modulation seems to require ongoing activity of the MP1 DAN together with further DANs. Interestingly, using a spaced training protocol and a Dop1R2 line another study showed impaired LTM(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Placais et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, after spaced training, flies have a higher energy uptake and the energy metabolism is upregulated in the MB. This increase in energy consumption is mediated by dopaminergic signaling from the MB-MP1 DAN. Loss of Dop1R2 in the MB abolishes the increase in energy consumption. Therefore, Dop1R2 seems to be important for aversive LTM formation by regulating energy consumption. Thus, like for reward LTM formation, aversive LTM seems to require sufficient energy. Starved flies reduce the formation of aversive LTM(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Plaçais &amp; Preat, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Plaçais et al., 2012</xref>). This information seems to be relayed through ongoing oscillation of MB-MP1 and Dop1R2 after training. In addition, the MVP2 MBON might also be involved(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Ueoka et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the gating mechanism in both aversive and reward LTM formation seems to require Dop1R2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pavlowsky et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, the MAPK signaling pathway might also be required in aversive LTM formation by activating transcription factors like CREB and c-fos(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Miyashita et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Both Dop1R2 and the ongoing activity of MB-MP1 seem to have multiple roles directly after training in a short time window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Placais et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Plaçais et al., 2012</xref>). The circuit acts like a gating mechanism for LTM to ensure, that there is enough energy for continuing LTM formation. The MBON MVP2 acts as feedback loop to regulate the activity of the DAN. Moreover, both the RAC and the Raf/MAPK signaling pathway seem to be engaged to either forget or stabilize the memory. In aversive memory formation, loss of Dop1R2 could lead to enhanced or impaired memory, depending on the activated signaling pathways and the internal state of the animal. For reward memory formation, loss of Dop1R2 seems to impair memory. Moreover, Rac does not have an effect on reward memories(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). However, it still remains unclear, how all of these aspects are integrated and if there is a hierarchical order.</p>
<p>DANs can produce aversive and appetitive associations depending on the temporal presentation of odor cue and reinforcement stimulus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Handler et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, dopaminergic signaling is able to modify the KC-MBON synapses bi-directionally. The Dop1R1-G<sub>αs</sub>-cAMP pathway seems to detect the temporal coincidence of the stimuli whereas the Dop1R2-G<sub>αq</sub>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway detects the temporal ordering(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Handler et al., 2019</xref>). Dop1R2 mutant flies seem to be able to form an odor association but are not able to update it. Further, Dop1R2 is required for the potentiation of the KC-MBON synapse following backward pairing.</p>
<p>Taken together, Dop1R2 has multiple roles during memory formation and integrates different signals, including the detection of the order of stimuli, the internal state, like energy levels and forgetting and maintenance signals.</p>
<p>The receptor does not seem to be required for STM but for later timepoints. Previous studies looking at the temporal requirement of the lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guven-Ozkan &amp; Davis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>) defined the γ-lobe to be responsible for memory acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Trannoy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zars et al., 2000</xref>). The α/β-lobe and its output is involved in LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akalal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Krashes &amp; Waddell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Trannoy et al., 2011</xref>). The function of the α’/β’-lobe seems to be LTM consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Krashes &amp; Waddell, 2008</xref>). However, both lobes also seem to have a role in middle-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Scheunemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shyu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Turrel et al., 2022</xref>). As loss of Dop1R2 in the γ-lobe or the whole MB does not impair STM, we conclude that the receptor is not required for this memory type. However, Dop1R2 is expressed in the γ-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Crocker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Croset et al., 2018</xref>), so it might be required for other types of behaviors.</p>
<p>The impairment of reward LTM upon knock-out of Dop1R2 in the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe matches the described role of these neurons. So, both the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe require Dop1R2 for LTM. Interestingly, both lobes also seem to require Dop1R2 for two-hour memories. As the MB-MP1 DAN is active in this time window as well, this would suggest that Dop1R2 function at this time point is important for correct LTM formation.</p>
<p>This would indicate, that Dop1R1 is the main contributor to STM while Dop1R2 is responsible for later memory stages. It would be interesting to know how the switch from Dop1R1 dependency to Dop1R2 occurs.</p>
<p>As Dop1R2 is required in the MBON MVP2 for reward LTM, it would be exciting to see if it is also required in other MBONs or neurons outside the MB. Besides learning and memory, the MB also uses dopamine to regulate sleep. This tool offers the opportunity to study both of these aspects in neurons of interest.</p>
<p>The genetic tool we generated here to study the role of the Dop1R2 dopamine receptor in cells of interest, provides versatile possibilities as it can be used in combination with the powerful genetic tools of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Using this line, we could show, that Dop1R2 is specifically required for later memory stages of both aversive and appetitive memory in the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe.</p>

<title>Generation of dop1R2<sup>cko</sup></title>
<p>For generating the conditional knock-out line we needed three regions: 1) The 5’ flanking sequence upstream of the first FRT site as homologous region, 2) The 3’ flanking sequence downstream of the second FRT site as homologous region, 3) the sequence in between the two FRT sites hereafter named Dop1R2 coding fragment. To obtain the dopamine receptor fragments, genomic DNA from <italic>nos &gt;Cas9</italic> flies was used as the template for the PCRs. The primers used for the different PCR fragments are shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The 3’ and 5’ fragments of Dop1R2 were sub-cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) vector (pBS) with adequate restriction enzymes – SpeI and SmaI for the 5’ fragment and XhoI and Acc65I for the 3’ fragment. The Dop1R2 coding fragment was cloned with the Invitrogen TOPO kit. After sequence confirmation the fragments were cloned subsequently into pBS-FRT-3xHA-FRT. The vector is modified from the vector used by Widmer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Widmer et al., 2018</xref>). The GFP was replaced by 3xHA using 3xHA Nco fw cacatggtTACCCATACGATGTTCCTGACTATGCGGGCTATCCCTATGACGTCCCG GACTATGCAGGATCCTATCCATATGACGTTCCAGATTACGCTgca and 3xHA H3 re agcttgcAGCGTAATCTGGAACGTCATATGGATAGGATCCTGCATAGTCCGGGACG TCATAGGGATAGCCCGCATAGTCAGGAACATCGTATGGGTAc as oligos whereas the FRT site and the pBS backbone were kept.

The used sequences (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were integrated into PCR primers to amplify a fragment of the pCFD4-U6_1_6_3tandemgRNAs plasmid (a gift from Simon Bullock, addgene plasmid # 49411 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Port et al., 2014</xref>) that was cloned into BbsI digested pCFD4-U6_1_6_3tandemgRNAs vector using Gibbson assembly (NEB). Insertion of the gRNAs was confirmed by sequencing. A mix containing 0.4 mg/ml template and 0.2 mg/ml of the guide RNAs plasmid was injected into <italic>nos&gt;Cas9</italic> embryos. The injected flies were crossed with a 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosomal balancer line. The F1 generation was crossed again with the 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosomal balancer flies. As soon as eggs or larvae were visible the adults were sacrificed to check for the <italic>Dop1R2</italic> construct via PCR. Positive hits were then sequenced, and a stock was established.</p>

After the brains were washed in 0.5% PBST again, they were incubated o/n at 4°C with the secondary antibodies. The following secondary antibodies were used: Goat α-rat Alexa 647 (Molecular probes A-21247) and Goat α-Mouse Alexa 488 (Molecular probes A11029) 1:200. The brains were washed again and mounted in self-made mounting media (90% Glycerol (Fischer Scientific Catalog No. BP229-1), 0.5% N-propyl gallate (Sigma P3130), 20 mM Tris (Fischer Scientific, Catalog No. BP152-5), pH 8.0) (Adapted from NIC Harvard Medical School). The brains were imaged using a confocal microscope (Leica STELLARIS 8 FALCON) at 40X magnification with the Plan APO 40x/1.10 water immersion objective at 1,024 × 1,024 pixels resolution and 600Hz scan rate. Images were processed with Fiji ImageJ and Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<title>Learning Apparatus</title>
<p>For behavior experiments, we used a memory apparatus that is based on Tully and Quinn’s design and modified to allow conducting four memory experiments in parallel (CON-Elektronik, Greussenheim, Germany). Experiments were performed at 23-25°C and 65-75% relative humidity. The training was performed in dim red light and memory tests were done in complete darkness. The two odors used were 3-octanol (3-Oct) (Sigma-Aldrich 218405) and 4-methyl-cyclohexanol (MCH) (Sigma-Aldrich 66360) diluted in paraffin oil (Sigma-Aldrich 18512) 1:100 respectively. 260μl of the diluted odors were presented in a plastic cup of 14 mm in diameter. A vacuum membrane pump ensured odor delivery at a flow rate of 7 l/min.</p>

<title>Aversive olfactory conditioning</title>
<p>For aversive conditioning, groups of 50-100 flies of mixed sex were loaded in tubes lined with an electrifiable copper grid. The position in the machine and the sequence in which the genotypes were tested were randomized. Experiments in which more than half of the flies died, the flies did not move or there were technical problems with the machine, as well as human errors were excluded. The training was conducted in the morning. After an accommodation period of 90 s, the first odor was presented for 60 s. In parallel, 12 pulses of 100 V for 1.5 s were delivered with an interval of 3.5 s. After 30 s of flushing with fresh air, the second odor was presented for 60 s. For the subsequent group of flies, the order of the two odors was reversed. For measuring 0 h performance flies were tested about 3 minutes after the end of the conditioning. To determine 2h memory performance, flies were transferred to food vials after conditioning and kept at 25°C until the test. For each genotype and condition the biological replicate is N=12.</p>

<title>Appetitive olfactory conditioning</title>
<p>Before appetitive conditioning, groups of 50 to 100 flies with mixed sex were starved for 19 to 21 h in plastic vials containing damp cotton at the bottom. Experiments in which more than half of the flies died, the flies did not move or there were technical problems with the machine, as well as human errors were excluded. The position in the machine and the sequence in which the genotypes were tested were randomized. The training was conducted in the morning. The conditioning protocol consists of a 90-s accommodation period, 120 s of the first odor, 60 s of fresh air followed by 120 s of the second odor. During the first odor, flies are in a conditioning tube lined with filter paper that was soaked in water the day before the experiment and left to dry overnight. For the second odor, flies are transferred to a conditioning tube lined with a filter paper that was soaked with a 1.5 M sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 84100-1KG; CAS Number 57-50-1) solution on the day before and left to dry at RT. After conditioning, flies were either directly tested for STM or put back in starvation vials until the memory test 2 h later. For 24-h memory, flies were fed for 3 h after training before starving them again. One experiment consisted of 2 reciprocal conditionings, in which the odor paired with sucrose was reversed. For each genotype and condition the biological replicate is N=12.</p>

<title>Memory tests</title>
<p>Flies were loaded into a sliding compartment and transferred to a two-arm choice point. Animals were allowed to choose between 3-octanol and 4-methyl-cyclohexanol. After 60 s, flies trapped in both arms were collected separately and counted. Based on these numbers, a preference index was calculated as follows:</p>
<p>PREF = ((N<sub>arm1</sub> - N<sub>arm2</sub>) 100) / N<sub>total</sub> the two preference indices were calculated from the two reciprocal experiments. The average of these two PREFs gives a memory performance index (PI). PI = (PREF<sub>1</sub> + PREF<sub>2</sub>) / 2</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i">
<title>Sensory Accuracy tests</title>
<p>Flies were tested for their ability to sense the two used odors 3-octanol and 4-methyl-cyclohexanol as well as electric shock. Therefore, the flies were loaded into a sliding compartment and brought to a two-arm choice point. The flies were allowed to freely choose between an arm containing the stimulus and a neutral arm. All experiments were carried out in the dark. Afterward, the flies in each arm were counted and a preference index was calculated.</p>
<p>For testing the odor response, the flies could choose between one of the odors in the same concentration as used for the behavior experiment and the same amount of paraffin oil for 120s.</p>
<p>Preference index PI = ((N<sub>air</sub>-N<sub>odor</sub>)100)/N<sub>total</sub>.</p>
<p>For shock response, the flies could freely choose for 60s between a cooper-grid lined tube getting pulses of 100V or a cooper-grid lined tube getting no electric shock. Preference index PI = ((<sub>NNo shock</sub>-N<sub>shock</sub>)100)/N<sub>total</sub>.</p>
<p>For testing sugar sensitivity, a group of flies was starved for 1 to 21 h in a tube with damp cotton on the bottom. They could choose for 120 s between a tube lined with filter paper that was soaked in 1.5 M sucrose solution the day before or a tube lined with filter paper that was soaked in distilled water the day before. Preference index PI = ((N<sub>sucrose</sub> − N<sub>water</sub>)100) / N<sub>total</sub></p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>To compare performance indices between different groups we used One-way ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) with posthoc Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) Test Calculator for comparing multiple treatments in R with the package multcomp. In the case of two groups, we performed a <italic>t</italic>-test for comparison.</p>

<p>The authors design and implement an elegant strategy to delete genomic sequences encoding the dopamine receptor dop1R2 from specific subsets of mushroom body neurons (ab, a'b' and gamma) and show that while none of these manipulations affect short term appetitive or aversive memory, loss of dop1R2 from ab or a'b' block the ability of flies to display measurable forms of longer forms of appetitive memory. These findings are <bold>valuable</bold> in confirming and/or moderating prior observations, with better genetic perturbation techniques and <bold>convincing</bold> data to support the authors' main conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors present a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic tool for the dopamine receptor dop1R2. Based on the known function of the receptor in learning and memory, they tested the efficacy of the genetic tool by knocking out the receptor specifically in mushroom body neurons. The data suggest that dop1R2 is necessary for longer-lasting memories through its action on ⍺/ß and ⍺'/ß' neurons but is dispensable for short-term memory and thus in ɣ neurons. The experiments impressively demonstrate the value of such a genetic tool and illustrate the specific function of the receptor in subpopulations of KCs for longer-term memories. The data presented in this manuscript are significant.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript examines the role of the dopamine receptor, Dop1R2, in memory formation. This receptor has complex roles in supporting different stages of memory, and the neural mechanisms for these functions are poorly understood. The authors are able to localize Dop1R2 function to the vertical lobes of the mushroom body, revealing a role in later (presumably middle-term) aversive and appetitive memory. In general, the experimental design is rigorous, and statistics are appropriately applied. While the manuscript provides a useful tool, it would be strengthened further by additional mechanistic studies that build on the rich literature examining the roles of dopamine signaling in memory formation. The claim that Dop1R2 is involved in memory formation is strongly supported by the data presented, and this manuscript adds to a growing literature revealing that dopamine is a critical regulator of olfactory memory. However, the manuscript does not necessarily extend much beyond our understanding of Dop1R2 in memory formation, and future work will be needed to fully characterize this reagent and define the role of Dop1R2 in memory.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The FRT lines generated provide a novel tool for temporal and spatially precise manipulation of Dop1R2 function. This tool will be valuable to study the role of Dop1R2 in memory and other behaviors potentially regulated by this gene.</p>
<p>(2) Given the highly conserved role of Dop1R2 in memory and other processes, these findings have a high potential to translate to vertebrate species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors state Dop1R2 associates with two different G-proteins. It would be useful to know which one is mediating the loss of aversive and appetitive memory in Dop1R2 knockout flies.</p>
<p>(2) It would be interesting to examine 24hr aversive memory, in addition to 24hr appetitive memory.</p>
<p>(3) The manuscript would be strengthened by added functional analysis. What are the DANs that signal through Dop1R. How do these knockouts impact MBONs?</p>
<p>(4) Also in Figure 2, the lobe-specific knockouts might be moved to supplemental since there is no effect. Instead, consider moving the control sensory tests into the main figure.</p>
<p>(5) Can the single-cell atlas data be used to narrow down the cell types in the vertical lobes that express Dop1R2? Is it all or just a subset?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kaldun et al. investigated the role of Dopamine Receptor Dop1R2 in different types and stages of olfactory associative memory in Drosophila melanogaster. Dop1R2 is a type 1 Dopamine receptor that can act both through Gs-cAMP and Gq-ERCa2+ pathways. The authors first developed a very useful tool, where tissue-specific knock-out mutants can be generated, using Crispr/Cas9 technology in combination with the powerful Gal4/UAS gene-expression toolkit, very common in fruit flies.</p>
<p>
They direct the K.O. mutation to intrinsic neurons of the main associative memory centre fly brain-the mushroom body (MB). There are three main types of MB-neurons, or Kenyon cells, according to their axonal projections: a/b; a'/b', and g neurons.</p>
<p>Kaldun et al. found that flies lacking dop1R2 all over the MB displayed impaired appetitive middle-term (2h) and long-term (24h) memory, whereas appetitive short-term memory remained intact. Knocking-out dop1R2 in the three MB neuron subtypes also impaired middle-term, but not short-term, aversive memory.</p>
<p>These memory defects were recapitulated when the loss of the dop1R2 gene was restricted to either a/b or a'/b', but not when the loss of the gene was restricted to g neurons, showcasing a compartmentalized role of Dop1R2 in specific neuronal subtypes of the main memory centre of the fly brain for the expression of middle and long-term memories.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The conclusions of this paper are very well supported by the data, and the authors systematically addressed the requirement of a very interesting type of dopamine receptor in both appetitive and aversive memories. These findings are important for the fields of learning and memory and dopaminergic neuromodulation among others. The evidence in the literature so far was generated in different labs, each using different tools (mutants, RNAi knockdowns driven in different developmental stages...), different time points (short, middle, and long-term memory), different types of memories (Anesthesia resistant, which is a type of protein synthesis independent consolidated memory; anesthesia sensitive, which is a type of protein synthesis-dependent consolidated memory; aversive memory; appetitive memory...) and different behavioral paradigms. A study like this one allows for direct comparison of the results, and generalized observations.</p>
<p>(2) Additionally, Kaldun and collaborators addressed the requirement of different types of Kenyon cells, that have been classically involved in different memory stages: g KCs for memory acquisition and a/b or a'/b' for later memory phases. This systematical approach has not been performed before.</p>
<p>(3) Importantly, the authors of this paper produced a tool to generate tissue-specific knock-out mutants of dop1R2. Although this is not the first time that the requirement of this gene in different memory phases has been studied, the tools used here represent the most sophisticated genetic approach to induce a loss of function phenotypes exclusively in MB neurons.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Although the paper does have important strengths, the main weakness of this work is that the advancement in the field could be considered incremental: the main findings of the manuscript had been reported before by several groups, using tissue-specific conditional knockdowns through interference RNAi. The requirement of Dop1R2 in MB for middle-term and long-term memories has been shown both for appetitive (Musso et al 2015, Sun et al 2020) and aversive associations (Plaçais et al 2017).</p>
<p>(2) The approach used here to genetically modify memory neurons is not temporally restricted. Considering the role of dopamine in the correct development of the nervous system, one must consider the possible effects that this manipulation can have in the establishment of memory circuits. However, previous studies addressing this question restricted the manipulation of Dop1R2 expression to adulthood, leading to the same findings than the ones reported in this paper for both aversive and appetitive memories, which solidifies the findings of this paper.</p>
<p>(3) The authors state that they aim to resolve disparities of findings in the field regarding the specific role of Dop1R2 in memory, offering a potent tool to generate mutants and addressing systematically their effects on different types of memory. Their results support the role of this receptor in the expression of long-term memories, however in the experiments performed here do not address temporal resolution of the genetic manipulations that could bring light into the mechanisms of action of Dop1R2 in memory. Several hypotheses have been proposed, from stabilization of memory, effects on forgetting, or integration of sequences of events (sensory experiences and dopamine release).</p>
<p>Overall, the authors generated a very useful tool to study dopamine neuromodulation in any given circuit when used in combination with the powerful genetic toolkit available in Drosophila. The reports in this paper confirmed a previously described role of Dop1R2 in the expression of aversive and appetitive LTM and mapped these effects to two specific types of memory neurons in the fly brain, previously implicated in the expression and consolidation of long-term associative memories.</p>
