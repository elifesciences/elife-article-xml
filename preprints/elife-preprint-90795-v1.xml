<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Color pattern of insects is one of the most dazzling adaptive evolutionary phenotypes. However, the molecular regulation of this color pattern is not clear. In this paper, we found a transcription factor, <italic>Bm-mamo</italic>, is responsible for <italic>bd</italic> (<italic>black dilute</italic>) allele mutants in silkworm. It belongs to BTB zinc finger family, and is ortholog to <italic>mamo</italic> of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, which It is found that this gene has conservative function in gamete production, and evolved a pleiotropic function in regulation of color patterns in caterpillar. We found that the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> can comprehensively regulate the expression of related pigment synthesis and cuticular protein genes to form color patterns. This suggests that the deposition of pigment particles in caterpillars’ epidermis requires not only the spatiotemporal expression of pigment synthesis genes, but also the correct expression of related cuticular protein genes. This study provides a new data for the setting of color patterns.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The insects, living under natural light, often have ingenious color patterns that provide great aid to them, such as in behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, thermoregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, UV protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, and especially in antagonist to visual predators by either aposematic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, mimicry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, cryptic color patterns or combination among them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Impressively, the color patterns of insects, such as cryptic color, can deceive visual animals, based on their clever designed which highly similar the surrounding environment. In addition, the color patterns are divergent and convergent among populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Due to this gorgeous visual feature and highly active adaptive evolutionary phenotype, lead to the genetic basis and evolution mechanism of color patterns have been highly concern for a long time.</p>
<p>The body color of insects is actually main formed by the absorption, reflection or/and diffraction of natural light by the body surface, or/and some appendage (such as bristles and scales)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Thus, the difference in epidermal structure and the difference in pigment deposits can form divergent color patterns. Cuticular proteins (CPs) are the main structural proteins that form the epidermis. There are large number genes encoding cuticular proteins in arthropods genome. For example, in <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> over 220 genes belong to the family of CPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. These cuticular proteins belong to more than 10 subfamilies, including CPR, CPF, CPFL, CPH, Tweedle, CPT, CPG and et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, the fine localization molecular mechanism of cuticular proteins in epidermis is still unclear. Moreover, the biochemical metabolic pathways of pigments, which used for color patten of insect, such as melanins, pterins, ommochromes, have been reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The deficient of enzymes in pigments metabolism pathway can lead to the change of color pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, some pleiotropic factors, such as <italic>wnt1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, <italic>Apontic-like</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, <italic>clawless</italic>, <italic>abdominal-A</italic>, and <italic>Abdominal-B</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, <italic>bric</italic> à <italic>brac</italic> (<italic>bab</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, <italic>Distal-less</italic> (<italic>Dll</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, play an important role in the regulation of color pattern. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which these factors participate in the regulation of body color patterns is unclear. In addition, there are many undiscovered factors involved in the gene regulatory network (GRN) involved in the regulation of insect color patterns. Hence, the identification of new color pattern regulatory genes and the study of molecular mechanisms are helpful to further understand the color patterns plan.</p>
<p>Silkworm, <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<italic>B</italic>. <italic>mori</italic>), is a completely domesticated Lepidoptera, for more than 5000 years, is famous in silk fiber production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Because of long-term domestication, artificial selection and genetic research, its genetic background is clear, and about 200 strains of mutants involved in color pattern have been preserved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, which provides a good resource for color pattern research. The <italic>black dilute</italic> (<italic>bd</italic>) mutant, complied with the recessive Mendelian inheritance law, showed a dark gray larvae body color and its female is sterile. The <italic>bd<sup>f</sup></italic> (<italic>black dilute fertile</italic>) is one of its alleles, the body color is lighter than that of <italic>bd</italic> and the female is fertile (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">fig.1</xref>). The two mutants were mapped to a single locus on 22.9 centimorgan (cM) of linkage group 9 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Because there are no pigmentation related genes reported at this locus. For it, research may discover a new color pattern related gene, which have aroused our concern.</p>

<title>Candidate gene of <italic>bd</italic> allele of silkworm</title>
<p>To identify the genomic region responsible for the <italic>bd</italic> alleles, the positional cloning of <italic>bd</italic> locus was performed. Due to the female infertility of the <italic>bd</italic> mutant and the female of its allele <italic>bd<sup>f</sup></italic>is fertile. So, we used <italic>bd<sup>f</sup></italic> and wild type Dazao strain as the parents for mapping analysis.</p>
<p>The 1162 back-crossed filial 1 (BC1M) generation individuals, between <italic>bd<sup>f</sup></italic> and Dazao, were used for fine mapping by using molecular markers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">fig 2</xref>). It found that the genome region of about 390 kb (kilo base) was responsible for <italic>bd</italic> phenotype (table s1). This region included five predicted genes (<italic>BGIBMGA012516</italic>, <italic>BGIBMGA012517</italic>, <italic>BGIBMGA012518</italic>, <italic>BGIBMGA012519</italic> and <italic>BGIBMGA014089</italic>). And then, qRT-PCR (Fluorescence quantitative PCR) was performed, which found that <italic>BGIBMGA012517</italic> and <italic>BGIBMGA012518</italic> were significant down-regulation expressed at day 3 of five instar of larvae in the <italic>bd</italic> phenotype individuals (fig s1). In addition, the two genes are consistent expression trend in those strain, respectively. To determine the gene structure of the <italic>BIGBMGA012517</italic> and <italic>BIGBMGA012518</italic>, we using forward primers of the <italic>BIGBMGA012517</italic> gene and reverse primers of the <italic>BIGBMGA012518</italic> gene to amplify the cDNA from wild type strain Dazao. By gene cloning, the predicted genes <italic>BGIBMGA012517</italic> and <italic>BGIBMGA012518</italic> were proved to be one gene. For the convenience of description, we temporarily call it <italic>12517/8</italic> gene. The <italic>12517/8</italic> gene produce two transcripts, the long transcripts contain an open reading frame (ORF) with 2397 bp, and the ORF of short one was 1824 bp, which share the same 5’-terminal in wild type strain Dazao (fig s2). The <italic>12517/8</italic> is significant low expression in <italic>bd<sup>f</sup></italic>mutant, and were found multiple variations in nearby region of this gene by analysis of comparative genome between <italic>bd<sup>f</sup></italic> and Dazao (table s2). In addition, the <italic>12517/8</italic> is silence completely due to the deletion of DNA fragments (about 168 Kb) from first intron to upstream, and insert 3560 bp in <italic>bd</italic> mutant (fig s3).</p>

<p>To estimate the function of the gene <italic>12517/8</italic>, we performed a BLAST search using its full-length sequence and found a transcription factor, <italic>mamo</italic> (<italic>maternal gene required for meiosis</italic>), in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, which had a highly sequence similarity to that of the <italic>12517/8</italic> gene (fig s4). So, we named the <italic>12517/18</italic> gene <italic>Bm-mamo</italic>.</p>
<p>The gene <italic>mamo</italic>, belong to Broad-complex, Tramtrack and bric à brac/poxvirus zinc finger protein (BTB-ZF) family. The BTB-ZF family, which use the zinc finger as recognition motif of DNA specific sequences, and the BTB domain promotes oligomerization and the recruitment of other regulator factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Most of these factors are typically repressors of transcription, such as N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor) and SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, but also some are activators, such as p300<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, these displaying features of commonly serve as regulator of gene expression. The <italic>mamo</italic> is enriched in embryonic primordial germ cells (PGCs) in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>. Deficiency of <italic>mamo</italic> are able to undergo oogenesis, but fail to execute meiosis properly and leading to female infertility in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. However, the lack of the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene not only leads to sterility, but also causes significant melanism, in caterpillar.</p>

<title>Expression pattern analysis of <italic>Bm-mamo</italic></title>
<p>To analyze the expression profiles of <italic>Bm-mamo</italic>, we examined the quantitative RT–PCR. The different developmental stage expression level of <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene was investigated in the whole body from embryonic stage to adult stage in Dazao strain. The gene is highly expressed at molting stage of caterpillar and the expression was up-regulated in the later pupa and adult stage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">fig 3A</xref>). This suggests that the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene may respond to ecdysone titer and participate in the process of molting and metamorphosis of silkworm. In the investigation of tissue expression levels in the 5th instar 3rd day larvae of Dazao strain, the midgut, head, epidermis, have highly expression level, and the trachea, nerve, silk glands, testis, ovary, muscle, wing disc and malpighian tubules have moderate expression level, in blood and fat body were low expression level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">fig 3B</xref>). This result suggests that the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> may be involved in the development regulation of multiple tissues of silkworm. Due to the melanism of the epidermis of the <italic>bd</italic> mutant and the high expression level of <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene in the epidermis, we detected the expression level of this gene in the epidermis of the 4th to 5th instar of Dazao. In the temporal expression of epidermis, the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene was up regulated in the molting period, and the highest expression was at the beginning of molting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">fig 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Functional analyses of <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> for pigmentation</title>
<p>In order to study the function of the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene, we carried out RNAi experiment. Five microliter of siRNA were injected into haemolymph form stigma of day 3 of fourth instar, before the expression peak of <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> in larval stage, and conducted the electroporation experimental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, immediately. We found that there was significant melanin pigmentation in the epidermis of the newly molted 5th instar larvae.

The ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) formed by gRNA and recombinant Cas9 protein were injected into 450 silkworm embryos. Then, the phenotype identification and DNA cloning of the individuals of third generation were performed. In the G0 generation, individuals with mosaic melanization phenotype were found. These melanistic individuals were raised to moth and then crossed. The homozygous line of gene knockout was obtained through generations of screening.

<title>Downstream target gene analysis</title>
<p>Because <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> belongs to zinc finger proteins family, which specifically recognize downstream DNA sequences based on their zinc fingers. We have identified homologous genes of mamo in multiple species and conducted phylogenetic analysis (fig s5). In addition, by sequence alignment, found that the amino acid residues of the zinc finger motif of mamo-S protein are much conserved among 57 species, and the mamo-L protein are conserved among 30 species (fig s6). Then, we used a software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zf.princeton.edu">http://zf.princeton.edu)28</ext-link> to predict the DNA recognition sequence of <italic>Bm-mamo</italic>, especially the core sequence, GCGTG, which highly consistent with the binding sequence of mamo in those species (fig s7). Using the predicted position weight matrices (PWMs) of recognized sequences of Bm-mamo and FIMO (Find Individual Motif Occurences) software of MEME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> suit to perform whole genome scanning for possible downstream target gene.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Insects are known as one of the most successful populations in evolution, which evolved many important phenotypes in the process of adapting to the environment. Among these, color pattern is one of the most magnetic traits. The biochemical metabolic pathways of pigment, such as melanin, ommochrome, pteridine have been identified in insects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, the regulation of pigment metabolism related genes, and the process of transport and deposition of pigment substances is not clear. In this paper, we discover the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene negative regulate melanin pigmentation in caterpillar. When this gene is deficient, the body color of silkworm is signification melanism, changes in the expression of some melanin synthesis genes and some cuticular protein genes are also significant change.</p>
<p>Deficient of some genes in the melanin synthesis pathway can lead to variations in the color pattern, such as <italic>TH</italic>, <italic>yellow</italic>, <italic>ebony</italic>, <italic>tan</italic>, <italic>aaNAT</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. However, those often only lead to localized pigmentation changes in later instar caterpillar. For example, the <italic>yellow</italic> mutant of silkworm, which eye spot, lunar spot, star spot, spiracle plate, head, foot hook and some sclerotization area appears reddish brown, and the other epidermis is consistent with the wild-type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Why not exhibit a yellow phenotype in other parts of the larval epidermis? The possible reason is that, the expression of <italic>yellow</italic> is limited to a certain region by transcription regulator, or\and other factors, such as transporter, cuticular protein in the epidermis limit the pigmentation of melanin. Because, the biochemistry synthesized pigment substances need to be transported from epidermis cells and embedded into the cuticle to form coloring. Therefore, the correct location of cuticular protein in epidermis may be one of the important factors of pigmentation. Previous studies have shown that the lack of cuticular protein, CPH24, can lead to defects in pigmentation which supports this argument<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>How does cuticular protein affect pigmentation? Previous research finding that some cuticular proteins can form “pore canals” to transport some macromolecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In addition, some cuticular proteins can be crosslinked with catecholamines which synthesized by melanin metabolism pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Because of no live cell in cuticle, melanin precursor substances may be transported by pore canals, formed by some cuticular proteins, and fixed to specific positions through cross-linking with some cuticular proteins. The cuticular protein, CPR4, high expression in black individuals of <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> knockout line, is required for formation of pore canals in <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In addition, the vertical pore canal is lacking in less pigmented cuticles of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. This suggestion that the pore canals constructed by CPR4 may transport the pigments and contribute in epidermis pigmentation. Consequently, to maintain the accuracy of the color pattern, the localization of cuticular proteins in the epidermis may be very important. In one study of microarray analysis, it was found that there are different kinds of cuticular proteins in different colored areas of epidermis, in <italic>papilio xuthus</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. These ten cuticular protein genes were conserved in different insects (table s4). In addition, ten cuticular protein genes, which are highly expressed in the black stripes of <italic>papilio xuthus</italic> larvae, are also significantly up-regulated in <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> knockout lines of silkworm (fig s8). Therefore, we believe that the location of cuticular proteins and architecture of epidermis, the transport and cross-linking of pigments in cuticle, is the important bases for the formation of color patterns. Hence, the cuticular proteins and pigments metabolism are close cooperated by the uniformly regulated of transcription factors, such as <italic>Bm-mamo</italic>, thus forming color patterns in caterpillars.</p>
<p>In <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, the <italic>mamo</italic> is required for functional gamete production. In silkworm, the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> has conservative function in the female reproduction. Furthermore, the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> play an important role in regulation of color pattern of caterpillar. It is generally believed that the main reason for a conserved transcription factor to gain new functions is the evolution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (CREs) of target genes. Because CREs have important function in spatiotemporal expression pattern regulation of genes, and large number of them are located in the non-coding region, which are prone to sequence changes compared with the sequences of coding genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. In addition, transcription factors (TFs), because of them recognize relatively short sequences, generally between 4 and 20 bp in length, can have a large number of binding sites on the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore, one member of TFs has the potential to regulate almost all genes in one genome. For example, according to the PWM sequence of mamo protein recognize sequence, 10622 genes (∼73% of the total number of genes) contain the binding sites in 2 kb of their up/down stream region, in silkworm. If the core recognition sequence (GCGTG) of mamo protein is used to compare these genome regions, there were 13567 genes (∼93% of the total number of genes) contain the binding sites in 2 kb of their up/down stream region (table s5). And, such binding sites also exist in intron or/and beyond the 2 kb of their up/down stream region of the remaining 1056 genes. The shorter the recognition sequence, the more widespread it can be in the genome. However, in fact, there are not as many genes whose expression is significantly affected by the change of one TF as expected. Therefore, there are some transcription factors binding sites in a gene, but this gene not necessarily regulated by these factors. The possible reason is gene regulation network restricts the target gene set of regulatory factors by such as, whether the target chromatin is open or not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, interplay of TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and the participation of cofactors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We have noticed that a lepidopteran caterpillar has multiple visual factors in its skin, and even when its compound eyes are covered, it can rely on the skin to feel the color of the environment, so as to change its body color to adapt to the environment. This visual gene is common in many <italic>Lepidoptera</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. In the industrial melanism event, in a short period of several decades, the body colors of multiple of insects have changed significantly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. If we only rely on random mutations in the genome, it cannot be so swift.</p>
<p>We speculate that under the stimulation of the natural environment, caterpillars can distinguish the light wave frequency of the background, so that this signal can guide the epigenetic factors and transcription factors, turn on or off the expression of corresponding gene, such as pigment synthesis gene and cuticular protein genes, thus forming a body color pattern similar to the background. In addition, the BTB-ZF family member can participate in chromatin remodeling, and their zinc finger motifs can recognize DNA sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. During the opening of chromatin, the probability of mutation of exposed DNA sequence will increase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The transposon insertion occurs in a timely manner upstream of the <italic>cortex</italic> gene in the melanism <italic>Biston betularia</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, may be caused by the similar binding of transcription factors and opening of chromatin.</p>
<p>Therefore, we speculate that evolution of color pattern may be programmed events of the system, rather than relying on random mutations. Based on this assumption, animals can rapidly undergo phenotypic changes under the influence of the environment, and thus the speed of species evolution may be much faster than previous cognition.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study identifies the gene Bm-mamo as a new regulator of pigmentation in the silkworm Bombyx mori, a function that was previously unsuspected because the extensively studied Drosophila mamo gene is involved in gamete production. The evidence supporting the role of Bm-nano in pigmentation is <bold>convincing</bold>, including high-resolution linkage mapping of two mutant strains, expression profiling, and reproduction of the mutant phenotypes with state-of-the-art RNAi and CRISPR knock-out assays. The part of the work that concerns potential effector genes that Bm-mamo may regulate relies on in vitro and in silico analysis and can be used as a starting point for future in vivo studies. The work will be of interest to evolutionary biologists and geneticists interested in color patterns and in evolution of gene networks in general.</p>

<p>Summary: This paper performs fine-mapping of the silkworm mutants bd and its fertile allelic version, bdf, narrowing down the causal intervals to a small interval of a handful of genes. In this region, the gene orthologous to mamo is impaired by a large indel, and its function is later confirmed using expression profiling, RNAi, and CRISPR KO. All these experiments are convincingly showing that mamo is necessary for the suppression of melanic pigmentation in the silkworm larval integument.</p>
<p>The authors also use in silico and in vitro assays to probe the potential effector genes that mamo may regulate.</p>
<p>Strengths: The genotype-to-phenotype workflow, combining forward (mapping) and reverse genetics (RNAi and CRISPR loss-of-function assays) linking mamo to pigmentation are extremely convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The last section of the results, entitled &quot;Downstream target gene analysis&quot; is primarily based on in silico genome-wide binding motif predictions.</p>
<p>2. The last part of the current discussion (&quot;Notably, the industrial melanism event, in a short period of several decades ... a more advanced self-regulation program&quot;) is flawed with important logical shortcuts that assign &quot;agency&quot; to the evolutionary process. For instance, this section conveys the idea that phenotypically relevant mutations may not be random. I believe some of this is due to translation issues in English, as I understand that the authors want to express the idea that some parts of the genome are paths of least resistance for evolutionary change (e.g. the regulatory regions of developmental regulators are likely to articulate morphological change). But the language and tone is made worst by the mention that in another system, a mechanism involving photoreception drives adaptive plasticity, making it sound like the authors want to make a Lamarckian argument here (inheritance of acquired characteristics), or a point about orthogenesis (e.g. the idea that the environment may guide non-random mutations).</p>
<p>In any case, it is important to highlight here that while this manuscript is an excellent genotype-to-phenotype study, it has very few comparative insights on the evolutionary process. The finding that mamo is a pattern or pigment regulatory factor is interesting and will deserve many more studies to decipher the full evolutionary study behind this Gene Regulatory Network.</p>
<p>Minor Comment :</p>
<p>The gene models presented in Figure 1 are obsolete, as there are more recent annotations of the Bm-mamo gene that feature more complete intron-exon structures, including for the neighboring genes in the bd/bdf intervals. It remains true that the mamo locus encodes two protein isoforms.</p>
<p>
An example of the Bm-mamo locus annotation, can be found at : <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/101738295">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/101738295</ext-link></p>
<p>
RNAseq expression tracks (including from larval epidermis) can be displayed in the embedded genome browser from the link above using the &quot;Configure Tracks&quot; tool.</p>
<p>Based on these more recent annotations, I would say that most of the work on the two isoforms remains valid, but FigS2, and particularly Fig.S2C, need to be revised.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors tried to identify new genes involved in melanin metabolism and its spatial distribution in the silkworm Bombyx mori. They identified the gene Bm-mamo as playing a role in caterpillar pigmentation. By functional genetic and in silico approaches, they identified putative target genes of the Bm-mamo protein. They showed that numerous cuticular proteins are regulated by Bm-mamo during larval development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
-preliminary data about the role of cuticular proteins to pattern the localization of pigments</p>
<p>
- timely question</p>
<p>
- challenging question because it requires the development of future genetic and cell biology tools at the nanoscale</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- statistical sampling limited</p>
<p>
- the discussion would gain in being shorter and refocused on a few points, especially the link between cuticular proteins and pigmentation. The article would be better if the last evolutionary-themed section of the discussion is removed.</p>
<p>A recent paper has been published on the same gene in Bombyx mori (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965174823000760">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965174823000760</ext-link>) in August 2023. The authors must discuss and refer to this published paper through the present manuscript.</p>
