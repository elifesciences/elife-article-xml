<title>Abstract</title><p>Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an endogenous inhibitor of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and plays an important role in pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism by which PGE2 inhibits GSIS. Our results showed that PGE2 inhibited Kv2.2 channels via increasing PKA activity in HEK293T cells overexpressed with Kv2.2 channels. Point mutation analysis demonstrated that S448 residue was responsible for the PKA-dependent modulation of Kv2.2. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 was blocked by EP2/4 receptor antagonists, while mimicked by EP2/4 receptor agonists. The immune fluorescence results showed that EP1-EP4 receptors are expressed in both mouse and human β-cells. In INS-1(832/13) β-cells, PGE2 inhibited voltage-gated potassium currents and electrical activity through EP2/4 receptors and Kv2.2 channels. Knockdown of Kv2.2 reduced the action potential firing frequency and alleviated the inhibition of PGE2 on GSIS in INS-1(832/13) β-cells. PGE2 impaired glucose tolerance in wild-type mice but did not alter glucose tolerance in Kv2.2 knockout mice. Knockout of Kv2.2 reduced electrical activity, GSIS and abrogated the inhibition of PGE2 on GSIS in mouse islets. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PGE2 inhibits GSIS in pancreatic β-cells through the EP2/4-Kv2.2 signaling pathway. The findings highlight the significant role of Kv2.2 channels in the regulation of β-cell repetitive firing and insulin secretion, and contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of β-cell dysfunction in diabetes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is the major prostaglandin formed in pancreatic islets and is closely related to islet β-cell dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Meng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Oshima, Taketo, &amp; Oshima, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Vennemann et al., 2012</xref>). As an endogenous inhibitor of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), PGE2 plays an important role in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carboneau, Breyer, &amp; Gannon, 2017</xref>). PGE2 has been demonstrated to inhibit GSIS in both mouse models of T2DM and in pancreatic islets obtained from human organ donors with T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kimple et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Neuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Parazzoli et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies have shown that plasma levels of PGE2 are correlated with T2DM status, and it has the potential to be a marker of T2DM status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fenske et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Truchan et al., 2021</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism for the PGE2 inhibition of GSIS is not fully understood.</p>
<p>PGE2 functions through the activation of four specific G protein coupled receptor subtypes, termed EP1-4. The EP1 receptor couples to G<sub>q</sub> and causes an intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase. The EP2 and EP4 receptors couple to G<sub>s</sub> to increase intracellular cAMP formation, while the EP3 receptor couples to G<sub>i</sub> to decrease intracellular cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sugimoto &amp; Narumiya, 2007</xref>). The mRNA expression of all four EP receptors is found in rat, mouse, and human pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bramswig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tran, Gleason, &amp; Robertson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Vennemann et al., 2012</xref>). Among all EP receptors, the EP3 receptor has attracted widespread attention due to its high expression on β-cells in diabetic mouse models (elevated more than 40 times compared to non-diabetic mice)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kimple et al., 2013</xref>). Currently, it is considered the primary effector for PGE2 in GSIS. Islets from diabetic BTBR mice exhibit increased GSIS when treated with the EP3 antagonist L-798106, and show decreased GSIS after treated with the EP3 agonist PGE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shridas, Zahoor, Forrest, Layne, &amp; Webb, 2014</xref>). However, increasing evidence suggests that EP3 plays a role only in insulin secretion under T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carboneau et al., 2017</xref>). In human islets from non-diabetic donors, the EP3 antagonist L-798106 does not affect GSIS, but improves insulin secretion in islets from donors with T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kimple et al., 2013</xref>). Ceddia et al. reported that the EP3 antagonist DG-041 does not affect GSIS in islets from non-diabetic human or wild-type mice on a chow diet, and that global gene knockout of EP3 in mice does not alter GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ceddia et al., 2016</xref>).The impact of the PGE2 signaling pathway on nondiabetic β-cell function remains unclear. Moreover, the roles of EP1, EP2, and EP4 receptors in GSIS are rarely reported.</p>
<p>Pancreatic β-cells are electrical excitable. GSIS is associated with a complex electrical activity, which is regulated by various voltage-gated plasmalemmal ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Braun et al., 2008</xref>; S. N. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). The Kv2 channel family, which consists of Kv2.1 and Kv2.2, plays a crucial role in modulating neural excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu &amp; Bean, 2014</xref>). The effect of Kv2.1 channels on insulin secretion has been well studied. In rodents, Kv2.1 is recognized as the primary facilitator of delayed rectifier potassium currents in β-cells. Suppressing Kv2.1 results in heightened glucose-stimulated membrane potential amplitude, consequently enhancing GSIS in mouse pancreatic β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jacobson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">MacDonald et al., 2002</xref>). However, Kv2.1 inhibitor stromatoxin shows little effect on human β-cell electrical function or insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Braun et al., 2008</xref>), despite the presence of Kv2.1 protein in human islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tamarina, Kuznetsov, Fridlyand, &amp; Philipson, 2005</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that Kv2.1 regulates insulin secretion through channel clusters independently of its electrical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Greitzer-Antes et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies have shown that human islet β-cells express both Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 channels, with much higher levels of Kv2.2 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Blodgett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fu et al., 2017</xref>). Jensen et al. reported that Kv2.2 expression is also involved in GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jensen et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, the functions of the Kv2.2 channel in the <italic>in vivo</italic> physiology of islet β-cells have not been definitively established.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the role of EP1-4 receptors and Kv2.2 in the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells and Kv2.2 knockout mice. Our findings indicate that: 1) PGE2 reduces Kv2.2 currents via the EP2/4-PKA signaling pathway; 2) PGE2 inhibits β-cell electrical activity through Kv2.2 channels; 3) Knockout of Kv2.2 channels abrogates the PGE2 induced inhibition of GSIS. These results suggest that EP2/4 receptors and Kv2.2 channels play crucial regulatory roles in the normal physiological secretion of insulin.</p>

<title>PGE2 inhibits Kv2.2 currents via the EP2/EP4 signaling pathway in HEK293T cells</title>
<p>We initially conducted experiments to assess the impact of PGE2 on Kv2.2 channels. Kv2.2 channels were overexpressed in HEK293T cells, and Kv2.2 currents were elicited by a 200-ms depolarization pulse from -80 to +40 mV. Extracellular application of 10 μM PGE2 significantly inhibited Kv2.2 currents. This inhibition was rapid, reaching its maximum effect in approximately 6 minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). The inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 is dose-dependent, with the maximum effect at around 10 μM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Therefore, we used 10 μM PGE2 for the subsequent experiments. The I-V curve demonstrated that PGE2 significantly inhibited Kv2.2 currents at all positive testing potentials above +20 mV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Moreover, 10 μM PGE2 did not alter the steady-state activation and inactivation properties of Kv2.2 currents (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E and F</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we investigated the mechanism of PGE2 inhibition on Kv2.2 channels. PGE2 functions by activating EP1-4 receptors. We investigated the mRNA and protein expression profiles of EP receptors in HEK293T cells. The mRNAs for all four EP receptors were detected in HEK293T cells, with notably higher levels observed for EP2 and EP4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Furthermore, immunofluorescence results confirmed the presence of protein expression for EP1-EP4 receptors in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). To determine which EP receptor is responsible for the PGE2-induced inhibition, we applied SC51089 (10 μM, the EP1 receptor antagonist) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhou, Qian, Chou, &amp; Iadecola, 2008</xref>), AH6809 (20 μM, the EP2 receptor antagonist) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Srinivasalu et al., 2020</xref>), L798106 (10 μM, the EP3 receptor antagonist) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Corboz et al., 2021</xref>), and AH23848 (20 μM, the EP4 receptor antagonist)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">He et al., 2021</xref>) to the extracellular solution to selectively inhibit the respective EP receptors. The acute application of the four antagonists alone had no effect on Kv2.2 currents (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Pretreatment with SC51089 and L798106 for 10 min did not alter the PGE2-induced inhibition. However, pretreatment with AH6809 and AH23848 partially blocked the PGE2-induced inhibition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D and E</xref>). Furthermore, the EP2 receptor agonist Butaprost (20 μM) and the EP4 receptor agonist CAY10598 (20 μM) both inhibited Kv2.2 currents (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F and G</xref>). These results suggest that PGE2 inhibits Kv2.2 via EP2/EP4 signaling pathway.</p>

<title>PGE2 inhibits Kv2.2 currents via the PKA signaling pathway in HEK293T cells</title>
<p>The EP2 and EP4 receptors couple to Gs, increasing intracellular cAMP formation and activating the PKA signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sugimoto &amp; Narumiya, 2007</xref>). We investigated whether PGE2 regulates Kv2.2 via PKA. Treatment with 10 μM PGE2 rapidly increased PKA activity in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The PKA activator, Db-cAMP, could mimic the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 channels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The PKA inhibitor, Rp-cAMP, had no effect on Kv2.2 currents (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). However, pre-incubation with Rp-cAMP blocked the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 channels in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). These findings illustrate that PGE2 inhibits Kv2.2 currents through the PKA signaling pathway.</p>

<p>We further investigated whether PKA regulates Kv2.2 currents via direct phosphorylation of the channel. The Kv2.2 channel protein contains approximately nine putative phosphorylation sites that conform to the minimal consensus sequence for PKA, according to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scansite4.mit.edu">https://scansite4.mit.edu</ext-link>. The positions of the nine sites are depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>. To identify the specific site responsible for PKA regulation of Kv2.2 channels, we introduced mutations in the amino acid sequence. We replaced all nine amino acids with aspartic acid to mimic the PKA phosphorylation state of Kv2.2 channels. Among the nine mutations, only the S448D mutation yielded a significant reduction in Kv2.2 currents (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Notably, the S448D mutation also abrogated the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). To further confirm the role of the S448 site in PGE2-induced inhibition of Kv2.2, we also conducted a mutation, changing S448 to alanine (S448A). This mutation effectively prevented the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 currents (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). These data indicate that the S448 site is responsible for the PGE2-induced inhibition of Kv2.2 currents.</p>

<p>To assess the contribution of Kv2.2 channels to the PGE2-induced inhibition in INS-1(832/13) cells, we knocked down the expression of Kv2.2 using shRNA. The efficiency of the two shRNAs, named KD1-Kv2.2 and KD2-Kv2.2, were first evaluated in HEK293T cells overexpressing Kv2.2. KD2-Kv2.2 showed higher efficiency than KD1-Kv2.2 and was selected for subsequent experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Knockdown of Kv2.2 by KD2-Kv2.2 significantly reduced endogenous K<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) in INS-1(832/13) cells, and abrogated PGE2-induced inhibition of K<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E and F</xref>).

<title>PGE2 reduces electrical activity via Kv2.2 channels in INS-1(832/13) cells</title>
<p>GSIS is associated with β-cell electrical activity, which is regulated by Kv2 potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Drews, Krippeit-Drews, &amp; Dufer, 2010</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether PGE2 affects β-cell electrical activity. We found that 10 μM PGE2 reduced action potential (AP) frequency and increased AP half-width in INS-1(832/13) cells with little effect on the peak amplitude of AP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of Kv2.2 with Kv2.2-specific shRNA abrogated PGE2-induced effect on INS-1(832/13) cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). This suggests that PGE2 reduces electrical activity via Kv2.2 channels in INS-1(832/13) cells. Since PGE2 inhibits Kv2.2 via EP2/4 receptors, it is plausible to hypothesize that PGE2 reduces electrical activity via EP2/4 receptors in INS-1(832/13) cells. To test the hypothesis, we first investigated the expression of EP receptors in INS-1(832/13) cells. Immunofluorescence results revealed that all EP1-EP4 receptors are expressed in INS-1(832/13) cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). In addition, both mouse and human islet β-cells were found to express all four EP receptors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>).

This indicates that PGE2 reduces electrical activity via EP2/4 in INS-1(832/13) cells.</p>

<p>To investigate the physiological role of Kv2.2 during GSIS <italic>in vivo</italic>, a mouse model was utilized in which the Kv2.2 coding gene is disrupted at exon 2 (Supplemental Fig. S1A). The targeting cassette removes 446 bp in exon 2 of the Kv2.2 coding gene sequence. The disrupted sequence is detected using PCR to produce one amplicon with one primer inside the targeting sequence in combination with one Kv2.2 specific primer outside the targeting sequence (Supplemental Fig. S1A). The Kv2.2 protein was detected only in wild-type islets using a Kv2.2-specific antibody (Supplemental Fig. S1B). The body weight of the Kv2.2 knockout mice was similar to that of the wild-type littermates (Supplemental Fig. S1C). Kv2.2<sup>−/−</sup> mice were assessed for possible impairment in glucose homeostasis using an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. Kv2.2<sup>−/−</sup> mice had similar fasting blood glucose levels with control group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>).

<p>Even though the previous study reported that the EP2 protein-encoding gene <italic>Ptger2</italic> was not identified by RNA-seq in mouse islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ku et al., 2012</xref>). Other studies have shown that the mRNA expression of all four EPs is observed in rat, mouse, and human pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bramswig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tran et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Vennemann et al., 2012</xref>). In our current study, we provide evidence demonstrating the presence of protein expression for all four types of PGE2 receptors in both human and mouse pancreatic β-cells. In comparison to EP3, our knowledge of the impact of EP1, EP2, and EP4 on insulin secretion is currently limited. Tran et al. have reported that the EP1 antagonist fails to impede the inhibitory effects of IL-1β on GSIS in isolated rat islets. EP3 agonists, such as misoprostol or sulprostone, decrease GSIS through Gi proteins in rat islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tran et al., 2002</xref>). A recent study has unveiled that the activation of Gi/o protein-coupled receptors leads to the stimulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase. This stimulation, in turn, hyperpolarizes the membrane potential of β-cells, consequently suppressing β-cell electrical excitability and insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dickerson et al., 2022</xref>). Consequently, one would anticipate that PGE2 activates Gi protein-coupled EP3 receptors, thereby inhibiting insulin secretion through membrane potential hyperpolarization and the reduction of β-cell electrical excitability. Surprisingly, no alterations in β-cell membrane potential were observed following PGE2 treatments. We found that PGE2 inhibits Kv2.2 channels and electroactivity of β-cells via G<sub>s</sub>-coupled EP2/4 receptors instead of EP3 receptors. PGE2 is likely to predominantly exert its effects via the EP2/4 receptors in normal β-cells. However, in instances of established β-cell dysfunction, such as in T2DM, it appears that PGE2 may act through the upregulated EP3 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kimple et al., 2013</xref>). This study found that activating either EP2 or EP4 receptors can inhibit Kv2.2 channels, and further research is needed to determine which receptor is the primary regulatory factor for GSIS.</p>
<p>Both Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 contribute to the delayed outward K<sup>+</sup> current in human β-cells, and their mRNA expression in diabetic islets is lower than that in non-diabetic islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fu et al., 2017</xref>). Kv2.1 channels in cell membrane exist in two forms: clustered and non-clustered. Non-clustered Kv2.1 channels conduct K<sup>+</sup> normally, while clustered Kv2.1 channels are barely conductive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fox, Loftus, &amp; Tamkun, 2013</xref>). A recent study has shown that Kv2.1 channels form clusters in INS-1(832/13) cells and human β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fu et al., 2017</xref>). Kv2.1-mediated insulin exocytosis requires Kv2.1 clustering and a direct interaction with syntaxin 1A but is not dependent on its electrical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fu et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the findings of the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jensen et al., 2013</xref>), we observed a significant reduction in GSIS in INS-1(832/13) cells upon knockdown of Kv2.2. Moreover, knockout of Kv2.2 also reduced GSIS in mouse islets. Kv2.2 channels play a crucial role in maintaining repetitive AP firing by promoting the recovery of voltage-gated sodium channels from inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnston et al., 2008</xref>). Inhibition of Kv2.2 channels significantly reduces the repetitive firing in medial nucleus of the trapezoid body neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnston et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). In the present study, we found that the major effect of PGE2-induced inhibition of Kv2.2 is to reduce the firing rate in β-cells, suggesting that Kv2.2 plays a key role in the β-cell repetitive firing upon stimulation. The PGE2-induced reduction in β-cell repetitive firing would decrease calcium channel opening, and thus, insulin secretion. Importantly, our findings pertain to physiological conditions, and while we demonstrate the inhibitory effects of PGE2 on Kv2.2 channels in normal β-cells, the role of this pathway under diabetic conditions requires further investigation and will be the focus of future studies</p>
<p>In summary, this study uncovers a previously unknown role of the EP2/4-PKA-Kv2.2 signaling pathway in the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on GSIS in normal β-cells. This provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between prostaglandins, potassium channels, and insulin secretion, contributing to our understanding of pancreatic islet function and potential implications for diabetes mellitus.</p>

<title>Generation of Kv2.2 knockout mice</title>
<p>The Kv2.2 channel coding gene, KCNB2 (Accession: NM_001098528.3), underwent conventional knockout using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Two guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed to target the KCNB2 gene. The sequences for the gRNAs are as follows: gRNA1: GAGAGTTAAGATCAACGTAG; gRNA2: AACTCGTCCGTGGCTGCAAA. The Cas9 protein was prepared and complexed with the two synthesized gRNAs to form ribonucleoprotein complexes. Ribonucleoprotein complexes were microinjected to fertilized C57BL/6 mouse oocytes to induce double-strand breaks at the KCNB2 gene target sites. The microinjected embryos were cultured in vitro to the appropriate developmental stage and then transferred into the oviducts or uteruses of pseudo pregnant recipient female mice. The recipient females gave birth to F<sub>0</sub> offspring. Genotyping of F<sub>0</sub> Mice: DNA was extracted from the tail tips of the F<sub>0</sub> mice. PCR was performed using two pairs of primers to amplify the regions flanking the target sites of the KCNB2 gene. The primer sequences are as follows: F1: TGATGTGGCGATGCCTATTCC; R1: TTCCCACAGACTAACACTTACGG; R2: TCTTCTGATGGTATCTGGCTTGG. The PCR products were purified and sequenced to confirm the knockout of the KCNB2 gene. Mice confirmed to have the desired KCNB2 gene knockout were bred to produce a stable line of KCNB2 conventional knockout mice for further studies. The KCNB2 knockout mouse was created by Cyagen Biosciences (Suzhou, China). All animals were accommodated in specific pathogen-free Fudan University facilities following a 12-hour light-dark cycle.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigated the mechanism by which PGE2 inhibits the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells in response to glucose. The researchers used a combination of cell line experiments and studies in mice with genetic ablation of the Kv2.2 channel. Their findings suggest a novel pathway where PGE2 acts through EP2/EP4 receptors to activate PKA, which directly phosphorylates a specific site (S448) on the Kv2.2 channel, inhibiting its activity and reducing GSIS.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The study elegantly demonstrates a potential pathway connecting PGE2, EP2/EP4 receptors, PKA, and Kv2.2 channel activity, using embryonic cell line.</p>
<p>- Additional experiments in INS1 and primary mouse beta cells with altered Kv2.2 function partially support the inhibitory role of PGE2 on GSIS through Kv2.2 inhibition.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- A critical limitation is the use of HEK293T cells, which are not pancreatic beta cells. Functional aspects can differ significantly between these cell types.</p>
<p>- The study needs to address the apparent contradiction of PKA activating insulin secretion in beta cells, while also inhibiting GSIS through the proposed mechanism.</p>
<p>- A more thorough explanation is needed for the discrepancies observed between the effects of PGE2 versus Kv2.2 knockdown/mutation on the electrical activity of beta cells and GSIS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your positive evaluation and constructive feedback on our study. We appreciate the concern regarding the use of HEK293T cells, which are not pancreatic beta cells and may exhibit functional differences. In response, we have repeated our key experiments using INS1 cells and primary mouse beta cells, which are more representative of the native beta cell environment. These additional experiments confirm our hypothesis and further support the role of Kv2.2 in PGE2-induced inhibition of GSIS. In beta cells, glucose-induced PKA activation is highly localized. As a result, while some PKA pathways promote insulin secretion, others may inhibit it. To directly demonstrate that PGE2-induced PKA phosphorylation of Kv2.2 is involved in the inhibitory effect on GSIS, we overexpressed the S448A mutant Kv2.2 channel in INS-1(832/13) cells. Our results show that Kv2.2-S448A channels significantly attenuate the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on GSIS, further supporting the critical role of Kv2.2 phosphorylation at S448. These data have been added to the revised Figure 7C.</p>

<p>Thank you for your positive evaluation and insightful comment. We have clarified in the Discussion section that our findings pertain specifically to physiological conditions. We acknowledge the importance of investigating the signaling pathway in a pathological context and plan to conduct experiments using a diabetes model in future studies to explore how this pathway may differ under such conditions.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Figure 3A-C: PKA activation regulates different functional aspects in beta cells and HEK293T cells. It is well known that PKA activation enhances insulin secretion in beta cells, therefore the mechanisms that allow the same pathway at the same time to inhibit GSIS are not clear and should be addressed by experiments in beta cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comment. Specificity and versatility in cAMP-PKA signaling are governed by the spatial localization and temporal dynamics of the signal. In beta cells, glucose-induced PKA activation is highly localized (Tengholm and Gylfe, 2017). As a result, while some PKA pathways promote insulin secretion, others may inhibit it. For example, a global increase in cAMP, such as through treatment with Db-cAMP, can simultaneously activate both stimulatory and inhibitory PKA pathways, reflecting a more integrated, complex response. In previous studies, 1 mM Db-cAMP was shown to enhance GSIS in INS-1 cells (Dezaki et al., 2011). We observed that 1 mM Db-cAMP increased GSIS, but lower concentrations (10 mM) decreased GSIS (as shown in Author response image 1). These findings suggest that not all PKA signaling events increase GSIS. To further investigate the role of PGE2-induced PKA phosphorylation of Kv2.2 in the inhibition of GSIS, we overexpressed the S448A mutant of Kv2.2 in INS-1 (832/13) cells. Our results showed that the Kv2.2-S448A mutant significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on GSIS. These new data have been incorporated into the revised Figure 7C.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 3G: One would expect that the phospho-mimetic mutation, S448D, will have an opposite effect to S448A and a similar effect as PGE2 or PKA activator in Figure 3B. There is no explanation by the authors for having the same effect in S448A and S448D.</p>

<p>Thank you for your thoughtful comment. Indeed, the S448D mutation exhibited a similar effect to PGE2 on Kv2.2 channels, as we observed significantly smaller currents compared to wild-type Kv2.2 (Figure 3F). The S448D mutation mimics the phosphorylated state of S448, and since PGE2 regulates Kv2.2 channels by phosphorylating this residue, it has no further effect on the S448D mutant (Figure 3G). In contrast, the S448A mutation prevents phosphorylation at this site, which explains why PGE2 has no effect on the currents of S448A mutant Kv2.2 channels (Figure 3H). These results confirm that PGE2 modulates Kv2.2 channels specifically through phosphorylation of S448, as evidenced by the lack of effect on both the S448A and S448D mutants.</p>

<p>(3) Figure 4E: Since both PGE2 and Kv2.2 KD inhibit the activity of the channel, it doesn't definitively prove whether PGE2 acts through Kv2.2 in INS-1 cells. A complementary experiment should be done in which overactivation of Kv2.2 rescues the effect of PGE2. For example, with the S448A form of the channel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your comment and valuable suggestion. Knockdown of Kv2.2 abrogated the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on I<sub>K</sub> currents in INS-1 cells (Figure 4E and F), which strongly indicates that PGE2 acts through Kv2.2. While we agree that the suggested complementary experiment with Kv2.2 overactivation (e.g., using the S448A mutant) could provide additional insights, we believe the current data sufficiently support our conclusion, as the knockdown of Kv2.2 eliminates the observed PGE2 effect, providing direct evidence of the channel's involvement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 5C: This result requires further explanation. If PGE2 downregulates Kv2.2 activity and has an inhibitory effect on GSIS, why does Kv2.2 KD have the opposite effect?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The knockdown of Kv2.2 (Fig. 5C) reduced action potential (AP) firing rates compared to the scramble control (Fig. 5B), which is expected because Kv2.2 is critical for maintaining AP firing. When Kv2.2 is knocked down, the reduced AP firing diminishes the system’s responsiveness to further modulation by PGE2. This is because PGE2 exerts its effects primarily through Kv2.2 channels. Therefore, in the Kv2.2 knockdown condition, PGE2 does not exert an additional inhibitory effect on AP firing rates, as the channels critical for its action are already impaired.</p>

<p>(5) Figure 5D - The EP1-EP4 receptor antibodies should be validated at least in INS-1(832/13) cells using knockdowns.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have validated the EP1-EP4 receptor antibodies in INS-1(832/13) cells using knockdown experiments. The validation results, including confirmation of specificity and knockdown efficiency, are provided in Supplemental Figure S2.</p>

<p>(6) Figure 7B - These experiments don't necessarily prove that PGE2 acts directly through Kv2.2 inhibition. Using the S448A mutation in these experiments could prove this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this valuable suggestion. We have now overexpressed the S448A mutant Kv2.2 channels in INS-1(832/13) cells, and the results demonstrate that Kv2.2-S448A channels significantly reduce the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on GSIS. These new data have been incorporated into the revised Figure 7C.</p>

<p>(1) Deficiencies and inaccuracies in the description of the methods (animal numbers, name of vendors, abbreviations) and the typos in the figures (axis label) require correction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have carefully reviewed the manuscript and the figures, making the necessary corrections to address the deficiencies in the methods section and the typos in the figure axis labels.</p>

<p>(2) Reducing the number of figures (Figures 7/C-E: knockout mouse line test and Figure1/HEK cell experiments could be part of supplementary) and paragraphs would make the manuscript more compact and powerful. It would also ease its reading for non-experts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have moved Figures 7C-E to the supplementary data (Supplemental Figure S1) to streamline the main manuscript.</p>

<p>(3) Multiple immunostainings for EP receptors in insulinoma cells or pancreatic islets would be representative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Due to the rabbit-derived nature of the antibodies (EP1, EP2, EP4), performing multiple immunostainings on the same samples is not feasible due to potential cross-reactivity. However, the immunohistochemistry images demonstrate that each antibody labels more than 90% of the cells, indicating that β-cell express different subtypes of EP receptors simultaneously.</p>

<p>(4) The antagonists chosen (AH6809, AH23848) are non-specific. Experiments should be re-run (at least some) under more stringent conditions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. AH6809 and AH23848 are well-documented, widely used antagonists in the literature. To further strengthen our findings, we have included additional, widely-used antagonists: the EP2-specific antagonist TG4155 and the EP4-specific antagonist GW627368. The results obtained with these new antagonists were consistent with those observed using AH6809 and AH23848. These updated data are now included in the revised Figure 4I and 4J.</p>

<p>(5) It would be very helpful to indeed emphasise that this work is for physiological conditions and that it is (or is not) modified in diabetes. Maybe even irrelevant for diabetes (?). This needs to be clarified and supported by data even if one could assume the authors intend to have a follow-up entirely dedicated to pathological changes, perhaps.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this insightful comment. We have clarified in the Discussion that our findings are specific to physiological conditions. To address this point, we have added the following statement:</p>
<p>&quot;Importantly, our findings pertain to physiological conditions. While we demonstrate the inhibitory effects of PGE2 on Kv2.2 channels in normal b-cells, the role of this pathway under diabetic conditions remains to be investigated and will be the focus of future studies.&quot;</p>
