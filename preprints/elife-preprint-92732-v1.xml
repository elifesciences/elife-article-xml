<title>Abstract</title><p>During mammalian oocyte meiosis, spindle migration and asymmetric cytokinesis are unique steps for the successful polar body extrusion. The asymmetry defects of oocytes will lead to the failure of fertilization and embryo implantation. In present study we reported that an actin nucleating factor formin-like 2 (FMNL2) played critical roles in the regulation of spindle migration and organelle distribution. Our results showed that FMNL2 mainly localized at the oocyte cortex and periphery of spindle. Depletion of FMNL2 led to the failure of polar body extrusion and large polar bodies in oocytes. Live-cell imaging revealed that the spindle failed to migrate to the oocyte cortex, which caused polar body formation defects, and this might be due to the decreased polymerization of cytoplasmic actin by FMNL2 depletion. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicated that FMNL2 was associated with mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum-related proteins, and FMNL2 depletion disrupted the function and distribution of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, showing with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and the occurrence of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Microinjecting Fmnl2-EGFP mRNA into FMNL2-depleted oocytes significantly rescued these defects. Thus, our results indicate that FMNL2 is essential for the actin assembly, which further involves into meiotic spindle migration and ER/mitochondria functions in mouse oocytes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammalian oocyte maturation is an asymmetric division process that generates a large egg and a small polar body. This asymmetry is critical for the following fertilization and early embryo development. After germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), the meiotic spindle is organized at the center of the oocyte, and then it migrates to the oocyte cortex at the late metaphase I (MI). The oocytes are arrested at metaphase II (MII) after the extrusion of first polar body (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>). Actin filaments, as the most widely distributed cytoskeleton in cells, regulate various dynamic events during oocyte meiotic maturation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic>), and two key events are the spindle migration and cortical reorganization in mammalian oocytes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></italic>). Small GTPases and actin nucleation factors are shown to promote the assembly and function of actin. The actin nucleation factors are the molecules that directly promote the actin assembly: Arp2/3 complex control the assembly of branched actin, and formin family member Formin2 (FMN2) and Spire1/2 control the assembly of linear actin. These proteins are all proposed to play a role in actin-related spindle migration and cytokinesis during mammalian oocyte maturation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>). The cortex protein Arp2/3 complex nucleates the actin to produce a hydrodynamic force to move the spindle toward the cortex, and regulates cytokinesis during oocyte maturation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>). FMN2 and Spire1/2 nucleates actin around the spindle in the cytoplasm to give the meiotic spindle an initial power for migration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Besides Formin2, the DRFs (diaphanous-related formins) subfamily in the formin family has been extensively studied. The DRFs family consists of mDia, Daam, FHOD and FMNLs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></italic>). The “Formin-like” proteins (FMNLs) subfamily includes FMNL1 (FRL1), FMNL2 (FRL3), and FMNL3 (FRL2). Like other Formin family proteins, FMNLs play important roles in cell migration, cell division, and cell polarity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>). While FMNL2 is widely expressed in multiple human tissues, especially in the gastrointestinal and mammary epithelia, lymphatic tissues, placenta, and reproductive tract (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>). As an important actin assembly factor, FMNL2 accelerates the elongation of actin filaments branched by Arp2/3 complex (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). In invasive cells, FMNL2 is mainly localized in the leading edge of the cell, lamellipodia and filopodia tips, to improve cell migration ability by actin-based manner (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>). FMNL2 is also involved in the maintenance of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human colorectal carcinoma cell (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>). Besides its roles on the actin assembly, emerging evidences indicate that FMNL2 may interact with organelle dynamics. It is shown that FMNL2 is related with the Golgi apparatus, since the absence of FMNL2/3 can cause the Golgi fragmentation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></italic>). However, till now the roles of FMNLs especially FMNL2 on oocyte meiosis are still largely unknown.</p>
<p>In the present study, we disturbed the FMNL2 expression and explored the roles of FMNL2 during mouse oocyte meiosis. Our results showed that FMNL2 was essential for the polar body size control and successful extrusion; and these abnormal phenotypes might be due to aberrant actin-based meiotic spindle migration. Meanwhile, we also found that FMNL2 was essential for the functions and distribution of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, this study provided the evidence for the critical roles of FMNL2-mediated actin on spindle movement and organelle dynamics in mammalian oocytes.</p>

<title>Expression and subcellular localization of FMNL2 during mouse oocyte maturation</title>
<p>We first examined FMNL2 expression in mouse oocytes at different stages. The results indicated that FMNL2 all expressed in GV, MI and MII stages during mouse oocyte maturation (GV, 1; MI, 0.82 ± 0.07; MII, 0.61 ± 0.10, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, we performed Fmnl2-EGFP mRNA microinjection to examine the localization of FMNL2. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, FMNL2 accumulated at the oocyte cortex during the GV, GVBD and MI stages. Besides, FMNL2 also localized at the spindle periphery during GVBD and MI stages. At anaphase-telophase I stage (ATI), FMNL2 was mainly at the midbody. The FMNL2 antibody staining results also confirmed this localization pattern. We also co-stained FMNL2 antibody with actin, and the result showed that the signals of FMNL2 and actin overlapped at the cortex in oocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The FMNL2 localization pattern indicated that FMNL2 might interact with actin dynamics during oocyte meiosis.</p>

<title>FMNL2 is essential for polar body extrusion and asymmetric division in mouse oocytes</title>
<p>To investigate the functional roles of FMNL2 in mouse oocytes, we employed Fmnl2 siRNA microinjection to knockdown FMNL2 protein expression. A significant decrease of FMNL2 protein level was shown in FMNL2-KD oocytes compared to control group by western blot (1 vs. 0.48 ± 0.08, P &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We then examined first polar body extrusion, and the results showed that deleting FMNL2 disturbed first polar body extrusion, while a large proportion of oocytes showed big polar bodies among the oocytes which extruded polar bodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The quantitative results also confirmed this phenotype (rate of polar body extrusion: 74.26 ± 1.44%, n = 439 vs. 59.5 ± 2.82%, n = 398, P &lt; 0.001, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; rate of large polar bodies: 19.05 ± 1.97%, n = 311 vs. 37.16 ± 1.87%, n = 257, P &lt; 0.0001, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, live-cell imaging was used to determine the dynamic changes that occurred during oocyte maturation, and the results showed that the oocytes either failed to undergo cytokinesis or divided from the central axis of the oocytes and formed big polar bodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). To further confirm the phenotype, we performed FMNL2 rescue experiments by expressing exogenous Fmnl2 mRNA in FMNL2-depleted oocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), we found that exogenous Fmnl2 mRNA expression rescued first polar body extrusion and large polar body defects (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). The quantitative results also confirmed this phenotype (rate of polar body extrusion: 48.34 ± 4.2%, n = 355 vs. 62.62 ± 3.6%, n = 377, P &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>; rate of large polar bodies: 30.93 ± 2%, n = 193 vs. 9.58 ± 2.4%, n = 203, P &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). To testify whether the functions of FMNL2 were associated with other FMNLs, we also compared the polar body extrusion with the knock down of both FMNL2 and FMNL3, and the results showed that double knock down of FMNL2 and FMNL3 did not cause a severe polar body extrusion defects compared with the single knock down of FMNL2 (polar body extrusion, Control: 70.97 ± 1.23%, n=261 vs FMNL2+3-KD: 60.42 ± 2.99%, n=198, P &lt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>. Large polar body, Control: 10.85 ± 0.97%, n=172 vs FMNL2+3-KD: 32.90 ± 1.88%, n=118, P &lt; 0.001, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). These results suggested that FMNL2 played critical roles for the polar body extrusion and asymmetric division during mouse oocyte maturation.</p>

<title>FMNL2 regulates spindle migration during mouse oocyte maturation</title>
<p>To investigate the causes for polar body extrusion defects, we examined the spindle migration by time-lapse microscopy during oocyte meiosis. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, in the control oocyte, the meiotic spindle formed in the center of the oocyte after culture 8 h and moved to the oocyte cortex at 9.5h; and the polar body was extruded at 11-12h, with a spindle formed near the cortex at MII stage. However, in FMNL2-KD oocytes, two phenotypes were observed: 1) the meiotic spindle remained in the center of the oocyte until 10 h, and then the oocytes initiated the cytokinesis at 10.5 h but failed to extrude the polar body; 2) some oocytes with arrested spindles initiated the cytokinesis but extruded a big polar body (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This indicated the failure of spindle migration after FMNL2 depletion. We analyzed the rate of cortex-localized spindle in oocytes by cultured for 9.5 h, and the result showed that the rate of migrated spindles in control oocytes was significantly higher than that in FMNL2-KD oocytes (59.94 ± 3.42%, n = 78 vs. 38.97 ± 6.34%, n = 64, P &lt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We also performed FMNL2 rescue experiments. Supplementing with exogenous Fmnl2 rescued the spindle migration defects compared with the Fmnl2-depletion group (40.27 ± 3.19%, n = 181 vs. 57.01± 2.72%, n = 57, P &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggested that FMNL2 might be involved in spindle migration in mouse oocytes.</p>

<title>FMNL2 promotes cytoplasmic actin assembly during mouse oocyte maturation</title>
<p>As FMNL2 is a key actin assembly factor, we further investigated actin assembly after deleting FMNL2 in mouse oocytes. Surprisingly there was no significant difference for the signals of cortex actin was observed between control oocytes and FMNL2-KD oocytes, which was confirmed by the fluorescence intensity analysis (30.88 ± 1.10, n = 28 vs. 30.58 ± 1.12, n = 28, P &gt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). However, we found a significant decrease of cytoplasmic actin signals in the FMNL2-KD oocytes, and the statistical analysis for the cytoplasmic actin fluorescent signals also confirmed our findings (58.25 ± 2.05, n = 26 vs. 37.92 ± 2.02, n = 24, P &lt; 0.0001, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, the rescue experiments showed that exogenous Fmnl2 rescued the decrease of cytoplasmic actin filaments compared with the Fmnl2-depletion group (37.98 ± 1.98, n = 16 vs. 54.72± 2.88, n = 15, P &lt; 0.0001, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). We next explored how FMNL2 regulates cytoplasmic actin assembly in oocytes. By mass spectrometry analysis we found there were several actin-related potential candidates which might be related with FMNL2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation results showed that FMNL2 precipitated Arp2 and Formin2 but not Profilin and fascin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). To further verify the correlation between FMNL2 and Arp2 and Formin2, we then examined Arp2 and Formin2 protein expression after FMNL2 knockdown. The results showed Arp2 protein expression increased significantly after FMNL2 knockdown (1 vs. 1.56 ± 0.07, P &lt; 0.001, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) but decreased after FMNL2 knockdown (1 vs. 0.62 ± 0.04, P &lt; 0.001, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).

<title>FMNL2 regulates endoplasmic reticulum distribution during mouse oocyte maturation</title>
<p>The mass spectrometry analysis data indicated that several ER-related potential candidates which might be related with FMNL2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), while INF2, a typical protein which mediates actin polymerization at ER showed high confidence level. We then examined the relationship between FMNL2 and INF2, and the co-immunoprecipitation results showed that FMNL2 precipitated INF2 and INF2 also precipitated FMNL2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that FMNL2 interacted with INF2 in mouse oocytes. We then examined the ER distribution in FMNL2-KD oocytes. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, in control oocytes the ER evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and accumulated at the spindle periphery in MI stage; however, ER agglomerated in cytoplasm in FMNL2-KD oocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The statistical analysis showed that the abnormal distribution of ER increased significantly in the FMNL2-KD group (28.91 ± 5.62, n = 27 vs. 59.64 ± 6.95, n = 28, P &lt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The localization pattern of ER indicated its functions might be disturbed. In FMNL2-KD oocytes, we found the expressions of ER-stress related proteins Grp78 and Chop were significantly increased (Grp78: 1 vs. 1.42 ± 0.12, P &lt; 0.05; Chop: 1 vs. 1.53 ± 0.16, P &lt; 0.05. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating the occurrence of ER stress.

<title>FMNL2 regulates mitochondrial distribution during mouse oocyte maturation</title>
<p>As INF2 is also related to the mitochondrial connection of ER, we further screened up the mass spectrometry analysis data and we found many mitochondria-related potential candidates which might be related with FMNL2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Therefore, we further examined the distribution of mitochondria in FMNL2-KD oocytes. In control oocytes, the mitochondria evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and accumulated at the spindle periphery in MI stage; however, in FMNL2-KD oocytes, mitochondria presented clumped aggregation distribution in cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). We counted the number of clumps and found that the uniform distribution of mitochondria decreased significantly in the FMNL2-KD group (59.66 ± 8.48, n = 31 vs. 20.83 ± 4.17, n = 32, P &lt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). A large number of FMNL2-KD oocytes agglomerated into one to three clumps (22.73± 4.27, n = 31 vs. 42.50 ± 1.25, n = 32, P &lt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Supplementing with exogenous Fmnl2 rescued the mitochondria distribution (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), the statistical analysis showed that the uniform distribution of mitochondria increased significantly in the rescue group (36.49 ± 3.97, n = 53 vs. 53.90 ± 2.09, n = 79, P &lt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). We also examined mitochondrial membrane potential, and the results showed that FMNL2 depletion caused the alterations of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by JC-1 staining. The fluorescence intensity of JC-1 red channel was decreased compared with the control group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we explored the functions of FMNL2 during mouse oocyte meiosis. Our results indicated that FMNL2 regulated actin-based spindle migration for asymmetric cell division of oocytes, and more importantly FMNL2 was critical for maintaining the distribution of the ER and mitochondria, which set up a link for actin-related spindle migration and organelle dynamics in oocytes.</p>
<p>As a subfamily of Formin family, FMNLs play an important role in regulating actin filaments (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>), while FMNL2 is most widely expressed in variety of cell models among the members of FMNLs. In this study, we showed that FMNL2 expressed in mouse oocytes and it mainly accumulated at the oocyte cortex and spindle periphery, which was similar with the actin distribution pattern in oocytes. This specific localization is also similar to FMN2, a well-studied factor in the formin family for spindle migration during oocyte meiosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>). In addition, another FMNLs family member, FMNL1 is also localized at the cortex and is essential for actin polymerization and spindle assembly during oocyte meiosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></italic>). Based on the localization pattern of FMNL2, we speculated that the functions of FMNL2 might be also involved in actin-related process during mouse oocyte meiosis.</p>
<p>To confirm our hypothesis, we depleted FMNL2 protein expression and we found that absence of FMNL2 caused the aberrant first polar body extrusion. The oocytes either failed to form the polar body or extruded large polar bodies. These phenotypes caused by FMNL2 depletion are similar to the other actin-related proteins during oocyte maturation such as Arp2/3 complex (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></italic>) and FMN2 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></italic>). We next examined the actin distribution in oocytes since it is reported that FMNL2 promotes actin filament assembly in many models. FMNL2 is required for cell-cell adhesion formation by regulating the actin assembly (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>), and FMNL2 could directly drives actin elongation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>). In CRC cells, cortactin bind to FMNL2 to active the actin polymerization, and FMNL2 is important for invadopodia formation and functions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></italic>). Our results showed that the FMNL2 depletion caused significantly decrease in cytoplasmic actin, indicating the conserved roles of FMNL2 on actin assembly in mammalian oocyte model. Other Formin family proteins such as Daam1, FHOD1, and Formin-homology family protein mDia1 are also reported to affect oocyte meiosis by regulating actin polymerization (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>We then tried to explore how FMNL2 involves into the actin assembly in oocytes. Mass spectrometry analysis data indicated that FMNL2 associated with several actin-related proteins, and we found that FMNL2 was associated with Arp2 and Formin2. This could be confirmed by the altered expression of these two molecules after FMNL2 depletion. Therefore, we speculated FMNL2 could regulate cytoplasmic actin assembly in oocytes through the association with Formin2 since it is reported to be an important protein for cytoplasmic actin assembly in oocytes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>). Interestingly, our results showed that unlike the reduction of cytoplasmic actin, cortex actin was not affected by the absence of FMNL2. We speculated that Arp2/3 complex has a compensation effect on the depleting of FMNL2 during oocyte meiosis, ensuring the cortex actin assembly in oocytes since Arp2 protein expression significantly increased after FMNL2 depletion. As an actin nucleator Arp2/3 complex localizes at the cortex and is essential for actin polymerization during oocyte meiosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></italic>). These results suggested that FMNL2 might be involved in cytokinesis and asymmetric division by regulating actin assembly during mouse oocyte maturation.</p>
<p>The spindle migration is a key step in ensuring the asymmetric division for oocytes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). In mitosis, spindle position is decided by cortical actin and astral microtubules; in contrast, spindle migration is mainly mediated by actin filaments during oocyte meiosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></italic>). Due to the effects of FMNL2 on asymmetric division and cytoplasmic actin, we analyzed the spindle positioning at late MI, we found that the spindle migration was disturbed after FMNL2 depletion, no matter the cytokinesis occurred or not. Several formin proteins are shown to regulate spindle migration during oocytes meiosis. For example, FMN2 nucleates actin surrounding the spindle, pushing force generated by actin to trigger the spindle migration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>), and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) induces cytoplasmic Formin-mediated F-actin polymerization to propel the spindle into the cortex (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></italic>). Our previous studies also showed that absence of the formin family member FMNL1 or FHOD1 could lead to the decrease of cytoplasmic actin to prevent the spindle migration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>). We speculated that FMNL2 together with other Formin proteins, conservatively regulate actin-mediated spindle migration during oocyte meiosis.</p>
<p>Another important finding is that through the mass spectrometry analysis we found many candidate proteins which were related with ER, and our results indicated that FMNL2 was essential for the maintenance of ER distribution in the cytoplasm. Moreover, the loss of FMNL2 induced ER stress, showing with altered expression of GRP78 and CHOP. Proper distribution of ER is important for the oocyte quality. ER displays a homogeneous distribution pattern throughout the entire ooplasm during development of oocytes and embryos from diabetic mice(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></italic>). During the transition of mouse oocytes from MI to MII phase, actin regulates cortical ER aggregation(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>). In addition, Formin2 is shown to colocalize with the ER during oocyte meiosis and the ER-associated Formin2 at the spindle periphery is required for MI chromosome migration(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>). In our results we showed that FMNL2 associated with INF2 protein in oocytes. INF2 is an ER-associated protein, and the expression of GFP-INF2 which containing DAD/WH2 mutations causes the ER to collapse around the nucleus (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></italic>). We concluded that FMNL2 might regulate INF2 for the distribution of ER in cytoplasm of oocytes.</p>
<p>Besides its roles of ER distribution, it is shown that INF2 also affects mitochondrial length and ER-mitochondrial interaction in an actin-dependent manner (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></italic>). It is shown that INF2 regulates Drp1 for mitochondrial fission, and INF2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows Drp1-driven secondary constriction(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>). In addition, we also found many candidate proteins which were related with mitochondria from mass spectrometry analysis. During oocyte meiosis, mitochondria gradually accumulated around the spindle after GVBD, and the spindle-peripheral FMN2 and its actin nucleation activity are important for the accumulation of mitochondria in this region (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>). Our results found that FMNL2 depletion caused agglutination of mitochondria and altered MMP level in the cytoplasm, indicating its roles on the mitochondria distribution and functions. Another formin protein mDia1 is shown to be necessary to induce the anchoring of mitochondria along the cytoskeletal in mammalian CV-1 cells and Drosophila BG2-C2 neuronal cells(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></italic>). Moreover, the formin interaction protein Spire1C binds INF2 to promote actin assembly on mitochondrial surfaces, and Spire1C disruption could reduce mitochondrial constriction and division(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>). In addition, our result indicated that cofilin expression decreased in FMNL2 depletion oocytes. Cofilin is an actin-depolymerizing factor and its localization at the mitochondrial fission site is crucial for inducing mitochondrial fission and mitophagy (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></italic>). Depleting of cofilin resulted in abnormal interconnection and elongation of mitochondria (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>). Together with its roles on ER, these data indicated that FMNL2 might associate with INF2 and cofilin for the actin-based organelle distribution during oocyte meiosis.</p>
<p>Collectively, we provide a body of evidence showing that FMNL2 associates with Formin2 and Arp2/3 complex for actin assembly, which further regulates spindle migration and INF2/Cofilin-related organelle dynamics during mouse oocyte maturation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The presented study focuses on the role of formin-like 2 (FMNL2) in oocyte meiosis. The authors assessed FMNL2 expression and localization in different meiotic stages and subsequently, by using siRNA, investigated the role of FMNL2 in spindle migration, polar body extrusion, and distribution of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in mouse oocytes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Novelty in assessing the role of formin-like 2 in oocyte meiosis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Methods are not properly described.</p>
<p>
Overstating presented data.</p>
<p>
It is not clear what statistical tests were used.</p>
<p>My main concern is that there are missing important details of how particular experiments and analyses were done. The material and methods section is not written in the way that presented experiments could be repeated - it is missing basic information (e.g., used mouse strain, timepoints of oocytes harvest for particular experiments, used culture media, image acquisition parameters, etc.). Some of the presented data are overstated and incorrectly interpreted. It is not clear to me how the analysis of ER and mitochondria distribution was done, which is an important part of the presented data interpretation. I'm also missing important information about the timing of particular stages of assessed oocytes because the localization of both ER and mitochondria differs at different stages of oocyte meiosis. The data interpretation needs to be justified by proper analysis based on valid parameters, as there is considerable variability in the ER and mitochondria structure and localization across oocytes based on their overall quality and stage.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This research involves conducting experiments to determine the role of Fmnl2 during oocyte meiosis I.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Identifying the role of Fmnl2 during oocyte meiosis I is significant.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The quantitative analysis and the used approach to perturb FMNL2 function are currently incomplete and would benefit from more confirmatory approaches and rigorous analysis.</p>
<p>1- Most of the results are expected. The new finding here is that FMNL2 regulates cytoplasmic F-actin in mouse oocytes, which is also expected given the role of FMNL2 in other cell types. Given that FMNL2 regulates cytoplasmic F-actin, it is very expected to see all the observed phenotypes. It is already established that F-actin is required for spindle migration to the oocyte cortex, extruding a small polar body and normal organelle distribution and functions.</p>
<p>2-The authors used Fmnl2 cRNA to rescue the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of Fmnl2. It is not clear how this works. It is expected that the siRNA will also target the exogenous cRNA construct (which should have the same sequence as endogenous Fmnl2) especially when both of them were injected at the same time. Is this construct mutated to be resistant to the siRNA?</p>
<p>3-The authors used only one approach to knockdown FMNL2 which is by siRNA. Using an additional approach to inhibit FMNL2 would be beneficial to confirm that the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of FMNL2 is specific.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors focus on the role of formin-like protein 2 in the mouse oocyte, which could play an important role in actin filament dynamics. The cytoskeleton is known to influence a number of cellular processes from transcription to cytokinesis. The results show that downregulation of FMNL2 affects spindle migration with resulting abnormalities in cytokinesis in oocyte meiosis I.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The overall description of methods and figures is overall dismissively poor. The description of the sample types and number of replicate experiments is impossible to interpret throughout, and the quantitative analysis methods are not adequately described. The number of data points presented is unconvincing and unlikely to support the conclusions. On the basis of the data presented, the conclusions appear to be preliminary, overstated, and therefore unconvincing.</p>
