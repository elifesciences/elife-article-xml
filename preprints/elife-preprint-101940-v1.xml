<title>Abstract</title>
<p>With the continuous rise in antibiotic resistance, novel methods that can reveal currently unknown antibiotic resistance mechanisms are essential to prepare and inform health responses. Here we built a library of species representative of the genus <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> and determined their antibiotic resistance profiles, allowing systematic multispecies comparisons. Analyzing antibiotic resistance in the context of other closely related organisms revealed species with truly exceptional traits, thus providing a solid starting point for the exploration of novel determinants of antibiotic resistance. We illustrate the utility of this genus-level approach to discovery of novel traits by characterizing a previously unrecognized rifamycin-inactivating enzyme that is present in a wide range of bacterial genera.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The discovery and successful clinical deployment of antibiotics is one of the most important breakthroughs in medical history, as it has dramatically reduced the morbidity and mortality in infections. Conversely, the extensive use of antibiotics has promoted the selection of mechanisms that enable bacteria to thrive regardless [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Not all resistance mechanisms can be attributed to human-derived antibiotic exposure, as many predate the clinical use of antibiotics and/or are observed in bacteria of no clinical importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. These mechanisms are derived from the natural evolution of species and the environment they occupy, as bacteria that co-inhabit niches with antibiotic-producing organisms naturally develop ways to avoid antibiotic-caused death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Of key importance, antibiotic resistance mechanisms do not have to evolve <italic>de novo,</italic> as they can be incorporated from other organisms via horizontal gene transfer (HGT).</p>
<p>Two main strategies are used to identify novel antibiotic resistance determinants. One clinical or hostbiased approach ensues when a patient who is infected with a presumably antibiotic-sensitive species fails to improve upon treatment. Isolation and study of the resistant strain then leads to the identification of a novel determinant of antibiotic resistance. Several seminal discoveries of direct clinical importance have taken place in this manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. However, this approach mostly discovers incremental strainspecific mechanisms, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that alter antibiotic binding to its target. Another strategy involves ecological sampling and screening, using targeted approaches or metagenomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The latter approach holds the promise to uncover truly novel mechanisms, although these mechanisms might never find their ways into extant pathogens, and therefore will never represent a clinically relevant problem.</p>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium</italic> is a genus that includes both environmental and clinically relevant microorganisms. Mycobacteria can be found in most environments including rivers and lakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], plant roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], moss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], reptiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], amphibians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. A typical divide of the genus is based on growth rate in a defined solid medium when sub-cultured from highly dilute inoculums [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. A mycobacterial species is “fast-growing” if it forms visible colonies within seven days; this phenotype is considered to be the ancestral state of the genus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. A species that takes longer than seven days to form mature colonies is classified as “slow-growing”, this category includes the most devastating disease-causing species <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans, M. avium</italic> complex (MAC), <italic>M. leprae,</italic> and the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC). Until recently, human infections with mycobacteria other than the MTBC and <italic>M. leprae, i.e.</italic> non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), were overshadowed by the TB burden but are now gaining increased attention due to their growing prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Some of the key NTM species that cause disease are the fast-growers <italic>M. abscessus and M. fortuitum,</italic> and the slow-growers <italic>M. avium, M. marinum, M. xenopi, M. gordonae</italic>and <italic>M. kansasii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. NTM can infect a variety of tissues including the lungs, central nervous system, lymphatic system, joints, and skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. As the frequency of NTM infections is increasing, so is the worry of their severity and resistance to treatment with available antibiotics. Contrasting with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. leprae,</italic> which due to their isolation inside the host, do not show cross-species horizontal gene transfer or HGT, NTM might acquire resistance determinants from environmental bacteria. Therefore, the potential of mycobacterial species to contain and disseminate antibiotic resistance determinants is likely as good as of other environmental bacteria.</p>
<p>Here, we propose a new method to study antibiotic resistance by comparing antibiotic resistance profiles across related bacterial species (macroevolution) to identify previously unknown high-level antibiotic resistant species. Then, taking advantage of the natural genetic diversity among species (encoded in their accessory genome) and their genetic similarity (encoded in their core genome), computational, molecular, and cellular approaches can more readily pinpoint resistance determinants. We illustrate the power of this method by characterizing a previously unrecognized rifamycin-inactivating enzyme that is widely distributed across bacterial genera.</p>

<title>Building a diverse library of mycobacterial species</title>
<p>A collection of 44 tractable mycobacterial species was assembled to cover most of the mycobacterial phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To evaluate the biological diversity of our library we analyzed the ecological and genomic information available for the selected species. In terms of niche/pathogenicity, mycobacteria can be broadly divided into <italic>bona fide</italic>avirulent saprophytes, opportunistic pathogens, and professional pathogens. However, we considered necessary to add further nuance to the opportunistic category by assessing the strength of the evidence of pathogenicity provided in the literature and used this knowledge to establish a five-level scoring system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). We determined doubling times in liquid culture in equivalent experimental conditions for 26 of the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The results revealed large differences within the genus. For example, <italic>M. szulgai</italic>and <italic>M. flavescens</italic> divided every 1.3 and 2.0 hours, respectively, while <italic>M. marinum</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis,</italic> divided every 17.1 hours. Strikingly, among slow-growers a 13-fold change difference exists between the fastest and the slowest-growing species (<italic>M. szulgai</italic> and M. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> respectively). The genome size of the library species is also highly different, with genomes as small as 3.59 Mbp and 4.08 Mbp, for <italic>M. triviale</italic> and <italic>M. koreense, respectively,</italic> to genomes as large as 6.99 Mbp and 8.01 Mbp for <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>and <italic>M. mageritense,</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These genome size differences suggest that the nature of the accessory genome varies widely from species to species. Interestingly, there is only a very small difference when comparing the average genome size of all fast and slow growers, 6.1 vs 5.8 Mbp, respectively. The high guanine-cytosine content (GC%) is a defining characteristic of mycobacteria. Within our library, GC% varies from 66.9–68.8%, in slow growers and the <italic>M. terrae</italic>clade respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Next, we investigated the number of ribosomal RNA encoding genes <italic>(rrn</italic> operon), a feature that has often been linked to growth rate. Twenty-five species possess a single copy of the <italic>rrn</italic> operon while the other 19 possess two copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1f</xref>). In general, but not always, “fast growers” tend to have two copies while “slow growers” one. In the genus <italic>Bacillus</italic> a correlation between growth rate and <italic>rrn</italic> operon copy number has been experimentally disproven [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], and number of <italic>rrn</italic> operon copies could be related to response of resource availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, comparative pangenome analyses conducted by Bachmann and collaborators suggested that growth limitation in slow growing mycobacteria might instead be related to loss of amino acid transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Finally, we analyzed the gene ontology (GO) distribution for our library in order to evaluate functional genetic diversity at the genome level. GO distribution varies noticeably across the analyzed genomes. The number of genes associated with transcription and membrane transport (categories indicated by arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1g</xref>) appeared to be particularly variable. We noted that much of the genome of several of these species is poorly annotated. Therefore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> supports the potential usefulness of our library as a resource to investigate mycobacterial biology, antibiotic resistance, and pathogen evolution.</p>

<title>Wide variation in antibiotic resistance profiles in mycobacteria</title>
<p>To harness the potential of our library, we tested the antibiotic potency and the extent of its variation across the <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> genus to identify biologically-relevant differences to be further studied. We determined minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC<sub>99</sub>) for 15 antibiotics, spanning most of the classes employed to treat mycobacterial infections, including TB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We found that several species displayed at least one MIC<sub>99</sub> value that is considerably different from the mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Supplementary Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">2</xref>), highlighting the biological diversity of the genus with respect to antibiotic action. As expected, notoriously multi-drug resistant <italic>M. abscessus</italic> was resistant to several antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], yet <italic>M. abscessus</italic> was not the most resistant of the species studied. <italic>M. mageritense, M. salmoniphilum</italic> and <italic>M. houstonense</italic> were highly resistant to most of the antibiotics tested. <italic>M. abscessus</italic> was somewhat sensitive to amikacin (AMK) and bedaquiline (BDQ), which is consistent with other findings in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Also, the magnitude of the changes in MIC<sub>99</sub> is remarkable, of the order of 100- to 1000-fold in some instances. Of note, when the data were re-ordered and unbiased clustered, based on the overall antibiotic sensitivity of each individual species, the species distribution were divided in three main clusters, which are dramatically different when compared to their phylogenetic positioning, as shown by the tanglegram between the two heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>. To illustrate the absence of a taxonomic trend in antibiotic resistance we explored in detail the clade composed by <italic>M. holsaticum, M. phlei, M. flavescens, M. tusciae</italic> and <italic>M. moriokaense</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). While most antibiotics behaved similarly across this group (<italic>i.e.</italic>, MIC<sub>99</sub> FC &lt; 3-fold). <italic>M. holsaticum</italic> was highly sensitive to paraaminosalicylic acid (PAS) and highly resistant to BDQ. High-level BDQ resistance was also observed with <italic>M. flavescens.</italic> Interestingly, <italic>M. flavescens</italic> is unusually sensitive to d-cycloserine (DCS). The mechanisms underpinning these distinct responses to antibiotics are currently unknown. We also observed that once ordered by antibiotic sensitivity, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is positioned at the middle of the heatmap and the number of NTM more resistant to antibiotics compared to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is nearly equal to the number of NTM that are more sensitive. Therefore, NTM are not generally intrinsically more drug resistant to the antibiotics tested than <italic>M. tuberculosis.</italic> In summary, antibiotic sensitivity varies dramatically across the <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> genus and our data provide the first quantitative blueprint of this variation.</p>

<p>There are striking differences in antibiotic response across the genus that highlight the value of a genuswide approach to inform antibiotic research efforts. For example, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> is frequently used as a model organism for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in TB antibiotic discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], but it displayed a completely different sensitivity profile from <italic>M. tuberculosis,</italic> being highly resistant to PAS, ethionamide (ETH), DCS and RIF. Our results suggest that <italic>M. marinum</italic> is a better <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> proxy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] as both have a similar sensitivity profile except to ofloxacin (OFX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The overall distribution of antibiotic potency (MIC<sub>99</sub>) against different species is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref>. Cell-envelope-targeting antibiotics and PAS exhibit a weaker potency across the genus, while antibiotics that target protein synthesis, DNA gyrase and the ATP synthase on average displayed an overall lower MIC<sub>99</sub>, indicating that most mycobacteria are sensitive to them. From the antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis, linezolid (LZD) displays the lowest overall MIC<sub>99</sub> and was effective against most species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To verify whether there is a correlation between doubling time and sensitivity to antibiotics we compared the doubling time of a subset of species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>) with the MIC<sub>99</sub> of a subset of antibiotics. As it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref>, no correlation is apparent between growth rate and antibiotic sensitivity in mycobacteria. Below, we explore the molecular causes of these dramatic changes in antibiotic potency observed across the <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> genus.</p>
<sec id="s2-2-1">
<title>Intra-bacterial antibiotic accumulation does not predict potency.</title>
<p>We employed liquid chromatography–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to determine the relative internal concentration of antibiotic ([ABX]<sub>IB</sub>) with an antibiotic concentration in the growth medium of 6 × MIC<sub>99</sub>. [ABX]<sub>IB</sub> is a function of three parameters: antibiotic uptake, efflux, and modification. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> shows extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) in five mycobacterial species for BDQ, LZD and RIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Quantification of [BDQ]<sub>IB</sub>, [LZD]<sub>IB</sub> and [RIF]<sub>IB</sub> illustrates the variability and the magnitude of the changes observed in [ABX]<sub>IB</sub>, spanning from 2- to 200-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c</xref>). As the experiment was performed at a concentration of antibiotic where every antibiotic was equally potent, we replotted these data as a function of each antibiotic MIC<sub>99</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Only for BDQ we could observe a correlation between antibiotic potency and [BDQ]<sub>IB</sub> which could be indicative of efflux playing a role in antibiotic efficacy. In the case of RIF, where there is no correlation between antibiotic potency and its accumulation in mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>), factors other than uptake and efflux as the dominant drivers of RIF potency in mycobacteria.</p>

<p>Considering the importance of rifamycins for the treatment of TB, leprosy, Buruli ulcer, MAC and <italic>M. kansasii</italic> infections, we focused on RIF resistance mechanisms operating in mycobacteria. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> highlights the diversity in RIF potency across our library, ranging from an MIC<sub>99</sub> of more than 100 μg/mL to less than 0.2 μg/mL. Arranging species by decreasing MIC<sub>99</sub> value highlights that there are species better suited for the identification of target-mediated resistance mechanisms (dark orange), and species that are better suited for the identification of non-target-based resistance mechanisms (dark purple). At this stage, we focused our work on four species, all of which are resistant (MIC<sub>99</sub> = 12.5 μg/mL) or superresistant (MIC<sub>99</sub> ≥ 100.0 μg/mL) to RIF, compared to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>(MIC<sub>99</sub> = 0.9 μg/mL): <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and <italic>M. flavescens</italic> (MIC<sub>99</sub> = 12.5 μg/mL), <italic>M. houstonense</italic> (MIC<sub>99</sub> = 25.0 μg/mL), and <italic>M. conceptionense</italic> (MIC<sub>99</sub> ≥ 100.0 μg/mL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>

<p>In <italic>M. tuberculosis,</italic> the fixation of mutations that decrease the affinity of RIF to the RNA polymerase β subunit (RpoB) represents the dominant cause of RIF resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], and therefore target modification is an obvious starting point to explore probable mechanisms of resistance to the rifamycin class of antibiotics in other mycobacteria. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> shows the Rifampicin Resistance Determining Region (RRDR), the segment of RpoB where most mutations conferring resistance to RIF are found. Except for <italic>M. branderi,</italic> no amino acid variations are found in our species of interest. This observation suggests that in contrast to <italic>M. tuberculosis,</italic> most mycobacteria are not resistant to RIF due to variations in the RIF binding region of RpoB.</p>
<p>As [RIF]<sub>IB</sub> or RpoB target variation cannot account for the observed resistance to RIF, we evaluated the remaining major mechanism of resistance to rifamycins, drug modification. RIF modification is widely found in nature and is carried out by various enzyme types, including phosphotransferases, glycosyltransferases, ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) and monooxygenases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Importantly, a RIFART has been characterized in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]; it is encoded by the gene <italic>MSMEG_1221,</italic> also known as <italic>arr-ms,</italic> and it has been showed to be the sole determinant of RIF resistance in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>by chemical and genetic methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. We employed proteomics to first check whether Arr-ms is expressed in the absence of RIF and if it is differentially expressed in the presence of RIF. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> shows that expression of Arr-ms is stimulated (5.6-fold) in the presence of RIF at 6 × MIC<sub>99</sub>, and therefore, proteomics can assist on the identification of RIF modifying enzymes in mycobacteria. Next, we evaluated whether the annotated Arr homologous proteins in <italic>M. conceptionense</italic> (SAMEA3305051) and in <italic>M. flavescens</italic> (SAMN05729960) were also induced in the presence of RIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4e</xref>), this was indeed the case (4.12- and 2.75-fold change respectively). To confirm that these putative RIF-ARTs are inactivating RIF, we employed LC-MS, to identify ribosyl-RIF (m/z 955.4601), a fragment of the larger ADP-ribosyl-RIF product, which fragments under LC-MS conditions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref> illustrates that ribosyl-RIF was observed in <italic>M. smegmatis, M. conceptionense</italic>and <italic>M. flavescens</italic> treated with RIF. Additionally, other mycobacteria with annotated putative <italic>arr</italic> genes also displayed high levels of RIF ADP-ribose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Supplementary Fig. 4a and 4b</xref>), indicating that RIF modification, and precisely ADP-ribosylation, is the dominant mechanism of resistance to RIF in mycobacteria.</p>

<title>A novel group of rifamycin ADP-ribosyltransferases</title>
<p>In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of Arrs in mycobacteria we mined for <italic>arr</italic> sequences in reference genomes and built a phylogenetic tree. Arr proteins were found to be widespread in both fast- and slow-growing mycobacteria, but in a dispersed pattern suggesting that both local vertical inheritance and gene losses and acquisitions have taken place. Mycobacterial Arrs form two monophyletic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). One of the groups, which we designated Arr-1, corresponds to sequences closely related to Arr-ms (median sequence identity of 80%). Arr-1 group members are predominantly Actinomycetota of the orders Geodermatophilales, Propionibacteriales, Micrococcales and Mycobacteriales. The second group, which we have named Arr-X, is taxonomically more broadly distributed, including members from Actinomycetota, Bacillota, Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota. Within mycobacteria, more species have an <italic>arr-1</italic> gene than <italic>arr-X</italic> and a few species have both, for example <italic>M. conceptionense</italic>and <italic>M. flavescens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). <italic>M. conceptionense</italic> Arr-1 (Uniprot A0A0U1D6J3) and Arr-X (Uniprot A0A0U1DL14) share 50% identity and 63% similarity (BLOSUM62). The equivalent of the three residues showed by Baysarowich and collaborators to be necessary for enzymatic activity in Arr-ms (Asp84, His19 and Tyr49) are conserved in all mycobacterial Arr-1 and Arr-Xs, suggesting that they are all active ADP ribosyltransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. However, the hydrophobic nature of the RIF binding cleft of Arr-ms is not completely preserved in the Arr-X group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) hinting at probable differences in substrate binding preference.</p>

</fig>
<p>To assess that Arr-X enzymes are indeed RIF-ARTs and to understand why some species have two <italic>arr</italic> genes, we cloned, overexpressed, purified, and tested the enzymatic activity of Arr-ms (as a control) and Arr-1 and Arr-X from both <italic>M. conceptionense</italic>and <italic>M. flavescens.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> displays the catalytic activity (<italic>V</italic><sup>app</sup>) of the different proteins with six rifamycins. All Arr-1 enzymes had similar activity and substrate preference, but Arr-X enzymes were much superior at inactivating rifamycins. For example, <italic>M. flavescens</italic> Arr-X is 3.9-fold faster with rifapentine than Arr-ms. Surprisingly, <italic>M. conceptionense</italic>Arr-X is 29-fold faster to inactivate rifabutin, compared to Arr-ms. These results therefore demonstrate that Arr-Xs are not only <italic>bona fide</italic>rifamycin inactivating enzymes, but also that they are significantly more efficient than Arr-1 s. We also determined the MIC<sub>99</sub> for different rifamycins in selected species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, these species are resistant to all rifamycins except for rifabutin. To probe whether Arr-X is active <italic>in bacterio,</italic> we used CRISPR interference to reduce the transcription of <italic>arr-1</italic>, <italic>arr-X</italic>and both genes in <italic>M. conceptionense. M. conceptionense</italic>continued to be resistant to rifabutin upon <italic>arr-1</italic> silencing but became more sensitive when <italic>arr-X</italic> was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Thus, Arr-X is an active “rifabutinase” that confers rifamycin resistance in <italic>M. conceptionense.</italic></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Discovery of unknown mechanisms for high-level antibiotic resistance in nature is essential for more efficient antibiotic discovery and development and for the continuous treatment of patients. Here we propose a powerful approach for the discovery of novel antibiotic resistance determinants. Our strategy consists of mapping and comparing the antibiotic response profile of a library of tractable species representative of the entire genus <italic>Mycobacterium;</italic> an approach that is applicable for the study of many biological traits and to other bacterial genera.</p>
<p>Using our mycobacterial library, we identified high- and ultra-high-level intrinsic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] to many of the antibiotics tested. Resistance profiles are highly variable across the genus and do not follow phylogeny, implicating HGT as the key mechanism for acquisition of resistance determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>].</p>
<p>Our study revealed that resistance levels to BDQ, LZD and RIF were particularly divergent across the genus and often could not be explained by our current knowledge of antibiotic resistance mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. We found that resistance to these antibiotics in mycobacteria cannot be explained by uptake/efflux mechanisms and it does not correlate with growth rate.</p>
<p>We illustrated the power of this comparative method by characterizing a previously unrecognized group of rifamycin-inactivating enzymes (Arr-X) that is present in a wide range of bacteria including Actinomycetes, Bacilli and Gammaproteobacteria. We found that several mycobacterial species have the gene coding for the RIF inactivating enzyme RIF-ART (Arr-1), and revealed that some species also code for a homologous protein Arr-X. The existence of a superior rifabutin-inactivating enzyme in several mycobacterial species might jeopardize the use of rifabutin, currently an antibiotic of choice to treat <italic>M. avium</italic> complex-caused infections and other infections. Novel inhibitors of these two distinct Arr enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]) might become essential to re-sensitize mycobacteria against rifamycins and against rifabutin in particular.</p>

<title>Mycobacterial species and cultures</title>
<p>Mycobacterial species were acquired from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH - DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). The species comprised in our library were selected based on (i) broad genus coverage; (ii) diversity with respect to niche/pathogenicity; (iii) availability of genome sequence; (iv) availability of the type or laboratory strain; and (v) ability to grow on Middlebrook 7H9 culture medium. Upon arrival, long-term (-80°C), short-term (-20°C) and agar plate stocks were prepared according to DSMZ’s protocols.</p>

<title>Mycobacterial diversity</title>
<p>Genotypic and phenotypic diversity is an essential feature required for our approach. To describe the niche/pathogenicity diversity encompassed in our library, we developed an ad-hoc pathogenicity score system based on the number and detail of peer-reviewed publications describing a particular species as pathogenic. We searched for the number of records in PubMed containing the species name and the words “bacteraemia” or “pathogen” or “infection”. Species with more than twenty matches were designated as a “common proven pathogen” (score of 4), and those with none as non-pathogenic (score of 0). The remaining species were classified as a “rare proven pathogen” (score of 3) if the diagnostic evidence presented in the paper was strong and the patient was immunocompetent, “pathogen” in either we considered that the diagnostic evidence was insufficient or if the patient was immunocompromised (score of 2) and a score of 1 was used for those that did not meet either criterion.</p>
<p>Genome size and guanine-cytosine content (GC%) values were obtained from NCBI Microbial Genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] and ribosomal copy number was annotated using rrnDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] or BLAST. When more than one hit was obtained, the genomic sequence and context were analyzed to confirm duplication. The growth rate of selected species was determined by turbidity measurements (OD<sub>600</sub>) taken in equal intervals. We inoculated 100 mL Middlebrook 7H9 broth complete in roller bottles. Middlebrook 7H9 broth complete contained 10% Albumin-Dextrose-Catalase (ADC) supplement, 0.05% Glycerol and 0.05% Tyloxapol. Growth rate was calculated using the specific growth rate formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Finally, encoded genes were classified based on their gene ontology using OmicsBox’s functional analysis tool, with default parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>].</p>

<title>Minimal inhibitory concentration measurements</title>
<p>Our mid-throughput minimal inhibitory concentration assay (MIC<sub>99</sub>) was adapted from previously described protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Briefly, in sterile Eppendorf tubes, each antibiotic was diluted in the recommended solvent to 4 mg/mL. Fluoroquinolones and BDQ were diluted to 0.4 mg/mL. Subsequently, 200 μL of each drug was added to column 10 of a 96-well plate. In the same plate, 100 μL of DMSO or water were added to columns 1–9 and 11. The drug titration was performed using a multi-channel pipette, using the volume 100 μL for 1:2 dilutions. The remaining 100 μL left over from column 1 was added to column 12, which is the negative control (contamination control). A secondary replicate plate was prepared in the same manner, and then combined for a final volume of 200 μL in each well. These plates were the master plates which were then copied into 36 new plates by transferring 5 μL of each well using Biomek FX Liquid Handling Automation (Beckman Coulter, California, USA). Once antibiotics were in the wells, 195 μL of Middlebrook 7H10 containing 10% Oleic Acid Albumin Dextrose Catalase (OADC) supplement was added each well and homogenized using Multidrop™ Combi Reagent Dispenser (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). All procedures were performed in a biosafety cabinet.</p>
<p>Bacterial cultures were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth complete at their preferred temperature, shaking at 180 rpm. Once cultures reached approximately OD<sub>600</sub> of 1, they were aliquoted in sterile micro tubes, and frozen at -20°C for future use.</p>
<p>For the MIC<sub>99</sub> determination, stock cultures were diluted OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.006 in Middlebrook 7H9 broth complete and 2 μL of the dilution were spotted into columns 1–11 of the 96-well plates. Plates were then incubated at the appropriate temperature and analyzed after confluent growth was observed in the growth control wells (column 11). Pictures of the plates were taken, and visual analysis was carried out to record the MIC<sub>99</sub>. At least three independent experiments were recorded for each species-antibiotic pair, for 15 antibiotics and 44 species, totaling 1,980 individual MIC determinations.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry and Proteomics</title>
<p>Sample preparation for LC-MS and proteomics was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Mycobacterial species were grown in roller bottles in a volume of 100 mL of Middlebrook 7H9 broth complete to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1. Cultures were filtered using MF-Millipore Membrane Filter – 0.22 μm pore size to concentrate cell amount. For each species, 24 bacterial-laden filters were prepared and 3 were placed in petri-dish plates of Middlebrook 7H10 containing 10% OADC supplement and incubated at appropriate temperature (37 or 30°C, depending on the species) for 5 doubling times, to expand the bacterial biomass. Subsequently, filters were transferred to fresh 7H10 containing 10% OADC supplement plates with vehicle or antibiotic at the concentration of 6 × MIC<sub>99</sub> and incubated for one doubling time, at appropriate temperature. Cells were then scraped into screw-cap tubes containing either 1 mL of ACN:MeOH:Water (2:2:1, v:v:v) and glass beads (150 μm) for LC-MS, or washed twice with 1 mL of PBS and then placed in 4% SDS/100 mM HEPES/50 mM DTT lysis buffer and glass beads (150–212 μm), for proteomics pilot experiment and 1% SDC/100 mM HEPES/50 mM DTT lysis buffer for remaining proteomics experiments. All samples were lysed by bead beating. At this stage, LC-MS samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and filtered using Corning® Costar® Spin-X® Plastic Centrifuge 0.22 μm tube filters. Proteomics samples were heat killed and subjected to acetone precipitation, only when extracted with SDS, and peptide digested with LysC and Trypsin in 100 mM HEPES pH 8, Guanidine HCl 1 M.</p>
<p>LC-MS samples were analyzed using a previously described method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Briefly, aqueous normal phase liquid chromatography was performed using an Agilent 1200 LC system at controlled temperature (4 °C). Flow rate of 0.4 ml min<sup>-1</sup> was used. Elution of polar compounds were performed using a gradient of two solvents, A (MS-grade water and 0.1% of formic acid) and B (acetonitrile and 0.1% of formic acid) in positive mode. The data were analyzed by MassHunter Qualitative Analysis B07.00 or XCMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. To verify the intracellular drug concentration for all samples, the molecular formulae of each drug was searched against the raw spectra and the integrated Extracted Ion Chromatogram (EIC) was used to extract quantitative information. The peak height of both the antibiotic standard and the samples was used to calculate the relative drug concentration in each sample. Although area would generally be the variable of choice for performing quantifications, the peak shape was not consistent for LZD, therefore the peak height would correlate better with the amount of drug inside the cell. Further, the amount of drug added to the cells was considered and used to perform normalization, given that each species was exposed to a concentration of drug proportional to their MIC<sub>99</sub>. For identifying and quantifying Ribosyl-RIF, XCMS was used to perform peak picking and alignment. Metaboanalyst was used to perform batch effect corrections and statistical analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. A feature with m/z 955.4601 was identified at 5.8 minutes and confirmed to be only present in RIF-treated samples. The feature abundance was normalized by the abundance in the pooled biological quality control (PBQC) samples (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). This accurate mass was searched using MassHunter Qualitative Analysis B07.00 with an acceptable error of ±10 ppm and the obtained peaks were integrated to extract the peak area, which was normalized by the peak area of the PBQC (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Finally, the average and the standard deviation between normalized values from six biological replicates were calculated and plotted.</p>
<p>Proteomics analyses were performed at the Proteomics Scientific Technology Platform (STP) at The Francis Crick Institute. Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) was used to build a peptide library and Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) was used to analyze the experimental samples. For both DDA and DIA, Evosep LC system (Evosep) was employed with the standard gradient for a total LC runtime of 44 min, using their supplied 15 cm column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Each sample was loaded from the peptide digests at a minimum volume of 10 μL (samples diluted for the optimum load for final loading volume of 10 μL to ensure all liquid enters the tip). An aliquot of the recommended amount of iRT peptides (Biognosys AG, Switzerland) was added to each sample at the sample loading stage. The protocol supplied with the Evotips was followed for conditioning/equilibrating/loading and washing the tips.</p>
<p>The outlet of the analytical column was connected directly to an adapter that allowed the EasySpray nano-source to be employed on the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA) using a stainless-steel emitter. The spray voltage was set to 2.2kV. The default charge state was set to 2+. For the DDA runs, MS1 data were acquired in profile mode at a resolution of 60000 (FWHM), with an AGC target of 1E6 ions and a maximum injection time of 50ms. The ion funnel RF was set at 30%. Quadrupole isolation was employed over the MS1 mass range of 375–1200 m/z. The monoisotopic precursor selection (MIPS) was set to “Peptide” and an intensity threshold of 5E4 was applied. Charge states from 2 + to 6 + were considered for MS/MS and dynamic exclusion was set to 15 seconds/10 ppm including exclusion of isotopes. Cycle time for the Data Dependent MS/MS Acquisition was set to 1 second. For the MS/MS, quadrupole isolation was set to 1.4 Da and HCD collision energy was employed at 32%. Data were acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 15000 (FWHM) in centroid, with a fixed first mass of 120 m/z. The AGC was set at 1E6 and maximum injection time of 22 ms.</p>
<p>For the DIA data acquisition, the following parameters were adjusted. Default charge state was set to 4+, and MS1 data were acquired in profile mode at a resolution of 120,000 (FWHM) with an AGC setting of 1E6 and maximum injection time of 20ms. The MS1 scan range was set from 393–907 m/z to allow enough data points per peak. 27 DIA windows (20 Da / 1 Da overlap) were employed over this range for DIA MS2 acquisition. These data were acquired at 30000 resolution (FWHM) in the Orbitrap in centroid mode. HCD collision energy was the same as for the DDA runs. MS2 data were acquired over the mass range 200–2000 m/z with an AGC setting of 1E6 and a maximum injection time of 54 ms. Ions were injected for all available parallelizable time.</p>

The column was washed with 5 column volumes (CV) of 5% buffer B [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl], and the adsorbed proteins were eluted with 5 CV of a linear gradient from 10 to 30% buffer B. Fractions containing the desired Arr protein were pooled together and brought to 1.25 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> by dropwise addition of the ammonium sulfate solution while stirring. After 30 min, the sample was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane and loaded onto a 1 mL HiTrap Phenyl Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer C [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1.25 M (NH4)2SO4]. The column was washed with 15 column volumes (CV) of 10% buffer D [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7)], and the adsorbed proteins were eluted with 20 CV of a linear gradient from 10 to 90% buffer D. Fractions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS - PAGE) (NuPAGE Bis-Tris 4 - 12% Precast gels, Thermo Fisher Scientific), pooled, dialyzed against 2 × 2 L of 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), concentrated using 5000-molecular-weight-cut-off (MWCO) centrifugal ultrafiltration membranes (Millipore), aliquoted, and stored at - 80°C. The concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 280 nm using a theoretical extinction coefficient of 16960 M-1 cm-1.

<title>In vitro activity assay of Arr enzymes</title>
<p>Assays were carried out based on the previous reported methods. Briefly, 150 nM protein (except for <italic>M. conceptionense</italic> Arr-X where 50 nM was used) in 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) was mixed with 150 μM of rifampicin and 2 mM NAD+. Time points (50 μL) where quenched by the addition of methanol (200 μL). The samples were then analyzed by injecting 20 μL onto the HPLC column Poroshell 120 Å, EC-C18, 3.0 × 150 mm, 2.7 μm (Agilent Technologies) and monitoring the consumption of rifampicin and formation of ADP-ribosylated rifampicin product. The same protocol was followed for each of the rifamycins in study: rifabutin, rifapentine, rifaximin, rifamycin B and rifamycin S. A standard curve of each rifamycin were measured independently.</p>

<title>Arr distribution analysis</title>
<p>In order to build a phylogenetic tree of mycobacterial Arr enzymes, Arr-ms (Uniprot A0QRS5) was used to query a local BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] database of genomic coding sequences of the mycobacterial reference genomes available in NCBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. The matching sequences were combined with those obtained by searching UniProt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>] entries matching the RIF-ART protein family (Pfam PF12120 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]).

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study introduces an approach to discovering antibiotic resistance determinants by leveraging diverse susceptibility profiles among related mycobacterial species, with particular relevance to high-level resistance against natural product-derived antibiotics. The research provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for the role of ADP-ribosylation enzymes in rifamycin resistance among mycobacteria, whilst also demonstrating that antibiotic susceptibility is not correlated with growth rate or intracellular compound concentration. Although some broader claims require additional experimental support, this work lays a significant foundation for understanding the complexity of antibiotic resistance mechanisms in mycobacteria and opens new avenues for future antimicrobial research.</p>

<p>This work shows that resistance profiles to a variety of drugs are variable between different mycobacterial species and are not correlated with growth rate or intrabacterial compound concentration (at least for linezolid, bedaquiline, and Rifampicin). Note that intrabacterial compound concentration does not distinguish between cytosolic and periplasmic/cell wall-associated drugs. The susceptibility profiles for a wide range of mycobacteria tested under the same conditions against 15 commonly used antimycobacterial drugs provide the first recorded cross-species comparison which will be a valuable resource for the scientific community. To understand the reasons for the high Rifampicin resistance seen in many mycobacteria, the authors confirm the presence of the arr gene known to encode a Rif ribosyltransferase involved in Rif resistance in M. smegmatis in the resistant mycobacteria after confirming the absence of on-target mutations in the RpoB RRDR. Metabolomic analyses confirm the presence of ribosylated Rif in some of the naturally resistant mycobacteria which may not be entirely surprising but an important confirmation. Presumably M. branderi is highly resistant despite lacking the arr homolog due to the rpoB S45N mutation. M. flavescens has an MIC similar to that of M. smegmatis, despite having both Arr-1 and Arr-X. Various Arr-1 and Arr-X proteins are expressed and characterized for catalytic activity which shows that Arr-X is a faster enzyme,, especially with respect to more hydrophobic rifamycins. M. flavescens has similar MIC values to Rifapentine and Rifabutin to M. smegmatis. Thus, the Arr-1 versus Arr-X comparison does not provide a complete explanation for the underlying reasons driving natural Rif resistance in mycobacteria. Downregulation of Arr-X expression in M. conceptionense confers increased sensitivity to Rifabutin confirming its role as a rifamycin-inactivating enzyme.</p>
<p>Overall, the comparison of cross-species susceptibility profiles is novel; the demonstration that MIC is not correlated with intracellular drug concentration is important but not sufficiently interrogated, the demonstration that Arr-X is also a Rif ADP-ribosyltransferase is a good confirmation and shows that it is more efficient than Arr-1 on hydrophobic rifamycins is interesting but maybe not entirely surprising. The manuscript seems to have two parts that are related, but the rifamycin modification aspect of the work is not strongly linked to the first part since it interrogates the modification of one drug but not the common cause of natural resistance for other drugs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors use a variety of methods to investigate the mechanisms of innate drug resistance in mycobacteria. They end up focusing on two primary determinants - drug accumulation, which correlates rather poorly with resistance for many species, and, for the rifamycins, ADP-ribosyltransferases. The latter enzymes do appear to account for a good deal of resistance, though it is difficult to extrapolate quantitatively what their relative contributions are.</p>
<p>Overall, they make excellent use of biochemical methods to support their conclusions. Though they set out to draw very broad lessons, much of the focus ends up being on rifamycins. This is still a very interesting set of conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) A very interesting approach and set of questions.</p>
<p>(2) Outstanding technical approaches to measuring intracellular drug concentrations and chemical modification of rifamycins.</p>
<p>(3) Excellent characterization of variant rifamycin ADP-ribosyltransferases</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 3c/d: These panels show the same experiment done twice, yet they display substantially different results in certain cases. For instance, M. smegmatis appears to show an order of magnitude lower RIF accumulation in panel d compared to M. flavescens, despite them displaying equal accumulation in panel c. The authors should provide justification for this variation, particularly as quantitative intra-species comparisons are central to the conclusions of this figure.</p>
<p>(2) There are several technical concerns with Figure 3 that affect how to interpret the work. According to the methods, the authors did not appear to normalize to an internal standard, only to an external antibiotic standard (which may account for some of the technical variation alluded to above). Second, the authors used different concentrations of drug for each species to try to match the species' MICs. I appreciate the authors' thinking on this, but I think for an uptake experiment it would be more appropriate to treat with the same concentration of drug since uptake is likely saturable at higher drug concentrations. In the current setup, for the species with higher MIC, they have to be able to uptake substantially more antibiotics than the species with low MIC in order to end up with the same normalized uptake value in Figure 3d. It would be helpful to repeat this experiment with a single drug concentration in the media for all species and test whether that gives the same results seen here.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 4f: This panel seems to argue against the idea that the efficacy of RIF ribosylation is what's driving drug susceptibility. M. flavescens is similarly resistant to RIF as M. smegmatis, yet M. flavescens has dramatically lower riboslyation of RIF. This is perhaps not surprising, as the authors appropriately highlight the number of different rif-modifying enzymes that have been identified that likely also contribute to drug resistance. However, I do think this means that the authors can't make the claim that the resistance they observe is caused by rifamycin modification, so those claims in the text and figure legend should be altered unless the authors can provide further evidence to support them. This experiment also has results that are inconsistent with what appears to be an identical experiment performed in Supplemental Figure 5b. The authors should provide context for why these results differ.</p>
<p>(4) Fig 4f/5c: M. flavescens has both Arr-1 and Arr-X, yet it appears to not have ribosylated RIF. This result seems to undermine the authors' reliance on the enzyme assay shown in Fig 5c - in that assay, M. flavescens Arr-X is very capable of modifying rifampicin, yet that doesn't appear to translate to the in vivo setting. This is of importance because the authors use this enzyme assay to argue that Arr-X is a fundamentally more powerful RIF resistance mechanism than Arr-1 and that it has specificity for rifabutin. However, the result in Figure 4f would argue that the enzyme assay results cannot be directly translated to in vivo contexts. For the authors to claim that Arr-X is most potent at modifying rifabutin, they could test their CRISPRi knockdowns of Arr-X and Arr-1 under treatment with each of the rifamycins they use in the enzyme assay. The authors mentioned that they didn't do this because all the strains are resistant to those compounds; however, if Arr-X is important for drug resistance, it would be reasonable to expect to see sensitization of the bacteria to those compounds upon knockdown.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 5d: The authors use this CRISRPi experiment to claim that ArrX from M. conceptionanse is more potent at inactivating rifabutin than Arr-1. This claim depends on there being equal degrees of knockdown of Arr-1 and Arr-X, so the authors should validate the degree of knockdown they get. This is particularly important because, to my knowledge, nobody has used this system in M. conceptionanse before</p>
<p>(6) The authors' arguments about Arr-X and Arr-1 would be strengthened by showing by LC/MS that Arr-X knockdown in M. conceptionense results in more loss of ribosyl-rifabutin than knockdown of Arr-1.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents a macroevolutionary approach to the identification of novel high-level antibiotic resistance determinants that takes advantage of the natural genetic diversity within a genus (mycobacteria, in this case) by comparing antibiotic resistance profiles across related bacterial species and then using computational, molecular, and cellular approaches to identify and characterize the distinguishing mechanisms of resistance. The approach is contrasted with &quot;microevolutionary&quot; approaches based on comparing resistant and susceptible strains of the same species and approaches based on ecological sampling that may not include clinically relevant pathogens or related species. The potential for new discoveries with the macroevolution-inspired approach is evident in the diversity of drug susceptibility profiles revealed amongst the selected mycobacterial species and the identification and characterization of a new group of rifamycin-modifying ADP-ribosyltransferase (Arr) orthologs of previously described mycobacterial Arr enzymes. Additional findings that intra-bacterial antibiotic accumulation does not always predict potency within this genus, that M. marinum is a better proxy for M. tuberculosis drug susceptibility than the commonly used saprophyte M. smegmatis, and that susceptibility to semi-synthetic antibiotic classes is generally less variable than susceptibility to antibiotics more directly derived from natural products strengthen the claim that the macroevolutionary lens is valuable for elucidating general principles of susceptibility within a genus.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the work. The argument for the novelty of the approach could be better articulated. While the opportunities for new discoveries presented by the identification of discrepant susceptibility results between related species are evident, it is less clear how the macroevolutionary approach is further leveraged for the discovery of truly novel resistance determinants. The example of the discovery of Arr-X enzymes presented here relied upon foundational knowledge of previously characterized Arr orthologs. There is little clarity on what the pipeline for identifying more novel resistance determinants would look like. In other words, what does the macroevolutionary perspective contribute to discovery from the point of finding interspecies differences in susceptibility? Does the framework still remain distinct from other discovery frameworks and approaches? If so, how?</p>
<p>While the experimentation and analyses performed appear well-designed and rigorous, there are a few instances in which broad claims are based on inferences from sample sets or data sets that are too limited to provide robust support. For example, the claim that rifampicin modification, and precisely ADP-ribosylation, is the dominant mechanism of resistance to rifampicin in mycobacteria may be a bit premature or an over-generalization, as other enzymatic modification mechanisms and other mechanisms such as helR-mediated dissociation of rifampicin-stalled RNA polymerases, efflux, etc were not examined nor were CRISPRi knockdown experiments conducted beyond an experiment to tease out the role of Arr-X and Arr-1 in one strain. The general claim that intra-bacterial antibiotic accumulation does not predict potency in mycobacteria may be another over-generalization based on the limited number of drugs and species studied, but perhaps the intended assertion was that antibiotic accumulation ALONE does not predict potency.</p>
