<title>Abstract</title><p>As the genome encodes the information crucial for cell growth, a sizeable genomic deficiency often causes a significant decrease in growth fitness. Whether and how the decreased growth fitness caused by genome reduction could be compensated by evolution was investigated here. Experimental evolution with an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain carrying a reduced genome was conducted in multiple lineages for approximately 1,000 generations. The growth rate, which was largely declined due to genome reduction, was considerably recovered, associated with the improved carrying capacity. Genome mutations accumulated during evolution were significantly varied across the evolutionary lineages and were randomly localized on the reduced genome. Transcriptome reorganization showed a common evolutionary direction and conserved the chromosomal periodicity, regardless of highly diversified gene categories, regulons, and pathways enriched in the differentially expressed genes. Genome mutations and transcriptome reorganization caused by evolution, which were found to be dissimilar to those caused by genome reduction, must have followed divergent mechanisms in individual evolutionary lineages. Gene network reconstruction successfully identified three gene modules functionally differentiated, which were responsible for the evolutionary changes of the reduced genome in growth fitness, genome mutation, and gene expression, respectively. The diversity in evolutionary approaches improved the growth fitness associated with the homeostatic transcriptome architecture as if the evolutionary compensation for genome reduction was like all roads leading to Rome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The genome encodes the information for cell growth, and its size is likely the evolutionary consequence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. To determine the essential genomic sequence of modern cells, removing redundant DNA sequences from the wild-type genome in bacteria, so-called genome reduction, has been challenged to a large extent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. These efforts have been made to discover the minimal genetic requirement for a free-living organism growing under the defined conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. It resulted in the finding of the coordination of genome with cell growth, i.e., genome reduction significantly decreased the growth rate of <italic>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</italic> cells independent of culture media or growth forms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Slow growth or fitness decline was commonly observed in the genetically reduced <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and chemically synthesized genomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The growth decrease could be recovered by experimental evolution. Growth fitness generally represents the adaptiveness of the living organism to the defined environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Although the reduced genomes somehow showed differentiated evolvability compared to the wild-type genomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, their evolutionary adaptation to the environmental changes has been successfully achieved <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Experimental evolution under the defined culture condition successfully increased the decreased growth rates of the reduced genomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and fastened the slow-growing synthetic genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The evolutionary rescue of the growth rate must be associated with the changes in genomic sequence and gene expression benefited for the growth fitness, as what happened in nature adaptive evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Our previous study showed that the decreased growth rate caused by the absence of a sizeable genomic sequence could be complemented by introducing the mutations elsewhere in the genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, the changes in growth rate caused by either genome reduction or experimental evolution were dependent on the genome size but not the specific gene function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A genome-wide understanding of the evolutionary compensated fitness increase of the reduced genome is required. The experimental evolution compensated for the genome reduction-mediated growth changes were considered stringently related to transcriptome reorganization. Our previous studies found the conserved features in transcriptome reorganization, although the gene expression patterns were significantly disturbed by either genome reduction or experimental evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. It indicated that experimental evolution rescued the growth rate disturbed by genome reduction <italic>via</italic> the underlying mechanisms to maintain homeostasis as a growing cell. How the growth recovery of reduced genomes was achieved and whether it was in general are unclear. To address the questions, we conducted the experimental evolution with a reduced genome in multiple lineages and analyzed the evolutionary changes of the genome and transcriptome in the present study.</p>

<title>Fitness recovery of the reduced genome by experimental evolution</title>
<p>Experimental evolution of the reduced genome was conducted to regain the growth fitness, which was decreased due to genome reduction. Serial transfer was performed with multiple dilution rates to keep the bacterial growth within the exponential phase (Fig. S1), as described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Nine evolutionary lineages were conducted independently (Fig. S2, Table S1). A gradual increase in growth rate was observed along with the generation passage, which was combined with a rapid increase in the early evolutionary phase and a slow increase in the later phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Most evolved populations (Evos) showed improved growth fitness. Nevertheless, the final growth rates were considerably varied (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, upper), and the evolutionary dynamics of the nine lineages were somehow divergent (Fig. S2). It indicated the diversity in the evolutionary approaches for improved fitness. Eight of nine Evos achieved faster growth than the genome-reduced ancestor (Anc), whereas all Evos decreased in their saturated population densities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, bottom). In comparison to the wild-type strain carrying the full-length genome (WT), the primarily decreased growth rate caused by genome reduction was significantly improved by experimental evolution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, upper), associated with the considerable reduction in saturated density (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, bottom). It demonstrated that the experimental evolution could compensate for the genome reduction with a trade-off in population size (carrying capacity), consistent with the previous findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, a positive correlation was observed between the growth fitness and the carrying capacity of the Evos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). It seemed that the present experimental evolution did not obey the <italic>r/K</italic> selection theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, which was known as the trade-off relationship (negative correlation) between the growth rate and the carrying capacity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Taking account of our previous finding that the colony growth rates of genome-reduced strains were proportional to the colony sizes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, the collapse of the trade-off law likely resulted from genome reduction. As the trade-off between growth fitness and carrying capacity was proposed to balance the cellular metabolism that resulted from the cost of enzymes involved <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, the deleted genomic sequences might play a role in maintaining the metabolism balance.</p>

<title>Significant variation and random localization of genome mutations</title>
<p>Genome resequencing (Table S2) identified a total of 65 mutations fixed in the nine Evos (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The number of mutations largely varied among the nine Evos, from two to 13, and no common mutation was detected (Table S3). 51 out of 65 mutations occurred in the genes, and 45 out of 51 were SNPs. As 36 out of 45 SNPs were nonsynonymous, the mutated genes might benefit the fitness increase. In addition, the abundance of mutations was unlikely to be related to the magnitude of fitness increase. For instance, A2 accumulating only two mutations presented a highly increased growth rate compared to F2 of eight mutations (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which poorly improved the growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). B2, D2, and E2 all succeeded in fitness increase to an equivalent degree (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), whereas they fixed 13, 7, and 3 mutations, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The mutated genes were varied in 14 gene categories, somehow more frequently in the gene categories of Transporter, Enzyme, and Unknown function (Fig. S3). They seemed highly related to essentiality, as 11 out of 49 mutated genes were essential (Table S3). As the essential genes were known to be more conserved than nonessential ones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, the high frequency of the mutations fixed in the essential genes suggested the mutation in essentiality for fitness increase was the evolutionary strategy for reduced genome. The large variety in genome mutations and no correlation of mutation abundance to fitness improvement strongly suggested that no mutations were specifically responsible or crucially essential for recovering the growth rate of the reduced genome.</p>

<p>Additionally, there were no overlapped genomic positions for the 65 mutations in the nine Evos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Random simulation was performed to verify whether there was any bias or hotspot in the genomic location for mutation accumulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The simulation of 65 mutations randomly occurred on the reduced genome was performed 1,000 times. The distance of the mutation (mutated genomic location) to the nearest genomic scar caused by genome reduction was calculated. Welch’s t-test was performed to evaluate the significance of the locational bias between the random mutations and the mutations accumulated in the Evos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). As the mean of <italic>p</italic> values from simulations was insignificant (μ<sub>p</sub> &gt; 0.05), there was no locational bias for mutation accumulation caused by genome reduction.</p>

<title>Common evolutionary direction and homeostasis in transcriptome reorganization</title>
<p>Since no specificity was detected in the genome mutations, whether these mutations disturbed the genome-wide gene expression pattern was investigated. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the evolved transcriptomes were directed to similar patterns but divergent to the WT transcriptome (Fig. S4). The evolutionary direction of the transcriptomes of the reduced genome was not approaching the wild-type transcriptome. As a global feature of gene expression, the chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptome was analyzed using the Fourier transform as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. As a result, the transcriptomes of all Evos presented a common six-period with statistical significance, equivalent to those of the wild-type and ancestral reduced genomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, Table S4). It demonstrated that the chromosomal architecture of gene expression patterns remained highly conserved, regardless of the considerably varied mutations. The homeostatic periodicity was consistent with our previous findings that the chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptome was independent of genomic or environmental variation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition, the genomic locations of the mutations seemed irrelevant to chromosomal periodicity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, red lines). No mutagenesis hotspot was observed even if these mutations were accumulated on a single genome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Alternatively, the expression levels of the mutated genes were somehow higher than those of the remaining genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), which sounded reasonable. The ratio of the essential genes in the mutated genes was ∼ 22% (Table S3), much higher than the ratio (∼9%) of essential to all genes (302 out of 3,290) in the reduced genome. As the essential genes showed higher expression levels than the nonessential ones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, the high essentiality of the mutated genes might result in a higher mean expression level. On the other hand, the high frequency of the mutations fixed in the essential genes was unexpected because the essential genes were generally more conserved than nonessential ones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. It strongly suggested the essentiality mutation for homeostatic transcriptome architecture happened in the reduced genome.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Diversified functions and pathways of the differentially expressed genes</title>
<p>As the evolved transcriptomes were differentiated from those of the WT and reduced genomes (Fig. S4), the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were further identified to discover the gene functions or biological processes contributing to the fitness changes. The abundance of DEGs among the Evos varied from 333 to 1,130 genes and of few overlaps (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Most DEGs were unique to each evolutionary lineage, and the common DEGs across all Evos were only 108 genes (Table S5). The number of DEGs partially overlapped among the Evos declined significantly along with the increased lineages of Evos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Enrichment analysis showed that only the histidine-related pathways were significantly enriched in the common DEGs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Functional enrichment of the DEGs in individual Evos showed that the amino acid metabolism considerably participated and that the enriched pathways were poorly overlapped (Fig. S5). These findings strongly suggested no universal rule for evolutionary changes of the reduced genome.</p>

</fig>
<p>In comparison, 1,226 DEGs were induced by genome reduction. The common DEGs of genome reduction and evolution varied from 168 to 540, fewer than half of the DEGs responsible for genome reduction in all Evos (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The conclusion remained consistent even if the DEGs were determined with an alternative method, RankProd (Fig. S6). Functional enrichment of the DEGs observed the specific transcriptional regulation and metabolic pathways participating in the transcriptome reorganization in response to genome reduction and evolution. Only σ38 was enriched in the genome reduction-mediated DEGs, which was the only regulon that partially overlapped with the Evos (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). No regulon in common was enriched, besides a few partially overlapped regulons, i.e., GadW, GadX, and RcsB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In addition, both the number of enriched pathways and their overlaps were significantly differentiated among the nine Evos or between Evos and reduced genome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). No common pathways were commonly enriched between the genome reduction-mediated DEGs and Evos, no matter annotated the metabolic pathways with GO or KEGG (Fig. S7). The flagellar assembly, the only enriched pathway in genome reduction-mediated DEGs, was absent in all Evos (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Alternatively, the amino acids-related metabolisms were frequently detected in the Evos, e.g., histidine metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, etc. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, Fig. S7). The variable pathways in the Evos indicated that evolution compensated for the genome reduction in various ways, which differed from how the genome reduction was caused.</p>

<title>Gene modules responsible for the evolutionary changes of the reduced genome</title>
<p>Genome mutation analysis and transcriptome analysis failed to identify the common gene categories or pathways that correlated to the evolution of the reduced genome; thus, the gene modules correlated to evolution were newly evaluated. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> was performed toward the evolved transcriptomes as tested previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Reconstruction of the 3,290 genes in the reduced genome led to 21 gene modules, comprising 8 to 320 genes per module (Fig. S8). Hierarchical clustering of these modules showed that roughly three major classes could be primarily divided (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Functional correlation analysis showed that three of 21 modules (M2, M10, and M16) were highly significantly correlated to the growth fitness, the number of DEGs, and mutation frequency, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). It indicated that the three modules were highly essential and functionally differentiated for growth control, transcriptional change, and mutagenesis.</p>

<p>Enrichment analyses further identified the gene categories, regulons, and metabolisms that significantly appeared in the three modules (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Two gene categories of nonessential function were enriched in M10, and the module correlated to the number of DEGs; in contrast, no gene category was enriched in M2 and M16 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, left). All three modules successfully enriched the regulons without overlaps (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, middle). It indicates that the main regulatory mechanisms participating in the three modules for growth control, transcriptional change, and mutagenesis were divergent. GO enrichment resulted in various biological processes in the three modules, roughly related to transport, transposition, and translation in M2, M10, and M16, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, right). Compared to the enriched functions of the genes that disappeared due to genome reduction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, bottom), the gene categories of phage and unknown function and the biological processes related to DNA transposition and integration were commonly identified in M10. It strongly indicated that M10 was responsible for genome reduction. The newly constructed gene networks successfully identified three modules correlated to mutation, DEGs, and growth, revealing the functional differentiation responsible for evolution to maintain the homeostatic transcriptome architecture for a growing cell.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The evolutionary compensation for genome reduction was directed toward an identical goal of increased fitness but differentiated in the manner of genomic changes. Firstly, various genetic functions seemed to trigger the increased growth rates of the Evos. A few mutations could compensate for the sizeable genomic deficiency. The considerable variation in the fixed mutations without overlaps among the nine Evos (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) implied no common mutagenetic strategy for the evolutionary improvement of growth fitness. It was supported by the fact that no genomic locational bias for mutations fixed in the evolution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Secondly, the transcriptomes presented conserved chromosomal architectures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and universal directional changes (Fig. S4), regardless of the significant and differentiated changes in gene expression in response to evolution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, Fig. S5). Although the periodicity of chromosomal architecture was well known <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> and coordinated to the bacterial growth rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, employing its homeostasis as the evolutionary consequence provided a conceptual and unique understanding of growing cells.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether the differentiation in evolutionary paths was particularly significant for the reduced genome used in the present study. Evolution studies often focus on finding the common mutations accumulated in multiple evolutionary lineages to obtain the reasonable mechanism responsible for the adaptation to the defined condition (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, i</xref>). Common mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> or identical genetic functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> were reported in the experimental evolution with different reduced genomes. Nevertheless, divergent evolutionary mechanisms were proposed as not all mutations contribute to the evolved fitness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The present study accentuated the variety of mutations fixed during evolution. Considering the high essentiality of the mutated genes (Table S3), most or all mutations were assumed to benefit the fitness increase, partially demonstrated previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The differentiated mutations and DEGs guided to a homeostatic (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, iii</xref>) rather than a variable consequence (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, ii</xref>). Multiple evolutionary paths for the reduced genome to improve growth fitness were likely all roads leading to Rome.</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition, the transcriptome reorganization for fitness increase triggered by evolution differed from that for fitness decrease caused by genome reduction. General analyses failed to detect the regulatory network or genetic function mediated by genome reduction and evolution in common. Instead, the newly constructed gene modules successfully enriched the gene categories of mobile elements and unknown functions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, left) as the evolutionary compensation for genome reduction. The represented mobile elements, flagella, were known to be responsive to environmental stresses such as hypoosmotic pressure or pH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Genome reduction and evolution seemed equivalent to the stress response in <italic>E. coli</italic>. These findings were reasonable as enterobactin protected <italic>E. coli</italic> from oxidative stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, and enterobactin biosynthesis was upregulated for biofilm formation in genome-reduced <italic>E. coli</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. The compensation of evolution to genome reduction not only verified the known function and mechanism from a global regulatory viewpoint but also revealed a novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms and gene functions.</p>
<p>The discriminated functions of gene modules might play a crucial role in response to genomic and evolutionary changes. WGCNA was conducted to discover the potential correlation of gene expression to growth fitness. It succeeded in finding the genes participating in the evolutionary changes of the reduced genome to regain growth fitness. Three enriched gene modules were assumed separately responsible for replication, transcription, and population dynamics (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). The growth-correlated gene module significantly enriched the iron-related biological functions (M2). Although the translation was commonly reported to be correlated to the growth rate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, it was enriched in the gene module coordinated to transcriptional changes (M10). Such functional differentiation of the gene modules might connect with the differentiated medium components responsible for varied bacterial growth phases, which was observed using the high-throughput growth assay in hundreds of medium combinations combined with machine learning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. We assumed that the various chemicals disturbed different metabolic fluxes in which different gene modules might have participated. The biological meaningfulness of the gene modules suggested an alternative genetic classification besides the commonly used clustering criteria, such as Gene Orthology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> and Regulon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. In summary, the present study provided a representative example showing multiple evolutionary paths (i.e., gene mutation and expression) directed the reduced genome to the improved fitness with the homeostatic transcriptome.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> report studies the recovery of genome-reduced bacterial cells in laboratory evolution experiments to understand how they regain their fitness. Through the analysis of gene expression and a series of tests, the authors discover distinct molecular changes in the evolved bacterial strains and propose that various mechanisms are employed to offset the effects of a reduced genome. While the findings have intriguing implications for understanding genome evolution, it is crucial to note that the evidence supporting these claims is <bold>incomplete</bold> due to insufficient experimental tests and statistical analysis.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors explored how the reduced growth fitness, resulting from genome reduction, can be compensated through evolution. They conducted an evolution experiment with a strain of Escherichia coli that carried a reduced genome, over approximately 1,000 generations. The authors carried out sequencing and found no clear genetic signatures of evolution across replicate populations. They carry out transcriptomics and a series of analyses that lead them to conclude that there are divergent mechanisms at play in individual evolutionary lineages. The authors used gene network reconstruction to identify three gene modules functionally differentiated, correlating with changes in growth fitness, genome mutation, and gene expression, respectively, due to evolutionary changes in the reduced genome.</p>
<p>I think that this study addresses an interesting question. Many microbial evolution experiments evolve by loss of function mutations, but presumably, a cell that has already lost so much of its genome needs to find other mechanisms to adapt. Experiments like this have the potential to study &quot;constructive&quot; rather than &quot;destructive&quot; evolution.</p>
<p>At the top of the results, the authors should say what species they're working with and give some background about the nature of the reduced genome. It is important to know what the changes were and especially how much of the genome was deleted. Some insights into the genes that were deleted would also be useful context for understanding the evolution experiment. This could be included in the introduction or results.</p>

<p>This manuscript describes an adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) study with a previously constructed genome-reduced E. coli. The growth performance of the end-point lineages evolved in M63 medium was comparable to the full-length wild-type level at lower cell densities. Subsequent mutation profiling and RNA-Seq analysis revealed many changes in the genome and transcriptomes of the evolved lineages. The authors did a great deal of analyzing the patterns of evolutionary changes between independent lineages, such as the chromosomal periodicity of transcriptomes, pathway enrichment analysis, weight gene co-expression analysis, and so on. They observed a striking diversity in the molecular characteristics amongst the evolved lineages, which, as they suggest, reflect divergent evolutionary strategies adopted by the genome-reduced organism.</p>
<p>As for the overall quality of the manuscript, I am rather torn. The manuscript leans towards elaborating observed findings, rather than explaining their biological significance. For this reason, readers are left with more questions than answers. For example, fitness assay on reconstituted (single and combinatorial) mutants was not performed, nor was any supporting evidence on the proposed contributions of each mutant provided. This leaves the nature of mutations - be they beneficial, neutral, or deleterious, the presence of epistatic interactions, and the magnitude of fitness contribution, largely elusive. Also, it is difficult to tell whether the RNA-Seq analysis in this study managed to draw biologically meaningful conclusions or instill insight into the nature of genome-reduced bacteria. The analysis primarily highlighted the differences in transcriptome profiles among each lineage based on metrics such as 'DEG counts' and the 'GO enrichment'. However, I could not see any specific implications regarding the biology of the evolved minimal genome drawn. In their concluding remark, 'Multiple evolutionary paths for the reduced genome to improve growth fitness were likely all roads leading to Rome,' the authors observed the first half of the sentence, but the distinctive characteristics of 'all roads' or 'evolutionary paths', which I think should have been the key aspect in this investigation, remains elusive.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Studying evolutionary trajectories provides important insight into the genetic architecture of adaptation and provides a potential contribution to evaluating the predictability (or unpredictability) of biological processes involving adaptation. While many papers in the field address adaptation to environmental challenges, the number of studies on how genomic contexts, such as large-scale variation, can impact evolutionary outcomes adaptation is relatively low. This research experimentally evolved a genome-reduced strain for ~1000 generations with 9 replicates and dissected their evolutionary changes. Using the fitness assay of OD measurement, the authors claimed that there is a general trend of increasing growth rate and decreasing carrying capacity, despite a positive correlation among all replicates. The authors also performed genomic and transcriptomic research at the end of experimental evolution, claiming the dissimilarity in the evolution at the molecular level.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The experimental evolution approach with a high number of replicates provides a good way to reveal the generality/diversity of the evolutionary routes.</p>
<p>The assay of fitness, genome, and transcriptome all together allows a more thorough understanding of the evolutionary scenarios and genetic mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
My major concern is the current form of statistical analysis leads to the conclusion that the dissimilarity is not very strong. Adding some more statistical analysis should substantially improve the strength of the manuscript. As mentioned in the Discussion, I understand that there are more available methods to test for generality in experimental evolution but less for diversity. When it is improper to use a canonical statistical test, a test with some simulation and resampling can be useful. For example, I particularly appreciate the analysis done in Figure 2B. An analysis like that should be done more throughout the entire manuscript.</p>
