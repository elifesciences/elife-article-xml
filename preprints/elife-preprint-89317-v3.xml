<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The discovery of a new neurotransmitter, especially one in the central nervous system (CNS), is both important and difficult. We have been searching for new neurotransmitters for 12 years. We detected creatine (Cr) in synaptic vesicles (SVs), at a level lower than glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) but higher than acetylcholine (ACh) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). SV Cr was reduced in mice lacking either arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT, a Cr synthetase) or SLC6A8, a Cr transporter with mutations among the most common causes of intellectual disability (ID) in men. Calcium-dependent release of Cr was detected after stimulation in brain slices. Cr release was reduced in SLC6A8 and AGAT mutants. Cr inhibited neocortical pyramidal neurons. SLC6A8 was necessary for Cr uptake into synaptosomes. Cr was found by us to be taken up into SVs in an ATP dependent manner. Our biochemical, chemical, genetic and electrophysiological results are consistent with the possibility of Cr as a neurotransmitter, though not yet reaching the level of proof for the now classic transmitters. Our novel approach to discover neurotransmitters is to begin with analysis of contents in SVs before defining their function and physiology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neural signaling depends on chemical transmission between neurons and their target cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Neurotransmission depends on chemicals such as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and neuropeptides. Decades of work, sometimes with convoluted paths, were involved before a molecule was established as a classic neurotransmitter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Initial hints about cholinergic signaling were obtained in the 1800s <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Choline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and acetylcholine (ACh) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> were discovered decades before their pharmacological effects were found around the turn of 20<sup>th</sup> century <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Henry Dale and colleagues realized similarities of ACh and parasympathetic stimulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> but it was not until 1929 when ACh was detected in the body <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and 1934 when ACh was proven a neurotransmitter in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. It took nearly 100 years from the finding of the effects of supradrenal gland damage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> or removal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, the observation of an activity in the supradrenal gland <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, the isolation of an inactive derivative <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and the successful isolation of adrenaline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, the notice of similarities between adrenaline and sympathetic stimulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, to the mid-1940s when Ulf von Euler proved that noradrenaline (NA) was the neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nerves <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. While it is not easy to establish a molecule as a neurotransmitter in the PNS, it is even harder to establish a central nervous system (CNS) neurotransmitter. Three decades elapsed between the time when ACh was proven to be a PNS neurotransmitter and the time when it was established as a CNS neurotransmitter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> and two decades between NA as a peripheral transmitter and a central transmitter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>If a neurotransmitter acts only in the CNS, but not in the PNS, it is much more difficult to discover or to prove. Most neurotransmitters were discovered for their effects on peripheral tissues, with muscle contraction or relaxation as a major readout. Glutamate (Glu) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> were discovered partly because of their peripheral effects and partly because of their effects on spinal neurons. There is no reason for central neurotransmitters to also act peripherally, but relatively little efforts have been reported to find small molecule neurotransmitters acting only on CNS neurons with no peripheral bioassays available. Premature assumptions and technical difficulties are among the major reasons why the hunt for neurotransmitters has not been a highly active area of research over the last three decades.</p>
<p>Are there more neurotransmitters and how can they be discovered? Classic neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles (SVs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. They are released upon electric stimulation before being degraded enzymatically or taken up into the presynaptic terminal by cytoplasmic transporters and into SVs by vesicular transporters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Most of the major textbooks list either 3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> or 4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> criteria of a neurotransmitter: presence in presynaptic neurons, release upon stimulation, action on postsynaptic neurons, mechanism of removal. Some molecules commonly accepted as neurotransmitters still do not meet all the criteria listed in different textbooks, but they nonetheless play important functional roles in the CNS and their defects cause human diseases. Over time, different small molecules have been proposed to function as neurotransmitters (e.g., 46,73), but none satisfies all the criteria. Robust and reliable detection of the candidate molecule in SVs is often, though not always, the problem (cf. 74).</p>
<p>Beginning in 2011, we have been actively searching for new neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain. We have tried different approaches, including searching for neuroactive substances in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and following transporters potentially localized in the SVs. One approach that we have now taken to fruition is the purification of the SVs from mouse brains coupled with chemical analysis of their contents. We have found known transmitters such as Glu, GABA, ACh, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). But more importantly, we have reproducibly detected creatine (Cr) in SVs.</p>
<p>Cr was discovered in 1832 by Michel-Eugène Chevreul <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> and has long been considered as an energy buffer in the muscle and the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. Half of Cr in a mammalian animal is thought to come from diet and the rest from endogenous synthesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Most of the Cr is present in the muscle but it is also present in the brain. Although most of the endogenous Cr is synthesized in the kidney, the pancreas and the liver <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>, Cr is also synthesized in the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Solute carriers (SLC) contribute to both cytoplasmic and vesicular transporters. With 19 members in humans, family 6 (SLC6) are secondary active transporters relying on electrochemical Na<sup>+</sup> or H<sup>+</sup> gradients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. SLC6 is also known as the neurotransmitter transporter (NTT) family because some members transport neurotransmitters such as GABA (by SLC6A1 or GABA transporter 1, GAT1; SLC6A13 or GAT2; SLC6A11 or GAT3) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>, NA (by SLC6A2 or NA transporter,</p>
<p>NET) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, dopamine (by SLC6A3 or DAT) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>, 5-HT (by SLC6A4 or serotonin transporter, SERT) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>, and glycine (by SLC6A9, or GlyT1; SLC6A5 or GlyT2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>. Cr is transported by SLC6A8 (also known as CrT, CT1 or CRCT) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup>. In addition to peripheral organs and tissues, SLC6A8 is also expressed in the nervous system where it is mainly in neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup>. SLC6A8 protein could be found on the plasma membrane of neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The functional significance of SLC6A8 in the brain is supported by symptoms of humans defective in SLC6A8. Mutations in SLC6A8 were found in human patients with intellectual disability (ID), delayed language development, epileptic seizures and autistic-like behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup>. They are collectedly known as Cr transporter deficiency (CTD), with ID as the hallmark. Particular vulnerability of language development has been observed in some SLC6A8 mutations which had mild ID but severe language delay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup>. CTD contributes to approximately 1 to 2.1% of X-linked mental retardation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref></sup>. While CTD is highly prevalent in ID males, it is also present in females, with an estimated carrier frequency of 0.024% <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>SLC6A8 knockout mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">127</xref></sup> showed typical symptoms of human CTD patients with early and progressive impairment in learning and memory. Mice with brain- and neuronal-specific knockout of SLC6A8 showed deficits in learning and memory without changes in locomotion caused by peripheral involvement of SLC6A8 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">129</xref></sup>. Deletion of SLC6A8 from dopaminergic neurons in the brain caused hyperactivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">130</xref></sup>. These results demonstrate that SLC6A8 is functionally important in neurons.</p>
<p>Cr deficiency syndromes (CDS) are inborn errors of Cr metabolism, which can result from defects in one of the three genes: guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">131</xref></sup>, arginine-glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">132</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">133</xref></sup>, and SLC6A8 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref></sup>. That they all show brain disorders indicates the functional importance of Cr in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">134</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">137</xref></sup>. Cr uptake was observed previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c220">220</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c221">221</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we first biochemically purified SVs from the mouse brain and discovered the presence of Cr, as well as classic neurotransmitters Glu and GABA, ACh and 5-HT, in SVs. We then detected calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) dependent releases of Cr, Glu and GABA but not ACh and 5-HT when neurons were depolarized by increased extracellular concentrations of potassium (K<sup>+</sup>). Both the level of Cr in SVs and that of Cr released upon stimulation were decreased significantly when either the gene for SLC6A8 or the gene for AGAT were eliminated genetically. When Cr was applied to slices from the neocortex, the activities of pyramidal neurons were inhibited. Furthermore, we confirmed that Cr was taken up by synaptosomes and found that Cr uptake was significantly reduced when the SLC6A8 gene was deleted. Finally, we found that Cr was transported into SVs. Thus, multidisciplinary studies with biochemistry, genetics and electrophysiology have suggested that Cr is a new neurotransmitter, though the discovery of a receptor for Cr would prove it.</p>

<title>Detection of Cr in SVs from the mouse brain</title>
<p>To search for new neurotransmitters, we tried several approaches. For example, we used Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to detect neuroactive substances in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but it was difficult to rule out existing neurotransmitters and select responses from potentially new neurotransmitters. We also transfected cDNAs for all human SLCs into dissociated cultures of primary neurons from the mouse brain and found that more than 50 out of all SLCs could be localized in SVs. However, when we used CRISPR-CAS9 to tag some of the candidate SLCs in mice, some of them were found to be expressed outside the CNS, indicating that, while ectopic expression of these candidate SLCs could be localized on SVs, the endogenous counterparts were not localized on SVs.</p>
<p>Here we report our approach using the purification of SVs as the first step (Supplementary Figure 1A) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">138</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c145">145</xref></sup>. Synaptophysin (Syp) is a specific marker for SVs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c146">146</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c149">149</xref></sup> and an anti-Syp antibody was used to immunoisolate SVs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">143</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">144</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c150">150</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c152">152</xref></sup>. Visualization by electronic microscopy (EM) (Supplementary Figure 1B, left panel) showed that the purified vesicles were homogenous, with an average diameter of 40.44 ± 0.26 nm (n=596 particles) (Supplementary Figure 1B, right panel), consistent with previous descriptions of SVs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c153">153</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c154">154</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Immunoblot analysis with twenty markers of subcellular organelles of neurons and one marker for glia (Supplementary Figure 1C) indicate that our purifications were highly effective, with SV markers detected after purification with the anti-Syp antibody, but not that with the control immunoglobulin G (IgG). SV proteins included Syp <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c146">146</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c149">149</xref></sup>, synaptotagmin (Syt1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c155">155</xref></sup>, synatobrevin2 (Syb2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c156">156</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c157">157</xref></sup>, SV2A <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c158">158</xref></sup>, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c159">159</xref></sup>, and vesicular neurotransmitter transporters for glutamate (VGLUT1, VGLUT2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c160">160</xref></sup> and GABA (VGAT) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c161">161</xref></sup>.

These results indicated that the SVs we obtained were of high integrity and purity.</p>
<p>To detect and quantify small molecules as candidate transmitters present in the purified SVs, capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) was optimized and utilized (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, Supplementary Figure 1A) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">151</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c170">170</xref></sup>. We found that the levels of classical neurotransmitters such as Glu, GABA, ACh and 5-HT were significantly higher in SVs pulled down by the anti-Syp antibody than those in lysates pulled down by the control IgG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 A-E</xref>). Consistent with previous reports <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">144</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">151</xref></sup>, significant enrichment of neurotransmitters was observed only from SVs immunoisolated at near 0 °C, but not at the room temperature (RT) (Figure1 A-E).

<p>The amount of Glu was 171.1 ± 5.4 pmol/μg anti-Syp antibody (n=10, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), approximately 10 times that of GABA (n=10,17.81 ± 1.47 pmol/μg anti-Syp antibody, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The amount of ACh was 1.29 ± 0.10 pmol/μg anti-Syp antibody (n=10, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), approximately 0.072 that of GABA. The amount of 5-HT was 0.096 ± 0.017 pmol/μg anti-Syp antibody (n=10, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, our purification and detection methods were highly reliable and sensitive enough to detect established neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Under the same conditions, we also detected Cr in SVs (n=14, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). Amount of Cr in the SVs was found to be 3.43 ± 0.40 pmol/μg anti-Syp antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), which was approximately 2% of Glu, 19% of GABA, 266% of ACh and 3573% of 5-HT. It is unlikely that these could be attributable to different levels for different neurotransmitters in each SV, but more likely attributable to the relative abundance of SVs containing different neurotransmitters. 85% to 90% neurons in the mouse brain were glutamatergic while 10%-15% were GABAergic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c171">171</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c173">173</xref></sup>, which can explain our detection of Glu as approximately 10 times that of GABA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> B and C). Similarly, cholinergic neurons (5.67−10<sup>5</sup>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c174">174</xref></sup> represented 0.81% of total number of neurons (approximately 70 million) in the mouse brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c175">175</xref></sup>, serotonergic neurons (approximately 26,000) for 0.037% of total neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c175">175</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c176">176</xref></sup>. Assuming that the content of each neurotransmitter in a single SV is similar, extrapolation from the above data would suggest that approximately 1.3% to 2.15% of neurons in the mouse brain are creatinergic.</p>
<p>To distinguish whether small molecules co-purified with SVs were in the SVs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">143</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">144</xref></sup>, or that they were just associated with the outside of SVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c154">154</xref></sup>, we tested the dependence of the presence of these molecules in the SVs on temperature and on the electrochemical gradient of H<sup>+</sup>. Cr was significantly reduced in SVs purified at the room temperature as compared to that immunoisolated at near 0 °C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), supporting the presence of Cr inside, instead of outside, SVs.</p>
<p>Classical neurotransmitters are stored in SVs with an acidic environment inside (pH of 5.6 ∼ 6.4) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c177">177</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c179">179</xref></sup>. To further verify the storage of Cr in SVs and examine the role of H<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient, we applied pharmacological inhibitors during purification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c180">180</xref></sup>. The proton ionophore FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-4-(tri-fluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone) was used to dissipate H<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c180">180</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c181">181</xref></sup>. FCCP significantly reduced the amount of Cr as well as classical neurotransmitters in SVs (Supplementary Figure 2A-E). The extent of FCCP induced reduction was correlated with the value of pKa or PI (isoelectric point) for different molecule: 5-HT (with pKa predicted to 10 and 9.31, Supplementary Figure 2E) &gt; Cr (PI of ∼7.94, Supplementary Figure 2A) &gt; GABA (PI of 7.33, Supplementary Figure 2C) &gt; Glu (PI of 3.22, Supplementary Figure 2B). Nigericin, a K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger which dissipates ΔpH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c180">180</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c181">181</xref></sup>, also reduced the amount of Cr and classical neurotransmitters in SVs (Supplementary Figure 2A-E). Furthermore, in the presence of FCCP or nigerin, SV Cr was reduced to a level comparable to that pulled down by control IgG (Supplementary Figure 2A), demonstrating the storage of Cr in SVs was dependent on H<sup>+</sup> gradient. As a control, the non-neurotransmitter molecule alanine in SVs was not changed by the inhibitors (Supplementary Figure 2F).</p>

While Cr pulled down by IgG was not significantly different between SLC6A8<sup>-/Y</sup> and SLC6A8<sup>+/Y</sup> mice, SV Cr purified by the anti-Syp antibody from SLC6A8<sup>-/Y</sup> was reduced to approximately 1/3 that of the WT (SLC6A8<sup>+/Y</sup>) littermates (n =14, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 B-C</xref>). Compared to the IgG control, Cr in SVs was enriched in WT mice, but not in SLC6A8<sup>-/Y</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> B and C).

<p>It is unlikely that the specific reduction of Cr in SVs from SLC6A8 KO mice was due to technical artifacts.

Second, data collected by high resolution MS (Q Exactive HF-X, Thermoscientific) also revealed selective decrease of SV Cr (m/z=132.0576) from SLC6A8 KO mice (n=8, Supplementary Figure 6 B-G), as quantified by the peak area. Peak areas for Glu (n=8, Supplementary Figure 6B, m/z=148.0604), GABA (n=8, Supplementary Figure 6C, m/z=104.0712), ACh (n=8, Supplementary Figure 6D, m/z = 146.1178) and alanine (n=8, Ala, Supplementary Figure 6E, m/z=90.055) were not significantly different between SVs immmunoisolated with the anti-Syp antibody and control IgG from WT and Slc6a8 KO mice.

<p>In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, depolarization with elevated extracellular K<sup>+</sup> led to robust release of Glu and GABA in slices from WT (SLC6A8<sup>+</sup>/Y) mice (n=7 per group, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> B and C). After 10 mins wash, levels of Glu and GABA returned to the baseline (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> B and C). In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, depolarization with elevated K<sup>+</sup> led to robust release of Cr. Extracellular Cr returned to the baseline after 10 min wash (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). For quantification, the stimulated releases of metabolites were calculated by subtracting the basal levels from the total releases in response to K<sup>+</sup> stimulation. In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> stimulation induced the efflux of Glu, GABA and Cr at 0.46, 0.33 and 0.086 nmol/min, respectively (n=7 per group) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> B, C, D). From the detection limits of ACh and 5-HT in our system, we inferred that the efflux rate for ACh was lower than 0.001 nmol/min and that for 5-HT lower than 0.003 nmol/min. The efflux rate for Cr in brain slices is lower than those of Glu and GABA, but higher than those for ACh and 5-HT.</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of transmitter release was examined by comparing responses to ACSF without Ca<sup>2+</sup> or elevated K<sup>+</sup> (supplemented with 1 mM EGTA), elevated extracellular K<sup>+</sup> in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (supplemented with 1 mM EGTA), or K<sup>+</sup> in presence of 2.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 E-G, n</xref>=5 per group). In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, elevated K<sup>+</sup> stimulated the release of a small but significant amount of Glu and GABA, with efflux rates at 0.056 nmol/min and 0.066 respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> E, F). In the presence of 2.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, elevated K<sup>+</sup> further augmented the release of Glu and GABA by 5 to 6 times, confirming previously reported Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent release of neurotransmitters in response to depolarization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c194">194</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c196">196</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Cr was also released both in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent and a Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). More Cr was released in response to K<sup>+</sup> stimulation in the presence of 2.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> than that in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These results demonstrate Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent release of Cr upon stimulation.</p>

<title>Reduced Cr release in SLC6A8 and AGAT mutant mice</title>
<p>We examined whether SLC6A8 KO affected K<sup>+</sup>-induced release of Cr. While Glu and GABA were released in slices from SLC6A8 KO (SLC6A8<sup>-</sup>/Y) mice at levels not significantly different from those of WT mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> B, C), release of Cr in response to K<sup>+</sup> stimulation was significantly reduced in SLC6A8<sup>-/Y</sup> mice as compared to SLC6A8<sup>+/Y</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The basal level of Cr in SLC6A8 KO mice was lower than that of WT mice. In addition, K<sup>+</sup> stimulation induced release of Cr persisted to some extent even after 10 mins of washout (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), possibly due to the inability of presynaptic terminals in SLC6A8 KO mice to reuptake Cr in the synaptic cleft (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<p>Experiments with slices from brains of SLC6A8 KO (SLC6A8<sup>-</sup>/Y) mice showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent release of either Glu or GABA was not affected by the genotype of SLC6A8 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> E and F). By contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent release of Cr was abolished in SLC6A8<sup>-</sup>/Y slices. Interestingly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent release of Cr was reduced by a third, but did not reach statistical significance, in SLC6A8<sup>-</sup>/Y slices. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the basal level of Cr was not changed in SLC6A8 KO mice. Taken together, these results indicate that there is Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent release of Cr upon stimulation and that SLC6A8 is required specifically for Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent release of Cr, but not for Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent release of other neurotransmitters such as Glu and GABA, or for Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent release of Cr. Knockout of AGAT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) selectively reduced K<sup>+</sup> evoked release of Cr, but not those of Glu or GABA (n=5 per group, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> B, C, D). Although K<sup>+</sup> stimulation still elicited Cr release from brain slices of AGAT<sup>+/-</sup> mice, the efflux rate in AGAT<sup>-/-</sup> mice was reduced to less than 10% that in AGAT<sup>+/+</sup> mice and 20% that in AGAT<sup>+/-</sup> mice.</p>

<p>Medium-sized pyramidal neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>) with a membrane capacitance (Cm) of 114.96 ± 3.92 pF (n=51, Supplementary Figure 11A) were recorded. These neurons exhibited regular firing patterns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c201">201</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c202">202</xref></sup> in response to depolarization current injection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref> and Supplementary Figure 11A) with moderate maximal evoked spiking frequencies of 10-30 spikes per 500 milliseconds (ms) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7 E-G</xref>), increasing of inter-spike intervals during depolarizing steps (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref> and Supplementary Figure 11A), high action potential amplitude (81.64 ± 1.06 mV, Supplementary Figure 12E) and large spike half-width (1.12 ± 0.031 ms, Supplementary Figure 12F).</p>
<p>Cr was bath applied only after the evoked firing pattern reached a steady state. Of the 51 neurons, 16 were inhibited by 100 μM creatine (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7 B-F</xref>). Fewer spikes were evoked in Cr responsive neurons in response to depolarizing current injections during Cr application (25 pA step, 500 ms) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7 D-F</xref>). The inhibitory effect of Cr was reversible (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7 D-F</xref>), typically observed within 2-3 min following Cr application (with maximal effect from 2 to 8 mins) and disappeared after 10 to 25 min washout. This could be repeated by a second application of Cr. The rheobase, defined as the minimal electrical current necessary to elicit an action potential, was increased during bath application of Cr (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> H). The inhibitory effect was most obvious at near spike threshold. When a neuron was depolarized with a current of 50 pA above rheobase, the number of evoked spikes was decreased dramatically during Cr application (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>). Cr also mildly inhibited the input resistance (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>), slightly hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (Supplementary Figure 12C) or reduced amplitude of afterhyperploarization (AHP) followed by the first evoked action potential (Supplementary Figure 12G).

<title>SLC6A8 dependent uptake of Cr into the synaptosomes</title>
<p>Along with enzymatic degradation, re-uptake by transporters serves as an important way to remove neurotransmitters released into the synaptic cleft. As synaptosomes contain the apparatus for neurotransmission, they are often used for studying uptake of neurotransmitters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c203">203</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To investigate whether Cr uptake into synaptosomes required SLC6A8, we first examined whether SLC6A8 was present in synaptosomes. Using Slc6a8-HA knockin mice and an anti-HA antibody, we found that SLC6A8-HA was present and enriched in crude synaptosomal fraction (P2 fraction in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, enrichment score: P2/H = 1.76 ± 0.15, n = 4) and synaptosomal fraction prepared using a discontinuous Ficoll gradient (Sy and 4-Sy fractions in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, enrichment score: Sy/H = 2.02 ±0.14, n = 4). The integrity of synaptosomes was confirmed by multiple markers of the synaptosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c203">203</xref></sup>, including the presynaptic membrane marker SNAP25 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c204">204</xref></sup> and the SV marker Syp (synaptophysin Syp) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c146">146</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c149">149</xref></sup> in presynaptic terminals, the postsynaptic density marker PSD95 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c165">165</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c166">166</xref></sup> and the postsynaptic membrane protein GluN1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c205">205</xref></sup>, the synaptic membrane protein SNAP23 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c162">162</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c164">164</xref></sup>, the plasma membrane marker Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c206">206</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c208">208</xref></sup>, and the mitochondria marker VDAC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c203">203</xref></sup>. These were all enriched in our synaptosomal preparations. The cytosol marker GAPDH was also present in synaptosomes, whereas the oligodendrocyte marker MBP was nearly absent, suggesting myelin pollution was largely avoided <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c203">203</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We have also used EM to confirm the quality of our synaptosome preparations. As reported previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c203">203</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c209">209</xref></sup>, synaptosomes were composed of membrane bounded structures (Sy in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>) filled with synaptic vesicles (SV in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>), sometimes with a segment of postsynaptic membrane along with the postsynaptic density (PSD in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>) and mitochondria (Mt in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). The sizes of synaptosomes from WT mice and <italic>Slc6a8</italic> knockout mice were similar, with areas of 0.245 ± 0.01 μm<sup>2</sup> (n=302 particles) and 0.247 ± 0.01 μm<sup>2</sup> (n=317 particles), respectively (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>
<p>We then examined whether SLC6a8 participated in Cr uptake into the synaptosomes. A mixture of 18 μM [<sup>14</sup>C]-Cr (with a total radioactivity of 0.4 μCi) and 5 μM Cr was used, and uptake at 0 °C measured at 10 mins was the baseline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c210">210</xref></sup>. Cr uptake into synaptosomes from WT mice was stimulated approximately sevenfold at 37 °C (Uptake, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>) as compared with 0 °C (Ctrl, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Cr uptake into synaptosomes from SLC6a8 knockout mice was less than 3 times as compared to its control, and was decreased to approximately 1/3 of that of WT mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Thus, SLC6A8 is necessary for uptake of Cr into the synaptosomes.</p>

<title>Cr uptake into SVs</title>
<p>Classical neurotransmitters were taken up in SVs in an ATP-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">144</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c159">159</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c181">181</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c210">210</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c211">211</xref></sup>. We examined whether Cr could be transported into SVs.</p>
<p>We used 10 μg anti-Syp antibody to purify SVs from mouse brains. Purified SVs were preincubated for 30 min to allow sufficient leakage of endogenous Cr, before being mixed with 1 mM [<sup>13</sup>C]-Cr in the presence or absence of 4 mM ATP and placed at 25 L for 10 mins to allow adequate uptake. The SV content of [<sup>13</sup>C]-Cr was then examined by CE-MS and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Significantly more [<sup>13</sup>C]-Cr were taken up by SVs in the presence of ATP, with about 10.3 pmol [<sup>13</sup>C]-Cr transported into SVs (1.03 pmol/μg α-Syp or transportation rate of 0.103 pmol/min, n=11, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, Cr could be transported into SVs in ATP-dependent manner. At this point, we do not know what is the transporter(s) on the SVs for Cr uptake. SLC6A8 is only found in plasma membrane, not on SVs, and is not a candidate for Cr uptake into SVs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While no neurotransmitter has been proven in a single paper, supportive evidence suggesting Cr as a possible new neurotransmitter has been presented here to the extent of any single previous papers.</p>
<p>At various times and by different researchers, taurine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c212">212</xref></sup>, proline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, D-aspartic acid <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c213">213</xref></sup>, hydrogen sulfide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c214">214</xref></sup>, agmatine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c215">215</xref></sup>, DOPA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c216">216</xref></sup>, estradiol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c217">217</xref></sup>, β-alanine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c218">218</xref></sup>, protons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c219">219</xref></sup> have been suspected as neurotransmitters, but they do not meet all the criteria. Some of the suspected molecules can be released upon stimulation or removed by transporters. Often, they have not been reproducibly found in SVs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our discovery of Cr in SVs significantly raised the priority of testing the candidacy of Cr, and our further investigations have led to more evidence suggesting Cr as a neurotransmitter: 1) Cr is stored in SVs; 2) Ca<sup>++</sup> dependent release of Cr upon stimulation has been observed; 3) both Cr storage in SVs and Cr release are reduced when either the gene for SLC6A8 or the gene for AGAT was deficient; and 4) Cr inhibits activities of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex; 5) Cr uptake into synaptosomes requires SLC6A8; 6) Cr uptake into SVs was ATP-dependent.</p>
<p>Of the above results, 1, 3, 4 and 6 are reported for the first time in this paper. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that detection of Cr in SVs was lower than those for Glu and GABA, but higher than those for ACh and 5-HT, placing Cr at a level in the middle of known central transmitters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The storage of Cr in SVs is dependent on preserved H<sup>+</sup> gradient (Supplementary Figure 2) and Cr can be transported into SVs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>).</p>
<p>There was a single previous report of Ca<sup>++</sup> dependent release of [<sup>3</sup>H]Cr and endogenous Cr in response to electrical stimulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c220">220</xref></sup>. We now provide evidence that Cr was released in response to extracellular K<sup>+</sup> stimulation (within 1-2 min) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Furthermore, Cr release was reduced when either the Slc6A8 or AGAT gene was removed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Although the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent component of K<sup>+</sup> evoked Cr release was smaller as compared to those of Glu and GABA, it nevertheless existed and was totally abolished by Slc6A8 knockout (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The reported electrically evoked Cr release showed more Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c220">220</xref></sup>. Taken together, our data and previous report <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c220">220</xref></sup> supported a role of Cr as a neurotransmitter. Our observation of extremely low efflux rates of 5-HT or ACh may have arisen from very limited numbers of cholinergic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c174">174</xref></sup> or serotoninergic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c176">176</xref></sup> in the sliced sections and rapid enzymatic degradation of these neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Cr uptake from the extracellular space into the cells was reported twice previously, once with brain slices showing sodium dependent uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H]Cr <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c220">220</xref></sup> and once with synaptosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c221">221</xref></sup>. Our new results have not only replicated the synaptosome Cr uptake experiment but also shown the requirement of SLC6A8, a membrane transporter expressed in synaptosomes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>), for Cr uptake into synaptosomes. Transportation of Cr into synaptosomes by Slc6A8 may function for both the clearance of Cr from the synaptic cleft and recycling of Cr into SVs residing in neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, in addition to confirming and extending previous results which have stood alone for more than a decade without replication or follow-up, we have obtained entirely new results suggesting the candidacy of Cr as a neurotransmitter. We discuss below the criteria for a neurotransmitter, Cr as a neurotransmitter, and the implications of Cr as a neurotransmitter.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Criteria of a neurotransmitter</title>
<p>The criteria for establishing a non-peptide small molecule as a neurotransmitter have varied from time to time and from author to author.</p>
<p>Some textbooks simply state that a neurotransmitter is stored presynaptically, released upon stimulation and active on postsynaptic neurons. The details of these 3 criteria can vary. For example, one textbook stipulates that “the substance must be present within the presynaptic neuron; the substance must be released in response to presynaptic depolarization, and the release must be Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent; specific receptors for the substance be present on the postsynaptic cell” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Another states that “the molecule must be synthesized and stored in the presynaptic neuron; the molecule must be released by the presynaptic axon terminal upon stimulation; the molecule, when experimentally applied, must produce a response in the postsynaptic cell that mimics the response produced by the release of neurotransmitter from the presynaptic neuron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. The neuroscience textbook most widely used internationally for the last 4 decades lists 4 criteria for a neurotransmitter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>: it is synthesized in the presynaptic neuron; it is present within vesicles and is released in amounts sufficient to exert a defined action on the postsynaptic neuron or effector organ; when administered exogenously in reasonable concentrations it mimics the action of the endogenous transmitter; a specific mechanism usually exists for removing the substance from the synaptic cleft. These are similar, but not identical, to the classic textbook on neurotransmitters: a neurotransmitter “should be synthesized and released presynaptically; it must mimic the action of the endogenous compound that is release on nerve stimulation; and where possible, a pharmacological identity is required where drugs that either potentiate or block postsynaptic responses to the endogenously released agent also act identically to the suspected neurotransmitter that is administered” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c222">222</xref></sup>. The pharmacological criterion is listed in another textbook <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c223">223</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Some authors note difficulties of establishing a CNS neurotransmitter. For example, a specialized neurotransmitter book states that “the candidate neurotransmitter should be present in the presynaptic terminal, be released when the presynaptic terminal is active, and when applied experimentally, induce faithful responses in the postsynaptic neuron. In practice, since central nervous system neurons continuously integrate diverse excitations and inhibitions, the last criterion is relaxed to demonstrating merely changes in such activity” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c224">224</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Solomon Snyder, a leading scientist of classic neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and their receptors, wrote that “designating a molecule as a transmitter depends on the criteria employed, the most common of which are that the substance is synthesized in neurons, released by their terminals, mimics the effects of physiologic neurotransmission and possess a mechanism for inactivation. However, with each new candidate the rules have been modified and broadened” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c225">225</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Evidence supporting Cr as a neurotransmitter</title>
<p>16 small molecules have been listed as neurotransmitters in the classic textbook <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Among them, adenosine, arachidonic acid, nitric oxide and carbon monoxide do not meet all four criteria, at the present. Cr appears to be better than these in meeting the criteria for a central neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>The results obtained by us in this paper have satisfied the criteria of Robinson <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c224">224</xref></sup> for Cr to be a CNS neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>The four criteria of Snyder and colleagues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c225">225</xref></sup> have been mostly met but the physiological neurotransmission would require more research because a specific synapse(s) would have to be defined and studied for putative creatinergic neurotransmission. This can take much longer in the CNS than the PNS. Some commonly accepted neurotransmitters have never satisfied this criterion in a strict sense. The mechanism of Cr removal criterion is met not only by the Cr uptake in brain slices <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c220">220</xref></sup> and in synaptosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c221">221</xref></sup>, but also by our demonstration that SLC6A8 is required for synaptosome uptake of Cr.</p>
<p>The four criteria of Kandel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> are mostly satisfied with some details requiring further research. The synthesis requirement is usually not strict because there are transmitters synthesized in some cells and transported into others where they function as transmitters. Our discovery of Cr in SVs can replace the synthesis requirement because the presence in neuronal SVs provide sufficient evidence that Cr is located in the right location to function as a neurotransmitter. The level of Cr in SVs is higher than those of ACh and 5-HT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The amount of released Cr is in the same order of magnitude as those of Glu and GABA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The criterion of a specific mechanism of removal was met by Cr uptake experiments in slices <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c220">220</xref></sup> and in synaptosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c221">221</xref></sup>, and further strengthened by our finding of SLC6A8 involvement in synaptosome uptake of Cr (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we report that Cr, at a concentration comparable to classical neurotransmitters, inhibits pyramidal neurons in specific regions of the mouse brain, with approximate 1/3 of pyramidal neurons responding to 100 μM Cr (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). In previous reports, 100 μM to 2 mM of GABA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c226">226</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c228">228</xref></sup>, 50 μM to 2 mM of Glu <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c229">229</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c230">230</xref></sup>, 1 to 100 μM of DA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c229">229</xref></sup>, 0.1-100 μM of 5-HT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c231">231</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c236">236</xref></sup> were bath applied to investigate the physiological functions of neurotransmitters. Our results revealed that, when bath applied, Cr could inhibit cortical neurons at 100 μM within several minutes, with a time course similar to that of 5-HT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c237">237</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c234">234</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c236">236</xref></sup> and DA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c229">229</xref></sup>, but significantly slower than that of Glu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c230">230</xref></sup>, GABA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c227">227</xref></sup> and 5-HT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c233">233</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In a recent report, knockout of the Slc6a8 gene increased excitation of cortical neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c267">267</xref></sup>. Electrophysiological characterization of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) found increased evoked firing frequency. Because we have shown that Cr inhibit a fraction of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>), this paper provides in vivo evidence consistent with the possibility of Cr as an inhibitory neurotransmitter.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Differences between Cr and classic neurotransmitters</title>
<p>At this point, we do not have a molecularly defined receptor for Cr, only inferring its presence from the electrophysiological responses to Cr. We speculate that Cr may act on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), rather than the fast-acting ligand-gated ion channels, such as AMPA or NMDA receptors for Glu and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor for GABA. There have been previous reports of Cr effects on neurons, including Cr as a partial agonist for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c238">238</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c241">241</xref></sup>. These effects require very high concentrations of Cr (in the ten millimolar range). There was also a report of the opposite effect: that Cr (at a concentration above 500 μM) increased neuronal excitability through NMDA receptors after incubation for 60 mins, with a time course significantly slower than those of classic neurotransmitters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c242">242</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent component of Cr release induced by extracellular K<sup>+</sup> was more prominent than those of Glu or GABA. One possibility was that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent Cr release came from glia, because high GAMT levels were reported in astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c261">261</xref></sup> and oligodendrites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c261">261</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c262">262</xref></sup>. As reported, other neuromodulators such as taurine can be released from astrocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c263">263</xref></sup> or slices <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c264">264</xref></sup> in an Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent manner. In addition, in the absence of potassium stimulation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion increased release of taurine in cultured astrocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c265">265</xref></sup> or in striatum <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c266">266</xref></sup>. Similarly, in SLC6A8 KO slices, Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>) also increased Cr baseline as compared to that in normal ACSF (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>With much longer history of research, ACh and 5-HT now have more evidence in other aspects than Cr as a central transmitter, especially because there are many agonists and antagonists for ACh and 5-HT to prove an additional criterion that is required in some <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c222">222</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c223">223</xref></sup>, but not the majority of, textbooks for a neurotransmitter. The pharmacology criterion will take some time and efforts, because, so far, no efforts have been made to find agonists or antagonists for Cr.</p>

<title>Implications of SLC6A8 and Cr</title>
<p>It is notable that SLC6A8 belongs to the neurotransmitter transporter family, with multiple members already shown to transport neurotransmitters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The uptake experiments by others and us indicate that SLC6A8 transports Cr into neurons within the brain. AGAT is also expressed in the brain, but in cells not expressing SLC6A8 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c243">243</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c244">244</xref></sup>. Cr and its precursor were thought to be transported between different cells in the nervous system. When SLC6A8 was completely missing, such as in homozygous SLC6A8 deficient patients, Cr treatment was not effective. But, if</p>
<p>SLC6A8 was partially active, Cr was effective <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c245">245</xref></sup>. Intractable epilepsy in a female with heterozygous SLC6A8 mutation was completely treated by Cr <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c246">246</xref></sup>. Our data of inhibitory effect of creatine on cortical neurons might provide a new mechanism to its anti-epileptic activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c247">247</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The absence of SLC6A8 expression in astrocytes whose endfeet lining microcapillary endothelial cells (MCEC) form the blood-brain barrier (BBB) indicates that Cr in the brain does not rely on import from the periphery and is instead mainly synthesized in the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c248">248</xref></sup>. SLC6A8 functions within the brain to transport Cr and its precursors, not as a major contributor of Cr transport across the BBB. It is thought to mediate Cr uptake into the presynaptic terminal, based on studies of synaptosomes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c221">221</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Cr is known to have effects other than an energy source, and Cr supplement has been thought to be beneficial for children, pregnant and lactating women, and old people <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c249">249</xref></sup>. Cr has been reported to improve human mental performance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c250">250</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c255">255</xref></sup>. Cr has been used as potential treatment in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c256">256</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c257">257</xref></sup>. Our work will stimulate further research to distinguish which of the previously suspected effects of Cr is not attributed to its role as an energy storage, but can be attributed to its role as a neurotransmitter.</p>

<title>Search for new neurotransmitters</title>
<p>Our work may stimulate the search for more neurotransmitters. Our discovery indicates that the hunt for neurotransmitters stopped decades ago because of technical difficulties, not due to absence of more neurotransmitters. The fact that most of the known small molecule neurotransmitters have been found because of their peripheral effects also argues that what is missing is the concerted efforts to uncover central neurotransmitters with no peripheral effects. New neurotransmitters may be discovered from candidates which have been long suspected, and from previously unsuspected molecules or even previously unknown molecules.</p>
<p>Innovative approaches should be taken to uncover molecules with no previous suspicions or hints. Highly purified SVs, SVs from different regions of the brain, SVs with specific SLCs offer some of the starting points for future research.</p>

<title>Isolation of synaptic vesicles</title>
<p>Our purification procedures for synaptic vesicles were based on previously established immunoisolation methods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">143</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">151</xref></sup>. Protein G magnetic beads (cat no.88848, Thermofisher Scienctific) were washed three times with IP buffer (100 mM potassium tartrate, 4 mM HEPES-KOH, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). 5 μg monoclonal anti-Syp antibody directed against a cytoplasmic epitope (cat no 101011, synaptic systems, Germany) or control mouse IgG (10400C, Thermofisher Scientific) was used to incubate with 20-30 μl beads for 30 mins at RT in 2% BSA dissolved in IP buffer. Under this condition, 4-4.5 μg of antibody was coupled, as determined by Western blot and Commassie Blue staining. Immunoisolation of SVs were carried out at 0 °C-2 °C to prevent vesicular content leakage (with RT as a control). Briefly, the whole mouse brain was homogenized in 3 ml of IP buffer with a glass/Teflon homogenizer (20 strokes at 2000 rpm, WHEATON, USA and WIGGENS WB2000-M, Germany) immediately after decapitation. Homogenates were centrifuged for 25 mins at 35,000 x g and the supernatant was adjusted to approximately 3 mg/ml protein (Nanodrop 2000 C, Thermofisher Scientific). To capture the SVs for content detection, about 200 μl of supernatants (per 5 μg anti-Syp/IgG) were incubated with pre-coupled beads for 2.25 h under slow rotation at 2 °C. Beads were washed 6 times for further Western blot analysis and vesicular content detection. For pharmacological blockade of H<sup>+</sup>-gradient across SV membrane, the mix of supernatants and pre-coupled beads was diluted into 1.2 ml before the addition of inhibitors.</p>

<title>Determination of vesicular contents</title>
<p>To extract SV contents, immunoisolates were treated with 50 μl ultra-pure water. 100 μl methanol together with 100 μl acetonitrile were added to precipitate proteins in samples. After centrifugation for 20 mins at 168000 × g, supernatants were collected and centrifuged for 20 mins at 2000 × g to remove beads and proteins. Samples were pre-frozen with liquid nitrogen and vacuum dried at −45 °C overnight. Dried samples were kept frozen and re-suspended with 50 μl of 0.2 μM <sup>13</sup>C-creatine (internal control) immediately before detection.</p>
<p>Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) was used to verify and quantify small molecules. CE/MS detection was applied with the coupling of PA800 plus CE system (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and mass spectrometry (TRIPLE QUAD 5500, AB SCIEX or Q Exactive HF-X, Thermo Scientific). Before SV content detection, we optimized MS detection of classical neuro transmitters, Cr and amino acids in positive ion mode. Firstly, the fragment ions (Q3) for a given molecule (precursor ions, Q1) were determined by either systematic scanning of standard sample solution (0.1 μM in 10% acetate acid) or referring to database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mzcloud.org">www.mzcloud.org</ext-link>). Secondly, optimal values of collision energy (CE), collision cell exit potential (CXP) and declustering potentials (DP) were determined for each pair of Q1/Q3. Thirdly, optimal combination of parameters (Q1/Q3, CE, CXP, DP) was chosen for each molecule. In addition, parameters were adjusted every 2 to 3 months for best signal to noise ratios.</p>
<p>CE/MS separations were carried out by capillaries (OptiMS silica surface cartridge, BECKMAN COULTER). The CE background electrolyte was 10 % acetate acid. Each new separation capillary was activated with rinsing under100 psi sequentially with methanol for 10 mins (forward), methanol for 3 mins (reverse), H<sub>2</sub>O for 10 mins (forward), H<sub>2</sub>O for 3 mins (reverse), 0.1 M NaOH for 10 mins (forward), water for 5 mins (reverse), 0.1 M HCl for 10 mins (forward), followed by water for 10 mins and then 10 % acetate acid for 10 mins (forward) and 3 mins (reverse), prior to the first use. Between analyses, the capillary was rinsed with 10% acetate acid under a 100 psi pressure for 5 min (forward) flowed by 75 psi for 4 min. The sample (50 μl) was injected with 2.5-4 psi for 30 s. Separation voltage of 25 kV was applied for 25 mins. To maintain stably spray during CE separation, ion spray voltage was applied at 1.7-1.9 kV. MS data were collected 5 mins after CE separation. Finally, the capillary was washed with 10% acetate acid for 10 mins, followed by methanol for 20 min and then10% acetate acid for 20 mins.</p>
<p>Standard solutions of 0.2 μM <sup>13</sup>C-Cr (internal control) and analytes were used to plot standard curves.

We waited for 30 seconds to allow K<sup>+</sup> stimulus to immerse the slices (dead volume for solution transition of 200 μl and chamber volume of 200 μl), then the sample “70 mM K” in response to K-ACSF was collected for another 1 min. Following 10 min of washout period, we collected the third sample of “wash” for 1 min.</p>
<p>To detect Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent release, slices were pre-incubated for 10 mins with normal ACSF and equilibrated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> free ACSF (containing 1 mM EGTA to chelate extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>) for 10 mins. The baseline sample “0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> ACSF” was collected for 1 min. Superfusion solution was changed to Ca<sup>2+</sup> free K-ACSF for 2 mins and sample “0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> 70 mM K” was collected (dead volume for solution transition of 400 μl and chamber volume of 200 μl). After that, the solution was changed back to normal ACSF for 10 mins and K-ACSF for 2 mins. The sample “2.5 mM Ca 70 mM K” for the last min was collected.</p>
<p>Samples were subjected to CE-MS in a method similar to SV content detection, except for the following: 1) standards were dissolved in ACSF or other buffers used in release experiment; 2) concentration ranges used for standards of Glu was from 0.003-1 μM. 3) To protect the MS from salt pollution, data were collected from 10 mins −20 mins during CE separation.</p>

<title>Patch-Clamp recordings</title>
<p>Slices were transferred to a recording chamber on an upright fluorescent microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics (DIC; Olympus BX51WI). Slices were submerged and superfused with ACSF at about 2.8 ml/min at 24-26 °C. Whole cell patch recordings were routinely achieved from layer 4/5 medium sized pyramidal neurons from the somatosensory cortex. Patch pipettes (3-5 MΩ) contained: 140 mM K-gluconate, 10 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM KCl, 3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.5 mM Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (with pH adjusted to 7.3 and osmolarity of 290 mOsm/kg). Current-clamp recordings were carried out with a computer-controlled amplifier (Multiclamp 700B, Molecular Devices) and traces were digitized at 10 kHz (DigiData 1550B, Molecular Devices). Data were collected and analyzed using Clampfitor Clampex 10 software (Molecular Devices).</p>
<p>Cells were characterized by their membrane responses and firing patterns during hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current steps (−100 to +500 pA, increment: 50 pA or 25 pA, 500 ms). Regular spiking pyramidal neurons were identified by moderate maximal spiking frequencies (20-60 Hz, that is, 10-30 spikes per 500 ms, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E-G</xref>), increasing of inter-spike intervals during depolarizing step (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> and Supplementary Figure 11A), high action amplitude (Supplementary Figure 12E) and large half width (Supplementary Figure 12F) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c201">201</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c202">202</xref></sup>. After the mean firing frequency evoked by current injections reached the steady state for at least 5 mins (typically 20-30 mins following the formation of whole-cell configuration), 100 μM Cr was bath-applied for 6 mins. Typically, Cr was applied for a 2<sup>nd</sup> time following washout to re-confirm the effects.</p>

<title>Synaptosome preparation</title>
<p>Synaptosomes were isolated by Ficoll/sucrose density-gradient centrifugation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c203">203</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c209">209</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c221">221</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c259">259</xref></sup>. Whole brains from adult male mice were homogenized with 15 strokes at 900 rpm in buffer A (320 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, with a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). The homogenate (H fraction) was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to precipitate the membrane fragments and nuclei (P1 fraction). Supernatant was centrifuged again at 1000 g for 10 min and the resulting supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min. Supernatant was the S2 fraction, and the pellet was re-suspended with buffer A and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was crude synaptosomes (P2 fraction), containing synaptosomes with mitochondria and microsomes.</p>
<p>Crude synaptosomes (P2 fraction) was re-suspended with 150-200 μl buffer B (320 mM sucrose and 10 mM Tris–HCI (pH 7.4)). The sample was carefully overlaid on the top of a gradient of 2 ml of 7.5 % (wt/vol in buffer B) Ficoll and 1.8 ml of 13% (wt/vol in buffer B) Ficoll and centrifuged at 98,000 g for 45 min at 2-4 °C in a swinging-bucket rotor. A myelin band was present near the surface, and th synaptosomes band (fraction Sy) was present at the interface between the 13% and 7.5 % Ficoll layers, with the mitochondria being pelleted at the bottom. For further western analysis, the supernatant was divided into 6 fractions (600 μl for each fraction) and the mitochondria pellet was discarded. The isolated synaptosomes was included in fraction 4.</p>
<p>For Western analysis, fractions H, S1, P1, S2, P2 and Sy were adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) method with reference to NanoDrop™ 2000 Spectrophotometers. 3.35 μg protein was loaded for each lane. Fractions 1-6 were loaded with the same volume (10 μl composed of 6.7 μl sample and 3.3 μl loading buffer) for each lane.</p>

<title>Creatine uptake into synaptosomes</title>
<p>To remove Ficoll, we diluted the synaptosomal band (480 μl) with 4.3 ml of a pH 7.4 buffer C containing (in mM) 240 mannitol, 10 glucose, 4.8 Kgluconate, 2.2 Cagluconate, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO4 and 25 HEPES-Tris. The sample was then centrifuged at 12,000 g and the pellet was re-suspended with buffer C. Uptake experiments were either performed at 37°C or at 0°C (control). For each sample, 25-43 μg of synaptosomes (with a volume of 40-50 μl) were added to 360 μl buffer containing (in mmol/L) 100 NaCl, 40 mannitol, 10 glucose, 4.8 Kgluconate, 2.2 Cagluconate, 1.2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 KH2PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 HEPES and 25 Tris (pH adjusted to 7.4). A mixture of 18 μM [<sup>14</sup>C]-creatine (0.4 μCi) and 5 μM creatine was quickly added. After 10 min, uptake was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of NaCl-free ice-cold buffer C. Samples were immediately filtered, under vacuum, through a Whatman GF/C glass filter (1825-025) pre-wetted with buffer C. Filters were further washed with 10 ml of ice-cold buffer C, dissolved in scintillation fluid and the radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry.</p>

<title>Creatine uptake into SVs</title>
<p>The uptake of <sup>13</sup>C-creatine was assayed according to a conventional procedure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c260">260</xref></sup> with slight modifications: the immunoisolated synaptic vesicles by 10 μg Syp antibody (101011, Synaptic Systems, Germany) were resuspended with the uptake buffer (150mM meglumine-tartrate, 4 mM KCl, 4 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail) containing 4mM Mg-ATP or additional 4mM MgSO4, followed by preincubation for 30 min at 25L. The uptake reaction was started by addition of 1mM <sup>13</sup>C-creatine dissolved in the uptake buffer with a final volume of 125 μL (pH at 6.8). After 10min at 25L, 1mL of ice-cold uptake buffer was added to the incubation to stop the reaction, followed by 5 more times washing. The SV contents were extracted using the protocol described in the determination of vesicular contents part. 100 nM Cr was used as the internal control. CE-MS and LC-MS was used to verify and quantify the creatine contents of samples. A Vanquish UHPLC system coupled to a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (both instrument Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) were used for LC-MS analysis along with SeQuant ZIC-HILIC column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 3.5 μm, Merck Millipore, 150442) in the positive mode and SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 5 μm, Merck Millipore, 150460) in the negative mode. For ZIC-HILIC column, the mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in water and the mobile phase B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The linear gradient was as following: 0 min, 80% B; 6 min, 50% B; 13 min, 50% B; 14 min, 20% B; 18 min, 20% B; 18.5 min, 80% B; 30 min, 80% B. The flow rate used was 300 μl/min and the column temperature was maintained at 30°C. For ZIC-pHILIC column, the mobile phase A is 20 mM ammonium carbonate in water, adjusted to pH 9.0 with 0.1% ammonium hydroxide solution (25%) and the mobile phase B is 100% acetonitrile. The linear gradient was as follows: 0 min, 80% B; 2 min, 80% B; 19 min, 20% B; 20 min, 80% B; 30 min, 80% B. The flow rate used is 150 μl/min and the column temperature is 25°C. Samples were maintained at 4°C in Vanquish autosampler. 3 µl of extracted metabolites were injected for each run. IP samples were subjected to ZIC-HILIC column in positive mode for major metabolites detection, and then subject to ZIC-pHILIC column in negative mode for orthogonal detection.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>valuable</bold> observations on a potential role of creatine (Cr) as a novel neurotransmitter. The data provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that Cr is present in synaptic vesicles. If, in the future, a receptor can be described, it will support the claim that Cr is synaptically released and binds to a post-synaptic receptor. This would be of wide interest to the field of neuroscience.</p>

<p>The overall tone of the rebuttal and lack of responses on several questions was surprising. Clearly, the authors did not appreciate the phrase 'no smoking gun' and provided a lengthy repetition of the fair argument about 'ticking boxes' on the classic list of criteria. They also make repeated historical references that descriptions of neurotransmitters include many papers, typically over decades, e.g. in the case of ACh and its discovery by Sir Henry Dale. While I empathize with the authors' apparent frustration (I quote: '...accept the reality that Rome was not built in a single day and that no transmitter was proven by a one single paper') I am a bit surprised at the complete brushing away of the argument, and in fact the discussion. In the original paper, the notion of a receptor was mentioned only in a single sentence and all three reviewers brought up this rather obvious question. The historical comparisons are difficult: Of course many papers contribute to the identification of a neurotransmitter, but there is a much higher burden of proof in 2023 compared to the work by Otto Loewi and Sir Henry Dale: most, if not all, currently accepted neurotransmitter have a clear biological function at the level of the brain and animal behavior or function - and were in fact first proposed to exist based on a functional biological experiment (e.g. Loewi's heart rate change). This, and the isolation of the chemical that does the job, were clear, unquestionable 'smoking guns' a hundred years ago. Fast forward 2023: Creatine has been carefully studied by the authors to tick many of the boxes for neurotransmitters, but there is no clear role for its function in an animal. The authors show convincing effects upon K+ stimulation and electrophysiological recordings that show altered neuronal activity using the slc6a8 and agat mutants as well as Cr application - but, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, these effects are not a clear-cut demonstration of a chemical transmitter function, however many boxes are ticked. The identification of a role of a neurotransmitter for brain function and animal behavior has reasonably more advanced possibilities in 2023 than a hundred years ago - and e.g. a discussion of approaches for possible receptor candidates should be possible.</p>
<p>Again, I reviewed this positively and agree that a lot of cumulative data are great to be put out there and allow the discovery to be more broadly discussed and tested. But I have to note, that the authors simply respond with the 'Rome was not built in a single day' statement to my suggestions on at least 'have some lead' how to approach the question of a receptor e.g. through agonists or antagonists (while clearly stating 'I do not think the publication of this manuscript should not be made dependent' on this). Similarly, in response to reviewer 2's concerns about a missing receptor, the authors' only (may I say snarky) response is ' We have deleted this sentence, though what could mediate postsynaptic responses other than receptors?'

<p>Bian et al studied creatine (Cr) in the context of central nervous system (CNS) function. They detected Cr in synaptic vesicles purified from mouse brains with anti-Synaptophysin using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Cr levels in the synaptic vesicle fraction was reduced in mice lacking the Cr synthetase AGAT, or the Cr transporter SLC6A8. They provide evidence for Cr release within several minutes after treating brain slices with KCl. This KCl-induced Cr release was partially calcium dependent and was attenuated in slices obtained from AGAT and SLC6A8 mutant mice. Cr application also decreased the excitability of cortical pyramidal cells in one third of the cells tested. Finally, they provide evidence for SLC6A8-dependent Cr uptake into synaptosomes, and ATP-dependent Cr loading into synaptic vesicles. Based on these data, the authors propose that Cr may act as neurotransmitter in the CNS.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. A major strength of the paper is the broad spectrum of tools used to investigate Cr.</p>
<p>
2. The study provides evidence that Cr is present in/loaded into synaptic vesicles.</p>
<p>Weaknesses (resubmission):</p>
<p>1. There is no significant decrease in Cr content pulled down by anti-Syp in AGAT-/- mice when normalized to IgG controls. Hence, blocking AGAT activity/Cr synthesis does not affect Cr levels in the synaptic vesicle fraction, arguing against a Cr enrichment.</p>
<p>
2. There is no difference in KCl-induced Cr release between SLC6A8-/Y and SLC6A8+/Y when normalizing the data to the respective controls. Thus, the data are not consistent with the idea that depolarization-induced Cr release requires SLC6A8.</p>
<p>
3. The rationale of grouping the excitability data into responders and non-responders is not convincing because the threshold of 10% decrease in AP rate is arbitrary. The data do therefore not support the conclusion that Cr reduces neuronal excitability.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Bian et al. promotes the idea that creatine is a new neurotransmitter. The authors conduct an impressive combination of mass spectrometry (Fig. 1), genetics (Figs. 2, 3, 6), biochemistry (Figs. 2, 3, 8), immunostaining (Fig. 4), electrophysiology (Figs. 5, 6, 7), and EM (Fig. 8) in order to offer support for the hypothesis that creatine is a CNS neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>STRENGTHS:</p>
<p>There are many strengths to this study.</p>
<p>• The combinatorial approach is a strength. There is no shortage of data in this study.</p>
<p>
• The careful consideration of specific criteria that creatine would need to meet in order to be considered a neurotransmitter is a strength.</p>
<p>
• The comparison studies that the authors have done in parallel with classical neurotransmitters is helpful.</p>
<p>
• Demonstration that creatine has inhibitory effects is another strength.</p>
<p>
• The new genetic mutations for Slc6a8 and AGAT are strengths and potentially incredibly helpful for downstream work.</p>
<p>WEAKNESSES:</p>
<p>• Some data are indirect. Even though Slc6a8 and AGAT are helpful sentinels for the presence of creatine, they are not creatine themselves. Of note, these molecules themselves are not essential for making the case that creatine is a neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>
• Regarding Slc6a8, it seems to work only as a reuptake transporter - not as a transporter into SVs. Therefore, we do not know what the transporter into the TVs is.</p>
<p>
• Puzzlingly, Slc6a8 and AGAT are in different cells, setting up the complicated model that creatine is created in one cell type and then processed as a neurotransmitter in another. This matter will likely need to be resolved in future studies.</p>
<p>
• No candidate receptor for creatine has been identified postsynaptically. This will likely need to be resolved in future studies.</p>
<p>
• Because no candidate receptor has been identified, it is important to fully consider other possibilities for roles of creatine that would explain these observations other than it being a neurotransmitter? There is some attention to this in the Discussion.</p>
<p>There are several criteria that define a neurotransmitter. The authors nicely delineated many criteria in their discussion, but it is worth it for readers to do the same with their own understanding of the data.</p>
<p>By this reviewer's understanding (and combining some textbook definitions together) a neurotransmitter: 1) must be present within the presynaptic neuron and stored in vesicles; 2) must be released by depolarization of the presynaptic terminal; 3) must require Ca2+ influx upon depolarization prior to release; 4) must bind specific receptors present on the postsynaptic cell; 5) exogenous transmitter can mimic presynaptic release; 6) there exists a mechanism of removal of the neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft.</p>
<p>For a paper to claim that the published work has identified a new neurotransmitter, several of these criteria would be met - and the paper would acknowledge in the discussion which ones have not been met. For this particular paper, this reviewer finds that condition 1 is clearly met.</p>
<p>Conditions 2 and 3 seem to be met by electrophysiology, but there are caveats here. High KCl stimulation is a blunt instrument that will depolarize absolutely everything in the prep all at once and could result in any number of non-specific biological reactions as a result of K+ rushing into all neurons in the prep. Moreover, the results in 0 Ca2+ are puzzling. For creatine (and for the other neurotransmitters), why is there such a massive uptick in release, even when the extracellular saline is devoid of calcium?</p>
<p>Condition 4 is not discussed in detail at all. In the discussion, the authors elide the criterion of receptors specified by Purves by inferring that the existence of postsynaptic responses implies the existence of receptors. True, but does it specifically imply the existence of creatinergic receptors? This reviewer does not think that is necessarily the case. The authors should be appropriately circumspect and consider other modes of inhibition that are induced by activation or potentiation of other receptors (e.g., GABAergic or glycinergic).</p>
<p>Condition 5 may be met, because authors applied exogenous creatine and observed inhibition. However, this is tough to know without understanding the effects of endogenous release of creatine. if they were to test if the absence of creatine caused excess excitation (at putative creatinergic synapses), then that would be supportive of the same. Nicely, Ghirardini et al., 2023 study cited by the reviewers does provide support for this exact notion in pyramidal neurons.</p>
<p>For condition 6, the authors made a great effort with Slc6a8. This is a very tough criterion to understand or prove for many synapses and neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>In terms of fundamental neuroscience, the story should be impactful. There are certainly more neurotransmitters out there than currently identified and by textbook criteria, creatine seems to be one of them taking all of the data in this study and others into account.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>

<p>Point-to-Point Responses to Reviewers’ Comments</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are a bit surprised by the comments of Reviewer 1, but that our further responses can help communications with Reviewer 1. We have also responded to comments of Reviewers 2 and 3.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p>*<italic>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</italic></p>
<p>The overall tone of the rebuttal and lack of responses on several questions was surprising. Clearly, the authors took umbrage at the phrase 'no smoking gun' and provided a lengthy repetition of the fair argument about 'ticking boxes' on the classic list of criteria. They also make repeated historical references that descriptions of neurotransmitters include many papers, typically over decades, e.g. in the case of ACh and its discovery by Sir Henry Dale. While I empathize with the authors' apparent frustration (I quote: '...accept the reality that Rome was not built in a single day and that no transmitter was proven by a one single paper') I am a bit surprised at the complete brushing away of the argument, and in fact the discussion. In the original paper, the notion of a receptor was mentioned only in a single sentence and all three reviewers brought up this rather obvious question. The historical comparisons are difficult: Of course many papers contribute to the identification of a neurotransmitter, but there is a much higher burden of proof in 2023 compared to the work by Otto Loewi and Sir Henry Dale: most, if not all, currently accepted neurotransmitter have a clear biological function at the level of the brain and animal behavior or function - and were in fact first proposed to exist based on a functional biological experiment (e.g. Loewi's heart rate change). This, and the isolation of the chemical that does the job, were clear, unquestionable 'smoking guns' a hundred years ago. Fast forward 2023: Creatine has been carefully studied by the authors to tick many of the boxes for neurotransmitters, but there is no clear role for its function in an animal. The authors show convincing effects upon K+ stimulation and electrophysiological recordings that show altered neuronal activity using the slc6a8 and agat mutants as well as Cr application - but, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, these effects are not a clear-cut demonstration of a chemical transmitter function, however many boxes are ticked. The identification of a role of a neurotransmitter for brain function and animal behavior has reasonably more advanced possibilities in 2023 than a hundred years ago - and e.g. a discussion of approaches for possible receptor candidates should be possible.</p>
<p>Again, I reviewed this positively and agree that a lot of cumulative data are great to be put out there and allow the discovery to be more broadly discussed and tested. But I have to note, that the authors simply respond with the 'Rome was not built in a single day' statement to my suggestions on at least 'have some lead' how to approach the question of a receptor e.g. through agonists or antagonists (while clearly stating 'I do not think the publication of this manuscript should not be made dependent' on this). Similarly, in response to reviewer 2's concerns about a missing receptor, the authors' only (may I say snarky) response is ' We have deleted this sentence, though what could mediate postsynaptic responses other than receptors?' The bullet point by reviewer 3 ' • No candidate receptor for creatine has been identified postsynaptically.' is the one point by that reviewer that is simply ignored by the authors completely. Finally, I note that my reivew question on the K stimulation issues (e.g. 35 neurons that simply did not respond at all) was: ' Response: To avoid the disadvantage of K stimulation, we also performed optogenetic experiments recently and obtained encouraging preliminary results.' No details, not data - no response really.</p>
<p>In sum, I find this all a bit strange and the rebuttal surprising - all three reviewers were supportive and have carefully listed points of discussion that I found all valid and thoughtful. In response, the authors selectively responded scientifically to some experimental questions, but otherwise simply rather non-scientifically dismissed questions with 'Rome was not built in a day'-type answers, or less. I my view, the authors have disregarded the review process and the effort of three supportive reviewers, which should be part of the permanent record of this paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>We were very surprised by the tone of Reviewer 1 in the second round of reviewing. The corresponding author has spent some time including a long holiday to cool down and re-read our earlier responses. The following is entirely by the correspond author.</p>
<p>I have finally checked the term “smoking gun”, and found out that I interpreted it wrongly while I had thought that Reviewer 1 was wrong. This came from a long story in that I was lectured by a native speaker for my English when submitting the first paper from my own paper. In that case, the Reviewer was wrong (in arguing that only adjectives but not nouns can be used to define nouns), I was quite offended and remembered it vividly. In the case of “smoking gun”, I wrongly believed that it meant a hint (while the definite evidence would be “the final nail in the coffin”). By interpreting is as a hint, I was then rebutting Reviewer 1 for negating all our experimental results as “not a single piece of suggestive evidence”.</p>
<p>For the above, I apologize.</p>
<p>I have another disagreement about “smoking gun”. For a transmitter, multiple criteria have to be met. For example, finding a receptor for a small molecule would not be definitive for a transmitter because if it is not present in the SVs, it is unlikely to be a typical transmitter. If a molecule has a receptor but they are not even in the nervous system, it is definitely no a transmitter.</p>
<p>The title of our paper is “Evidence suggesting creatine as a new central neurotransmitter”, not “Evidence proving creatine as a new central neurotransmitter”. In the Abstract, after “Our biochemical, chemical, genetic and electrophysiological results are consistent with the possibility of Cr as a neurotransmitter”, we are adding “though not yet reaching the level of proof for the now classic transmitters”. In the last sentence of the introduction, we have now added “though the discovery of a receptor for Cr would prove it”.</p>
<p>I do, however, believe that, however strong the wordings are, criticisms and rebuttals in science are normal and should be conducted even when emotions are involved.</p>
<p>One of my major point of differences with at least two of the reviewers is that the criteria for neurotransmitters should be those listed in major textbooks. While everyone can have one’s own opinions, the textbooks, especially those accepted by readers of the field for more than 40 years, should be the standards. Kandel has listed the 4 criteria not only 40 years ago but also just 2 years ago in their latest 6th edition. The reviewers have asked for more, while discounting Kandel et al. (2021). So, in essence, the Reviewer is not shy in scientific criticisms when stating “The identification of a role of a neurotransmitter for brain function and animal behavior has reasonably more advanced possibilities in 2023 than a hundred years ago”.</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 raised another new criterion: brain function and behavior, while this is not in any textbook lists. However, lack of Cr caused behavioral problems, as cited by us in the introduction: both humans and mice were defective in brain function with loss of function mutations in the gene for the specific Cr transporter SLC6A8. If the reviewer meant behavioral abnormalities caused by Cr injection, that was unclear. But that criterion may not be met by other transmitters which is the likely reason that it was not a criterion in any textbook.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Bian et al studied creatine (Cr) in the context of central nervous system (CNS) function. They detected Cr in synaptic vesicles purified from mouse brains with anti-Synaptophysin using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Cr levels in the synaptic vesicle fraction was reduced in mice lacking the Cr synthetase AGAT, or the Cr transporter SLC6A8. They provide evidence for Cr release within several minutes after treating brain slices with KCl. This KCl-induced Cr release was partially calcium dependent and was attenuated in slices obtained from AGAT and SLC6A8 mutant mice. Cr application also decreased the excitability of cortical pyramidal cells in one third of the cells tested. Finally, they provide evidence for SLC6A8-dependent Cr uptake into synaptosomes, and ATP-dependent Cr loading into synaptic vesicles. Based on these data, the authors propose that Cr may act as neurotransmitter in the CNS.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. A major strength of the paper is the broad spectrum of tools used to investigate Cr.</p>
<p>2. The study provides evidence that Cr is present in/loaded into synaptic vesicles.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. There is no significant decrease in Cr content pulled down by anti-Syp in AGAT-/- mice when normalized to IgG controls. Hence, blocking AGAT activity/Cr synthesis does not affect Cr levels in the synaptic vesicle fraction, arguing against a Cr enrichment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Evidence for Cr enrichment in the SVS was obtained robustly with wild type mice. When brain Cr is very low in AGAT-/- mutant mice, because there is little Cr, there is also little Cr in the SVs. One does not require that as a criterion: it does not argue against the normal levels of Cr could be transported into the SVs even if when the much reduced levels of AGAT-/- Cr in mutant mice could be enriched in SVs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. There is no difference in KCl-induced Cr release between SLC6A8-/Y and SLC6A8+/Y when normalizing the data to the respective controls. Thus, the data are not consistent with the idea that depolarization-induced Cr release requires SLC6A8.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: This comment of Reviewer 2 was based on Figure 5D. But if one carefully examines Figure 5G, it was clear that the Ca++ dependent component of KCl -induced Cr release was lower in SLC6A8-/Y than that in SLC6A8+/Y.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The rationale of grouping the excitability data into responders and non-responders is not convincing because the threshold of 10% decrease in AP rate is arbitrary. The data do therefore not support the conclusion that Cr reduces neuronal excitability.</p>

<p>Response: Comparison of the same neuron, before and after Cr did show effects on neuronal excitability though that would have no statistics if one does not group multiple cells into the same categories.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Response: While any of us can come up with a list according to our own understanding, the paper copies lists from textbooks, especially from Kandel et al. (2021), which lists the same 4 criteria as Kandel et al. (1983), providing consistency and consensus.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For a paper to claim that the published work has identified a new neurotransmitter, several of these criteria would be met - and the paper would acknowledge in the discussion which ones have not been met. For this particular paper, this reviewer finds that condition 1 is clearly met.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Classic transmitters are released in a Ca++ dependent manner when stimulated by KCl, though they also had a Ca++ independent component as also shown in our Figure 5 E and F.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Condition 4 is not discussed in detail at all. In the discussion, the authors elide the criterion of receptors specified by Purves by inferring that the existence of postsynaptic responses implies the existence of receptors.

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Condition 5 may be met, because authors applied exogenous creatine and observed inhibition.

Nicely, Ghirardini et al., 2023 study cited by the reviewers does provide support for this exact notion in pyramidal neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: For most commonly accepted transmitters, this criterion has never been met. For example, the simplest case would be ACh at the neuromuscular junction. Howver, we have now found that choline is clearly present in SVs. So, how does anyone be sure that only ACh is released only, or how does anyone rule out effects of choline on postsynaptic cells when cholinergic neurons are stimulated?</p>
<p>Many synapses are now known to release more than one transmitter, making it difficult to define the effect of one transmitter released endogenously.</p>
<p>These are perhaps reasons why some textbooks do not emphasize similarities of endogenously released vs exogenously applied molecules.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For condition 6, the authors made a great effort with Slc6a8. This is a very tough criterion to understand or prove for many synapses and neurotransmitters.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: SLC6A8 is a transporter on the cytoplasmic membrane, thus a good candidate for removal of Cr from the synaptic cleft.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In terms of fundamental neuroscience, the story should be impactful. There are certainly more neurotransmitters out there than currently identified and by textbook criteria, creatine seems to be one of them taking all of the data in this study and others into account.</p>
