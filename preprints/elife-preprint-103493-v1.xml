<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Sliding clamps like PCNA are crucial processivity factors for replicative polymerases, requiring specific clamp loaders for loading onto DNA. The human alternative clamp loader CTF18 interacts with the leading strand polymerase Pol ε and loads PCNA onto primer/template DNA using its RFC pentameric module. Here, we provide a structural characterization of the human CTF18 complex and its interaction with PCNA. Our cryo-EM data support that the Ctf8 and Dcc1 subunits of CTF18, which form the regulatory module interacting with Pol ε, are flexibly tethered to the RFC module. A 2.9 Å cryo-EM structure shows the RFC module bound to PCNA in an auto-inhibited conformation similar to the canonical RFC loader, marking the initial step of the clamp-loading reaction. The unique RFC1 (Ctf18) large subunit of CTF18, which shows high relative mobility, is anchored to PCNA through an atypical low-affinity PIP box in the AAA+ domain and engages the RFC5 subunit using a novel β-hairpin at the disordered N-terminus. We show that deletion of this β-hairpin impairs the CTF18−PCNA complex stability and decreases the rate of primer synthesis by Pol ε. Our research identifies distinctive structural characteristics of the human CTF18-RFC complex, providing insights into its role in PCNA loading and the stimulation of leading strand synthesis by Pol ε.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>High fidelity and efficiency are critical for chromosomal DNA duplication in eukaryotes. This precision is achieved through the coordinated action of replicative DNA polymerases, Pol δ and Pol ε, anchored to the sliding clamp, and Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The ring-shaped PCNA homotrimer encircles DNA, enhancing the processivity of these polymerases in DNA replication and repair processes, including excision repair and homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), and plays an important role in sister chromatid cohesion establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The closed-ring topology of PCNA necessitates the transient opening of one interface to facilitate the incorporation and trapping of primer-template DNA. This critical function is executed by pentameric AAA+ ATPases, collectively known as clamp loaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Extensive structural and biochemical work in different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) established a common mechanism for the clamp-loading reaction, which proceeds through three main steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Initially, the clamp loader engages with the intact clamp ring, adopting an autoinhibited configuration that precludes DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). This stage sets the groundwork for the subsequent transition, where the clamp loader alters its conformation to an activated state. This change facilitates the opening of the clamp ring, creating a gap sufficiently large to permit the passage of duplex DNA and aligning the clamp loader for primer-template DNA interaction. The final phase of this process is initiated by the binding of DNA to the clamp loader, catalyzing ATP hydrolysis. This action prompts the closure of the clamp and the concurrent disassembly of the clamp loader, completing the cycle necessary for the engagement of the replicative polymerases to start DNA synthesis.</p>
<p>The canonical Replication Factor C (RFC), consisting of a large RFC1 subunit and four subunits (RFC2, RFC3, RFC4, and RFC5), acts as the primary clamp loader for PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). However, eukaryotes also employ alternative loaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), including CTF18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), highlighting the specificity of loading mechanisms facilitating DNA replication fidelity and efficiency.</p>
<p>Genome-wide analyses revealed that CTF18 predominantly facilitates PCNA loading on the leading strand, in contrast to the canonical RFC complex, which mainly loads PCNA on the lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Although CTF18 is not essential for bulk DNA replication in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), it plays a vital role in ensuring sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). This may be due to its selective loading of PCNA linked to EcoI acetyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), which acetylates Smc3, preventing cohesin destabilization by WapI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Recruitment of CTF18 to the leading strand is also important for activation of the replication checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>
<p>The CTF18 complex features two distinct modules with separate functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>): a catalytic RFC module for PCNA loading, consisting of a large RFC1-like subunit (hereby referred to as Ctf18), alongside the four RFC2, RFC3, RFC4 and RFC5 subunits utilized by the canonical RFC complex, and a regulatory module, made up of the Ctf8 and Dcc1 subunits. These latter two subunits attach to the Ctf18 C-terminus, forming the Ctf18-1-8 module. A long linker predicted to be flexible connects these two segments. Structural and functional studies have demonstrated that the interaction between the Ctf18-1-8 module and the catalytic domain of Pol2 (Pol2<sub>CAT</sub>), the principal subunit of Pol ε, directs CTF18 to replication forks and boosts its clamp loading efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). This interaction situates the clamp loader close to the primer/template junction, facilitating PCNA loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Pol2<sub>CAT</sub> is tethered to the remainder of Pol ε via an unstructured linker, making it an integral component of the CMGE (CMG-Pol ε) core replisome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). It has been proposed that Pol ε utilizes both the CMG helicase and PCNA as processivity factors to facilitate normal replication rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Tethering by the CMG complex might allow Pol ε to dissociate from the 3′ end of the leading strand but stay at the replication fork until leading strand synthesis restarts. Given Pol ε relatively weak interaction with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), it is possible that multiple PCNA loading events on the leading strand via CTF18 are necessary to achieve full Pol ε processivity.</p>
<p>Although the structure of the Ctf18-1-8 module in association with Pol2<sub>CAT</sub> has been elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), the architecture of the CTF18-RFC module and its interaction with PCNA remain uncharacterized. To investigate the clamp loading mechanism employed by CTF18, we reconstituted the full human CTF18 complex with PCNA and determined its structure using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our cryo-EM data supports the prediction that the Ctf18-1-8 and RFC modules are flexibly tethered. The analysis yielded high-resolution reconstructions of the entire CTF18-RFC module bound to a closed PCNA ring. Although the overall architecture mirrors the autoinhibited state observed in the canonical RFC loader in a complex with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), distinctive features within CTF18 were identified. These distinctions may offer insights into the specialized functional roles CTF18 plays in DNA replication.</p>

<title>Structure of the human CTF18-PCNA complex</title>
<p>We employed single-particle cryo-EM to determine the structure of human CTF18 bound to PCNA. To this purpose, the full CTF18 complex, including Ctf8 and Dcc1, was expressed in insect cells and purified to homogeneity (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>). The purified complex includes all subunits as shown in the SDS-PAGE gel (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>). With the aim of trapping CTF18 in different steps of the clamp loading reaction, the complex was vitrified in the presence of ATP, PCNA, and primer/template DNA but omitting the Mg<sup>2+</sup> cofactor to halt hydrolysis, and then imaged by cryo-EM (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2</xref>). Surprisingly, image processing yielded only a major 3D class, including the CTF18-RFC pentamer bound to a closed PCNA ring (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a-b</xref>, S2-3 Fig), with no evidence of DNA density. The Ctf18-1-8 module, which is connected to the RFC module by a 91 amino acid linker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>), is not resolved in the map (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>), suggesting it is flexibly tethered to the RFC module. The map was refined to a global resolution of 2.9 Å (S2-3 Fig), which allowed the model building of the five CTF18-RFC subunits as well as the PCNA homotrimer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). The final model refines to a map-to-model FSC of 3.0 Å at 0.5 threshold, with good refinement statistics (S1 Table).</p>

<p>The five CTF18-RFC subunits are positioned on top of the closed PCNA ring, which is planar and undistorted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). A structural comparison shows that the CTF18-RFC pentamer was trapped in an autoinhibited conformation analogous to that reported for the canonical human (h) and yeast (sc) RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), pertaining to the initial step of the clamp loading reaction, right before clamp opening (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>). In such conformation, the AAA+ domains form an overstwisted and asymmetric spiral that is incompatible with DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The AAA+, collar, and A’ domains of the Ctf18 subunit (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>) align with the homologous domains of hRFC1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>). As in the hRFC structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), the Ctf18 subunit interacts with RFC2, RFC3, and PCNA1. Three main deviations from the hRFC−PCNA structure are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>): a different tilt of the PCNA ring (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c-d</xref>), significant mobility of the large Ctf18 subunit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref> and S2 Fig) and, importantly, the presence of a β-hairpin engaged to the outer surface of the RFC5 subunit, which we mapped to the disordered N-terminus of the Ctf18 subunit (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). These features are analyzed in detail below.</p>

<title>Structure of the large subunit of CTF18</title>
<p>The Ctf18 subunit presents 22% identity with the homologous subunit RFC1 of hRFC and an overall structural conservation, with some deviations particularly in the A’ domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>). Compared to the other subunits, the AAA+ domain of Ctf18 shows increased flexibility, as evidenced by the local resolution map of the complex (S2d Fig). Increased flexibility was not detected in the RFC1 subunit of human RFC bound to PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). This discrepancy could be explained by the diminished interactions between Ctf18 and the adjacent RFC2 subunit, in contrast to the stronger interactions between RFC1 and RFC2 within the RFC complex. These differing interactions result in varying buried surface areas, with CTF18 and RFC having 1400 Å<sup>2</sup> and 2300 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Additionally, as explained below, the interaction between Ctf18 and PCNA is weaker compared to the interaction between RFC1 and PCNA, further contributing to these structural differences. The Ctf18 C-terminal region (residues 953-975) predicted to interact with the Ctf8 and Dcc1 subunits (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>) is invisible in the map.</p>
<p>The most striking feature is a small β-hairpin-containing fold mapped between residues 165-194 in the disordered N-terminus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) of the Ctf18 subunit, ∼80 Å apart from the Ctf18 AAA+ domain, to which it is connected by a disordered linker of 86 amino acids (residues 195-280). This N-terminal fold plugs into a groove at the outer surface of the collar domain of the RFC5 subunit defined by helices α1, α3, α4, and α5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). The resolution of the map in this region is sufficient for confident model building of the interface (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). The interface buries 984 Å<sup>2</sup> and is characterized by both apolar and polar interactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). A set of hydrophobic side chains protruding from Ctf18 β-hairpin (V178, V180, L190, L192) approaches a complementary patch of hydrophobic residues on RFC5 (L255 in α1; F287, V291 and F293 in α3; I336 and V337 in α5). The interface is further strengthened by several hydrogen bonds mostly mediated by main-chain atoms in the Ctf18 β-hairpin, and by a salt bridge between R193 of the Ctf18 β-hairpin and D292 of RFC5. It is worth highlighting that RFC2 separates the Ctf18 and RFC5 subunits. Despite this separation, Ctf18 projects the β-hairpin directly onto RFC5, bypassing any interactions with RFC2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>). This observation supports that the β-hairpin functions as a “latch” to stabilize the CTF18-RFC structure.</p>

<p>Similarly to human CTF18, long regions predicted to be disordered by AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) are present in the N-terminal sequence of Ctf18 of lower eukaryotes. The β-hairpin region of human Ctf18 does not show strict sequence conservation, but a similar fold in the N-terminus of lower eukaryotes Ctf18 is predicted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>). Therefore, lower eukaryotes may use a similar β-hairpin motif to bind the corresponding RFC5 subunit of the RFC-module complex, emphasizing its importance.</p>

<title>Interactions of CTF18 with PCNA</title>
<p>CTF18 engages two of the three PCNA protomers through four contact points involving the AAA+ domains of Ctf18, RFC2, RFC4, and RFC5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c-d</xref>). The interactions with Ctf18, RFC2, and RFC5 subunits are analogous to those reported in the hRFC−PCNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). However, while Ctf18 engages PCNA1 via a PIP-box interaction as hRFC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), its atypical PIP motif lacking aromatic residues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3d</xref>) results in a smaller buried surface area (782 vs 1009 Å<sup>2</sup>). This low-affinity interaction may contribute to the relative flexibility of the AAA+ domain of Ctf18 observed in the complex (S2d Fig). RFC2 contacts the Interdomain Connecting Loop (IDCL) of PCNA1, while the RFC5 PIP-box docks into the hydrophobic pocket of PCNA2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>), as already observed in hRFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Differently from the hRFC−PCNA complex, where RFC4 is detached from PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), in CTF18, this subunit interacts with the IDCL of PCNA2 similarly as RFC2 binds PCNA1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). The RFC4−PCNA interaction, which was also observed in the structure of scRFC bound to an open PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), brings PCNA closer to the CTF18-RFC module, explaining the different tilt of the PCNA ring compared to the hRFC−PCNA complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Given the structure of scRFC bound to open PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), where all five RFC subunits are bound to PCNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref>), we predict that a conformational shift in CTF18−RFC, specifically bringing the fifth subunit (RFC3) to engage PCNA3, would be necessary to disrupt the interface between PCNA1 and PCNA3, thereby opening the clamp and aligning the CTF18 subunits for primer-template DNA interaction. The reason for the absence of such an active CTF18 conformation in our cryo-EM analysis remains uncertain. However, similar to observations with the hRFC−PCNA complex, where an open-clamp state was not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), this could be attributed to the hydrophobic regions of the open clamp interacting with the water-air interface, potentially leading to protein denaturation during the vitrification process to prepare the cryo-EM grids.</p>

<title>Nucleotide binding to the AAA+ modules</title>
<p>The map is consistent with nucleotides in four of the five AAA+ domains of the CTF18 subunits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>). ATP is bound to subunits Ctf18, RFC2, and RFC5, while ADP appears to engage RFC3, consistent with the structure hRFC−PCNA complex reconstituted with ATPγS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Density for the adenine ring of ATP in the Ctf18 subunit is poor, likely a consequence of the increased mobility of the AAA+ domain of this subunit (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>). Compared to the canonical RFC1, the Walker A motif of Ctf18 contains a lysine residue (L378) instead of a valine, but this substitution does not appear to affect its interaction with the ATP nucleotide (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4 Fig</xref>). Since RFC3 lacks critical catalytic residues and bears a substitution in the Walker A motif (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4 Fig</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), the presence of ADP, rather than a product of ATP hydrolysis, probably results from co-purification of the complex where ADP contaminants are present. In the human RFC complex, it has been previously shown that an intact nucleotide binding site in RFC3 has an important structural role in the complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). If this is the case for CTF18, it remains to be established, but it is likely that ADP binding to this subunit may play a stabilizing role in all RFC-like loaders.</p>

<p>Differently from the hRFC−PCNA complex, where RFC4 is bound to ATPγS, in CTF18, this subunit is not engaged with a nucleotide (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>). The residues in the AAA+ of RFC4 of CTF18 coordinated to ATPγS in hRFC are displaced and incompatible with nucleotide binding. Interestingly, mutation of the conserved K84 residue in the ATP-binding motif of RFC4 in hRFC did not impair the ability of this subunit to assemble with other RFC subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). In agreement, our structure shows that the lack of ATP binding to RFC4 does not preclude the assembly of the CTF18-RFC pentamer in the autoinhibited conformation. However, considering the importance of ATP binding of RFC4 for the hRFC clamp loading function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), it is expected that ATP binding to RFC4 in CTF18 is required to switch to an enzymatically active conformation.</p>
<p>The asymmetric spiral of the CTF18 AAA+ pentamer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a-b</xref>) disrupts the active sites at the Ctf18/RFC2, RFC2/5, and RFC5/4 interfaces (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c</xref>). At these interfaces, the <italic>trans</italic>-acting arginine fingers are positioned too far away to interact with the γ-phosphate of ATP (<italic>e.g.</italic>, ∼9 Å for Arg184 of RFC2, ∼10 Å for Arg168 of RFC5, and ∼7 Å for Arg193 of RFC4) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c</xref>). Prior research has indicated that the Ctf18/RFC2 particular site is not essential for clamp loading by various loaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), while the others are critical for the clamp-loading activity of eukaryotic RFCs.</p>
<p>In CTF18, the AAA+ spiral is overtwisted in a manner reminiscent of the autoinhibited conformations observed in hRFC and scRFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>), leading to steric hindrance that impedes DNA binding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref>). Specifically, the overtwisted RFC3 and RFC4 subunits occupy the space normally filled by DNA. In the autoinhibited structure of hRFC, the β-hairpin (residues 68-88) located at the base of RFC3 also referred to as “E-plug”, extends towards the anticipated location of DNA and interacts with the Rossmann fold of RFC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Conversely, in CTF18, while this same β-hairpin is oriented toward the interior of the DNA-binding channel (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d</xref>), it does not make direct contact with the Ctf18 subunit. Collectively, the E-plug appears a conserved feature in eukaryotic clamp loaders, underlying its importance in maintaining the pentamer in its autoinhibited conformation, by preventing DNA access through the central channel. We observed that human CTF18 shares an additional conserved feature with the yeast RFC, specifically the presence of a separation pin in the CTF18 large subunit. This pin is analogous to the one that interacts with DNA in the yeast RFC complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4e</xref>) [11].</p>
<p>To discount the possibility that the absence of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions in the cryo-EM sample could have hindered the proper assembly of the CTF18 pentamer for DNA engagement, we used cryo-EM to visualize CTF18 with PCNA, primer-template DNA, ATP, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5 Fig</xref>, S1 Table). Despite the inclusion of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the resulting 3.2 Å reconstruction of the complex remained in a configuration analogous to that without Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a-b</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6 Fig</xref>). In this reconstruction, distinct density for Mg<sup>2+</sup> is noted in the active sites of RFC2 and RFC5, coordinating ATP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>). Similar to the map without Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ADP coordination is present in RFC3, while RFC4 is not engaged with any nucleotide. These findings collectively imply that the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the nucleotide binding sites does not influence the transition of CTF18 from an autoinhibited to an active state. This result also confirms the remarkable stability of the autoinhibited conformation, even in hydrolyzing conditions.</p>

<title>The Ctf18 <bold>β</bold>-hairpin plays a role in stimulating DNA synthesis by Pol <bold>ε</bold></title>
<p>Based on the structures reported herein, the β-hairpin at the disordered N-terminal domain of Ctf18 is a distinctive feature that may serve to stabilize the CTF18-RFC pentamer and maximize its clamp loading efficiency. To investigate the functional importance of the β-hairpin, we purified a CTF18 mutant with a truncation at the disordered N-terminal domain of the Ctf18 subunit, specifically, the segment spanning residues 165-194 (CTF18-RFC<sup>Δ165-194</sup>). This mutation eliminates the entire Ctf18 β-hairpin and is expected to destabilize the CTF18-RFC pentamer. In agreement, when mutant CTF18 was imaged by cryo-EM with PCNA in the same conditions used for wild type CTF18, only a small subset of particles of the complex was observed, while the majority of particles contained dissociated PCNA (S7 and S8 Fig). We hypothesized that this destabilizing mutation in CTF18 may reduce its efficiency in loading PCNA onto DNA, thereby resulting in diminished stimulation of primer synthesis by Pol ε.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we performed primer extension assays using Pol ε, PCNA, and either wild-type or mutant CTF18 constructs to assess their ability to stimulate DNA synthesis by Pol ε. Our results indicate a significant reduction in primer extension products when the β-hairpin was deleted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>). Measurement of band intensities revealed an approximately two-fold decrease in the amount of extended primer produced by the mutant compared to the wild-type (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b</xref>). To further support that the observed effect on primer extension is due to the mutation, we conducted a concentration titration comparing wild-type and mutant CTF18 (S9 Fig). The CTF18 mutant displayed altered concentration dependencies compared to the wild-type, thereby validating the mutant phenotype and underscoring the structural importance of the β-hairpin feature.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we reported the structure of the human CTF18 clamp loader bound to PCNA in the presence of ATP with or without Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Our cryo-EM data, together with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), support that the Ctf8 and Dcc1 subunits of CTF18, forming the regulatory module interacting with Pol ε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), are flexibly tethered to the RFC-module via binding to the Ctf18 C-terminus, which is separated by the N-terminal RFC1-like module of Ctf18 by ∼90 amino acid flexible linker. Therefore, CTF18 comprises two structurally distinct modules that cooperate to load PCNA onto the leading strand, facilitating replication by Pol ε.</p>
<p>The CTF18-PCNA complex was observed in an autoinhibited conformation, which prevents DNA binding. This mirrors the similar conformation in hRFC and scRFC, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Such conformation represents a transient encounter complex that occurs early in the clamp loading process, before the opening of the clamp. Despite the variations in the large RFC subunit in the two assemblies, we demonstrate a striking architectural conservation between the alternative human clamp loader CTF18 and the canonical RFC. Specifically, CTF18 utilizes three subunits (Ctf18, RFC2, RFC5, and RFC4) to engage two PCNA protomers. However, the engagement of the third PCNA protomer by RFC3 is necessary to initiate the opening of the PCNA ring interface, a process that requires a conformational shift of the AAA+ pentamer from an autoinhibited to an active state. Supporting this, previous structural studies on scRFC have shown that the conformation of RFC bound to open PCNA is facilitated through a ‘crab-claw’ mechanism, which is inherently predisposed to DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). This conformational change creates an opening between the A′ segment and the AAA+ module in the A subunit, allowing primer-template DNA to bind within the RFC inner chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Remarkably, this significant conformational shift occurs rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), does not depend on ATP hydrolysis, and ensures the sequential binding of PCNA and the DNA substrate in the correct order. While our study did not resolve the active conformation of CTF18, the observed structural conservation in the autoinhibited state, particularly of the large Ctf18 subunit (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), suggests that a similar ’crab-claw’ mechanism may facilitate the transition of CTF18 to its active state for PCNA opening and DNA binding. While our work was being finalized, several cryo-EM structures of human CTF18 bound to PCNA and primer/template DNA were reported by another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). These findings confirm the distinct features of CTF18 observed in our structures and validate our predictions regarding the significant similarities between CTF18-RFC and canonical RFC in loading PCNA onto a ss/dsDNA junction.</p>
<p>The main structural differences between CTF18 and the canonical RFC include increased mobility of the large subunit and the presence of a β-hairpin that attaches to the RFC5 subunit. The mobility of the large subunit is likely enhanced by the low-affinity PIP motif that anchors it to the PCNA ring. We propose that the β-hairpin may have evolved to counterbalance the mobility of the large subunit, helping to maintain its connection to the RFC pentamer and stabilizing the clamp loader structure. Our structural data and functional assays indeed show that deletion of the β-hairpin results in reduced stability of the CTF18−PCNA complex and diminished activity of CTF18 in stimulating Pol ε primer synthesis, likely by reducing CTF18 efficiency in PCNA loading (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Interestingly, a recent work reporting cryo-EM structures of the yeast homolog of CTF18 bound to PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) does not support the presence of a stable β-hairpin at the N-terminus of the Ctf18 subunit engaged to the collar of the Rfc3 subunit. Therefore, the functional β-hairpin we observed in human CTF18 appears a distinct feature that pertains to higher eukaryotes, required to maximize the activity of CTF18 in loading PCNA onto the leading strand.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM grids preparation and data collection</title>
<p>For all the complexes (WT and mutant), UltraAuFoil® R1.2/1.3 Au 300 grids were glow-discharged at 30 mA for 30 seconds on an EasyGlow glow-discharge unit. For the preparation of the complex without Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Dataset 1 and Dataset 3), P/T DNA, ATP, CTF18-RFC WT/CTF18-RFC<sup>Δ165-194</sup>, and PCNA were mixed in order. The final concentrations were 5.6 μM P/T DNA, 0.2 mM ATP, 1.5 μM CTF18-RFC WT/CTF18-RFC<sup>Δ165-194</sup>, and 7.5 μM PCNA. The buffer this was performed in comprised 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM ATP. 3 μL of the sample was applied to the grid, blotted for 2 s at blot force -5, and plunged frozen into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI Thermo Fisher), which was set at 4°C and 100% humidity. For the preparation of CTF18-RFC /PCNA/P-T DNA/ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>complex (Dataset 2), the components P/T DNA, ATP, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, CTF18-RFC, and PCNA were mixed in order. The final concentrations were 5.6 μM P/T DNA, 0.2 mM ATP, 1.9 mg/mL Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 1.5 μM CTF18-RFC, and 7.5 μM PCNA. The buffer this was performed in comprised 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM ATP, and 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. 3 μL of the sample was applied to the grid in the same way as above for data collection. Cryo-EM data for all the samples were collected on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Titan Krios G4 transmission electron microscope at KAUST. Electron micrographs for Dataset 1 (CTF18-RFC-PCNA with ATP in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>), were collected using a Falcon 4i detector at a dose rate of 7.5 e<sup>-</sup>/pix/sec for 5 seconds and a calibrated pixel size of 0.93 Å. Focusing was performed over a range between -2.7 μm and -1.5μm, in 0.3 μm intervals. Electron micrographs for Dataset 2 (CTF18-RFC-PCNA with ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) were collected using a Falcon 4i detector at a dose rate of 8.02 e<sup>-</sup>/pix/sec for 5 seconds and a calibrated pixel size of 0.93 Å. Focusing was performed over a range between - 2.7 μm and -1.5 μm, in 0.3 μm intervals. Electron micrographs for Dataset 3 (CTF18-RFC<sup>Δ165-194</sup>-PCNA with ATP and in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>) were collected using a Falcon 4i detector at a dose rate of 7.4 e<sup>-</sup>/pix/sec for 5 seconds and a calibrated pixel size of 0.93 Å.

<p>The structure of the Ctf18 large subunit of human CTF18 (Q8WVB6, residues 277-805) was generated with Phyre2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), using as a template the sequence of human RFC1 (P35251, residues 581-1034). The Ctf18 subunit model was then aligned to the RFC1 subunit in the structure of the human RFC clamp loader bound to PCNA in an autoinhibited conformation (PDB 6VVO, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>)) using Chimera, the RFC1 subunit was deleted, and the resulting model including Ctf18, subunits RFC2-5 and PCNA was rigid-body fitted into the cryo-EM map. The model was edited and real-space refined with Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) following flexible fitting performed with ISOLDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). A final real-space refinement was performed in Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), applying secondary structure constraints.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors report the structure of the human CTF18-RFC complex bound to PCNA. Similar structures (and more) have been reported by the O'Donnell and Li labs. This study should add to our understanding of CTF18-RFC in DNA replication and clamp loaders in general. However, there are numerous major issues that I recommend the authors fix.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The structures reported are strong and useful for comparison with other clamp loader structures that have been reported lately.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The structures don't show how CTF18-RFC opens or loads PCNA. There are recent structures from other groups that do examine these steps in more detail, although this does not really dampen this reviewer's enthusiasm. It does mean that the authors should spend their time investigating aspects of CTF18-RFC function that were overlooked or not explored in detail in the competing papers. The paper poorly describes the interactions of CTF18-RFC with PCNA and the ATPase active sites, which are the main interest points. The nomenclature choices made by the authors make the manuscript very difficult to read.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Briola and co-authors have performed a structural analysis of the human CTF18 clamp loader bound to PCNA. The authors purified the complexes and formed a complex in solution. They used cryo-EM to determine the structure to high resolution. The complex assumed an auto-inhibited conformation, where DNA binding is blocked, which is of regulatory importance and suggests that additional factors could be required to support PCNA loading on DNA. The authors carefully analysed the structure and compared it to RFC and related structures.</p>
<p>Strength &amp; Weakness</p>
<p>Their overall analysis is of high quality, and they identified, among other things, a human-specific beta-hairpin in Ctf18 that flexibly tethers Ctf18 to Rfc2-5. Indeed, deletion of the beta-hairpin resulted in reduced complex stability and a reduction in a primer extension assay with Pol ε. This is potentially very interesting, although some more work is needed on the quantification. Moreover, the authors argue that the Ctf18 ATP-binding domain assumes a more flexible organisation, but their visual representation could be improved.</p>
<p>The data are discussed accurately and relevantly, which provides an important framework for rationalising the results.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a high-quality manuscript that identifies a key intermediate in CTF18-dependent clamp loading.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>CTF18-RFC is an alternative eukaryotic PCNA sliding clamp loader that is thought to specialize in loading PCNA on the leading strand. Eukaryotic clamp loaders (RFC complexes) have an interchangeable large subunit that is responsible for their specialized functions. The authors show that the CTF18 large subunit has several features responsible for its weaker PCNA loading activity and that the resulting weakened stability of the complex is compensated by a novel beta hairpin backside hook. The authors show this hook is required for the optimal stability and activity of the complex.</p>
<p>Relevance:</p>
<p>The structural findings are important for understanding RFC enzymology and novel ways that the widespread class of AAA ATPases can be adapted to specialized functions. A better understanding of CTF18-RFC function will also provide clarity into aspects of DNA replication, cohesion establishment, and the DNA damage response.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The cryo-EM structures are of high quality enabling accurate modelling of the complex and providing a strong basis for analyzing differences and similarities with other RFC complexes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript would have benefitted from more detailed biochemical analysis to tease apart the differences with the canonical RFC complex.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of using Mg depletion to trap active states of AAA ATPases. Perhaps the authors could provide a reference to successful examples of this and explain why they chose not to use the more standard practice in the field of using ATP analogues to increase the lifespan of reaction intermediates.</p>
<p>Overall appraisal:</p>
<p>Overall the work presented here is solid and important. The data is sufficient to support the stated conclusions and so I do not suggest any additional experiments.</p>
