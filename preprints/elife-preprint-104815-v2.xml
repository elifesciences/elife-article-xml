<title>Abstract</title>
<p>While advances in single cell genomics have helped to chart the cellular components of tumor ecosystems, it has been more challenging to characterize their specific spatial organization and functional interactions. Here, we combine single cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics by Slide-seq, and <italic>in situ</italic> multiplex RNA analysis, to create a detailed spatial map of healthy and dysplastic colon cellular ecosystems and their association with disease progression. We profiled inducible genetic CRC mouse models that recapitulate key features of human CRC, assigned cell types and epithelial expression programs to spatial tissue locations in tumors, and computationally used them to identify the regional features spanning different cells in the same spatial niche. We find that tumors were organized in cellular neighborhoods, each with a distinct composition of cell subtypes, expression programs, and local cellular interactions. Comparing to scRNA-seq and Slide-seq data from human CRC, we find that both cell composition and layout features were conserved between the species, with mouse neighborhoods correlating with malignancy and clinical outcome in human patient tumors, highlighting the relevance of our findings to human disease. Our work offers a comprehensive framework that is applicable across various tissues, tumors, and disease conditions, with tools for the extrapolation of findings from experimental mouse models to human diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The spatial organization of diverse cells in the tumor ecosystem impacts and drives interactions between malignant cells and neighboring immune and stromal cells, either promoting or suppressing tumor growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Recent studies have shown that systematic understanding of the spatial organization of tumors can shed light on disease progression and response to therapy, with specific features correlated with tumor subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, cancer prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, or response to treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>However, genome-scale, high-resolution dissection of the spatial organization of tumors and its functional implications remains challenging, largely due to technical limitations. Methods such as fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry can only measure a handful of pre-selected transcripts or proteins, whereas single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) does not directly capture spatial relations. Recent advances in spatial genomics and proteomics allow multiplexed or genome-scale measurements <italic>in situ</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, but with a trade-off between genomic scale and spatial resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. As a result, data from different experimental methods need to be integrated for a comprehensive view of the tissue biology. Many analytical tools have been developed to integrate some crucial aspects of the data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, but it can be challenging to deploy them and distill answers to specific disease biology questions. This leaves open many fundamental questions about tissue organization and collective function, including whether there are canonical functional units in tumors, what may be their organization in the tumor landscape, and what role does each play in tumor progression.</p>
<p>A case in point is colorectal cancer (CRC), where initial lesions (adenomatous polyps) progress over time to carcinoma and eventually to metastatic disease. While the mutations that drive this process were extensively studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, and the cellular ecosystem of CRC has now been deeply charted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, the spatial landscape is less well-characterized. In a recent study of human CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, we statistically associated cell profiles across tumors and showed that they map to different cellular communities, reside in different locations in the tumor and reflect different tumor subtypes. However, absent genome wide <italic>in situ</italic> measurements, these statistical inferences do not yet reflect the full spatial organization of the tumor. Moreover, it is important to relate such patterns to those in animal models used in mechanistic studies and as pre-clinical models, to understand the relation between lab models and human tumors.</p>
<p>Here, we deciphered the spatial and cellular organization of colorectal cancer (CRC) by combining scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics by Slide-seq, and <italic>in situ</italic> RNA multiplex analysis, using a novel computational framework. We first profiled two inducible genetic mouse models of colorectal cancer that recapitulate key features of human CRC, before and after tumor initiation. We integrated the spatial and cell profiles to create a spatial cell map of the tumor landscape, revealing dysplasia-specific cellular layout and potential physical interactions. We found that the tumor landscape is organized in cell neighborhoods, each with distinct epithelial, immune, and stromal cell compositions, and governed by different gene programs. Three of the cell neighborhoods are associated with tumor progression, each activating different biological pathways but all active simultaneously albeit in different parts of the tumor. We devised a computational framework, based on the TACCO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> method, extending it to compare single cell and spatial features of tumors between species and applied it to scRNA-seq data from human CRC. Multiple features were conserved between tumors in the mouse model and the human patients, and the mouse cellular neighborhoods correlated with malignancy and clinical outcome (progression-free intervals (PFI) and overall survival (OS)) in human patient tumors. Our work provides a general approach that can be applied to other tissues, tumors and disease conditions.</p>

<title>Tumorigenic genotypes cause shifts in the composition of epithelial cell populations and their microenvironment in AV and AKPV lesions</title>
<p>Dysplastic lesions exhibited shifts in proportions of immune and stromal cells, including changes in subsets pre-existing in normal tissue, as well as infiltration of new cell subsets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1D,E,F</xref>). This resulted in both increase in cells of existing populations (<italic>e.g.</italic>, some T cell subsets (TNK05 (GdT/Il17+), TNK06 (Treg)) and emergence of new dysplasia-associated cells (<italic>e.g.</italic>, granulocytes (Gran01, Gran02) and monocytes (Mono02, Mono03)) mirroring observations in human CRC<sup>2</sup>, breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, and non-small cell lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2 A-C</xref>). We validated these patterns using multiplex <italic>in situ</italic> RNA analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1F-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figSI1">Supplementary item 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figSI2">2</xref>). Infiltration is likely to underlie many of these changes as many of the increasing cell subsets (granulocytes, monocytes, mast cells) expressed genes, such as Sell and Ccr2, indicating tissue recruitment, and as the cells dramatically increase in proportion despite negligible signals of proliferation programs.</p>
<p>Two of four monocyte subsets, Mono02 and Mono03, were unique dysplasia-associated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2D-F</xref>) and were respectively enriched for general inflammatory response genes (FDR=5.7 10<sup>-30</sup>, two-sided Fisher’s exact test in GO term enrichment) and interferon beta and gamma response genes (FDR=3.5 10<sup>-11</sup>, 1.0 10<sup>-13</sup>). T cell subsets showed the expected diversity across nine subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2G-I</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, with a significant decrease (out of all T cells) in TNK01 (GdT/Cd8) in the dysplastic microenvironment and an increase in TNK05 (GdT/Il17+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2J</xref>). This is consistent with the T cell composition in tumors from mismatch repair proficient (MMRp) CRC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2K</xref>). RNA velocity analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> of T cells from normal and AV tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3A</xref>) showed a change in inferred cellular relationships with TNK03 (naïve T) and TNK02 (Th1/Th17) preceding TNK06 (Treg), consistent with the promotion of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and TNK08 (proliferating T) also preceding TNK02 (Th1/Th17), TNK04 (GdT/Cd8) and TNK05 (GdT/Il17+) populations.</p>
<p>Within the five subsets of stromal cells (including vascular endothelial and lymphatic endothelial cells and three fibroblast subsets, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2L-N</xref> and <bold>Methods</bold>), Endo01 (vascular) were enriched in dysplastic lesions compared to normal colon (FDR=1.8 10<sup>-3</sup>, two-sided Welch’s t test on CLR transformed compositions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2O</xref>). Angiogenesis-related pathways, such as angiogenesis (FDR=1.0 10<sup>-11</sup>) and positive regulation of angiogenesis (FDR=3.4 10<sup>-4</sup>) as well glycolytic process (FDR=1.4 10<sup>-4</sup>) were enriched in Endo01 (vascular) from lesions compared to normal colon (Table S1). This is in line with vascular adaptation to the tumor’s growing needs for nutrients and oxygen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and with the increased expression of the vascular growth factor <italic>Vegf-A</italic> in both monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2P</xref>).</p>

<title>Cell-intrinsic expression shifts in different sub-lineages in the dysplastic epithelium</title>
<p>Epithelial cells showed dramatic cell-intrinsic changes between normal tissues and either AV or AKPV lesions, such that the cell profiles of dysplastic epithelial cells in both models were highly distinct from normal epithelial cells (and similar to each other) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A</xref> and <bold>Methods</bold>). Epithelial cell profiles from normal mice (41% of cells) separated from most of those from AV and AKPV models (59% of cells) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A,B</xref>), suggesting a common shift in all dysplastic cells from the normal state. Notably, 11% of epithelial cells from AV/AKPV mice were classified as non-dysplastic healthy cells, indicating that normal, non-dysplastic, cells may be present in or adjacent to the lesion microenvironment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A</xref>), although we cannot firmly rule out adjacent tissue contamination. We annotated two cell clusters – Epi01 (dysplastic stem-like) and Epi05 (dysplastic secretory-like) – as dysplastic, due to their virtually exclusive presence in AV and AKPV models and because they expressed high levels of <italic>Apc</italic> target genes (<italic>e.g</italic>., <italic>Axin2, Ascl2, Myc, Ccnd1, Lgr5</italic>) and were enriched in tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells from AKPVT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4C,D</xref>) while also spanning the enterocyte to secretory continuum with healthy cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4B</xref>, PC2).</p>

<p>Interestingly, Epi05 (dysplastic secretory-like) had distinguishing markers (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>Ccl9, Mmp7, Ifitm3</italic>) from their counterparts in normal tissue, Epi04 (secretory) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A,C,E</xref>). <italic>Mmp7</italic> and <italic>Ifitm3</italic> are known to promote metastasis in human CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, and <italic>Ccl9</italic> expression by epithelial cells promotes tumor invasion through recruitment of Ccr1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells to the tumor’s invasive front in a mouse model of CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Notably, <italic>Ccr1</italic> is expressed by newly recruited monocytes, macrophages and granulocytes in our model, suggesting a potential mechanism for tumor infiltration and invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4E</xref>).

<p>RNA velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> analysis of the epithelial cell compartment predicted that in the dysplastic epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3B, right</xref>) a proliferating stem-cell like dysplastic subset is a direct source to both a massively expanded and heterogeneous non-proliferating population of dysplastic stem-like cells (expressing WNT signaling and angiogenesis programs) and to dysplastic cells of different ‘differentiation states’ (MHCII expressing stem/progenitors leading to enterocytes and secretory-like cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3B,C</xref>). Conversely, in the normal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3B</xref>, left), the ‘root’ is placed in a much smaller population of proliferating intestinal stem cells, and the stem cell compartment is overall much more modest. The proliferation and differentiation path of previously identified normal epithelial cells remains intact (<italic>i.e.</italic>, reminiscent of the one in normal samples) even in the dysplastic lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3B</xref>).

<title>Expression programs for stem-like functions, Wnt signaling, angiogenesis and inflammation are activated in dysplastic epithelial cells</title>
<p>Both normal and dysplastic epithelial cells varied along a continuum, as expected and previously observed in the ongoing differentiation in the colon epithelium<sup>2,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and our RNA Velocity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3</xref>). Using non-negative matrix factorization (iNMF from LIGER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, <bold>Methods</bold>), we recovered 20 expression programs spanning the different epithelial functions, and annotated them by Gene Ontology terms enriched in their top 100 weighted genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3C</xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4F-L</xref><bold>, Methods</bold>).</p>
<p>The programs enriched in different dysplastic cells highlighted key processes that play a role in tumor promotion, including stem cell programs, Wnt signaling, angiogenesis, and inflammation and innate immunity, including interferon alpha, beta and gamma pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3C</xref>). In particular, the stem cell program (#16) detected in some cells across all conditions, was enriched in dysplastic samples (FDR=5.6 10<sup>-10</sup>, two-sided Welch’s t-test on CLR transformed compositions), reminiscent of a recently described population in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Comparing cells from dysplastic and normal samples that express the stem cell program, the dysplastic cells had distinct expression profiles with induction of negative regulators of Wnt signaling (FDR=4.5 10<sup>-5</sup>, two-sided Fisher’s exact test in GO term enrichment, <italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>Notum</italic>, Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (<italic>Wif1</italic>) and <italic>Nkd1</italic>) and genes that are related to cellular response to interferon-gamma (FDR=1.7 10<sup>-6</sup>, <italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>Ccl9, Ccl6</italic>) and immune system process (FDR=6.4 10<sup>-4</sup>, <italic>e.g.</italic>, Ifitm1 and Ifitm3) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E,F</xref>). This is consistent with recent studies showing that <italic>Apc</italic>-mutant stem cells secrete negative regulators of Wnt signaling to induce the differentiation of the WT stem cells in their proximity, thereby outcompeting them and promoting tumor formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Thus, stem cells from dysplastic lesions may have non-canonical function and regulation. In addition, the programs for Wnt signaling (expressing both positive and negative regulators; #4, FDR=2.8 10<sup>-6</sup>), angiogenesis (#14, FDR=1.2 10<sup>-9</sup>), inflammatory response (#6, FDR=1.4 10<sup>-6</sup>), and innate immune response and interferon response (#7, FDR=1.2 10<sup>-2</sup>) were all predominantly expressed or enriched in AV/AKPV epithelium (all with two-sided Welch’s t-test on CLR transformed compositions, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4I-M</xref>).

<title>Malignant-like tissue programs and composition are conserved between mouse and human tumors</title>
<p>To evaluate the relevance of our findings to human colorectal cancer, we compared them to a scRNA-seq atlas we recently generated from tumor and adjacent normal tissue from 62 patients with either MMRp or MMRd CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.

While our mouse model should more closely resemble MMRp tumors, we compared to both classes separately and together to identify any shared features.</p>
<p>To assess the similarity between mouse and human programs we controlled for overall cross-species and batch differences by normalizing program-specific expression profiles with species-specific background profiles (<bold>Methods</bold>). The Pearson correlation coefficients of these normalized scores between the human and mouse programs indicate some overlap in the programs defined on mouse and human data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5A</xref>). Epithelial cells from human and mouse tumors expressed many programs highly correlated between the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5B</xref>, <bold>Methods</bold>), including for cell cycle, inflammation, epithelial secretory, angiogenesis, Wnt signaling, and normal colon functions.</p>
<p>Co-variation in cell proportions across samples (by scRNA-seq) was also conserved between human and mouse tumors, suggesting broad conservation of tumor composition. For example, in both species the proportion of endothelial cells and fibroblasts correlated across samples, as did T and B cell proportions in human tumors and mouse dysplastic lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5C</xref>). Moreover, when we transferred epithelial program annotations from mouse to human scRNA-seq and calculated their co-variation across samples in each species, programs 11 (proliferation), 14 (angiogenesis) and 16 (stem cells), co-varied both across dysplastic mouse tumors and across human MMRp and MMRd tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5D</xref> and <bold>Methods</bold>), suggesting a conserved dysplastic tissue architecture.</p>

<title>Integrated spatial and single-cell atlas of mouse CRC tumors</title>
<p>To comprehensively decipher the distribution of cells and programs in the tumor spatial niche, we next used Slide-seqV2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> for genome-wide spatial RNA-seq at 10 μm resolution. We sectioned and profiled frozen tissues from four normal colon and four AV lesions using 10 Slide-seqV2 pucks (<bold>Methods</bold>), recovering 221,936 high quality beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6A-C</xref>, <bold>Methods</bold>). We then integrated the single cell census and spatial profiles using TACCO, which allowed us to annotate each bead with compositions of discrete cell types (from epithelial, immune and stromal compartments) and to further annotate the epithelial fraction of each bead with a composition of epithelial program activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> “annotation”).</p>
<p>We first used TACCO to annotate every bead in the Slide-seq data with a composition of discrete cell subtypes for every puck separately, using its matching single-cell reference (normal or disease; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <bold>Methods</bold>). To this end, TACCO iteratively solved optimal transport problems to assign cell subtypes to fractions of reads of the beads.

It then summed all epithelial contributions into an epithelial-only spatial count matrix, followed by optimal transport to assign epithelial program contributions to individual beads, based on epithelial cell-only read signals.

<p>Cell proximity preferences in the normal colon tissue are consistent with the expected morphology, validating our approach (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A,B</xref>).

<title>Epithelial regional analysis recovers canonical structures in normal colon</title>
<p>To detect distinctive tissue regions in tumors, which lack traditional tissue references, we identified cellular neighborhoods with both similar epithelial program activity and a particular composition of immune and stromal cells. Specifically, we first identified “epithelial program regions” as areas of distinct epithelial program activity, and then found immune or stromal cells associated with each region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> “annotation”). Intuitively, we defined “regions” based on both the similarity in epithelial expression program activity and proximity in space. To do this, after assigning epithelial programs to epithelial beads, we clustered the beads based on a weighted sum of spatial proximity and expression program similarity. This results in spatially contiguous annotation of beads with distinct epithelial program activity, which, together with the immune and stromal cells in their proximity, compose the “region”. Specifically, using TACCO, we defined epithelial program regions by Leiden clustering of the weighted sum of neighborship graphs for spatial bead proximity and epithelial expression program similarity, such that transcriptionally similar epithelial beads on different pucks can be connected (despite “infinite” spatial distance, <bold>Methods</bold>). We then used this single framework for region annotation across all pucks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), to determine the distinctive composition of additional cell types in the same set of spatial regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8A</xref>).</p>

<p>In the normal colon, the regional analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom) robustly recovered the expected spatial organization of the healthy colon across five regions and their cellular composition and sublayers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), from luminal/apical to basal. Four regions recovered by TACCO corresponded to different layers of the mucosa (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E,F</xref>): a luminal layer with reads found beyond the cellular layer and likely representing cellular debris trapped in the mucus; three apical layers expressing programs related to normal epithelial function (transmembrane transport, oxidation-reduction process) with gradual transition from apical to basal features; and a basal-most layer, enriched for the deep crypt, proliferation (G1/S,G2/M), MHCII and basolateral plasma membrane programs, all common features of the deep crypt area. Finally, region 2, enriched with fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and endothelial cells, and located in the most basal side of the tissue, captured the submucosal and muscularis propria layers, which are predominantly comprised of fibroblasts and muscle, respectively, alongside blood and lymphatic vessels, nerves and immune cells. Overall, TACCO recovered the known organization of the colon, showing the power of our unsupervised mapping approach and shedding light on expression programs that are required for the maintenance of normal colon homeostasis.</p>

<title>Dysplastic lesions maintain some of the programs of the corresponding regions in healthy tissue</title>
<p>AV lesions did not maintain the robust organization of normal tissues, and reflected the expected histopathology of high grade dysplasia, when dysplastic cells are confined to the mucosal layer and do not invade the submucosa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>, top). Specifically, the submucosal and muscularis propria layers from both normal and AV lesions were assigned to region 2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the altered morphology, some of the disrupted regions also expressed programs characteristic of their normal healthy function, suggesting that tumor progression is spatially structured and compartmentalized. For example, the region above the submucosa, captured as region 1 in AV lesions and region 5 in normal colon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), had similar features in both AV lesions and normal samples. Thus, although the overall spatial organization was disrupted in the lesion, region 1 in AV lesions expressed programs that are reminiscent of the normal deep crypt region 5, and was enriched for deep crypt cells and programs that are related to proliferation and MHC II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,C</xref>). These included proliferation programs 3 and 11 and both normal stem cells (Epi03) and dysplastic secretory-like cells (Epi05), as well as dysplastic stem cells (Epi01, though to a lesser extent than some other regions), so it may reflect one of the proliferative stem cell (and dysplastic secretory-like) niches in AV models (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Other regions in the AV lesions also contained some epithelial cells with normal profiles, expressing programs that should allow them to maintain their capacity to perform normal tasks. For example, region 3 expressed apical plasma membrane functions and region 10 was enriched with oxidation-reduction functions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>To learn about the spatial distribution of the dysplastic regions, we measured their distance from region 2 (muscularis), which is a stable landmark in the lesions. Remnants of the layered structure of the healthy tissue were still observed in the AV tissue, especially at relatively low distances from the muscularis. For example, healthy region 5 – characteristically located at distances of about 150-200µm from the muscularis – is replaced by dysplastic region 1, peaking at 200µm. All malignant-like regions (6/8/11) were spatially associated at ∼300-700μm from the muscularis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8C</xref>), located ∼100-400μm apart from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8D</xref>). We further validated this result at the protein level, by staining for b-catenin, showing an (inactive) cytoplasmic localization in the region adjacent to the muscularis, and mostly nuclear (active) localization in distal regions, near the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8B</xref>).</p>

<title>Three spatially and functionally distinct tumor regions enriched in AV lesions</title>
<p>Three regions – 6, 8, and 11 – had epithelial composition and programs that suggested advanced malignant-like characteristics, each highlighting a potentially different mechanism for tumor progression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G,H</xref>). These three ‘malignant-like regions’, were enriched (<italic>vs</italic>. all other regions) in stem cell, Wnt signaling and angiogenesis programs (16, #4 and #14; FDR=9.6 10<sup>-21</sup>, 8.1 10<sup>-10</sup>, 3.7 10<sup>-10</sup>, two-sided Welch’s t-test on CLR transformed compositions) and depleted of normal epithelial programs (#5, #8, and #10; FDR=5.5 10<sup>-12</sup>, 1.6 10<sup>-12</sup>, 4.2 10<sup>-10</sup>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). Furthermore, the malignant-like regions were enriched in immune cells, including monocytes-macrophages (FDR&lt;=1.5 10<sup>-5</sup>; excluding Mac02 (Lyve1+)), T cell subsets TNK02 (Th1/Th17), TNK05 (GdT/Il17+), TNK06 (Treg), TNK08 (proliferating T) (FDR=2.4 10<sup>-3</sup>, 2.2 10<sup>-4</sup>, 1.7 10<sup>-3</sup>, 9.6 10<sup>-4</sup>; two-sided Welch’s t-test on CLR transformed compositions), infiltrating granulocytes (FDR&lt;=9.7 10<sup>-3</sup>), and mast cells (FDR=1.4 10<sup>-2</sup>), suggesting an ongoing immune response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). However, each one of the three regions had a different epithelial program composition, suggesting that in each type of region there is a different dominant pathway/feature that may drive tumor progression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, Table S2).</p>
<p>Region 6 was characterized by an inflammatory and angiogenic multicellular community, with epithelial and immune cells expressing inflammatory programs, endothelial cells and monocytes connected in a pro-angiogenic circuit, and pro-invasive genes expressed by both endothelial and immune cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Specifically, region 6 was distinctly enriched for proliferation (programs 3 and 11; FDR=2.2 10<sup>-14</sup>, 1.2 10<sup>-15</sup>, two-sided Welch’s t-test on CLR transformed compositions) and inflammatory epithelial programs (programs 6 and 7; FDR=9.0 10<sup>-7</sup>, 2.0 10<sup>-11</sup>), and its non-epithelial compartment was correspondingly enriched for genes from inflammatory pathways, including the response to TNF, IL-1 and IFN γ (FDR=3.1 10<sup>-4</sup>, 2.8 10<sup>-3</sup>, 4.9 10<sup>-6</sup>, two-sided Fisher’s exact test in GO term enrichment), and chemotaxis of monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes (FDR=1.5 10<sup>-3</sup>, 3.2 10<sup>-10</sup>, 1.0 10<sup>-2</sup>, Table S2), suggesting recruitment of inflammatory cells from the circulation or other parts of the tissue. Region 6 was also enriched for collagen binding genes and collagen-containing extracellular matrix (ECM) genes (FDR=1.4 10<sup>-2</sup>, 7.6 10<sup>-5</sup>, two-sided Fisher’s exact test in GO term enrichment, Table S2), which are important for migration and invasiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. These include <italic>Sparc</italic>, expressed mainly by endothelial cells and fibroblasts in our data, known to promote colorectal cancer invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>; and <italic>Ctss</italic>, a peptidase expressed by T cells and monocytes-macrophages that promotes CRC neovascularization and tumor growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Finally, gene expression patterns in endothelial cells and monocytes in region 6 suggested active angiogenesis through a multi-cellular feedback loop, with enriched numbers of vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells expressing immune-attracting chemokines (<italic>Cxcl9</italic>) and adhesion molecules (<italic>e.g. Chd5, Mcam</italic>), monocytes expressing proangiogenic factors that induce proliferation of endothelial cells (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>Mmp12</italic>), and monocytes and macrophages expressing <italic>Ctsd</italic>, which increases tumorigenesis in CRC models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8E</xref>).</p>
<p>Region 8 was enriched for deep crypt cells (program 13; FDR=1.7 10<sup>-14</sup>, two-sided Welch’s t-test on CLR transformed compositions), reminiscent of the normal stem cell niche in normal colon, an epithelial innate immune program (program 1; FDR=3.4 10<sup>-100</sup>) expressed by secretory cells in AV and AKPV lesions, and plasma and B cell activity. Unlike the canonical (normal) deep crypt region (region 5), which is enriched for MHCII expression (program 18; FDR=8.6 10<sup>-28</sup>), this region was depleted for the program’s expression (FDR=2.1 10<sup>-26</sup>), which may indicate an earlier stem cell-like state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, or a decoupling of the cell cycle and MHCII programs (which are coupled in normal ISC differentiation, and allow a cross talk with T cells to modulate T cell differentiation) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,C</xref>). The region’s non-epithelial compartment was enriched for B cell activation and BCR signaling genes (FDR=4.0 10<sup>-4</sup>, 1.9 10<sup>-3</sup>, two-sided Fisher’s exact test in GO term enrichment, Table S2). This may be related to B cell function in protection from lumen antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> or to tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), which is correlated with clinical benefits in cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Notably, Epi05 (dysplastic secretory-like) enriched in Region 8 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) expressed higher levels of inflammatory genes and immune chemokines (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>Ccl9, Ifitm3</italic>) compared to normal counterparts, Epi04 (secretory) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4C,E</xref>), and may thus promote the formation of this region. We validated the presence of TLS-like structures in association with deep crypt secretory cells in AV lesions using multiplex RNA analysis (Cartana) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figSI3">Supplementary item 3</xref>), showing that the dominant population of B cells is accompanied by monocyte-macrophages and T cells characteristic of TLSs, as well as the expression of <italic>Reg4</italic> and <italic>Muc2</italic>, deep crypt goblet/secretory cell markers.</p>
<p>Region 11 was populated by cells expressing the Wnt signaling pathway program (4, FDR=9.3 10<sup>-13</sup>, two-sided Welch’s t-test on CLR transformed compositions), with several lines of evidence supporting an active epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in this region. Epithelial cells in region 11 were enriched for the expression of mesenchymal genes, including Vimentin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> (<italic>Vim</italic>, FDR=7.4 10<sup>-245</sup>, one-sided Fisher’s exact test), <italic>Prox1</italic><sup>59</sup> (FDR=3.7 10<sup>-153</sup>), and <italic>Sox11</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> (FDR=7.7 10<sup>-224</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8F</xref>), as well as for EMT signatures from a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> (FDR=1.5 10<sup>-142</sup>, two-sided Mann-Whitney U test) and from human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> (FDR=6.9 10<sup>-55</sup>, two-sided Mann-Whitney U test). This is consistent with the role of Wnt signaling in promoting EMT and a mesenchymal phenotype in CRC, breast cancer and other epithelial tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Region 11 non-epithelial cells also expressed genes encoding MHC-I binding proteins (FDR=4.6 10<sup>-2</sup>, two-sided Fisher’s exact test in GO term enrichment, Table S2) and actin cytoskeleton, filament and binding proteins (FDR=3.1 10<sup>-6</sup>, 7.7 10<sup>-3</sup>, 2.7 10<sup>-10</sup>). Organization of the cytoskeleton affects migration, adherence, and interaction of lymphocytes with antigen presenting cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Notably, region 11 also concentrated at a more distal part of the tissue at ∼900μm from the muscularis suggesting an outgrowth of the tissue towards the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8C</xref>).</p>
<p>Non-epithelial cells formed two cellular hubs in the malignant-like regions (6,8,11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8G</xref>): An endothelial-fibroblast hub, detected in all three regions, and an immune hub with B cells, TNK cells, monocytes, and macrophages, which was prominent in inflammatory region 6, weaker (less spatially correlated) in region 8 (but validated <italic>in situ</italic>), and not correlated in region 11. Thus, activation of an immune response is reflected by close proximity between immune cells. We further characterized the organization of the vascular niche using our multiplex <italic>in situ</italic> RNA data, finding that while neighbors of the Pdgfrb-expressing pericytes are mainly other Pdgfrb-expressing pericytes and endothelial cells, Pecam1-expressing endothelial cells appear self-enriched next to themselves at cellular scale distances and close to Pdgfrb-expressing pericytes for larger distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8H</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, three multicellular community regions were enriched in AV lesions: (<bold>1</bold>) inflammatory epithelial regions with endothelial cells and monocytes expressing angiogenesis, inflammation and invasion programs; (<bold>2</bold>) epithelial stem-like regions, associated with plasma and B cell activity; and (<bold>3</bold>) regions with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Wnt signaling dysplastic cells. Each region highlights different processes that modulate tumorigenesis or invasion, and the three regions co-exist in the same tumor at different spatial locations.</p>

<title>Cell-cell interactions are rewired in AV lesions</title>
<p>To identify cell-cell signaling mechanisms that may underly these regional associations, we used COMMOT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, a computational framework that uses Optimal Transport to infer cell-cell communication from receptor-ligand expression patterns in spatially resolved data.

<title>Similar spatial patterns in human and mouse tumors</title>
<p>The overall spatial distribution of cell types and epithelial profiles was conserved between mouse and human tumors, when comparing to scRNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>.

This identified two main “meta compartments”, with epithelial, stromal and immune profiles from human MMRp and MMRd tumors associated with regions 6, 8 and 11 that were enriched in AV lesions (as well as 0 and 2), while those from normal human tissue were associated with normal regions (<italic>e.g.</italic>, 5, 10, 12) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Figure S9A</xref>, <bold>Methods</bold>).</p>

<title>Malignant-like regions are associated with tumor progression in human colorectal tumors</title>
<p>We next assessed if the regional epithelial programs that we spatially identified in mouse are conserved in human. To this end, we constructed pseudo-bulk profiles from epithelial cells for our mouse samples and for recently published human samples profiled along different stages of malignant transformation, from normal tissue to polyp to CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. We scored each epithelial pseudo-bulk profile with the differentially expressed genes between the epithelial parts of the regions and computed the principal components of these scores across all human and mouse samples (<bold>Methods</bold>). The first principal component (PC1) captured features that are related to malignancy, with higher values for human tumors <italic>vs</italic>. polyps (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Figure S9B</xref>). In addition, malignant-like region (6/8/11) scores were higher in dysplastic <italic>vs</italic>. normal samples (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, the spatial region profiles defined in mouse capture features that correlate with malignant transformation in human.</p>
<p>We further classified each full pseudo-bulk profile from the dysplastic human samples into one of the four groups in the CMS expression-based classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> (<bold>Methods</bold>) and compared the mouse region scores for each class of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Figure S9C</xref><bold>, Methods</bold>). CMS2 classified samples were most closely related to our dysplastic mouse models: all of the dysplasia -associated regions were enriched in CMS2 tumors while most normal regions were depleted, relative to the other CMS classes.</p>
<p>Finally, we found that expression of the malignant like regions (6/8/11) in tumors was associated with clinical outcome. We scored each tumor based on genes that were differentially expressed between the full expression profile of malignant-like regions (6/8/11) and compared the progression-free interval (PFI) and overall survival (OS) for patients in TCGA whose RNA-seq profiles were in the top and bottom quartile of malignant-like region scores (<bold>Methods</bold>). High scores for malignant-like region 11 (EMT) were correlated with shorter PFI, while those for malignant-like region 6 (inflammation) correlate with longer PFI and longer OS, (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D,E</xref>). These associations were driven primarily by MMRp tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Figure S9D,E</xref>). This suggests that region 11 is associated with pro-tumorigenic properties in human patients, while region 6 might be associated with tumor controlling properties. This highlights the importance of multicellular functional tissue modules in the CRC tumor ecosystem.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we systematically charted the spatial organization of cellular expression in dysplastic tissue of the colon, to help identify putative functional units in the tumor. We used TACCO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> to integrate scRNA-seq and Slide-seq data, not only by mapping cell types to their positions, but also distinguishing different cell programs, the regions that they dominate, and their characteristic microenvironments. This allowed us to overcome technical limitations, such as lack of spatial context in scRNA-seq and sparse readout in Slide-seq, and to generate a high-resolution spatial map of the dysplastic landscape transcending beyond the mapping of individual cells to spatial positions. We used this map to show correlation with clinical outcome in human patient tumors.</p>
<p>Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed profound enrichment of a stem cell program in dysplastic tissues. The profiles of dysplastic cells expressing this program are distinct from normal stem cells and enriched with expression of negative regulators of the WNT signaling pathway and inflammation, suggesting a non-canonical function. The abundance of these cells with stemness potential across all our malignant-like regions, points to a dynamic population that can affect the cells in its proximity, by secretion of negative regulators of the WNT signaling and inflammatory function but may also adopt various functions depending on the environmental cues and dysplasia-associated cells in its proximity. A similar population, designated “high-plasticity cell state”, was previously described in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma and in human patients, where it was correlated with resistance to chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Whether these cells can be manipulated to take on specific phenotypes or even to differentiate into normal-like enterocytes given the appropriate signal from the microenvironment, remain as open questions.</p>
<p>Within the dysplastic lesions, alongside malignant-like regions, we found regions with normal features (Regions 3,4,9,10), comparable to regions found in the normal colon, most likely representing compartments driven by clones that were not affected by the genetic perturbation. One of these regions, region 4, contained mainly goblet cells with normal expression profiles. Whether this neighborhood represents normal cells that reside alongside malignant cells or a cancer transition state, it may modify tumor progression, by recruiting immune cells or by secreting factors that affect epithelial proliferation in adjacent regions. For example, region 4 in dysplastic lesions is enriched with chemokine activity genes relative to region 4 in normal colon suggesting a possible role in recruitment of immune cells to the dysplastic landscape. Further work is required to understand the role of these regions (expressing normal features) in tumor progression.</p>
<p>While the malignant-like regions were identified as discrete spatial entities, each with coordinated features across epithelial, immune, and stromal cells, these regions are adjacent to each other. Thus, they may still influence one another through signaling or by utilizing branches of the same main vessels. For example, <italic>Osm</italic> is expressed by cells in region 6, whereas its receptor is expressed on fibroblasts and endothelial cells enriched in region 11. <italic>OSMR</italic> was previously shown to be expressed by inflammatory fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> and its activation in malignant cells promotes EMT in breast cancer and pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> and a mesenchymal state in glioblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Future studies can help determine if these regions are functionally inter-dependent and if they evolved from the same clones and can inter-convert, or whether they developed independently.</p>
<p>Because animal models complement cell and tissue atlases of human colorectal cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, by allowing experimental manipulation for mechanistic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>, it is important to relate between models and patients. By studying genetically engineered mouse models using high resolution single cell spatial genomics we can help determine to what extent they recapitulate the cellular and spatial organization of human disease, in the context of two distinct genetic states that represent human CMS-2 lesions. To this end, we developed several approaches to allow cross species comparison of tumors at the single cell and spatial level, despite the high level of both intra- and inter-individual variation within each species. Comparing to human CRC, our analysis suggests that the CRC landscape is organized in similar multicellular functional tissue modules between human and mouse, and disease subtypes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, MMRp and MMRd). Future studies applying our approaches to patient cohorts could help understand whether the expression of different tissue modules may contribute to the partial response to immunotherapy reported for MMRd patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, and to define specific tissue modules predictive of response to therapy. Notably, while our study focused on the tumor landscape, its findings may be relevant for tissue response to other challenges (<italic>e.g.</italic>, inflammation, fibrosis, wound healing), which involve activation of similar functional tissue modules, a result of collective function of parenchymal, immune and stromal cells.</p>
<p>Taken together, our integrative approach facilitates spatial analysis with high resolution, constructing regional neighborhoods and their spatial layout at both high cellular resolution and genomic scale. Our work is an important step toward a systematic understanding of the organization of dysplastic tissue with the potential to contribute to improved patient stratification by the multicellular functional units in the tumor landscape.</p>

<title>Multiplex <italic>in situ</italic> RNA Analysis</title>
<p>Multiplex <italic>in situ</italic> RNA analysis was performed with Cartana<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> technology (a newer version is now available as Xenium (10x Genomics)). In total we measured 3 samples with one section per sample in each state (normal/AV) and probe set (V1/V2), with an additional replicate section for one of the samples in normal V2.</p>
<p>Fresh Frozen OCT-embedded tissues from normal colon and AV lesions were cryosectioned as 10 μm sections and placed onto SuperFrost Plus glass slides (ThermoFisher) and further stored at - 80°C before experiments. Samples were fixed (with 4% formaldehyde) for 5 minutes and permeabilized for 5 minutes (with 0,1 mg/mL pepsin in 0.1M HCl (P7012 Sigma-Aldrich)) prior to library preparation.</p>
<p>For library preparation, chimeric padlock probes (directly targeting RNA and containing an anchor sequence as well as a gene-specific barcode) for a custom panel of 66 (V1) or 180 (V2) genes (Table S3, see below) were hybridized overnight at 37°C, then ligated before the rolling circle amplification was performed overnight at 30°C using the HS Library Preparation kit for CARTANA technology and following manufacturer’s instructions. All incubations were performed in SecureSeal<sup>TM</sup> chambers (Grace Biolabs). Note that prior to final library preparation, optimal RNA integrity and assay conditions were assessed using Malat1 and Rplp0 housekeeping genes only using the same protocol.</p>
<p>To prevent tissue sections detachment, an additional baking step of 30 minutes at 37°C was performed before mounting. To quench autofluorescence background, TrueView (SP-8400 VectorLabs) was used for 1 minute at room temperature. For tissue sections mounting, Slow Fade Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher) was used for optimal handling and imaging.</p>
<p>Quality control of library preparation was performed by applying anchor probes to detect simultaneously all rolling circle amplification products from all genes in all panels. Anchor probes are labeled probes with Cy5 fluorophore (excitation at 650 nm and emission at 670 nm). All samples passed quality control and went through <italic>in situ</italic> barcode sequencing, imaging and data processing. Briefly, adapter probes and sequencing pools (containing 4 different fluorescent labels: Alexa Fluor® 488, Cy3, Cy5 and Alexa Fluor® 750) were hybridized to the padlock probes to detect the gene-specific barcodes, through a sequence specific signal for each gene specific rolling circle amplification product. This was followed by imaging and performed 6 times in a row to allow for the decoding of all genes in the panel. To reduce lipofuscin autofluorescence, 1X Lipofuscin Autofluorescence Quencher (Promocell) was applied for 30 seconds before fluorescence labeling.</p>
<p>Raw data consisting of 20x or 40x images from 5 fluorescent channels (DAPI, Alexa Fluor® 488, Cy3, Cy5 and Alexa Fluor® 750) were each taken as z-stack and flattened to 2D using maximum intensity projection.

The single cell profiles were provisionally annotated with SingleR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> cell-wise (i.e. without using clustering information) using the SingleR built-in MouseRNAseqData and an intestine specific dataset from Tabula Muris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/13092143">https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/13092143</ext-link><underline>)</underline>.

<title>Expression programs and batch correction</title>
<p>For the dataset of each compartment separately (generated as described above), an integrative NMF was performed (using a part of the LIGER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> implementation) with k=20 and lambda=5 to identify 20 programs and their respective weights per cell. This iNMF factorization represents the single cell expression matrix as a weighted sum of profiles such that both the weights and programs contain only non-negative numbers, while allowing for and separating out batch-only contributions. The same approach was also used with a higher <italic>k</italic> (epithelial and immune: 200, stromal: 50) to yield a detailed and batch corrected decomposition of expression which was then combined to obtain a count-like corrected expression matrix for the top 5,000 highly variable genes. For each compartment separately, these batch-corrected data were normalized to 10,000 counts, log1p transformed, corrected for number of counts and percentage of mitochondrial genes by linear regression, scaled with a max_value of 10, followed by a PCA of the previously annotated 5,000 highly variable genes. A <italic>k</italic>-nearest neighbors (<italic>k</italic>-NN) graph was constructed from the top 50 PCs, with <italic>k</italic>=15 neighbors using Scanpy, and clustered using a compartment-specific Leiden resolution parameter (epithelial: 0.2, immune: 0.4, stromal: 0.1). This clustering was used as the cluster level annotation of the mouse scRNA-seq data for the epithelial and stromal compartment. Separately per compartment the data were annotated with SingleR using the cluster information. The same per-compartment batch-corrected and preprocessed data from the Leiden clustering was used to create UMAP embeddings with PAGA initialization using Scanpy.</p>
<p>To improve the clustering and annotation in the immune compartment and to filter out additional doublets not detected by Scrublet, the immune data were separately filtered and clustered using information from the compartment level clustering and annotation. To that end, myeloid and T/NK cells were partitioned separately and further processed, and additional likely doublet cells were labeled and removed by the following procedure:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Cells were labeled as doublets based on higher number of UMIs of marker genes for other compartments than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile observed in this immune partition (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Epcam and Cdh1 to remove immune-epithelial doublets and Cav1 and Kdr to remove immune-stromal doublets) and other immune partitions (i.e., Cd3d, Cd3e, and Cd3g to remove myeloid-lymphoid doublets from the myeloid cells). This type of filter criterion for lowly expressed genes (“larger than some percentile” on integer counts) also allows to keep more than 95% of the cells if, for example, all cells of this partition happened to have 0 UMIs of a particular marker gene.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cells were labeled as doublets if they had inconsistent cell-wise and cluster-wise SingleR annotations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cells were labeled as doublets if they had significantly (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR=0.05, one-sided Fisher’s exact test) more neighbors in the k-NN graph from the immune compartment that were already marked as doublets.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All cells labeled as doublets were removed.</p></list-item>
</list>
After filtering, the count matrices were batch corrected as above using the integrative NMF from LIGER with k=20 and lambda=5, and clustered like above with group specific Leiden resolution (myeloid: 0.2, TNK: 0.4). For myeloid and TNK cells, this clustering superseded the original clustering. The integrative NMF result here was only used for updating the clustering and not for generating an extra set of expression programs.</p>
<p>Note that cluster Epi06 shows a broad expression spectrum; while such pattern can best be explained by remaining doublets, they were not called by Scrublet and could also not be consistently removed by extra QC as was applied to the immune compartment. The interpretation of Epi06 as containing doublets is supported by its overrepresentation in the annotation of the Slide-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6E</xref>), as both doublets and slide-seq beads represent compositions of different cells. Still, non-doublet explanations (e.g. undifferentiated cells) cannot be ruled out. Therefore, Epi06 cells are retained in the data but not interpreted biologically.</p>

<title>Marker selection for <italic>in situ</italic> RNA analysis (CARTANA)</title>
<p>CARTANA V1 markers were selected from genes differentially expressed between compartments, cell types and clusters (for the immune and stromal compartments), and highly ranked genes for programs (for the epithelial compartment) were first filtered by biological relevance and the literature, obtaining 87 genes. To further reduce the set to the available panel size (66 genes), genes were annotated into categories of potential redundancy. To choose between redundant genes, a global objective function was optimized over the gene selection, looping over all potentially redundant gene sets until convergence, exhaustively testing all choices within a gene set, and accepting the best choice for this gene set in terms of the global objective function. The global objective function was constructed as the mean 4-fold cross-validation scores (using “GroupKFold” and “cross_val_score” from sklearn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>) of multi-class logistic regression classification (using “LogisticRegression” from sklearn) for discriminating cell classes and of ridge regression of epithelial program weights (using “RidgeRegression” from sklearn) on the scRNA-seq data subsampled to the expected sparsity of CARTANA data. The cell classifications used were between the stromal, immune, and epithelial compartment, within the stromal compartment between Endo01, Endo02, and fibroblasts, within the immune compartment between myeloid and lymphoid lineage, within the lymphoid lineage between T cells and B cells, within the myeloid lineage between granulocytes, mast cells, and all monocytes and macrophages together, between monocytes and macrophages, and within monocytes between Mono01, Mono02, Mono03, and Mono04. The programs used in ridge regression were programs 3, 4, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, and 16. As the probes for Ly6c1 and Ly6c2 could not discriminate sufficiently between Ly6c1 and Ly6c2, we chose combined probes that measure both.</p>
<p>The CARTANA V2 panel, included 59 of the 66 genes in the V1 panel (the others had to be removed for technical reasons), another 113 genes from the standard fixed gene panel for CARTANA, and 8 selected genes from literature.</p>

First, human expression data were mapped to mouse genes using MGI homology information [subsection “Mapping of mouse and human orthologs”].

Annotation with maximum probability per cell was used as the unique cluster level annotation for mouse T/NK cells. Annotations were aggregated per sample to yield a compositional annotation over the identical cluster annotation categories (from the human dataset) for the T/NK subsets of human and mouse samples.

<title>Slide-seq compositional annotation</title>
<p>Slide-seq data were annotated with scRNA-seq reference annotations. First, Slide-seq and scRNA-seq data were filtered to retain only 15759 genes that were detected in both datasets and only beads and cells that had at least 10 counts across all these common genes.</p>
<p>Next, TACCO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> was used to perform compositional annotation of each bead, allowing the bead counts to be explained by fractional contributions. In its basic application, TACCO finds an “optimal” mapping between scRNA-seq annotation categories (<italic>e.g.</italic>, cell types) and beads by solving a variant of an entropically regularized Optimal Transport (OT) problem in expression space. In its iterative application, TACCO uses a bi-sectioning functionality iteratively, annotating only fractions of the counts in each round, and reserving the remainder for the next round to improve the sensitivity to sub-leading annotation contributions (that is, first capture a portion of the counts for the “top” cell types, but preserving others for other, more minor, cell types).</p>
<p>For the compositional annotation of Slide-seq beads with the categorical cell clusters from the single cell data, the “annotate” function of TACCO with OT was used as core annotation method per Slide-seq puck with the subset of the single cell data with matching disease state, with basic platform normalization, entropy regularization parameter epsilon 0.005, marginal relaxation parameter lambda of 0.001, and 4 iterations of bisectioning with a divisor of 3.</p>
<p>For the compositional annotation of Slide-seq beads with the compositional epithelial programs, the annotated beads were split using the “split_observations” function of TACCO on the cluster-level annotation and then aggregated to compartment level using the “merge_observations” function keeping only beads for a compartment with at least 50 counts assigned to that compartment. The genes from the epithelial part were filtered to retain only those that were used to define the epithelial programs in scRNA-seq, and then annotated using again the “annotate” function with OT as core annotation method, basic platform normalization, entropy regularization parameter epsilon 0.01, and a marginal relaxation parameter lambda of 0.001.</p>

<title>Slide-seq region annotation</title>
<p>Region annotation was done for all pucks (normal and AV pucks) in one step to get comparable region annotations across pucks, such that beads that have similar epithelial program activity and are spatially close are called as one region. Because cell type composition can change drastically from one bead to its neighbor at the length scales of Slide-seq data, there is a need to compromise between optimizing the two similarities. This is done with the “find_regions” function of TACCO, which performs a Leiden clustering on the weighted sum of connectivity matrices derived from epithelial program similarity and spatial proximity, using a position weight of 0.7, a Leiden resolution of 1.3, and 15 nearest neighbors per bead in position space and epithelial program space. To determine the neighbors in epithelial program space, the square-roots of the program weights were used for neighbor finding which effectively uses Bhattacharyya coefficients as overlap in epithelial program space instead of the Euclidean scalar products used for position space. These regions are defined by construction only on beads with a large enough epithelial contribution (see above) and are then extended to all beads by assigning unannotated beads the region from the nearest bead with region annotation.</p>
<p>Submucosal and muscularis propria layers are predominantly comprised of fibroblasts and muscle cells, respectively, alongside blood and lymphatic vessels, nerves and immune cells. Our algorithm depends on the epithelial expression component in beads. Since these layers do not contain epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>, mapping likely relied either on “noisy” signal from non-epithelial cells or from the basal-most epithelial layer.</p>

<title>Cell-type neighborships in Slide-seq data</title>
<p>To evaluate the local cell-type neighborship relations in the different disease states on the cluster level, the clusters were filtered per disease state to contain only clusters which account for at least 1% of the UMIs in that state. Then neigbourhood-enrichment z-scores were calculated using TACCO’s “co_occurrence_matrix” function with max_distance=20 and n_permutation=10. To evaluate the stability of the result, this is also repeated for (max_distance, n_permutation)=(40,10),(60,10),(20,5), and (20,50). To get the significance of the overall change in z-scores between the states, a one-sided Mann-Whitney-U test was performed on the values of the upper triangular half of the matrix between the two disease states for (max_distance, n_permutation)=(20,10).</p>
<p>A similar neighborship analysis was performed on the coarser cell-type level separately for the three malignant regions 6, 8, and 11, using TACCO’s “co_occurrence_matrix” function with max_distance=20 and n_permutation=10.</p>

<title>Cell-type co-occurrence in Slide-seq data</title>
<p>Cell-type compositions relative to a spatial landmark, Region 2=muscularis, were evaluated using TACCO’s “annotation_coordinate” function with max_distance=1000 and delta_distance=10. To reduce tissue structure bias from the muscularis, the distance dependency of cell-type frequency relations was evaluated only for beads deep in the “epithelial domain”, defined as follows. The effective distance from stromal annotation was computed using TACCO’s “annotation_coordinate” function (with max_distance=100, delta_distance=10, critical_neighbourhood_size=4.0) and only beads with a distance of at least 75µm were used. On these remaining beads, TACCO’s “co_occurrence” function was used (with delta_distance=20, max_distance=1000) to compute cell types co-occurrence as a function of their distance.</p>

<title>Ligand-Receptor analysis and spatially informed enrichment</title>
<p>For the ligand-receptor analysis on slide-seq data we used COMMOT v0.03<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. COMMOT employs optimal transport to construct sender and receiver side receptor-ligand interactions for every bead in one run of COMMOT. After filtering to beads with at least 100 counts, we applied basic preprocessing (normalization, log1p-transformation) and load the CellChat database as done in the COMMOT tutorial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://commot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Basic_usage.html">https://commot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Basic_usage.html</ext-link>). We then follow the Slide-Seq v2 analysis from the COMMOT paper (“slideseqv2-mouse-hippocampus/1-lr_signaling.ipynb” from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7272562">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7272562</ext-link>) to filter the database and to reconstruct the spatial communication network on ligand-receptor pair and pathway level separately for every puck. In particular, we use the distance cutoff of 200µm for inference of ligand-receptor interactions. The resulting bead-wise sender- and receiver communication values were then used for enrichment analysis between disease states and between spatial regions.</p>
<p>Unlike the downstream Slide-Seq v2 analysis from the COMMOT paper (“slideseqv2-mouse-hippocampus/2-downstream_analysis.ipynb” from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7272562">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7272562</ext-link>), we do not treat each bead on the puck as statistically independent observation in statistical tests, which leads to unreliably small p-values. Instead, we split all pucks along their axis of greatest extent (defined by the first principal component axis of the distribution of the spatial measurements) into spatial patches discarding 400µm of boundary layer (twice the COMMOT distance cutoff, also co-occurrences have decayed strongly at this distance) in between the patches to reduce the correlation between the patches. This is done iteratively with the patches to get a set of weakly correlated patches. On these patches we calculate the mean of the communication values and treat them as statistically independent observations for statistical tests. We argue that multiple sufficiently separated spatial patches of single spatial samples can be seen as multiple spatial samples using a spatial method with a smaller measurement area, and therefore can be treated as replicates. Unlike splitting into patches without removing a boundary layer, this procedure does not converge to the case of treating each bead as an independent observation as the number of iterations rises as it accounts for the spatial correlations between adjacent measurements. This gives a natural lower limit of p-values reachable with p-values rising again if too many splits are performed as too much data is lost to remove the correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figSI4">Supplementary item 4C,D</xref>). We chose a number of iterations of 2 as a compromise between having more patches and not discarding much data. For the enrichment of the pathway communication values we used a two-sided Mann-Whitney U test across the patches and cite Benjamini-Hochberg FDR values. For the enrichment testing in a given group (e.g. an annotated spatial region) only those patches are used which have at least 100 beads on the patch.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, for consistency, an analogous enrichment procedure was also used for COMMOT-unrelated quantities, like cell types, even though their spatial footprint is not as large as COMMOT’s (distance cutoff of 200µm). For cluster-level cell type enrichment analyses on Slide-seq data, only the top 3 contributing subtypes were considered, to better reflect the expected properties of Slide-seq data and better compare with categorically annotated scRNA-seq data.</p>

<title>Comparison between mouse and human programs</title>
<p>To compare mouse and human epithelial expression programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, genes were mapped to mouse homologs using MGI homology information [subsection “Mapping of mouse and human orthologs”]. Mouse and human programs were then characterized by a single vector of mean expression per program in mouse gene space. Specifically, both mouse and human programs were defined such that their weighted sum approximates the expression profiles of the cells without any transformations. Programs and weights were normalized to sum to 1. To reduce batch-effects (including species-specific ones), a background expression profile was defined for each species dataset as the pseudo-bulk epithelial expression profile in the respective scRNAs-seq data. Program and background profiles were normalized to 10,000 counts and the log ratio of the normalized program and background expression vectors was used to define a vector for each species. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for each pair of program vectors (mouse vs. human).</p>

<p>In their study, Avraham-Davidi et al. combined scRNA-seq and spatial mapping studies to profile two preclinical mouse models of colorectal cancer: Apcfl/fl VilincreERT2 (AV) and Apcfl/fl LSL-KrasG12D Trp53fl/fl Rosa26LSL-tdTomato/+ VillinCreERT2 (AKPV). In the first part of the manuscript, the authors describe the analysis of the normal colon and dysplastic lesions induced in these models following tamoxifen injection. They highlight broad variations in immune and stromal cell composition within dysplastic lesions, emphasizing the infiltration of monocytes and granulocytes, the accumulation of IL-17+gdT cells and the presence of a distinct group of endothelial cells. A major focus the study is the remodeling of the epithelial compartment, where most significant changes are observed. Using no-negative matrix factorization, the authors identify molecular programs of epithelial cell functions, emphasizing stemness, Wnt signaling, angiogenesis and inflammation as majors features associated with dysplastic cells. They conclude that findings from scRNA-seq analyses in mouse models are transposable to human CRC. In the second part of the manuscript, the authors aim to provide the spatial contexture for their scRNA-seq findings using Slide-seq and TACCO. They demonstrate that dysplastic lesions are disorganized and contain tumor-specific regions, which contextualize the spatial proximity between specific cell states and gene programs. Finally, they claim that these spatial organizations are conserved in human tumors and associate region-based gene signatures with patient outcome in public datasets. Overall, the data were collected and analyzed using solid and validated methodology to offer a useful resource to the community.</p>
<p>Main comments:</p>
<p>(1) Clarity. The manuscript would benefit from a substantial reorganization to improve clarity and accessibility for a broad readership. The text could be shortened and the number of figure panels reduced to emphasize the novel contributions of this work while minimizing extensive discussions on general and expected findings, such as tissue disorganization in dysplastic lesions. Additionally, figure panels are not consistently introduced in the correct order, and some are not discussed at all (e.g., Fig. S1D; Fig. 3C is introduced before Fig. 3A; several panels in Fig. 4 are not discussed). The annotation of scRNA-seq cell states is insufficiently explained, with no corresponding information about associated genes provided in the figures or tables. Multiple annotations are used to describe cell groups (e.g., TKN01 = γδ T and CD8 T, TKN05 = γδT_IL17+), but these are not jointly accessible in the figures, making the manuscript challenging to follow. It is also not clear what is the respective value of the two mouse models and timepoints of tissue collection in the analysis.</p>
<p>(2) Novelty. While the study is of interest, it does not present major findings that significantly advance the field or motivate new directions and hypotheses. Many conclusions related to tissue composition and patient outcomes, such as the epithelial programs of Wnt signaling, angiogenesis, and stem cells, are well-established and not particularly novel. Greater exploration of the scRNA-seq data beyond cell type composition could enhance the novelty of the findings. For instance, several tumor microenvironment clusters uniquely detected in dysplastic lesions (e.g., Mono2, Mono3, Gran01, Gran02) are identified, but no further investigation is conducted to understand their biological programs, such as applying nNMF as was done for epithelial cells. Additional efforts to explore precise tissue localization and cellular interactions within tissue niches would provide deeper insights and go beyond the limited analyses currently displayed in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(3) Validation. Several statements made by the authors are insufficiently supported by the data presented in the manuscript and should be nuanced in the absence of proper validation. For example: 1.) RNA velocity analyses: The conclusions drawn from these analyses are speculative and need further support. 2.) Annotations of epithelial clusters as dysplastic: These annotations could have been validated through morphological analyses and staining on FFPE slides. 3.) Conservation of mouse epithelial programs in human tumors: The data in Figure S5B does not convincingly demonstrate enrichment of stem cell program 16 in human samples. This should be more explicitly stated in the text, given the emphasis placed on this program by the authors. 4.) Figure S6E: Cluster Epi06 is significantly overrepresented in spatial data compared to scRNA-seq, yet the authors claim that cell type composition is largely recapitulated without further discussion, which reduces confidence in other conclusions drawn.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, stronger validation of key dysplastic regions (regions 6, 8, and 11) in mouse and human tissues using antibody-based imaging with markers identified in the analyses would have considerably strengthened the study. Such validation would better contextualize the distribution, composition, and relative abundance of these regions within human tumors, increasing the significance of the findings and aiding the generation of new pathophysiological hypotheses.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors conducted a spatial analysis of dysplastic colon tissue using the Slide-seq method. Their main objective is to build a detailed spatial atlas that identifies distinct cellular programs and microenvironments within dysplastic lesions. Next, they correlated this observation with clinical outcomes in human colorectal cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is a good example of utilising spatial methods to study different tumour models. The authors identified a unique stem cell program to understand tumours gently and improve patient stratification strategies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the study's predominantly descriptive nature is a significant limitation. Although the spatial maps and correlations between cell states are interesting observations, the lack of functional validation-primarily through experiments in mouse models-weakens the causal inferences regarding the roles these cellular programs play in tumour progression and therapy resistance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Indeed, functional validation to pin down causal dependencies and a more thorough investigation of tumor progression and therapy resistance both in mouse model as well as human patients and/or patient derived samples would broaden the insights to be gained from this work. Unfortunately, this is beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors also missed an opportunity to link the mutational status of malignant cells with the cellular neighbourhoods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The data reported in this study only contains spatial data for one mouse model (AV). As spatial data for the other model (AKPV) is missing, it is not possible to link the mutational type of the model with the cellular neighborhoods. We did investigate whether there is extra somatic mutational heterogeneity in the AV data, both regarding single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and copy number variations (CNVs). But at the time when the mice were sacrificed (after 3 weeks) there was no significant mutational heterogeneity discoverable.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, the study contributes to profiling the dysplastic colon landscape. The methodologies and data will benefit the research community, but further functional validation is crucial to validate the biological and clinical implications of the described cellular interactions.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In their study, Avraham-Davidi et al. combined scRNA-seq and spatial mapping studies to profile two preclinical mouse models of colorectal cancer: Apcfl/fl VilincreERT2 (AV) and Apcfl/fl LSL-KrasG12D Trp53fl/fl Rosa26LSL-tdTomato/+ VillinCreERT2 (AKPV). In the first part of the manuscript, the authors describe the analysis of the normal colon and dysplastic lesions induced in these models following tamoxifen injection. They highlight broad variations in immune and stromal cell composition within dysplastic lesions, emphasizing the infiltration of monocytes and granulocytes, the accumulation of IL-17+gdT cells, and the presence of a distinct group of endothelial cells. A major focus of the study is the remodeling of the epithelial compartment, where the most significant changes are observed. Using non-negative matrix factorization, the authors identify molecular programs of epithelial cell functions, emphasizing stemness, Wnt signaling, angiogenesis, and inflammation as major features associated with dysplastic cells. They conclude that findings from scRNA-seq analyses in mouse models are transposable to human CRC. In the second part of the manuscript, the authors aim to provide the spatial context for their scRNA-seq findings using Slide-seq and TACCO. They demonstrate that dysplastic lesions are disorganized and contain tumor-specific regions, which contextualize the spatial proximity between specific cell states and gene programs. Finally, they claim that these spatial organizations are conserved in human tumors and associate region-based gene signatures with patient outcomes in public datasets. Overall, the data were collected and analyzed using solid and validated methodology to offer a useful resource to the community.</p>
<p>Main comments:</p>

<p>The manuscript would benefit from a substantial reorganization to improve clarity and accessibility for a broad readership. The text could be shortened and the number of figure panels reduced to emphasize the novel contributions of this work while minimizing extensive discussions on general and expected findings, such as tissue disorganization in dysplastic lesions. Additionally, figure panels are not consistently introduced in the correct order, and some are not discussed at all (e.g., Figure S1D; Figure 3C is introduced before Figure 3A; several panels in Figure 4 are not discussed). The annotation of scRNA-seq cell states is insufficiently explained, with no corresponding information about associated genes provided in the figures or tables. Multiple annotations are used to describe cell groups (e.g., TKN01 = γδ T and CD8 T, TKN05 = γδT_IL17+), but these are not jointly accessible in the figures, making the manuscript challenging to follow. It is also not clear what is the respective value of the two mouse models and time points of tissue collection in the analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We clarified and simplified the revised manuscript, however we believe that the current discussions are an important part of the manuscript and would be useful to readers. We reordered panels in Figures S1 and 3 to align with their appearance in the manuscript. We kept the order of other panels as it is to keep both context and coherence of those figures intact. We changed the way we reference cell clusters in the manuscript to better align with the naming scheme introduced in Figure 1B. The respective value of the two mouse models as well as the time points of tissue collection are described in lines 108-120 of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Novelty</p>
<p>While the study is of interest, it does not present major findings that significantly advance the field or motivate new directions and hypotheses. Many conclusions related to tissue composition and patient outcomes, such as the epithelial programs of Wnt signaling, angiogenesis, and stem cells, are well-established and not particularly novel. Greater exploration of the scRNA-seq data beyond cell type composition could enhance the novelty of the findings. For instance, several tumor microenvironment clusters uniquely detected in dysplastic lesions (e.g., Mono2, Mono3, Gran01, Gran02) are identified, but no further investigation is conducted to understand their biological programs, such as applying nNMF as was done for epithelial cells. Additional efforts to explore precise tissue localization and cellular interactions within tissue niches would provide deeper insights and go beyond the limited analyses currently displayed in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Our study aimed to spatially characterize the tumor microenvironment, with scRNA-seq analysis serving to support this spatial characterization.</p>
<p>Due to technical limitations—such as the number of samples and the limited capture efficiency of Slide-seq—the resolution of immune cell identification in our spatial analysis is constrained. Additionally, while immune and stromal cells formed distinct clusters, epithelial cells exhibited a continuum that was better captured using nNMF.</p>
<p>Lastly, our manuscript provides a general characterization of monocyte and granulocyte populations in scRNA-seq (line 144) and their spatial microenvironments (line 400). We believe that additional analyses of these populations would be beyond the scope of this study and could place an unnecessary burden on the reader. Instead, we suggest that such analyses be explored in future studies.</p>
<p>We remark that we analyzed tissue localization for two entirely different spatial transcriptomics assays (Slide-seq and Cartana) at the resolution of cell types and programs, which was feasible within the constraints of the sparsity, gene panel and sample size in the experiments. A future potential path to further increase the resolution of investigation in this dataset is to include other datasets, e.g. by the emerging transformer-based spatial transcriptomics integration methods.</p>
<p>We also remark that the manuscript already includes an investigation of cellular interactions within tissue niches based on COMMOT (Fig 4k, Fig S8i, Supp Item 4).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Validation</p>
<p>Several statements made by the authors are insufficiently supported by the data presented in the manuscript and should be nuanced in the absence of proper validation. For example:</p>
<p>(a) RNA velocity analyses: The conclusions drawn from these analyses are speculative and need further support.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We clarified that our conclusions from the RNA velocity analysis need further support by experimental validation (lines 223-225), which is outside the scope of the current study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) Annotations of epithelial clusters as dysplastic: These annotations could have been validated through morphological analyses and staining on FFPE slides.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. While this could have been a possible approach, our study primarily relies on scRNA-seq, which does not preserve tissue morphology, and Slide-seq of fresh tissue, where such an analysis is particularly challenging.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(c) Conservation of mouse epithelial programs in human tumors: The data in Figure S5B does not convincingly demonstrate the enrichment of stem cell program 16 in human samples. This should be more explicitly stated in the text, given the emphasis placed on this program by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We clarified the section about the stem cell program 16 and references to Figures S5A and S5B (lines 269-274): while we do see correlation in the definition of human programs with the mouse stem cell program (Figure S5A), we do not see a correlated expression of the stem cell program across human and mouse (Figure S5B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(d) Figure S6E: Cluster Epi06 is significantly overrepresented in spatial data compared to scRNA-seq, yet the authors claim that cell type composition is largely recapitulated without further discussion, which reduces confidence in other conclusions drawn.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this remark. Indeed, Epi06 was a cluster which drew our attention during early analyses for its mixed expression profiles with contributions of vastly different cell types. We concluded that this is best explained by doublets, but we cannot rule out (partial) non-doublet explanations (e.g. undifferentiated cells). As doublet detection with Scrublet did not flag those cells as doublets, we kept these cells in the workflow, but excluded them from further interpretation. While in the previous version of the manuscript we only shortly hinted to this in figure legend 2A (&quot;Cluster Epi06: doublets (not called by Scrublet)&quot;), we expanded on this in the methods section of the revised manuscript (lines 863-869). Given the doublet interpretation, the observation that this cluster is significantly overrepresented in the annotation of the spatial data is not surprising as this annotation comes from the decomposition of compositional data which contains contributions of multiple cells per Slide-seq bead which are structurally very similar to doublets. While Epi06 appears enriched in S6E when comparing Slide-Seq to scRNA-seq, there are multiple technical  cross platform differences, including different per-gene sensitivities or capture biases for certain cell types (e.g. stromal cells suffering more from dissociation in scRNA compared to Slide-Seq). We believe that comparisons between disease states within a single platform are more biologically meaningful, like the comparison between normal and premalignant tissue, which is presented in Figure S6G. To increase confidence in the analysis and to assess whether intra-platform biological conclusions are affected by the inclusion/exclusion of Epi06, we recreated Figure S6G for a Slide-Seq cell type annotation without Epi06 in the reference (see Author response image 1). Even though Epi06 is missing in that annotation, the strong enrichments are consistently preserved between the two analysis variants, while as expected some less significant enrichments with larger FDR values are not preserved.</p>

<p>Furthermore, stronger validation of key dysplastic regions (regions 6, 8, and 11) in mouse and human tissues using antibody-based imaging with markers identified in the analyses would have considerably strengthened the study. Such validation would better contextualize the distribution, composition, and relative abundance of these regions within human tumors, increasing the significance of the findings and aiding the generation of new pathophysiological hypotheses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>We agree with the reviewer with their assessment that validation by antibody-based imaging (or other spatial proteomics data) would have been useful follow-up experiments, yet these are beyond the scope of the current study.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>AV and AKPV have different oncogenic mutations, and their impact on spatial neighbourhoods is unclear. Can authors perform an analysis to understand the contribution of oncogenic mutations on the spatial landscape of CRC?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The data reported in this study only contains spatial data for one mouse model (AV). As spatial data for the other model (AKPV) is missing, it is not possible to comparatively link the mutational type of the model with the spatial landscape.</p>
