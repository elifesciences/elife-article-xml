<abstract>
<p>Apoptosis has been recognized as a suicidal host-defense programmed cell death pathway against invading pathogens. However, recent evidences showed that viruses can employ caspases to cleave and inactivate immune signaling molecules to facilitate infection. Whether caspases can promote anti-viral immune responses is currently unknown. Here, we demonstrated that the NSs protein of RVFV triggers activation of apoptotic caspases, which cleave the mitochondrial fission factor DRP1 resulting in mitochondrial elongation. Elongated mitochondria promote MAVS aggregation leading to enhanced anti-viral immunity. Apoptotic caspases, including caspase-3, -6, -7 and -8, cleave DRP1 at the motifs of D<sup>500</sup>FAD<sup>503</sup> and/or AEAD<sup>556</sup>, suggesting that this cleavage event may occur during infection of different viruses. Indeed, infection of H1N1, SeV and HSV-1 all triggered apoptotic caspases activation to cleave DRP1 promoting anti-viral immune responses. Compared with wild-type DRP1, introduction of caspase-resistant DRP1 strongly attenuated immune responses triggered by virus infection. These results revealed a novel mechanism through which apoptotic caspases promote anti-viral immunity by regulating mitochondrial morphodynamics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an enveloped, single-stranded ambisense, tri-segmented RNA virus, belonging to the genus <italic>phlebovirus</italic> and the family <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> within the order <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Noronha and Wilson, 2017</xref>). As a mosquito-borne virus, RVFV is transmitted among humans through mosquito bites and can cause serious diseases including ocular (eye) disease, meningoencephalitis or haemorrhagic fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McMillen and Hartman, 2018</xref>). The case-fatality ratio for RVF patients developing the haemorrhagic fever can be up to approximately 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the absence of effective preventive or therapeutic strategies for human use and the potential of widespread transmission, RVFV has been listed as one of the viruses causing priority diseases categorized by the world health organization (WHO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gerken et al., 2022</xref>). RVFV has a three-segmented RNA genome of the L (large), M (medium) and S (small) segment, of which the S segment encodes the major virulence factor nonstructural protein (NSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Freire et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Leger et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the virulence factor NSs protein triggers apoptosis during infection and contributes to viral pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Austin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Narayanan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Smith et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that functions in regulating normal embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Elmore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Everett and McFadden, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Williams, 1994</xref>). Apoptosis is mediated through the activation of apoptotic caspases including caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9 and -10. Apoptosis can be triggered by either extrinsic or intrinsic pathways. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated by the engagement of cell surface death receptors, such as members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, by its ligands, leading to the activation of caspase-8 and its downstream effector caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Li and Yuan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Orzalli and Kagan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). The intrinsic apoptosis is regulated by the function of pro-apoptotic members of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family, which controls the Bax/Bak activation and induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). MOMP results in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, which binds to Apaf-1 to activate caspase-9 and the downstream effector caspases -3, -6 and -7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Li and Yuan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Many viruses, including both DNA and RNA viruses, cause infected cells to undergo apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Koyama et al., 1998</xref>). Apoptosis has long been regarded as a host defense mechanism eliminating the niche of virus amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Koyama et al., 1998</xref>). However, recent evidences showed that viruses can employ activated caspases to cleave and inactivate the innate immune molecules to dampen the host anti-viral immune responses and promote virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ning et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). For example, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Poliovirus trigger caspase-3 or caspase-7 activation to cleave and inactivate MAVS (also named as VISA, IPS-1, and Cardif) to facilitate virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ning et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Rebsamen et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, HIV-1 triggers caspase-3 activation to cleave IRF3 and promotes virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ning et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Park et al., 2014</xref>). IRF3 can also be cleaved and inactivated by caspase-8 during Sendai virus (SeV) infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sears et al., 2011</xref>). Up till now, whether virus infection-triggered apoptotic caspases can promote antiviral innate immunity has not been reported.</p>
<p>Both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis involve regulation of mitochondria, a critical intracellular organelle participating in energy production, metabolism, cell death and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ren et al., 2020</xref>). Recent studies revealed that mitochondria are central hubs of innate immune responses mediating both IFN-I and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Sandhir et al., 2017</xref>). Mitochondria undergo dynamic morphological changes regulated by mitochondrial fusion and fission factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Tilokani et al., 2018</xref>). Key regulators that mediate the switch between mitochondrial fusion and fission include OPA1, which is responsible for fusion of the inner membrane; MFN1 and MFN2, which are responsible for fusion of the outer membrane; and dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1/DNM1L/DLP), which is the critical factor that participates in mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wei et al., 2021</xref>). The morphodynamics of mitochondria is important for regulating immune responses with the elongated mitochondria mediates enhanced immune responses through serving as the platform for immune signalosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Mitochondrial elongation has been reported during virus infection which is induced by inactivation of DRP1 modulated by its phosphorylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Whether virus-triggered apoptosis can regulate mitochondrial morphodynamics is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we found that RVFV virulence factor NSs activates apoptotic caspases which then cleave and deplete mitochondrial fission factor DRP1. DRP1 depletion leads to elongated mitochondria and promotes anti-viral immune responses through facilitating MAVS aggregation. We further demonstrated that multiple apoptotic caspases can cleave and deplete DRP1 at different positions. This caspase mediated DRP1 cleavage event is observed during both DNA and RNA virus infection and appears as a general caspase-dependent host anti-viral mechanism. These results revealed a new host defense mechanism mediated by apoptotic caspase activity.</p>

<title>RVFV infection leads to mitochondrial elongation through down-regulating DRP1</title>
<p>RVFV infection leads to distinctly elongated mitochondria in the infected PMA-induced THP-1 macrophage cells (THP-1<sup>PMA</sup>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The RVFV-induced mitochondrial elongation was also observed in various cell types including Huh7 cells and A549 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Examination of ultrathin sections of RVFV infected THP-1<sup>PMA</sup> cells by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that mitochondria were more elongated in RVFV-infected cells than those in uninfected cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). To identify which viral protein induced mitochondrial elongation, RVFV viral proteins, including NSs, NP, NSm, Gn, Gc and polymerase (Pol), were transiently expressed in Huh7 cells and the mitochondrial morphology was observed. It is found that only NSs expression, but not other viral proteins, induced distinct mitochondrial elongation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The expression of RVFV-NSs in A549 cells also induced mitochondrial elongation (Figure S1A). To analyze whether NSs mediates mitochondrial elongation during RVFV infection, we generated NSs-deleted RVFV encoding EGFP in the position of NSs (RVFV<sup>EGFP △ NSs</sup>) and evaluated mitochondrial morphology in infected cells. Unlike infection with wild type (WT) virus, infection with RVFV<sup>EGFP△NSs</sup> did not lead to elongated mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggested that the viral protein NSs induced mitochondrial elongation during RVFV infection.</p>

</fig>
<p>To explore the mechanisms underlying RVFV-NSs induced mitochondrial elongation, we first examined the abundance of host proteins that regulate mitochondrial morphology, including MFN1, MFN2, OPA1, which mediate mitochondrial fusion, and DRP1, which mediates mitochondrial fission. It is found that among these proteins the fission factor DRP1 was significantly down-regulated in RVFV infected cells, while the abundance of other proteins was unaffected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, DRP1 down-regulation in RVFV infected cells showed a MOI-dependent phenotype (Figure S1B). DRP1 down-regulation was also observed in RVFV infected human Huh7 cells (Figure S1C) and A549 cells (Figure S1D), mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) (Figure S1E) or liver samples harvested from RVFV-infected mice (Figure S1F). Since DRP1 functions in mitochondrial fission, it’s down-regulation might account for mitochondrial elongation triggered by RVFV infection. In line with this notion, infection with RVFV<sup>EGFP△NSs</sup>, which does not result in mitochondrial elongation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), did not lead to down-regulation of DRP1 in Huh7 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, exogenous expression of NSs leads to down-regulation of DRP1 protein level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that RVFV infection induced NSs-dependent DRP1 down-regulation resulting in mitochondrial elongation.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>DRP1 is cleaved by activated caspase during RVFV infection</title>
<p>We next investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying RVFV NSs-induced DRP1 down-regulation. The transcriptional level of DRP1 was not down-regulated during RVFV infection (Figure S2A), indicating down-regulation at the post-transcriptional level. We then used the inhibitors MG132 (proteasome inhibitor), Chloroquine (CQ) (autophagy-lysosome inhibitor) and Z-VAD-FMK (pan caspase inhibitor) to characterize the pathway that mediates DRP1 down-regulation. Neither MG132 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) nor CQ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) treatment inhibited DRP1 down-regulation in RVFV infected cells. In contrast, the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK treatment prevented DRP1 down-regulation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). These results suggested that RVFV infection triggered the caspase-mediated down-regulation of DRP1.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we found that RVFV infection induced DRP1 cleavage to generate a cleaved DRP1 (∼60 kDa) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E</xref>). Similar to RVFV infection, apoptotic inducer staurosporine (STS) can also induce DRP1 cleavage (Figures S2B). Cleavage of DRP1 showed a time- and MOI-dependent manner during RVFV infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E</xref> and S2C). Exogenously expressed DRP1, either through transient transfection (Figure S2D) or lentiviral transduction (Figure S2E), was also cleaved upon RVFV infection. And Z-VAD-FMK inhibited the formation of cleaved form of DRP1 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), further supporting that DRP1 might be cleaved by RVFV activated caspases. Indeed, RVFV infection induced the activation of multiple apoptotic caspases, including caspase-3, -6, -7, -8 and -9 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). In contrast, infection with RVFV<sup>EGFP△NSs</sup> did not trigger the activation of these caspases (Figure S2F). NSs expression alone triggered apoptotic caspases activation and PARP-1 cleavage (Figure S2G). These results together suggested that RVFV infection triggered NSs-dependent caspases activation that cleaved DRP1 in infected cells.</p>

<title>Apoptotic caspase-3, -6, -7 and -8 cleave DRP1 at the AEAD<sup>556</sup> and D<sup>500</sup>FAD<sup>503</sup> motifs</title>
<p>To analyze whether activated caspases cleave DRP1, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> caspase cleavage assay with purified caspases. Purified DRP1 was incubated with active human recombinant caspase-1, -4, -3, -6, -7, -8 or -9 protein (C1, C4, C3, C6, C7, C8 or C9). Immunoblotting analysis showed that among these caspases, apoptotic caspase-3, -6, -7 and -8, but not caspase-1, -4 or -9, cleaved DRP1 into a C terminal 20 kDa fragment recognized by the anti-strep antibody (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Pulldown assay showed that DRP1 interacted with caspase-3, -6, -7 and -8 protein, but not with EGFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The potential caspase cleavage sites on DRP1 were predicted with the CaspDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>).

<p>In the <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage assay, caspases cleaved the C-terminal strep tagged DRP1 into two bands that can be recognized by the anti-strep antibody (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). One of the cleaved bands was approximately 20 kDa, which corresponds to the potential cleavage site of D556. We therefore substituted the D556 of DRP1 with glutamate (E) to construct the mutant, DRP1-D556E, and transiently expressed the DRP1-D556E and DRP1-WT in Huh7 cells. Upon RVFV infection, DRP1-WT was cleaved, but no cleaved band was observed in DRP1-D556E expressing cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that D556 may be a key caspase cleavage site of DRP1. The <italic>in vitro</italic> caspase cleavage assay further showed that the DRP1-D556E mutant is resistant to caspase cleavage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that caspase-3, -6, -7 and -8 can recognize and cleave DRP1 at the AEAD<sup>556</sup> motif. Another cleavage band in the caspase-3 treated group was approximately 27 kDa, and there was a canonical caspase recognition motif (D<sup>500</sup>FAD<sup>503</sup>) in this region. We mutated D500 and D503 to glutamate (E) respectively or in combination on the basis of the D556E mutation. The <italic>in vitro</italic> caspase cleavage assay showed that the mutation of either D500 or D503 prevented caspase cleavage and the formation of the 27 kDa fragment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that caspase-3 can also recognize and cleave DRP1 at the D<sup>500</sup>FAD<sup>503</sup> motif and both D residues are important for this cleavage. Thus, apoptotic caspase-3, -6, -7 and -8 cleave DRP1 at the AEAD<sup>556</sup> motif and caspase-3 has an additional cleavage site at the D<sup>500</sup>FAD<sup>503</sup> motif (Figure S3).</p>

<title>Caspases-mediated DRP1 cleavage promotes anti-viral innate immunity</title>
<p>Mitochondria is a critical platform for regulating innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arnoult et al., 2011</xref>), so we reasoned that RVFV infection triggered DRP1 down-regulation and mitochondrial elongation may regulate anti-viral immune responses. To analyze this possibility, we first depleted DRP1 in THP-1 cells through knockdown (KD) by shRNA or knockout (KO) by sgRNA with CRISPR-Cas9. The RVFV-induced transcription of IFNβ and its downstream interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including RSAD2, CXCL10, ISG15, ISG54 and ISG56, were significantly enhanced in DRP1 knockout macrophages compared with the control cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Immunoblot analysis showed that DRP1 depletion though knockdown (Figure S4A) or knockout (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) enhanced the phosphorylation of TBK1 and up-regulated the expression of ISGs after RVFV infection indicating elevated innate immune responses. In line with this, intracellular RVFV-NP protein expression (Figures S4A and 5B), or RVFV-NSs protein expression (Figure S4C) and infectious RVFV production (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref> and S4B) were all significantly reduced in DRP1-depleted macrophages relative to the control cells. Treatment with DRP1 inhibitor mdivi-1, which inhibits DRP1 fission functionality, also inhibited RVFV replication in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S4D). Restriction of RVFV replication was also observed in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells with DRP1 depletion by CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout (Figure S4E). These results indicated that DRP1 deficiency potentiated innate antiviral responses.</p>

<p>To verify whether DRP1 cleavage by apoptotic caspases play a role in regulating immune responses, human DRP1-WT or caspase-resistant DRP1-3DE (a mutant of which the three D residues in the caspase cleavage motifs D<sup>500</sup>FAD<sup>503</sup> and AEAD<sup>556</sup> were substituted into E) was over-expressed in THP-1 cells. We found that cells expressing DRP1-3DE, which is resistant to caspase cleavage, showed further attenuated transcription of ISGs RSAD2, ISG15 and ISG54 mRNA compared with the DRP1-WT over-expressing cells, in response to RVFV infection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Compared with DRP1-WT, DRP1-3DE also more strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of TBK1 and the up-regulation of ISGs after RVFV infection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>).

These data revealed that the caspase-resistant DRP1-3DE mutant showed more potent inhibition of antiviral immune responses compared with the DRP1-WT control, suggesting that caspases-mediated DRP1 cleavage plays a role in up-regulating anti-viral innate immune responses.</p>

<title>Caspases-mediated DRP1 cleavage leads to mitochondrial elongation and promotes MAVS aggregation</title>
<p>The above evidences suggest that the DRP1-depletion altered mitochondrial morphodynamics is linked with regulation of antiviral innate immunity. Activation and aggregation of the mitochondria-associated MAVS is a key event to mediate the activation of TBK1/IKKε and the down-stream immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore analyzed whether mitochondrial elongation caused by caspases-mediated DRP1 depletion can facilitate MAVS aggregation to promote the antiviral innate immunity. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that DRP1 depletion in macrophages caused significant MAVS aggregation on fused mitochondria (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Concomitantly, DRP1 deficiency in THP-1<sup>PMA</sup> cells either through CRISPR-Cas9 knockout showed significantly increased transcription of representative ISGs including RSAD2, ISG54 and CXCL10 mRNA compared with the scramble cells (Figure S5A). Similarly, DRP1 deficiency in MEF cells through knockout also elevated transcription of representative ISGs RSAD2, ISG56 and CXCL10 mRNA compared with the scramble cells (Figure S5B). RVFV infection of THP-1<sup>PMA</sup> led to caspase activation, DRP1 depletion and aggregation of MAVS (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). DRP1 depletion further increased aggregation of MAVS upon SeV (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>) or RVFV infection (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). Simultaneous knock-out (dKO) of DRP1 and MAVS strongly attenuated the elevated antiviral immune responses observed in RVFV infected DRP1 KO cells and promoted viral replication (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8E</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8F</xref>). These data suggest that DRP1 depletion promotes antiviral innate immunity, at least in part, through inducing MAVS aggregation and activation. Altogether, these data indicated that virus infection can trigger caspases-mediated DRP1 depletion leading to mitochondrial elongation, which enhanced MAVS aggregation to elevate the antiviral immune responses.</p>

<title>Caspases-mediated DRP1 depletion and elevation of immune responses is conserved among different viruses infection</title>
<p>Next, we analyzed whether caspase-dependent DRP1 depletion and promotion of innate immune responses is a general mechanism during virus infection. For this purpose, H1N1 and SeV were selected as additional RNA model viruses, and HSV-1 was selected as a DNA model virus. THP-1<sup>PMA</sup> cells were infected with H1N1, SeV or HSV-1 and the activation of multiple apoptotic caspases, including caspase-3, -6, -7, -8 and -9 were observed (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figures 9A</xref>-<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Virus triggered apoptotic caspase activation has recently been shown to dampen antiviral innate immunity via the cleavage of multiple key immune molecules, such as cGAS, MAVS, and IRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ning et al., 2019</xref>). Whether apoptotic caspases can promote innate immune responses to inhibit viral infection is currently unknown. Here, we demonstrated that virus-activated apoptotic caspases, including caspase-3, -6, -7 and -8, cleave and deplete the mitochondrial fission factor DRP1 leading to mitochondrial elongation, which in turn results in increased MAVS aggregation and enhanced antiviral innate immune signaling. This mitochondrial elongation driven elevation of innate immune responses can occur during multiple viruses infection and poses a broad antiviral effect against both RNA and DNA viruses. Thus, while the virus can employ host caspase activity to facilitate it’s infection, the activated caspases can also promote immune responses to inhibit viral replication serving as a host defense mechanism. It has been recognized that apoptotic caspases-mediated suicidal cell death limits virus replication through eliminating the niche of viral production. Thus, it can be speculated that apoptotic caspases can pose two-modes of anti-viral effects through cleaving DRP1 and mediating mitochondrial elongation to elevate the immune responses and, in the meantime, depleting the virus infected cells.</p>
<p>The dynamic balance between fission and fusion plays a critical role in maintaining the functionality of mitochondria. DRP1 is the major regulator of mitochondrial fission, and its activity is regulated by multiple post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and S-nitrosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Khan et al., 2015</xref>). Previous reports showed that viruses can dampen the activity of DRP1 by modulating its phosphorylation state. For example, SeV infection-induced TBK1-mediated DRP1 phosphorylation and abrogates its mitochondrial fission function, leading to mitochondrial elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, DENV NS4B inhibits phospho-S616-dependent activation of DRP1 and its subsequent translocation to mitochondria, thus inducing mitochondrial elongation in virus-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chatel-Chaix et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we discovered that cleavage by multiple caspases is a novel mechanism to dampen DRP1 functionality and enhance innate immune responses. This new layer of regulation adds to the complex regulation mechanisms of DRP1 and further indicates its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial morphodynamics and immune responses.</p>
<p>It is found that multiple caspases, including caspase-3, -6, -7 and -8, are capable of cleaving DRP1. Among them, caspase-8 is the initiator apoptotic caspase, while caspase-3, -6 and -7 belong to the executive apoptotic caspases. In addition, multiple sites in DRP1 are sensitive to caspase cleavage, including the D<sup>500</sup>FAD<sup>503</sup> and AEAD<sup>556</sup> motifs. The susceptibility of DRP1 to cleavage by different types of caspases and the presence of multiple caspase-sensitive sites in DRP1 ensure the efficient cleavage of DRP1 under different contexts. Indeed, multiple viruses and other pathogens trigger apoptotic caspases activation during infection through diverse mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fang and Peng, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Li et al., 2020b</xref>). The results that, besides RVFV, H1N1, SeV and HSV-1 infection triggered caspase-dependent cleavage of DRP1 further support the notion. It can be speculated that DRP1 potentially serves as a common sensor of pathogen invasion through sensing pathogen activated caspases and promotes innate immunity. This might be a general host defense mechanism occurring under different pathogen invasion contexts.</p>
<p>In summary, these results revealed a novel apoptotic caspase-DRP1 axis in promoting anti-viral immune responses through regulating mitochondrial morphodynamics. This indicates that apoptotic caspases activation can have both pro- or anti-viral effects depending on the cleaved substrates. During the course of virus infection, it is likely that the balance between pro- or anti-viral effects is controlled by multiple viral and host factors. The overall effect of how caspase activation regulates viral infection and pathogenesis may be context-dependent and awaits further characterization for different viruses. Nevertheless, the critical roles of caspases in regulating cell death and immune responses may provide novel targets for developing anti-viral therapeutics.</p>

<p>This manuscript describes an unexpected role of cellular caspases in cleaving Drp1, a protein involved in mitochondrial fission, in virus-infected cells. Drp1 cleavage augments mitochondrial fission, reinforcing MAVS-dependent type-1 IFN response against multiple viruses. The findings presented in this manuscript are <bold>important</bold> and the strength of evidence is <bold>solid</bold>. Additional studies may allow for more robust mechanistic substantiation of the proposed model.</p>

<p>Drp1 supports mitochondrial fission (doi: 10.1038/s41586-019-1296-y). Viral sensing triggers mitochondrial fusion, leading to MAVS aggregation and improved type-1 IFN response. It was suggested that impairment of Drp1 upon phosphorylation by Tbk1 enhances mitochondrial fusion in virus-infected cells (doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.10.018). In this manuscript, Fang et al. describe an unexpected role of caspases activated upon Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection in inactivating Drp1. They show that Drp1 is targeted by multiple caspases, including caspase-3, -6, -7 and -8. Indeed, cleavage of Drp1 leads to mitochondrial elongation, boosting the type-1 IFN response of infected cells. Finally, the authors establish the generalisability of the proposed mechanism in the context of cellular infections with H1N1, SeV, and HSV-1. Caspase-dependent and independent cell death processes provide important host defence mechanisms against obligatorily intracellular viral pathogens. This work suggests that caspases reinforce antiviral response involving also the mitochondria-type 1 IFN axis. As such, the manuscript is well written, and the proposal pertaining to caspase-mediated targeting of Drp1 may have implications beyond host-virus interaction studies. However, several loose ends remain, and these concerns need to be addressed to substantiate the mechanistic model.</p>

<p>In the present study, authors report the role of virus-induced apoptosis in positively regulating the innate immune response. Upon infection, host cell apoptosis is triggered as a defence mechanism against virus replication. Culmination of infected-cell death impairs replicative potential for viruses, hence attenuating virus propagation. Reports exist denoting the inhibitory effect of apoptosis upon innate immune signalling. Contrary to that, the findings of this manuscript underscore the possible role of apoptosis in enhancing innate immune signalling and effector response. Infection-induced activation of caspases (3, 6, 7, and 8) has been demonstrated to cleave DRP1 protein. DRP1, a positive regulator for mitochondrial fission, degradation leads to altered mitochondrial morphology (elongation).</p>
<p>Mitochondria, being a hub for innate immune signalling (via operation of RLR-MAVS-downstream effector molecule-axis), upon elongation as a result of DRP1 depletion, results in greater innate immune signal flux and interferon induction. Increased interferon induction thus acts to inhibit virus propagation, as demonstrated by the authors using cell-culture models.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The findings presented by the authors have been validated by employing elaborate biochemical experimental approaches. The study entails extensive biochemical characterization of DRP1 residues targeted by activated caspases, in vitro assays validating caspase-mediated DRP1 cleavage &amp; caspase-DRP1 interaction.</p>
<p>(2) This study possesses broad implications since the authors demonstrate the role of caspase-mediated DRP1 cleavage in promoting innate immunity in the context of infection by diverse viruses (both RNA and DNA viruses).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the authors undertook a thorough experimental approach attempting to validate their findings, all the experiments were performed using either cell-culture models for infection or in vitro biochemical assays (cleavage and protein-protein interaction). Additional experimentation using animal models (in vivo) will further help strengthen the biological significance of their findings under more physiological settings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrated that the NSs protein of RVFV triggers the activation of apoptotic caspases, which cleave the mitochondrial fission factor DRP1 resulting in mitochondrial elongation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript provides an insightful investigation into a novel mechanism through which apoptotic caspases promote anti-viral immunity by regulating mitochondrial morphodynamics.</p>
