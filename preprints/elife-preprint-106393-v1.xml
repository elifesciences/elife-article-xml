<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The tympanic membrane (TM), or eardrum, is a thin, sensitive tissue critical for hearing by vibrating and transmitting sound waves to the inner ear. TM perforation and development of otitis media and conductive hearing loss are commonly seen in the clinic. In this study, we demonstrate the role of TRPV1 signaling mediated macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis in TM repair. By creating a wounded TM mouse model with a perforation in the anteroinferior region of the pars tensa — a region in humans often damaged in traumatic injury, we observed a massive accumulation of macrophages in the vicinity of the acutely wounded TM. Using 5-Ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine pause labeling and a chimeric bone marrow transplant model, we found that most of the recruited macrophages did not originate from local tissue-resident macrophages but rather from blood-circulating monocytes. Parallel to macrophage recruitment, angiogenesis was observed near the wound on day 3 after perforation and further progressed by day 7. The angiogenic process was strongly associated with the recruited macrophages, as macrophage depletion resulted in a notable reduction in angiogenesis. At the transcriptional level, we found that macrophages facilitate angiogenesis through several signaling pathways. Additionally, we identified direct intercellular communication between macrophages and endothelial cells mediated by phosphoprotein 1 signaling. Furthermore, Gene Ontology analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from TMs revealed that the macrophage recruitment is associated with neuroinflammatory responses. Using a fluorescence reporter mouse driven by TRPV1, we discovered that the TM contains rich sensory nerve fibers expressing TRPV1. A genetic mutation in the <italic>Trpv1</italic> gene resulted in a marked decrease in the expression of neuroinflammatory genes, such as <italic>Tac1</italic>. This decrease subsequently resulted in reduced macrophage recruitment, impaired angiogenesis, and delayed wound healing. Together, these findings highlight the crucial role of TRPV1 signaling in monocyte migration and macrophage-related angiogenesis, both of which are crucial for facilitating healing of the TM. These results also open new opportunities for clinical interventions. Targeting TRPV1 signaling could enhance TM immunity, improve blood circulation, promote the repair of damaged TM, and ultimately prevent middle ear infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The normal structure and function of the tympanic membrane (TM) are essential for sound transduction and hearing. Sound waves are transmitted through the external auditory meatus, causing the TM to vibrate. These vibrations are then transmitted to the auditory ossicles, the small bones in the middle ear, which amplify the sound vibrations before passing them on to the inner ear. Sensory hair cells in the inner ear convert these mechanical signals into electrical signals that the brain interprets as sound. Additionally, the TM serves as a protective barrier, shielding the middle ear from invading pathogens. Anatomically, the TM consists of two regions: the pars tensa and the pars flaccida. The pars tensa is the largest portion of the TM and vibrates in response to sound. The pars flaccida, located in the superior portion of the malleus, helps maintain the proper function of the pars tensa by stabilizing pressure in the middle ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stenfors et al. 1979</xref>). The pars tensa is a thin and delicate structure that is often vulnerable to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Paik et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pusz and Robitschek 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Van Hoecke et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Littlefield and Brungart 2020</xref>). Traumatic perforations, which can occur due to assault or sound blasts, are commonly observed in young adults. Although most TM perforations heal spontaneously, approximately 20% do not, which can lead to complications such as middle ear infections and conductive hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Santa Maria et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sagiv et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dolhi and Weimer 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lou 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lou et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike typical cutaneous wounds, the TM is unique as a healing tissue because it is suspended in air. During the healing process, reparative cells must bridge a gap without a ready-made surface over which they can migrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Santa Maria et al. 2010</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the squamous epithelium, the outer layer of the TM, is responsible for closing the perforation by forming an epithelial bridge over the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Araujo et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Santa Maria et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rosowski et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kitazawa et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bergevin and Olson 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aarnisalo et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kurabi et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Henson and Henson 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dong et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Frumm et al. 2020</xref>). More recent research indicates that the localization of progenitor or stem cells in the epidermal layer plays a significant role in TM repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mozaffari et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Frumm et al. 2020</xref>). A study by Scaria et al. demonstrated that after injury, a multi-lineage blastema-like cellular mass is recruited, which forms a wound epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Scaria et al. 2023</xref>). This finding highlights that TM repair is a type of epimorphic regeneration. However, a comprehensive understanding of the complex network of cellular processes and molecular interactions involved in TM wound healing, as well as the mechanisms leading to failed healing, remains limited. In this study, we report that monocyte recruitment mediated by TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1) signaling expressed in peripheral nerve fibers of TM, along with macrophage-associated angiogenesis, are crucial during the acute phase of TM wound healing.</p>
<p>Wound healing is a highly orchestrated and complex regulatory process that involves inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wilkinson and Hardman 2020</xref>). Recent studies have highlighted the vital role of macrophages in wound healing, including their functions in dampening inflammation, clearing cellular debris, and coordinating tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Krzyszczyk et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim and Nair 2019</xref>). Dysfunctional macrophage responses can lead to delayed wound healing and tissue fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lech and Anders 2013</xref>). In our study, we found that the macrophages recruited to the injured area following TM injury are derived from monocytes, rather than being locally proliferated or migrated from resident tissue macrophages. Alongside the recruitment of monocytes, we also observed the growth of new blood vessels, which is a crucial element in TM repair. The presence of macrophages in the wound area is strongly linked to angiogenic activity, as depleting macrophages significantly impairs angiogenesis. Through the analysis of recent single-cell RNA sequencing datasets (GEO; accession number GSE196692) obtained from mouse TMs at various time points following perforation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Scaria et al. 2023</xref>), we found that macrophages promote angiogenesis during the early stages of wound healing via different signaling pathways. Notably, we discovered that communication between macrophages and endothelial cells is mediated by secreted phosphoprotein 1 (<italic>Spp1</italic>).</p>
<p>The TM is densely innervated with sensory nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Uddman et al. 1988</xref>). Clinically, perforation of the TM can cause a sudden onset of pain in patients due to the injury and stretching of nerves. Using a transgenic TRPV1 fluorescence reporter mouse line, we unexpectedly found that the TM contains a high density of TRPV1-expressing sensory nerve fibers. TRPV1 is a non-selective cation channel and polymodal receptor activated by agents such as capsaicin, endogenous lipids, heat, and mildly acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ho et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Marrone et al. 2017</xref>). It is known for its rapid response to noxious stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ho et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Silverman et al. 2020</xref>). Studies have illustrated that the activation of TRPV1 can quickly initiate a cascade of events, including vascular inflammation, immune responses, and proliferation of precursor cells. Research in other organ systems has specifically shown that damage-induced TRPV1 activation triggers a rapid release of neuropeptides, facilitating macrophage recruitment, vascular cell proliferation, and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Feng et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Foster et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wang et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bujak et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schäffer et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Ziche et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Yano et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nguyen et al. 1995</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the role of TRPV1 signaling in macrophage mobilization and macrophage-related angiogenesis, which contributes to the healing of TMs, as <italic>Trpv1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited delayed and impaired wound healing with reduced monocyte recruitment. Our findings suggest that targeting TRPV1 signaling and the associated recruitment of monocytes may be an effective strategy for restoring damaged TMs by enhancing blood circulation — an essential factor often lacking in failed TM restoration efforts.</p>

All transgenic mice were inbred in our laboratory, validated, and genotyped for the study. Both male and female mice were used. All animal experiments were approved by the Oregon Health &amp; Science University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC IP00000968).</p>
<p>To generate CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup>; ROSA26<sup>ZsGreen</sup> mice, CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup> mice were crossed with ROSA26<sup>ZsGreen</sup> mice. These mice were used to evaluate changes in the macrophage population following the perforation of the TM. CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup>; ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup> mice were created by breeding CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup> mice with ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup> mice to assess the source of macrophage recruitment after TM perforation. Additionally, CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup>; iDTR mice were developed by crossing CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup> mice with iDTR mice to facilitate macrophage depletion. To activate Cre-mediated recombination, tamoxifen (TAM) was administered via intraperitoneal (IP) injection at a dose of 75 mg/kg body weight every 24 hours for three consecutive days. For macrophage depletion, diphtheria toxin (DT) was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 10 ng/kg body weight once every 24 hours for four consecutive days, starting one day after the administration of TM prior to TM perforation. iDTR mice served as control animals.</p>

<title>TM perforation</title>
<p>Animals were anesthetized using an intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine (20 mg/mL) and xylazine (2 mg/mL) mixture in saline, at a dosage of 0.1 mL per 20 g of body weight. After achieving anesthesia, a sterile 26-gauge needle was employed to create a perforation in the pars tensa of the TM. After the animals awakened and fully recovered, they were returned to the animal facility. The procedure has been approved by the IACUC protocol under TR01_IP00000968.</p>

<title>5-Ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling of TM</title>
<p>EdU (5 mg/mL in PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. # 900584) was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 25mg/kg body weight starting one day prior to TM perforation and then once every two days until the animals were sacrificed (27). TMs were isolated and fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C overnight. The following day, proliferating cells in the TMs were assayed using a Click-iT® Plus EdU Alexa Fluor® 555 imaging kit (Life Technologies, Cat. # C10638) used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, TMs were washed once in PBS, permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 for 2 hours, and immunoblocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 30 minutes. Samples were then incubated in the EdU cocktail for 30 minutes, washed once in 3% BSA in PBS, mounted using mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Cat. # H-1200) and visualized under an Olympus FV1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV1000, Japan).</p>

<title>Bone marrow transplantation</title>
<p>CX3CR1<italic><sup>CreER</sup></italic>; ROSA26<italic><sup>tdTomato</sup></italic>, C57/BL, and <italic>TRPV1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (6 weeks old, both sexes) were irradiated with a γ-emitting source at a dose of 9 Gy. Immediately following irradiation, the mice were reconstituted via a single periorbital sinus injection of 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> fluorescent bone marrow derived cells (BMDCs) from donor CSF1R<italic><sup>EGFP</sup></italic> mice (4 weeks old) in 200 μl of modified Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). To prevent potential radiation effects on tissue-resident macrophages in the TM, the animals were protected with a specially designed head shield during irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mildner et al. 2007</xref>). After transplantation, the mice were provided with antibiotics in their drinking water (1.1g/L neomycin sulfateand 167mg/L polymyxin B sulfate) and monitored daily for four weeks. At four weeks post-transplantation, the recipient mice were used for further studies.</p>

<title>Bulk RNA-seq analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from the TM of wild-type (WT) mice, including both control and post-perforated groups, on days 1, 3, and 7. Three replicates were collected per group, with three TMs per sample, using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat. # 73404) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and quality of the isolated RNA samples were assessed using an Agilent TapeStation system. Only samples with RNA integrity numbers (RIN) greater than 8.5 were selected for library preparation and sequencing with polyA selection (40M/PE150). Data analysis was conducted using the ROSALIND® pipeline. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the different groups (post-injury days 1, 3, and 7 compared to control) were evaluated. This evaluation included calculating fold changes, p-values, and optional covariate correction with DESeq2. Additionally, hypergeometric distribution analysis was performed to analyze gene ontology (GO) enrichment. The topGO R library was utilized to determine local similarities and dependencies between GO terms using an Elim pruning correction. Enrichment was calculated relative to a set of background genes relevant to the experiment.</p>

<title>scRNA-seq analysis</title>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing data on murine TMs across several wound healing stages were obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession number GSE196692) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Scaria et al. 2023</xref>). The sequences were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10), and standard processing was conducted using Seurat v5 in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Team 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Satija et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hao et al. 2024</xref>). Cells expressing fewer than 200 genes and genes expressed in fewer than three cells were excluded from the analysis. Data were log-normalized, and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the first 16 components for graph-based clustering, followed by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction. Supervised classification was conducted using specific marker genes of macrophages and endothelial cells. Gene expression trends over time were visualized for selected genes. Additionally, the top 500 genes from each stage were analyzed using the PANTHER Classification System for PANTHER pathway and GO biological process enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mi et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Thomas et al. 2003</xref>), revealing biological processes such as angiogenesis and wound healing. Macrophage-to-endothelial cell communication was analyzed using the CellChat package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jin et al. 2021</xref>), identifying key signaling pathways. All visualizations were constructed to highlight differences in biological processes, gene expression patterns, and cell-cell communication across the wound healing timeline.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence in frozen sections of the TM and trigeminal ganglion</title>
<p>The auditory bulla and capsule, which enclose the TM, middle ear, and trigeminal ganglion, were isolated and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the TMs were carefully dissected and incubated the following day in a permeabilization solution containing 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature (RT). Afterward, the tissues were blocked in a solution composed of 0.25% Triton X-100, 10% goat serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS (blocking/permeabilization solution) for 1 hour at RT. The samples were then transferred to a primary antibody solution containing an anti-F4/80 monoclonal antibody (BM8) from eBioscience (Invitrogen Cat# 14-4801-85), diluted in the blocking/permeabilization solution, and incubated overnight at 4°C. The next day, after washing three times with the blocking/permeabilization solution, the samples were incubated for 1 hour at RT with a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody in the same blocking/permeabilization solution. Finally, the samples were washed three times with PBS, mounted on slides, and visualized under an Olympus laser-scanning confocal microscope (model number: FV1000, Japan).</p>
<p>The trigeminal ganglion was dehydrated sequentially in 15% and 30% sucrose solutions, frozen, and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound. Tissues were sectioned at a thickness of 10 μm for subsequent immunofluorescence staining. Specimens were incubated in blocking/permeabilization for 1 hour at RT, followed by incubation in primary antibody solution (diluted in blocking/permeabilization solution) overnight at 4°C. After three washes with PBS the next day, samples were incubated with the fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody in the blocking/permeabilization solution for 1 hour at RT. Following three additional washes with PBS, samples were mounted using Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI and visualized under an Olympus FV1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV1000, Japan).</p>

<title>Macrophage quantification</title>
<p>The TM was imaged using an Olympus FV1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV1000, Japan) equipped with a 10x objective lens. Composite images were created by stitching together four tiles to capture the entire TM. To ensure consistent comparability across all confocal scans, laser intensity, step size, and resolution were maintained throughout the imaging process. Macrophage numbers in the wound area were quantified using the 3D object counter in Fiji software (ImageJ, NIH, version 1.51t). A thresholding technique was applied to distinguish object voxels from background voxels. Additionally, a size filter was set between 300 to 1500 μm³ to exclude objects outside this defined range from the analysis. The density of tissue-resident macrophages (cells per mm²) was calculated by dividing the total number of macrophages by the area of the TM analyzed. Mean values were determined for each sample and subsequently analyzed and compared across different groups.</p>

<title>Macrophages ‘gathering’ in the vicinity of the injured TM wound region are primarily recruited from blood-circulating monocytes and not locally proliferated or migrated</title>
<p>In this study, a perforation was created in the antero-inferior quadrant of the pars tensa of the TM in an adult CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup>; ROSA26<sup>ZsGreen</sup> mouse model. The antero-inferior quadrant was chosen because it is the most common site for traumatic TM perforations seen in clinic. In this model, CreER-mediated recombination was activated by tamoxifen injections, enabling visualization of Cx3cr1+ cells through green GFP fluorescence. Following the TM perforation, we observed that macrophages began to migrate toward the perforation site by day 3. By day 7, the injured membrane was largely covered by an accumulation of macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). This raises the question: What is the source of these macrophages? We propose three possible sources that could explain the increased population of macrophages: recruited macrophages from non-wounded areas, migrating monocytes from the bloodstream, or proliferating local tissue-resident macrophages. To determine the source, we first administered EdU, a nucleoside analog, to the animals one day before perforation and then once every two days after the perforation until the point of sacrifice. We observed very little overlap between the ZsGreen+ and EdU+ signals, as shown in the higher magnification images (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, lower panel). This finding indicated that the accumulated macrophages were recruited from distant sources rather than locally proliferated. Next, we developed a chimeric bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and fluorescence reporter mouse model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In this model, CSF1R<sup>EGFP</sup> donor bone marrow cells were transplanted into CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup>; ROSA<sup>26tdTomato</sup> recipient mice. This allowed us to distinguish local tissue-resident macrophages (tdTomato+) from blood-circulating monocytes (EGFP+). One month after transplantation, when the mice were effectively reconstituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Park et al. 2021</xref>), we perforated the TMs of the recipient mice. After perforation, we observed a significant presence of EGFP+ cells recruited to the wound area, while few tdTomato+ cells were found (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This experiment further confirmed that the macrophages accumulating around the wound primarily originated from blood-circulating monocytes, rather than from locally proliferated or migrated tissue-resident macrophages.</p>

<title>Angiogenesis takes place during wound healing</title>
<p>Angiogenesis is crucial for wound healing, and numerous studies have highlighted the link between impaired angiogenesis and delayed wound recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Schugart et al. 2008</xref>). In our study, we observed early vascular inflammation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary Materials) and subsequent angiogenesis occurring alongside the recruitment of monocytes near the wound site. Angiogenesis began on day 3 after perforation and continued to progress by day 7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>). We noted a significant increase in vascular density around the wound area (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The newly formed immature vessels were large in diameter and showed increased permeability, as evidenced by the extravascular presence of circulating fluorescently labeled lectin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F and G</xref>). Using a fluorescent reporter mouse model, we found that pericytes (NG2DsRed) migrated and proliferated as tip cells during angiogenesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, right panels a, b). This finding aligns with our previous report on NG2+ pericyte-led neovascularization in the inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>). These observations suggest that sprouting angiogenesis, mediated by pericytes, occurred during TM wound healing.</p>

<title>Macrophages promote angiogenesis and depletion of macrophages attenuates angiogenesis</title>
<p>Monocyte recruitment and angiogenesis occur simultaneously during wound healing in the TM, as we have demonstrated. Study has shown that macrophages play a key role in stimulating vessel sprouting during wound angiogenesis in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gurevich et al. 2018</xref>). To investigate the role of macrophages in angiogenesis in adult mice, we developed an inducible macrophage depletion model (CX3CR1CreER; iDTR). This model was created by crossing CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup> transgenic mice with an inducible diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) mouse line that carries a Cre-dependent simian diphtheria toxin receptor. This combination enables targeted cell death upon the administration of diphtheria toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Buch et al. 2005</xref>). At one month of age, the mice were treated with tamoxifen (TAM) for three days to induce the expression of Cre recombinase. To deplete macrophages, DT was administered through daily intraperitoneal injections at a dose of 10 µg/kg for four consecutive days, starting one day after TAM treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>), followed by an acute perforation of the TM in the pars tensa. Our results showed that, compared to control mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), the recruitment and accumulation of macrophages (labeled with F4/80) in the wound area were significantly reduced at day 3 post-perforation in the macrophage depletion mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). By day 7, the wound area in mice that were not depleted of macrophages was filled with macrophages and newly formed blood vessels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the macrophage-depleted mice showed an unhealed wound with reduced macrophage infiltration and less angiogenesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Quantitative analysis confirmed that both the macrophage population and vascular density were significantly lower in the macrophage-depleted mice at both day 3 and day 7 following perforation.

<p>To further investigate the roles of macrophages in driving sprouting angiogenesis, we re-analyzed a published sc-RNA-seq dataset (GEO dataset: GSE196692) collected from mouse TMs at various time points following TM perforation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Scaria et al. 2023</xref>). Our focus was primarily on the signature genes of macrophage clusters. Notably, the gene ontology enrichment analysis of these macrophage clusters revealed significant enrichment of genes associated with angiogenesis, epidermal development, keratinization, and extracellular matrix organization at different stages of TM wound healing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-D</xref>). The role of macrophages in angiogenesis is particularly highlighted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>.

<title>Monocyte recruitment in wound TM is mediated by TRPV1 signal</title>
<p>The final central question we asked in this study was: what molecular signals trigger monocyte migration to the wound area during TM wound healing? The recruitment of macrophages is known to be complex and tissue specific. Recent studies have emphasized the role of interactions between neurons and the immune system in mediating wound healing processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wang et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lowy et al. 2021</xref>). Through bulk RNA sequencing analysis of normal and perforated TMs at various time points, we identified an enrichment of the neuroinflammation response process (Gene Ontology: 0150076) in perforated TMs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Notably, we observed a significant upregulation of the Tac1 gene—up to tenfold compared to non-perforated conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). The Tac1 gene encodes several neuropeptides from the tachykinin family, including substance P, neurokinin A, neuropeptide K, and neuropeptide gamma, all of which are closely linked to TRPV1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Devesa et al. 2014</xref>). The TM is a highly sensitive tissue rich in sensory nerve fibers. A rupture of the TM can result in intense pain for patients. The TRPV1 channel is well-known for its crucial role in pain sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Marrone et al. 2017</xref>). TRPV1-dependent pain signals can rapidly trigger vascular inflammation, immune responses, and the proliferation of precursor cells. Using a fluorescent reporter mouse line for TRPV1, we were surprised to discover that the TM is abundant in TRPV1-positive nerve fibers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). We further validated this finding in the trigeminal ganglion tissue (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wietecha et al. 2013</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that acute TM wound healing involves macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis mediated by TRPV1 signaling. Specifically, we observed that macrophages derived from blood-circulating monocytes are rapidly drawn to the wound area following perforation. In parallel with the macrophage recruitment, we captured the dynamics of angiogenesis including early vascular inflammation and later vascular sprouting near the wound. Using bulk RNA gene analysis, we identified the DEGs enriched in the gene ontology at different time points after TM perforation, particularly regarding neuroinflammation response and angiogenesis. Further, by reprocessing published scRNA-seq datasets on unwounded and wounded murine TMs, we obtained the picture of vital biological processes that macrophages participate in during TM wound healing, including intercellular signaling between macrophages and endothelial cells and macrophage-associated angiogenesis. Finally, we found that the natural process of eardrum wound healing requires TRPV1-associated neuronal signaling, as <italic>Trpv1-/-</italic> mice display delayed or impaired wound healing with reduced monocyte recruitment and diminished angiogenic activity.</p>

<title>Monocyte-derived macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis in TM wound healing</title>
<p>Macrophages are critical in tissue development, homeostasis, and repair of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mosser et al. 2021</xref>). These innate immune cells are among the first responders to tissue injury and are vital at every stage of wound healing. They play a critical role in all phases of wound healing, from initiating inflammation to combat pathogen invasion, to resolving inflammation once the pathogens are eliminated, and further guiding vascular remodeling and stimulating local stem or progenitor cells to promote tissue remodeling and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim and Nair 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gurevich et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pang et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sim et al. 2022</xref>). In our study, we observed a significant accumulation of macrophages at the site of the TM wound. During wound healing, macrophages can originate from different sources. They can rise from monocyte infiltration, proliferate locally, or migrate from other unwound areas in response to early tissue inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guilliams et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davies et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ginhoux and Guilliams 2016</xref>). Our findings indicate that the macrophages in wound tissue are primarily derived from blood-circulating monocytes, rather than from proliferating tissue-resident macrophages or significantly migrating from other tissue regions as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>. This observation aligns with previous studies that have identified the role of monocyte-derived macrophages in wound healing and tissue repair in various other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Willenborg et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Little et al. 2014</xref>). Research indicates that during the healing process, infiltrated monocytes first differentiate into M1 macrophages. These M1 macrophages play a crucial role in scavenging, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation during the inflammatory phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Raziyeva et al. 2021</xref>). Over time, the gene expression of macrophages gradually shifts from the M1 phenotype to the M2 phenotype. This transition enables them to recruit stem cells and secrete cytokines and growth factors that stimulate the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kuraitis et al. 2022</xref>). In our study, we did not examine the plasticity of macrophage phenotypes during wound healing, nor did we investigate the specific roles of monocyte-derived macrophages throughout all phases of the healing process. Future studies that focus on identifying macrophage phenotypes in TM wound healing would be valuable. Such research could help unlock the therapeutic potential of manipulating specific macrophage functions to enhance TM wound healing.</p>
<p>Alongside macrophage recruitment, we observed early vascular inflammation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary Information) and later angiogenesis near the wound. Angiogenesis was initiated by day 3 post-perforation, and further progressed by day 7. Both macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis are critical for the early phase of the wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pang et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sim et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Veith et al. 2019</xref>). Angiogenesis is particularly vital as it restores the supply of nutrients and oxygen to the wound area, aids in waste removal, and facilitates the transport of inflammatory cells, including monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gurevich et al. 2018</xref>). Impaired angiogenesis could result in stunted formation of granulation tissue and prolonged wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brem and Tomic-Canic 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nunan et al. 2014</xref>). In our findings, we demonstrated that depleting macrophages resulted in reduced angiogenesis and delayed wound closure, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. Accumulated evidence indicates that macrophages secrete various pro- and anti-angiogenic growth factors, which are crucial for stimulating angiogenesis during tissue repair and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Corliss et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Stockmann et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Angiogenesis is a complex process that involves various cell types and a coordinated sequence of events within the microenvironment, including vascular sprouting, regression, and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Shi et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wietecha et al. 2013</xref>). Endothelial cells play a pivotal role at the cellular level, serving as the foundational scaffold during tissue repair. As angiogenic sprouting progresses, these cells undergo processes such as activation, adhesion, proliferation, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wacker and Gerhardt 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Shi et al. 2023</xref>). In our previous study on the inner ear, we found that pericytes act as tip cells and are essential for guiding vessel sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>). Consistent with these prior findings, we observed that angiogenesis in the wounded TM is driven by the migration and proliferation of NG2+ pericytes. At the molecular level, wound angiogenesis is regulated by signals from both serum and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al. 2003</xref>). Several angiogenic growth factors have been shown to accelerate healing of TM wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Uddman et al. 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>A previous study demonstrated that the topical application of epidermal growth factor (EGF) effectively heals chronic TM perforations in an animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al. 2023</xref>). In our bulk gene analysis, we observed significant upregulation of several genes associated with angiogenesis, including <italic>Rdpjl, Hif1a, Pla2g4d, Vegfa, Pik3r3,</italic> and <italic>Rhoc</italic>. While we did not thoroughly investigate the specific molecular signals related to macrophage-mediated angiogenesis in the wounded TM in this study, we reanalyzed a previously published scRNA-seq dataset (GEO dataset: GSE196692) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Scaria et al. 2023</xref>). This dataset was collected from mouse TMs at various time points following TM perforation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Scaria et al. 2023</xref>). Our primary focus was on the signature genes from macrophage clusters. Gene enrichment analysis of these macrophage clusters revealed a high enrichment of transcripts related to angiogenesis, epidermal development, keratinization, and extracellular matrix organization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-D</xref>). The macrophage-related angiogenesis was associated with <italic>Rdpjl, Hif1a, Pla2g4d, Vegfa, Pik3r3</italic>, and <italic>Rhoc</italic> signals. These signals were consistently identified in our bulk gene analysis of the entire TM preparation. Most interestingly, from post-perforation days 1 to 7, we observed strong intercellular communication between macrophages and endothelial cells through phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1). Notably, no SPP1-mediated macrophage-to-endothelial cell interactions were detected in the unwounded tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>
<p>SPP1, also known as osteopontin, is a secreted multifunctional glyco-phosphoprotein that is upregulated in acute and chronic inflammatory settings, signaling via integrin and CD44 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yim et al. 2022</xref>). An early study demonstrated that microglia are a major source of SPP1 under stress conditions, contributing to angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Waller et al. 2010</xref>). Other studies have shown that SPP1 contributes to angiogenesis by upregulating VEGF signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Takano et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lou et al. 2021</xref>). However, the current underlying regulatory mechanisms of <italic>Spp1</italic> signaling in macrophage-EC-associated angiogenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we did not examine the individual effects of specific signals on angiogenesis, nor did we investigate whether blocking the SPP1 signal would impact the identified angiogenic factors. It is clear that future research is needed to explore the role of SPP1+ macrophage-associated angiogenesis in wound TM repair. This research would be highly clinically relevant, as it could enhance blood circulation and improve wound healing.</p>

<title>TRPV1 mediated neuronal inflammation facilitates TM wound healing</title>
<p>The signaling pathways that elicit monocyte migration are complex. Over the past few decades, extensive research has highlighted the critical role of neural-inflammatory interactions throughout all stages of wound healing, which has significant clinical implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wang et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The TM is a delicate tissue rich in sensory nerve fibers located near its outer surface. An acute perforation of the TM often results in an immediate and intense pain response in affected individuals. In this study, we hypothesize that the initial pain signal generated by tissue damage acts as a trigger for initiating an acute inflammatory response. This response includes vascular inflammation and the recruitment of monocytes. TRPV1 is recognized as a sensor for pain, cold, and itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ho et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Marrone et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Silverman et al. 2020</xref>). In other tissues, TRPV1-dependent pain sensation is known to rapidly provoke vascular inflammation, immune reactions, and the proliferation of precursor cells, accompanied by the swift release of neuropeptides such as Substance P (SP), neurokinin A, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Du et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gazzieri et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tang et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Oliveira et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Corrigan et al. 2016</xref>). These neuropeptides significantly facilitate macrophage recruitment, vascular inflammation, and increased vascular permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Corrigan et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Silverman et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Foster et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Breglio et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bujak et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li and Gupta 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nidegawa-Saitoh et al. 2018</xref>). Additionally, a recent study demonstrated that cutaneous TRPV1+ neurons directly respond to noxious stimuli and are essential for innate immunity against various pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cohen et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, TRPV1 was predominantly expressed in the trigeminal (TM) nerves and their associated trigeminal ganglia (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Further bulk RNA sequencing analysis of tissue from control and perforated wild-type (WT) animals at different time points indicated early signs of neuronal inflammation. Notably, we observed a significant upregulation of Tac1 expression in the perforated TMs. The Tac1 gene encodes four members of the tachykinin peptide family: Substance P, neurokinin A, neuropeptide K, and neuropeptide γ. This suggests that neural inflammation plays a role in the healing of TM wounds. By comparing monocyte recruitment and angiogenesis levels between WT and <italic>Trpv1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, we found that the <italic>Trpv1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited significantly reduced monocyte recruitment and correspondingly lower angiogenic activity compared to the WT mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Additionally, by day 7, the perforation in the Trpv1-/- mice had not fully sealed. Consistent with our findings, previous studies have shown that TRPV1 depletion impairs wound healing in both cutaneous and corneal tissues. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Ueno et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sumioka et al. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data provide new insight into both the essential role of monocyte recruitment mediated by TRPV1 signaling and macrophage-associated angiogenesis in facilitating TM wound healing, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>. These findings may open new translational opportunities for clinical intervention, as target of the TRPV1 signaling might enhance TM immunity or by promoting angiogenesis and boosting the blood circulation.</p>

<p>This study exploring the role of TRPV1 signaling in recruiting macrophages and promoting angiogenesis during tympanic membrane wound healing presents <bold>useful</bold> findings. However, the strength of evidence supporting the central claims is <bold>incomplete</bold>, as the mechanistic links between TRPV1 activation and immune cell recruitment remain largely correlative and rely heavily on previously published datasets without sufficient functional validation. The work will be of interest to researchers studying wound healing and sensory-immune interactions, though substantial revisions are needed to support its broader significance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study reveals that TRPV1 signaling plays a key role in tympanic membrane (TM) healing by promoting macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis. Using a mouse TM perforation model, researchers found that blood-derived macrophages accumulated near the wound, driving angiogenesis and repair. TRPV1-expressing nerve fibers triggered neuroinflammatory responses, facilitating macrophage recruitment. Genetic Trpv1 mutation reduced macrophage infiltration, angiogenesis, and delayed healing. These findings suggest that targeting TRPV1 or stimulating sensory nerve fibers could enhance TM repair, improve blood flow, and prevent infections. This offers new therapeutic strategies for TM perforations and otitis media in clinical settings. This is an excellent and high-quality study that provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying TM wound healing.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is particularly important for elucidating the cellular and molecular processes involved in TM repair. However, there are several concerns about the current version.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major concerns</p>
<p>(1) The method of administration will be a critical factor when considering potential therapeutic strategies to promote TM healing. It would be beneficial if the authors could discuss possible delivery methods, such as topical application, transtympanic injection, or systemic administration, and their respective advantages and limitations for targeting TRPV1 signaling. For example, Dr. Kanemaru and his colleagues have proposed the use of Trafermin and Spongel to regenerate the eardrum.</p>
<p>(2) The authors appear to have used surface imaging techniques to observe the TM. However, the TM consists of three distinct layers: the epithelial layer, the fibrous middle layer, and the inner mucosal layer. The authors should clarify whether the proposed mechanism involving TRPV1-mediated macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis is limited to the epithelial layer or if it extends to the deeper layers of the TM.</p>
<p>Minor concerns</p>
<p>In Figure 8, the schematic illustration presents a coronal section of the TM. However, based on the data provided in the manuscript, it is unclear whether the authors directly obtained coronal images in their study. To enhance the clarity and impact of the schematic, it would be helpful to include representative images of coronal sections showing macrophage infiltration, angiogenesis, and nerve fiber distribution in the TM.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study examines the role of TRPV1 signaling in the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages and the promotion of angiogenesis during tympanic membrane (TM) wound healing. The authors use a combination of genetic mouse models, macrophage depletion, and transcriptomic approaches to suggest that neuronal TRPV1 activity contributes to macrophage-driven vascular responses necessary for tissue repair.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The topic of neuroimmune interactions in tissue regeneration is of interest and underexplored in the context of the TM, which presents a unique model due to its anatomical features.</p>
<p>(2) The use of reporter mice and bone marrow chimeras allows for some dissection of immune cell origin.</p>
<p>(3) The authors incorporate transcriptomic data to contextualize inflammatory and angiogenic processes during wound healing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The primary claims of the manuscript are not convincingly supported by the evidence presented. Most of the data are correlative in nature, and no direct mechanistic experiments are included to establish causality between TRPV1 signaling and macrophage recruitment or function.</p>
<p>(2) Functional validation of key molecular players (such as Tac1 or Spp1) is lacking, and their roles are inferred primarily from gene expression data rather than experimentally tested.</p>
<p>(3) The reuse of publicly available scRNA-seq data is not sufficiently integrated or extended to yield new biological insights, and it remains largely descriptive.</p>
<p>(4) The macrophage depletion model (CX3CR1CreER; iDTR) lacks specificity, and possible off-target or systemic effects are not addressed.</p>
<p>(5) Several interpretations of the data appear overstated, particularly regarding the necessity of TRPV1 for monocyte recruitment and wound healing.</p>
<p>(6) Overall, the study appears to apply known concepts - namely, TRPV1-mediated neurogenic inflammation and macrophage-driven angiogenesis - to a new anatomical site without providing new mechanistic insight or advancing the field substantially.</p>
<p>Overall:</p>
<p>While the study addresses an interesting topic, the current version does not provide sufficiently strong or novel evidence to support its major conclusions. Additional mechanistic experiments and more rigorous validation would be necessary to substantiate the proposed model and clarify the relevance of the findings beyond this specific tissue context.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study reveals that TRPV1 signaling plays a key role in tympanic membrane (TM) healing by promoting macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis. Using a mouse TM perforation model, researchers found that blood-derived macrophages accumulated near the wound, driving angiogenesis and repair. TRPV1-expressing nerve fibers triggered neuroinflammatory responses, facilitating macrophage recruitment. Genetic Trpv1 mutation reduced macrophage infiltration, angiogenesis, and delayed healing. These findings suggest that targeting TRPV1 or stimulating sensory nerve fibers could enhance TM repair, improve blood flow, and prevent infections. This offers new therapeutic strategies for TM perforations and otitis media in clinical settings. This is an excellent and high-quality study that provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying TM wound healing.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is particularly important for elucidating the cellular and molecular processes involved in TM repair. However, there are several concerns about the current version.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank Reviewer #1 for their time and effort in evaluating and improving our study. Below, we are pleased to address the Reviewer's concerns point by point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major concerns</p>
<p>(1) The method of administration will be a critical factor when considering potential therapeutic strategies to promote TM healing. It would be beneficial if the authors could discuss possible delivery methods, such as topical application, transtympanic injection, or systemic administration, and their respective advantages and limitations for targeting TRPV1 signaling. For example, Dr. Kanemaru and his colleagues have proposed the use of Trafermin and Spongel to regenerate the eardrum.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful to the reviewer for raising this important point. While the present study primarily focuses on the mechanistic role of TRPV1 in TM repair, we agree that the mode of therapeutic delivery will be pivotal in translating these findings into clinical practice. In response, we will expand the discussion to explore possible delivery methods—such as topical application, transtympanic injection, and systemic routes—along with their respective benefits and challenges. We will also cite the work by Dr. Kanemaru and colleagues as an example of how local delivery systems may facilitate TM regeneration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors appear to have used surface imaging techniques to observe the TM. However, the TM consists of three distinct layers: the epithelial layer, the fibrous middle layer, and the inner mucosal layer. The authors should clarify whether the proposed mechanism involving TRPV1-mediated macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis is limited to the epithelial layer or if it extends to the deeper layers of the TM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any confusion caused by our previous description. In our study, we utilized Z-stack confocal imaging to capture the full thickness of the TM, as illustrated in Author response image 1 (reconstructed from the acquired Z-sections). This imaging technique allowed us to encompass all three layers of the TM entirely. Each sample was imaged using a 10X objective on an Olympus fluorescence microscope. Given the conical shape and size of the TM, we imaged it in four quadrants, acquiring approximately 30 optical sections (with a 3 µm step) per region. Each acquired images were projected and exported using FV10ASW 4.2 Viewer, then stitched together using Photoshop. The resulting Z-stack projections enabled us to visualize the distribution of macrophages, angiogenesis, and the localization of nerve fibers throughout the TM. We will include this detailed methodology in our revision to clarify any potential confusion.</p>

<p>Minor concerns</p>
<p>In Figure 8, the schematic illustration presents a coronal section of the TM. However, based on the data provided in the manuscript, it is unclear whether the authors directly obtained coronal images in their study. To enhance the clarity and impact of the schematic, it would be helpful to include representative images of coronal sections showing macrophage infiltration, angiogenesis, and nerve fiber distribution in the TM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted above, we utilized Z-stack confocal imaging to capture the full thickness of the TM, enabling us to visualize structures across all three layers. This approach ensured that all layers were included in our analysis. Due to the thin and curved nature of the TM, traditional cross-sectional imaging often struggles to clearly depict the spatial relationships between macrophages, blood vessels, and nerve fibers, especially at low magnification as shown in Author response image 2. In response to the reviewer's suggestion, we will include representative coronal images in the revised manuscript to better illustrate the distribution of these structures at higher magnification.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate Reviewer #2's perspective on the lack of molecular mechanisms linking TRPV1 signaling and macrophages. However, our data demonstrates that TRPV1 mutations significantly affect macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis. This initial study primarily focuses on the intriguing phenomenon of how sensory nerve fibers are involved in eardrum immunity and wound healing, an area that has not been clearly reported in the literature before. We believe that further research is necessary to explore this topic in greater depth.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Functional validation of key molecular players (such as Tac1 or Spp1) is lacking, and their roles are inferred primarily from gene expression data rather than experimentally tested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we have identified the TAC1 and SPP1 signals as potentially important for TM wound healing for the first time, we agree with the Reviewer's view regarding the lack of molecular mechanisms explored in this study. We have not yet tested the downstream signaling pathways, but we plan to investigate them in a series of future studies. As this is an early report, we will continue to explore these signals and their potential clinical applications based on our initial findings moving forward.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The reuse of publicly available scRNA-seq data is not sufficiently integrated or extended to yield new biological insights, and it remains largely descriptive.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate Reviewer #2 for highlighting this point. Leveraging publicly available scRNA-seq databases and established analysis pipelines not only saves time and resources—my lab recently collected macrophages from the eardrums of postnatal P15 mice, with each trial requiring 20 eardrums from 10 animals to obtain a sufficient number of cells—but also allows researchers to build on previous work and focus on new biological questions without the need to repeat experiments. A prior study conducted by Dr. Tward and his team utilized scRNA-seq data to make initial discoveries related to eardrum wound healing, primarily focusing on epithelial cells rather than macrophages. We are building on their raw data to uncover new biological insights regarding macrophages, even though we have not yet tested the unidentified signals, which we believe will be valuable to our peers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The macrophage depletion model (CX3CR1CreER; iDTR) lacks specificity, and possible off-target or systemic effects are not addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with reviewer #2, although macrophage depletion model used in our study is a standard and well-used animal model (Shi, Hua et al. 2018), which has been used by many other laboratories, it is important to note that any macrophage depletion model may have potential issues. We will discuss this in our revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Several interpretations of the data appear overstated, particularly regarding the necessity of TRPV1 for monocyte recruitment and wound healing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We will revise our manuscript where it is overstated accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Overall, the study appears to apply known concepts - namely, TRPV1-mediated neurogenic inflammation and macrophage-driven angiogenesis - to a new anatomical site without providing new mechanistic insight or advancing the field substantially.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although our study may not seem highly innovative at first glance, it reveals a previously unknown role of the TRPV1 pain signaling pathway in promoting eardrum healing for the first time. This healing process includes the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages and the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). While this process has been documented in other organs, most research on macrophage-driven angiogenesis has been conducted using <italic>in vitro</italic> models, with very few studies demonstrating this process <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our findings could lead to new translational opportunities, especially considering that tympanic membrane perforation, along with damage-induced otitis media and conductive hearing loss, are common clinical issues affecting millions of people worldwide. Targeting TRPV1 signaling could enhance tympanic membrane immunity, improve blood circulation, promote the repair of damaged tympanic membranes, and ultimately prevent middle ear infections—an idea that has not been previously proposed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall:</p>
<p>While the study addresses an interesting topic, the current version does not provide sufficiently strong or novel evidence to support its major conclusions. Additional mechanistic experiments and more rigorous validation would be necessary to substantiate the proposed model and clarify the relevance of the findings beyond this specific tissue context.</p>

<p>We greatly thank the two reviewers for their helpful critiques to improve our study. We especially thank the Section Editors for their insightful and constructive comments on this initial study.</p>
