<abstract>
<p>The human fingertip can detect small tactile features with a spatial acuity roughly the width of a fingerprint ridge. However, how individual ridges deform under contact to support accurate and high-precision tactile feedback is currently unknown. The complex mechanical structure of the glabrous skin, composed of multiple layers and intricate morphology within which mechanoreceptors are embedded, makes this question challenging. Here, we used optical coherence tomography to image and track sub-surface deformations of hundreds of individual fingerprint ridges during contact events at high spatial resolution in vivo. We calculated strain patterns in both the stratum corneum and viable epidermis in response to a variety of tactile stimuli, including static indentation, stick-to-slip events, sliding of a flat surface in different directions, and interaction with small tactile features, such as edges and grooves. We found that ridges could stretch, compress, and undergo considerable shearing orthogonal to the skin surface, but there was limited horizontal shear. Therefore, it appears that the primary components of ridge deformation and, potentially, neural responses are deformations of the ridge flanks and their relative movement, rather than overall bending of the ridges themselves. We conclude that the local distribution of mechanoreceptors across the ridges might be ideally suited to extract the resulting strain gradients and that the fingertip skin may possess a higher mechanical spatial resolution than that of a single ridge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human fingertip is a highly effective tactile sensing organ housing thousands of mechanoreceptors (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Corniani and Saal, 2020</xref>) that convert deformations into neural responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Handler and Ginty, 2021</xref>), which underlie our capacity for fine tactile discrimination and object manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lieber and Bensmaia, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Johansson and Flanagan, 2009</xref>). The ridged structure of the volar skin of the fingertip gives rise to fingerprints, which are thought to determine the spatial resolution at which we can resolve small tactile features. Ridge spacing correlates with perceptual spatial acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Peters et al., 2009</xref>) and the size of receptive sub-fields of type-1 tactile afferents has been estimated in the sub-millimeter range, roughly matching the width of a single ridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sukumar et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>However, understanding how the mechanical properties of individual fingerprint ridges support high-precision tactile feedback presents significant challenges: any force applied to a ridge on the skin’s surface causes deformations within multiple skin layers with distinct mechanical properties and complex morphology, before being transduced into neural activity by mechanoreceptors situated at the epidermis-dermis border and distributed at regular intervals relative to the ridges (see illustration in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Experimental setup and identification of individual fingerprint ridges.</title>
<p><bold>A</bold>. Two main mechanically relevant skin layers constitute the epidermis on the human fingertip: the stratum corneum (blue shading) and the viable epidermis (orange). The ridged structure of the fingerprints extends to deeper layers with increasing morphological complexity. Interactions with surfaces (grey shading, flat surface) take place at the outer boundary of the stratum corneum, while mechanoreceptors are located at the border between the epidermis and the dermis (red shading), at distinct landmarks associated with the ridge structure. Identification of specific morphological landmarks, such as the tops and valleys of a ridge, allows the creation of a fine-grained mesh covering the sub-surface structure of a single ridge (blue and orange overlaid meshes). <bold>B</bold>. Potential ridge deformations during tactile interactions, with arrows indicating the directions of relative deformation. i) Reference mesh (undeformed); ii) Tension and compression of the whole ridge along or orthogonal to the surface axis of the skin; iii) surface (horizontal) shear, where the ridge tilts sideways; iv) ridge (vertical) shear, where the ridge tilts along the axis orthogonal to the surface of the skin. These deformations need not apply to the whole ridge but could also manifest locally, e.g., in individual layers or, as in one of the ridge shear examples, differently across both ridge flanks. <bold>C</bold>.

<p>While numerous studies have investigated ridge deformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cauna, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gerling and Thomas, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Willemet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Delhaye et al., 2016</xref>) and the mechanical properties of different skin layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pereira et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Leyva-Mendivil et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">2017</xref>), most of this work has focused on ex-vivo specimens, surface measurements, or computer simulations. Consequently, the mechanical response of the skin below its immediate surface remains largely unknown, leading to conflicting interpretations in the literature. For instance, when the skin on the fingertip conforms to the shape of an external object, the ridges might be stiff and maintain their shape while bending occurs primarily in the flexible grooves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Swensson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gerling and Thomas, 2008</xref>). Alternatively, the grooves may be stiffer or less prone to movement than the ridges, which might depress to conform to the object’s shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cauna, 1954</xref>). Similarly, during contact with a small tactile feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Johansson and LaMotte, 1983</xref>) or stick-to-slip transitions on a flat surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Delhaye et al., 2016</xref>), the ridge flanks experience stretching and compression at the skin’s surface. However, it remains uncertain whether these deformations are mirrored in deeper layers or if the ridges undergo complex bending (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cauna, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gerling and Thomas, 2008</xref>, for two opposing ideas).</p>
<p>From a mechanical standpoint, these conflicting interpretations raise the question of to what extent ridges stretch or compress along the plane of the skin’s surface, how much they shear horizontally, and whether ridges do also shear orthogonal to the skin surface (see examples in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Additionally, all these deformations might apply to ridges in bulk or might only manifest locally, such as in individual skin layers or within a single ridge flank. To empirically address this question, we employed Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to precisely measure the sub-surface deformation of individual fingerprint ridges in response to a variety of mechanical events. OCT has been used previously to investigate sub-surface skin properties, however, its application has been limited to static characterization of the skin morphology, such as measuring tissues’ thickness and roughness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maiti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ding et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Adabi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Czekalla et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lin et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we aimed to investigate the ways in which ridges are able to deform during dynamic contact events as well as the role played by different skin layers in order to better understand how the ridged structure of fingertip skin supports tactile sensing.</p>

<title>Measuring skin deformation on a sub-ridge scale</title>
<p>We developed a setup for tactile stimulation of the fingertip, which involved lowering a custom-made transparent thin plate onto the participant’s fixed fingertip at a set normal load and smoothly sliding the plate in both distal and proximal directions at a set speed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F, G</xref>). Concurrently, we used an OCT scanner to capture images of the skin’s surface and sub-surface morphology. The scanner obtained 4 mm wide slices with 4.5 μm lateral and 5 μm axial resolution at a sampling frequency of 10 Hz. The images were taken by scanning through the transparent plate along the proximal-distal axis of the finger. Both the stratum corneum and viable epidermis were clearly distinguishable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, H</xref>).</p>
<p>After acquiring and pre-processing the OCT images, we used semi-automatic methods to track sub-surface landmarks associated with individual ridges across different video frames (see Methods). The resulting triangular mesh consisted of eight facets per ridge, distributed between the stratum corneum and viable epidermis, as well as the two flanks of the ridge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Importantly, the mesh was fine-grained enough to identify canonical sub-surface ridge deformation patterns in response to various tactile events. The mesh also extended to and partially covered the dermis-epidermis border, where low-threshold mechanoreceptors are located (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). On average across participants, we measured a ridge width of 0.47 mm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), along with a thickness of 0.38 mm for the stratum corneum and 0.12 mm for the viable epidermis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Moore, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maiti et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>We gathered a large and varied dataset to be able to make robust claims: across four protocols and ten participants, we identified a total of 393 unique ridge slices, which were tracked for 34 s on average and more than a minute in some cases, supported by hundreds of thousands of individually tracked landmarks.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Static normal load</title>
<p>To investigate the response of individual ridges to static normal loads, we applied a flat stimulus to the fingertip, incrementally increasing the load from initial contact in steps of 0.5 N until reaching a maximum of 3.5 N (see examples in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Deformation was measured relative to the unloaded ridge’s stereotypical configuration, and the principal tensile and compressive components of the strain experienced by each mesh facet were obtained (see Methods).</p>

</fig>
<p>Under load, the central part of individual ridges depressed, while the flanks stayed in place (vertical shear), which led to a flattening of the ridge structure and which was consistently observed across participants (see examples in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Ridges could also display horizontal shear and bend proximally or distally depending on their unloaded configuration and sometimes stretch horizontally along the axis of the skin surface. Both tensile and compressive strains increased monotonically with normal load, with rapid changes and, therefore, larger deformations at initial contact followed by slower and mostly linear changes from 0.5 N onwards (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). Across all facets in a given layer, tensile strains reached around 15% in the stratum corneum and 10% in the viable epidermis, while compressive strains were above 20% in the viable epidermis and steadily increased with the load but remained below 10% in the stratum corneum. We noted a small increase in the area of the stratum corneum, which was likely an artifact due to the fit of the mesh to the ridge’s curvature, but a notable decrease in the area of the viable epidermis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Our results, therefore, indicate that both the stratum corneum and the viable epidermis undergo deformation under static load, mostly manifested as a flattening of the ridge structure, but that compression is higher in the viable epidermis.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Lateral sliding and stick-to-slip</title>
<p>After characterizing the deformation resulting from a static normal load, we investigated sliding interactions between the fingertip and the flat surface. The flat surface was first lowered onto the fingertip until stable contact was established (with a normal load below 0.5 N), then displaced at a constant speed of 0.8 mm/s by 7.6 mm in the distal or proximal direction for a total of 8 movements. In accordance with previous findings, we observed two distinct phases of relative movement between the skin and the plate: stick, where the ridges adhered to the plate and were dragged along with it, and slip, where the ridges stopped moving, and the plate slipped over them. The clear distinction between the stick and slip phases allowed us to classify each phase based on the average horizontal velocity over all tracked features (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> for an example from a single participant).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="547395v1_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Previous studies have shown that stick-to-slip events elicit strain waves on the surface of the fingertip skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Delhaye et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Willemet et al., 2022</xref>; du Bois <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">de Dunilac et al., 2022</xref>), but their effects on the sub-surface structure are unclear. Additionally, reversing the plate’s movement direction changes the tangential force applied to the skin and induces shear deformations within the tissue, but it is unclear whether these are absorbed in surface skin layers or in deeper tissues. To quantify the deformation that occurred between the transitions from stick to slip and between different movement directions of the plate, respectively, we calculated a stereo-typical mesh covering a single papillary ridge by averaging the meshes of all tracked ridges (<italic>n</italic> = 140 in total) across image frames within the same phase for each participant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, C</xref>, see Methods). We then calculated the principal tensile and compressive strain components experienced by each mesh facet on the transition from one phase to the next.</p>
<p>Examining the ridge deformation changes between movement phases revealed large variability across participants, both in the magnitude and the orientation of the deformations (see individual examples in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and all participants in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). This variability is likely explained by the fact that, during stick-to-slip transitions, some parts of the fingertip experience tension, while others experience compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Delhaye et al., 2016</xref>), and therefore measurements depend on the precise location. Additionally, the mechanical properties of each individual fingertip influence its own mechanical response and, crucially, at what time during the plate transit the stick-to-slip transition will happen (see Methods), leading to varied mechanical environments. Nonetheless, several consistent findings emerged from the data.</p>
<p>First, we found that, across participants, strain magnitudes (quantified as maximal shear strain, see Methods) were consistently larger by about a third during the stick-to-slip transitions compared to the plate reversal transition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>) for both the stratum corneum and viable epidermis (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01 for both based on paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests across all facets, movement directions, and participants). This was also true for individual participants, with strain largest during stick-to-slip transitions for eight out of nine participants. Thus, ridge deformations are most pronounced during stick-to-slip transitions rather than in response to different movement directions of the surface.</p>
<p>Second, while the orientation of the principal strain axes varied between participants, they were relatively consistent within participants in individual phases: the average angular standard deviation was 26 degrees when considering all facets of the ridge within a given phase and, subsequently, averaging over phases and participants. Consequently, strains tended to act in a consistent direction along the entire extent of the ridge (see also examples in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Notably, the principal strain directions exhibited a greater alignment with the cardinal axes (0 and ±90 degrees) rather than diagonal axes (±45 degrees) for the majority of participants across most phases (averaging 60% overall, see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). This alignment implies a predominance of tension and compression in the ridge rather than horizontal shear. When shear did manifest, it was more pronounced during stick-to-slip transitions compared to direction changes, and generally aligned with the direction of plate movement, although this alignment was not always observed. We did not find any significant differences in the distribution of principal angles between the stratum corneum and the viable epidermis for either stick-to-slip transitions or movement reversals (<italic>p &gt;</italic> 0.37 for both based on two-sample Kolmogornov-Smirnov tests across all facets, directions, and participants).</p>
<p>The low amount of shear was surprising, as during stick phases the skin was typically dragged along with the surface for several millimeters (mean: 3.4 mm, range: 0.9-6.3 mm). Assuming no motion of the bone, and a distance of 5-10 mm between the lightly loaded skin surface and the bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Birznieks et al., 2001</xref>) yields large expected shear strains of 45% on average (range: 9-126%), clearly much in excess of what we observed. Thus, most of this shearing must be sustained by deeper tissues. In agreement with this idea, we noticed that collagen fiber bundles visible in the recorded frames often displayed much higher tilt than was visible in the stratum corneum or viable epidermis (see highlighted examples in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, when switching movement direction, which caused the skin to stick to the surface again, we observed a 90-degree rotation of the principal axis of deformation (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, bottom panel). In contrast, there was relatively little change in the angle when transitioning to slip (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, top panel). Thus, changing direction caused a reversal in the tension and compression axes but relatively little deformation in itself; this deformation then occurred during the transition to slip. The observed changes in orientation occurred consistently for both ridge flanks and therefore applied uniformly to the whole ridge.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings indicate that the primary deformations occurring during contact with a flat plate predominantly involve tension and compression of individual ridges along the skin’s surface. Horizontal shear is only occasionally present and does not consistently align with the direction of movement. When shear is observed, it is more prominent during stick-to-slip transitions rather than during reversals of the plate movement.</p>

<title>Ridge interactions with small tactile features</title>
<p>Finally, we investigated ridge deformation during contact with small tactile features that were close in size to that of a single ridge itself (1 mm in width and 0.3 mm in height/depth). For this experiment, we used the plates with the edge and groove, respectively, keeping all other stimulation parameters the same. We identified five consecutive phases for each tracked ridge based on its position relative to the edge or groove: 1) sliding under the flat part of the surface, 2) approach of the feature, 3) located centrally under the feature, 4) withdrawal from the feature, and 5) sliding under the flat part of the surface (see illustrations in top rows of <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, D</xref>). We again quantified the deformation of the average ridge during all these phases (see Methods), with the strains calculated relative to the initial mesh before contact with the feature was made (phase 1).</p>

<p>Ridge deformations were remarkably similar across participants but differed clearly across movement phases (see ridge deformations for a single participant in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, D</xref> bottom rows and all participants in <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figs. S2</xref> and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>). There was minimal evidence supporting the notion of a rigid ridge maintaining its shape, and instead, the central part of the ridge deformed considerably. Horizontal shear was relatively modest, with generally little bending of the ridge observed. Instead, our findings highlighted that the primary mechanism through which the ridge conformed to the shape of a feature involved vertical shearing of the whole ridge or the two ridge flanks against each other, as the skin moved vertically to conform to the feature. Consequently, during the transit of the edge, the full ridge initially sheared orthogonally to the skin’s surface with both the strain orientations of both flanks aligned (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, left panel). When the edge was directly above the ridge, both flanks sheared against each other, leading to opposite strain orientations across the two flanks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, middle panel) before the ridge returned to its original configuration during the withdrawal of the edge <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, right panel). This pattern was mirrored, but with strain orientations reversed, during the transit of the groove (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Strains increased and reached their maximum with respect to the initial configuration when the ridge was located directly under the feature and then decreased again as the ridge reverted to its original shape. For the edge, both strain components differed between the viable epidermis compared to the stratum corneum when the ridge was located directly below the feature (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01 in Bonferroni corrected paired Wilcoxon tests across all facets and participants), resulting in an expansion of the area of the viable epidermis, as it was stretched around the edge feature, while the mostly incompressible stratum corneum retained its area (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Conversely, while interacting with the groove, a ridge experienced high compressive strains, which again were larger in the viable epidermis compared to the stratum corneum, and as a result, the area covered by the viable epidermis contracted, while the stratum corneum retained its area (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study measured the sub-surface deformation of individual papillary ridges in the fingertip skin during tactile interactions in vivo. The dataset included hundreds of individual ridges, whose deformations were tracked using high-resolution meshes during static normal load, lateral stick, and slip using a flat surface, as well as during contact with small tactile features. We found that individual ridges tended to flatten even at relatively low forces. Lateral sliding elicited strong tension and compression, often aligned with the surface orientation of the skin, which was especially strong during stick-to-slip transitions. Contact with edges and grooves yielded strong vertical shear, with ridge flanks moving relative to each other. We observed horizontal shear during static contact and sometimes when sliding the flat surface, however, it was limited in magnitude and was present only for some participants.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Canonical ridge deformations during tactile interactions</title>
<p>One of the main objectives of our study was to investigate the primary deformation patterns exhibited by individual ridges during tactile interactions. Previous stud-ies combining mechanical measurements at the ridge surface and histology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cauna, 1954</xref>) or analyzing the spatial keratin expression patterns within single ridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Swensson et al., 1998</xref>) have suggested the presence of alternating softer and stiffer regions within the ridges. These findings implied a mechanically constrained set of canonical deformations, yet the specific nature of these deformations has been a subject of debate, lacking direct empirical evidence.</p>
<p>In this study, we have provided conclusive evidence that ridge peaks are not rigid and, instead, individual ridges undergo significant flattening during contact. This finding challenges previous speculation that the grooves between the ridges act as ‘hinges’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Swensson et al., 1998</xref>). Instead, our results demonstrate that the fingerprint predominantly conforms to an external object through vertical shearing. Thus, the primary mechanism through which the ridge conforms to the object involves the relative movement and shearing of the ridge flanks, rather than relying on the grooves as articulated joints.</p>
<p>In contrast to the prominent vertical shearing observed, our study revealed minimal and inconsistent horizontal shear. We propose that the flattening of the ridges during contact may prevent further bending of the ridges, thus limiting the occurrence of horizontal shear. The absence of horizontal shear during the stick phase of lateral sliding on the flat surface was particularly unexpected. During these periods, the skin re-adhered to the plate and was subsequently dragged along, often over a distance of several millimeters. Our findings strongly indicate that the majority of the surface movement of the skin was absorbed by deeper tissue rather than the surface layers of the skin. Previous studies investigating tactile afferent responses to tangential skin movements have reported strong activation of SA-2 receptors, thought to measure skin stretch mainly in deeper tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Saal et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, the mechanical response of the fingertip during tactile interactions involves a complex interplay between the surface layers and deeper tissues, which warrants further investigation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Duprez et al., 2023</xref>, for some recent work).</p>

<title>Implications for neural coding of touch</title>
<p>Ridge deformations are ultimately transduced into neural activity by mechanoreceptors, and our findings provide new insights into this process.</p>
<p>First, the magnitude of sub-surface deformation measured in our study correlated with neural response strengths observed in other studies. In trials with the flat surface, we measured larger deformations during stick-to-slip transitions than during reversals of the plate’s movement direction. Analogously, a previous study recorded neural responses during sliding stimulation of the fingertip and reported that rapidly adapting type I afferents (RA-I) showed little to no response during the onset and offset of the tangential load but strongly encoded the stick-to-slip transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Delhaye et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that mechanoreceptors directly encode the local amount of deformation. Our findings also extend these prior results by demonstrating that the large surface strains measured during the transition from stick to slip are mirrored in tissues below the surface and specifically at the depth at which type-1 mechanoreceptors are located. Altogether these results provide a physiological explanation for the widely observed human capacity of fine-tuned grasping with quick adjustments of the grip force to friction changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansson and Westling, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cadoret and Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schiltz et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, our finding that contact with small tactile features elicits shearing of both ridge flanks against each other suggests that the mechanical resolution of the fingerprint skin is on the order of half the width of an individual papillary ridge. In principle, such fine-grained and local differences in strain might be detectable by mechanoreceptors. Indeed, Meissner corpuscles innervate each flank of a fingerprint’s ridge, and prior work has shown that separate fibers can innervate the two flanks of the same ridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nolano et al., 2003</xref>). Previous psychophysical work also appears to support this idea because it has estimated the spatial resolution of static touch at around 200 μm, thus approximately half the width of a single ridge of the fingerprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hollins and Risner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bensmaia and Hollins, 2003</xref>). However, it should be pointed out that such estimates are notoriously difficult to obtain reliably as they depend on both the precise stimulus and the mode of contact and that this limit has traditionally been associated with the responses of Merkel cells rather than Meissner corpuscles. Previous neural recordings measured the spatial acuity of the receptive sub-fields of RA1 and SA1 afferents, which were estimated to lie in the submillimeter range, roughly matching the width of a single ridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sukumar et al., 2022</xref>). Our results also suggest that complementary features (edges and grooves, respectively) generate symmetrical deformation. Recording responses from the same tactile afferent to such complementary features might help to disentangle what aspects of shearing the afferent is sensitive to. Therefore further electrophysiological and psychophysical work is needed to determine whether the sub-ridge mechanical resolution of the fingerprint skin does indeed translate into corresponding neural and perceptual acuity.</p>

<title>Limitations and future work</title>
<p>While our study was based on a large dataset, which contained a variety of tactile interactions, there are a number of limitations. First, while we could confidently track landmarks associated with the stratum corneum, we could not reliably identify the primary ridges of the epidermis, though they were visible in some of the frames. We hypothesize that the additional depth combined with their slender morphology might have degraded the signal. Primary ridges are of importance because Merkel cell clusters are located at their tip, and they are therefore likely important for mechanotransduction. Indeed, primary ridges feature in the so-called ‘lever hypothesis’ of tactile transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cauna, 1954</xref>), which has been called into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gerling and Thomas, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">2008</xref>), though direct empirical evidence is currently lacking. Ideally, future studies would improve imaging resolution and clarity to visualize morphological structures in more detail and at greater depth. We employed a state-of-the-art, clinical OCT scanner, routinely used in dermatological clinical assessments. Data from a recently developed experimental scanner demonstrated the possibility of resolving smaller structures in the tissues, even as small as Meissner corpuscles, by applying a technique called speckle-modulating OCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liba et al., 2017</xref>). Coupling such advanced imaging techniques with our experimental set-up and analysis pipeline would further advance the understanding of sub-surface skin properties and deformation mechanisms and allow more direct investigation of neural mechanisms. Such advanced imaging could also be combined with electrophysiological recordings from afferent fibers using microneurography (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Delhaye et al., 2021</xref>, for an example).</p>
<p>Second, while the edges and grooves of our feature plates were only marginally larger than a single papillary ridge and mimic those employed in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>), even smaller stimuli would be capable of delivering much more localized forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Johansson and LaMotte, 1983</xref>). In the present study, we were limited by the resolution of the 3D printing technique employed to manufacture the transparent plates. Additionally, sharp corners elicit optical artifacts in the obtained images, which can occlude landmarks.</p>
<p>Third, we obtained two-dimensional slices oriented orthogonal to the orientation of the fingerprints, but the skin is a three-dimensional structure. Some of our tactile interactions might have caused skin deformations out-of-plane that were thus not measurable. Future studies could consider creating three-dimensional reconstructions of the fingerprint structure to study such effects.</p>
<p>Finally, in our study, we focused on young, healthy participants. However, several studies have shown that morphological and mechanical skin properties can greatly vary with physiological and physical factors such as age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jobanputra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Püllen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Skedung et al., 2018</xref>), sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Luebberding et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Diridollou et al., 2000</xref>), level of skin moisturization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tomlinson et al., 2011</xref>), as well as room temperature and humidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>). All these factors might therefore also influence how individual ridges deform.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Ten healthy participants (3 males, average age 20.5 years) participated in the experiment after providing informed consent. Due to low imaging quality for data from one participant, which precluded consistent tracking, all sliding experiments included data from nine participants; the static protocol was run on a subset of five participants. The experiment was performed on the subjects’ left middle finger. Before any trial, the finger was thoroughly cleaned with water and dried carefully, and a thin layer of petroleum jelly was applied to moisturize the skin; this helped prevent repeated stick-slip events while sliding the surface. Environmental conditions during the test were controlled with 20° C room temperature and 50% relative humidity. The study protocol received ethical approval from The University of Sheffield Research Ethics Committee (ethics number 039144). All experiments took place in the Skin Barrier Research Facility, operated by Sheffield Dermatology Research at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, UK.</p>

<title>Experimental set-up</title>
<p>The experimental set-up for the present study was adapted from the design of an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Transparent plates were secured by a support rig fixed on a linear stage that could move in both distal and proximal directions with respect to the participant’s fingertip, allowing the plate to slide against the finger. The fingertip was glued onto a finger holder to maintain its position during the acquisitions. The support rig was mounted on a force plate (HE6×6-10, Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc.) to measure the load along the axes parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the movement and along the axis normal to the plate surface. The plates were made from polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and were 30×40×0.5 mm in size (produced by Shape Technology S.r.l., Casale Monferrato, Italy). One plate was flat, while the two others had an embossed oriented half-circular edge (1 mm base diameter and 0.4 mm height) or an engraved oriented groove (1 mm based diameter and 0.3 mm depth) traversing the middle of the surface (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior to each trial, the plate specimens were cleaned with deionized water and dried thoroughly with paper towels. In the static loading experiment, the plate was initially positioned in contact with the participant’s fingertip without exerting any pressure (0 N). Afterward, the load was manually incrementally increased in 0.5N steps, reaching a maximum of 3.5N. At each step, 20 frames were recorded. In the sliding experiments, before commencing the imaging acquisition in each trial, the plate was manually lowered onto the participant’s fingertip until a normal load of 0.2N was reached. During each trial, the plate was moved 7.6mm in each direction (proximal to distal and vice versa) four times at a constant speed of 0.8mm/s.</p>

<title>Image acquisition and pre-processing</title>
<p>For image acquisition, we utilized the Vivosight® OCT system (Michelson Diagnostics, Kent), which is clinically approved and features a Fourier domain with a 20 kHz swept-source laser at 1300 nm center wavelength. The image capture rate was 10 frames per second, and the dimension of each image was 895 × 483 pixels with 256 gray levels with a 4.5μm lateral and 5μm axial resolution.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition, we preprocessed the images using the cv2 library in Python. Firstly, we normalized the brightness and increased the contrast by applying histogram equalization. Then, to further enhance the contrast and adjust the image saturation, we performed a gamma transformation (<italic>γ</italic> = 5). Lastly, we removed noise while preserving sharp edges by applying a bilateral filter (diameter of pixel neighborhood: 5, sigmaColor: 110, sigmaSpace: 190).</p>

<title>Tracking of individual ridge deformation</title>
<p>In each frame of the experiment, the top and bottom of each ridge within the field of view were semiautomatically tracked at three levels: the surface, the border between the stratum corneum and viable epidermis, and the junction between the dermis and epidermis. For each set of frames obtained during a single trial, a portion of the frames, ranging between 25-50% of the total, were manually annotated using the Python polygonal annotation library Labelme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wada et al., 2021</xref>). The annotated frames were then used to train a DeepLabCut model to automatically estimate the position of each tracked point in the remaining frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nath et al., 2019</xref>). The accuracy of the models, on average, was 2.96 pixels on the training set and 14.64 pixels on the test set. We then manually reviewed the automatic annotations to correct any inaccuracies that might have arisen from automatic tracking. To measure the deformation of individual sub-surface ridges, the tracked points were used to create a triangular mesh for each ridge in the field of view. The mesh consisted of 8 facets per ridge, divided between the stratum corneum and viable epidermis and between the proximal and distal flanks of each ridge.</p>

<title>Movement phase classification</title>
<p>To study the skin movement during the transits of the plate, we analyzed the displacement of the tracked points from frame to frame.

<p>To identify the transition between sticking and slipping phases, we took the positive and negative extrema of the first derivative of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="547395v1_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> as markers. Each trial consisted of four plate transits in each direction, resulting in a total of 16 successive phases.

We chose <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>phase</italic></sub> as the minimum duration of each phase among its four repetitions. The time spent in either phase varied markedly across participants (range: 11.4-82.7%, mean: 44.7%). These differences are partly attributable to differences in skin mechanics across participants (e.g., moisture level) but also depend on the precise location of the imaging site on the fingertip, as previous research has shown that stable contact is lost progressively over time across the whole fingertip during the transition from stick to slip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Delhaye et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<p>The principal component of the strain, <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>e</italic><sub>2</sub>, were obtained by eigenvalue decomposition of the strain matrix <italic>ε</italic>, as reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Delhaye et al., 2016</xref>). The principal strain decomposition consists of a rotation of the reference coordinates so that the shear strain is canceled and the axial strains take their maximal and minimal value. Thus, the principal components <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>e</italic><sub>2</sub> represent the maximum tensile and compressive deformation along perpendicular axes.</p>
<p>From the principal strain components, we computed the variation in the area of every triangle composing the mesh as:

As as measure of overall deformation during sliding of the flat surface, we calculate the maximum shear strain as:

The study provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence that such features tend to cause deformation and relative movement of what the authors term ridge flanks rather than bending of the ridges themselves.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) to visualize tissue microstructures about 1-2 mm under the finger pad skin surface. Their geometric features are tracked and used to generate tissue strains upon skin surface indentation by a series of transparent stimuli both normal and tangential to the surface. Then movements of the stratum corneum and the upper portion of the viable epidermis are evaluated. Based upon this data, across a number of participants and ridges, around 300 in total, the findings report upon particular movements of these tissue microstructures in various loading states. A better understanding of the mechanics of the skin microstructures is important to understand how surface forces propagate toward the locations of mechanoreceptive end organs, which lie near the edge of the epidermis and dermis, from which tactile responses of at least two peripheral afferents originate. Indeed, the microstructures of the skin are likely to be important in shaping how neural afferents respond and enhance their sensitivity, receptive field characteristics, etc.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The use of OCT in the context of analyzing the movements of skin microstructures is novel. Also novel and powerful is the use of distinct loading cases, e.g., normal, tangential, and stimulus features, e.g., edges, and curves. I am unaware of other empirical visualization studies of this sort. They are state-of-the-art in this field. Moreover, in addition to the empirical imaging observations, strain vectors in the tissues are calculated over time.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The interpretation of the results and their framing relative to the overall hypotheses/questions and prior works could be articulated more clearly. In particular, the major findings of the manuscript are in newly describing a central concept regarding &quot;ridge flanks,&quot; but such structures are neither anatomically nor mechanistically defined in a clear fashion. For example, &quot;... it appears that the primary components of ridge deformation and, potentially, neural responses are deformations of the ridge flanks and their relative movement, rather than overall bending of the ridges themselves.&quot; From an anatomical perspective, I think what the authors mean by &quot;ridge flanks&quot; is a differential in strain from one lateral side of a papillary ridge to the other. But is it unclear what about the continuous layers of tissue would cause such behaviors. Perhaps a sweat duct or some other structure (not visible to OCT) would subdivide the &quot;flanks&quot; of a papillary ridge somehow? If not due to particular anatomy, then is the importance of the &quot;ridge flank&quot; due to a mechanistic phenomenon of some sort? Given that the findings of the manuscript center upon the introduction of this new concept, I think a greater effort should be made to define what exactly are the &quot;ridge flanks.&quot; It is clear from the results, especially the sliding case, that there is something important that the manuscript is getting at with this concept.</p>
<p>The OCT used herein cannot visualize deep and fully into what the manuscript refers to as a &quot;ridge&quot; (note others have previously broken apart this concept apart into &quot;papillary&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot; and &quot;limiting&quot; ridges) near locations of the mechanoreceptive end organs lie at the epidermal-dermal border. Therefore, the OCT must make inferences about the movements of these deeper tissues, but cannot see them directly, and it is the movements of these deeper tissues that are likely driving the intricacies of neural firing. Note the word &quot;ridge&quot; is used often in the manuscript's abstract, introduction, and discussion but the definition in Fig. 1 and elsewhere differs in important ways from prior works of Cauna (expert in anatomy). Therefore, the manuscript should clarify if &quot;ridge&quot; refers to the papillary ridge (visible at the exterior of the skin), intermediate ridge (defined by Cauna as what the authors refer to as the primary ridge), and limiting ridge (defined by Cauna as what the authors refer to as the secondary ridge). What the authors really mean (I think) is some combination of the papillary and intermediate ridge structures, but not the full intermediate ridge. The manuscript acknowledges this in the &quot;Limitations and future work&quot; section, stating that these ridges cannot be resolved. This is important because the manuscript is oriented toward tracking this structure. It sets up the narrative and hypotheses to evaluate the prior works of Cauna, Gerling, Swensson, and others who all directly addressed the movement of this anatomical feature which is key to understanding ultimately how stresses at these locations might move the peripheral end organs (i.e., Merkel cells, Meissner corpuscles).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors investigate sub-skin surface deformations to a number of different, relevant tactile stimuli, including pressure and moving stimuli. The results demonstrate and quantify the tension and compression applied from these types of touch to fingerprint ridges, where pressure flattens the ridges. Their study further revealed that on lateral movement, prominent vertical shearing occurred in ridge deformation, with somewhat inconsistent horizontal shear. This also shows how much the deeper skin layers are deformed in touch, meaning the activation of all cutaneous mechanoreceptors, as well as the possibility of other deeper non-cutaneous mechanoreceptors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The paper has many strengths. As well as being impactful scientifically, the methods are sound and innovative, producing interesting and detailed results. The results reveal the intricate workings of the skin layers to pressure touch, as well as sliding touch over different conditions. This makes it applicable to many touch situations and provides insights into the differential movements of the skin, and thus the encoding of touch in regards to the function of fingerprints. The work is very clearly written and presented, including how their work relates to the literature and previous hypotheses about the function of fingerprint ridges. The figures are very well-presented and show individual and group data well. The additional supplementary information is informative and the video of the skin tracking demonstrates the experiments well.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are very few weaknesses in the work, rather the authors detail well the limitations in the discussion. Therefore, this opens up lots of possibilities for future work.</p>
<p>Impact/significance:</p>
<p>
Overall, the work will likely have a large impact on our understanding of the mechanics of the skin. The detail shown in the study goes beyond current understanding, to add profound insights into how the skin actually deforms and moves on contact and sliding over a surface, respectively. The method could be potentially applied in many other different settings (e.g. to investigate more complex textures, and how skin deformation changes with factors like dryness and aging). This fundamental piece of work could therefore be applied to understand skin changes and how these impact touch perception. It can further be applied to understand skin mechanoreceptor function better and model these. Finally, the importance of fingertip ridges is well-detailed, demonstrating how these play a role in directly shaping our touch perception and how they can shape the interactions we have with surfaces.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The publication presents unique in-vivo images of the upper layer of the epidermis of the glabrous skin when a flat object compresses or slides on the fingertip. The images are captured using OCT, and are the process of recovering the strain that fingerprints experience during the mechanical stimulation.</p>
<p>The most important finding is, in my opinion, that fingerprints undergo pure compression/tension without horizontal shear, hinting at the fact that the shear stress caused by the tangential load is transferred to the deeper tissues and ultimately to the mechanoreceptors (SA-I / RA-I).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- Fascinating new insights into the mechanics of glabrous skin. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence of the mechanical deformation of fingerprints when subjected to dynamic mechanical stimulation. The OCT measurement allows an unprecedented measurement of the depth of the skin whereas previous works were limited to tracking the surface deformation.</p>
<p>
- The robust data analysis reveals the continuum mechanics underlying the deformation of the fingerprint ridges.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
I do not see any major weaknesses. The work is mainly experimental and is rigorously executed. Two points pique my curiosity, however:</p>
<p>1. How do the results presented in this study compare with previous finite element analysis? I am curious to know if the claim that the horizontal shear strain is transferred to the previous layer is also captured by these models. The reason is that the FEA models typically use homogeneous materials and whether or not the behavior in-silico and in-vivo matches would offer an idea of the nature of the stratum corneum.</p>
<p>
2. Was there a specific reason why the authors chose to track only one fingerprint? From the method section, it seems that nothing would have prevented tracking a denser point cloud and reconstructing the stain on a section of the skin rather than just one ridge. With such data, the author could extend their analysis to multiple ridges interaction and get a better sense of the behavior of the entire strip of skin.</p>
