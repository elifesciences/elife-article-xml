<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The intestinal absorption of essential nutrients, especially those not readily biosynthesized, is a critical physiological process for maintaining homeostasis. Numerous studies have indicated that intestinal absorption is mediated by various membrane transporters. Citrate, a crucial bioactive compound produced as an intermediate in the Krebs cycle, is absorbed in the small intestine through carrier-mediated systems because of its high hydrophilicity. While the luminal absorption of citrate is mediated by Na<sup>+</sup>-dicarboxylate cotransporter 1 (NaDC1), the mechanism governing the release of the transported citrate into the bloodstream remains unknown. Here, we explored the transporters responsible for intestinal citrate absorption at the basolateral membrane, focusing on highly expressed orphan transporters in the small intestine as candidates. Consequently, SLC35G1, originally identified as a partner of stromal interaction molecule 1, a cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein, was found to play a role in the intestinal absorption of citrate at the basolateral membrane. Furthermore, our results revealed that SLC35G1-mediated citrate transport was diminished by chloride ions at extracellular concentrations. This suggests that SLC35G1, to our best knowledge, is the first transporter identified to be extremely sensitive to chloride ions among those functioning on the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. This study provides valuable insights into the intestinal absorption of citrate and significantly contributes to elucidating the poorly understood molecular basis of the intestinal absorption system.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Citrate plays a crucial role as a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate, contributing to the generation of metabolizable energy. Since citrate is obtained not only through biosynthesis but also from the diet, the existence of intestinal absorption system has long been acknowledged (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Browne et al., 1978</xref></italic>). Luminal absorption is predominantly mediated by Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent dicarboxylate transporter 1 (NaDC1/SLC13A2) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Pajor, 2006</xref></italic>); however, the transporter responsible for the release of citrate and its metabolites across the basolateral membrane remain unidentified (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Pajor, 2014</xref></italic>). To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying citrate absorption at the basolateral membrane, we explored the transporters implicated in the process. Our study provides novel insights into basolateral membrane transporters, addressing a previously poorly understood aspect in intestinal epithelial cells.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>Our investigation revealed that SLC35G1, a member of the solute carrier (SLC) 35 family and originally identified as a partner of stromal interaction molecule 1 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Krapivinsky et al., 2011</xref></italic>), is capable of transporting citrate. While the functions of nucleoside-sugar transporters on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane have been identified for certain SLC35 family members, including SLC35A, SLC35B, SLC35C, and SLC35D (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ishida and Kawakita, 2004</xref></italic>), the roles of SLC35E, SLC35F, and SLC35G have not yet been fully elucidated, as shown in <italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic>. For the functional analysis, we first established Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKII) cells stably expressing SLC35G1. Using these cells, we observed a linear increase in SLC35G1-mediated citrate uptake with time, specifically during the first 10 min in Hanks’ solution mimicking the cytosolic ion content by eliminating Cl<sup>-</sup> (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></italic>). The acidic condition (pH 5.5) was used to gain sufficient uptake for functional analysis. Therefore, the uptake at 10 min was evaluated in subsequent studies. A kinetic analysis revealed that the SLC35G1-specific uptake of citrate exhibited saturation kinetics, with a <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of 1.10 nmol/min/mg protein and a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 519 μM (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></italic>). Notably, the specific uptake of citrate by SLC35G1 was extensively inhibited by extracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></italic>), with an <italic>IC</italic><sub>50</sub> value of 6.7 mM (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></italic>). As previously reported (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Melkikh and Sutormina, 2008</xref></italic>), the Cl<sup>−</sup> concentration is lower in the cytosol (5 mM) than in the extracellular conditions (120 mM), suggesting that SLC35G1 is a potential citrate exporter. Additionally, we examined the effect of various compounds, including other TCA cycle intermediates and typical inhibitors of organic anion/cation transporters at a concentration of 200 μM, to explore the potential role of SLC35G1 in their transport (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></italic>). Among the tested compounds, certain anionic compounds significantly inhibited SLC35G1-specific citrate uptake, indicating that they are also recognized by SLC35G1. SLC35G1-specific citrate uptake showed pH dependence (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></italic>). To investigate whether SLC35G1 utilizes an H<sup>+</sup> gradient as a driving force for citrate transport, we examined the effect of the protonophore nigericin in the uptake solution at pH 5.5 to dissipate the H<sup>+</sup> gradient across the plasma membrane. However, treatment with nigericin did not affect the specific uptake of citrate (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref></italic>), excluding this possibility. Given that one carboxylate can be protonated with a p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of 5.4 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Contreras-Trigo et al., 2018</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref></italic>), SLC35G1 may preferably transport dianionic citrate, like NaDC1 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Pajor and Sun, 1996</xref></italic>). Finally, we determined the role of SLC35G1 in the transcellular transport of citrate at the basolateral membranes using SLC35G1-transfected polarized MDCKII cells on Transwell permeable membrane filters. As shown in <italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref></italic>, SLC35G1 predominantly localized to the basolateral membrane of polarized MDCKII cells. Transport studies were performed under pH gradient conditions (apical pH 5.5 and basal pH 7.4) in the presence of Cl<sup>-</sup> to mimic intestinal physiological conditions. SLC35G1-transfected cells showed no significant change in intracellular citrate accumulation from the apical side, compared to mock cells (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref></italic>). However, apical-to-basolateral transcellular transport was significantly higher in SLC35G1-transfected cells (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref></italic>). On the other hand, SLC35G1 overexpression affected neither intracellular accumulation nor transcellular transport from the basolateral side. This is reasonable since the basolaterally localized SLC35G1 operates for efflux but not for uptake in the presence of Cl<sup>-</sup> in the extracellular environment. These results suggest that SLC35G1 plays a role in the intestinal absorption of citrate at the basolateral membrane as an exporter under physiological conditions.</p>

<p>To further investigate the physiological role of SLC35G1, we examined its expression in human tissues (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic>). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that SLC35G1 is highly expressed in the digestive tract, especially in the upper part of the small intestine, including the duodenum and jejunum, followed by the testis and pancreas. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining of the human jejunum clearly showed that SLC35G1 is localized on the basolateral membrane, as indicated by the co-localization of ATP1A1, a marker protein on the basolateral membrane (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></italic>). To investigate the physiological impact of SLC35G1 on intestinal citrate absorption, we examined the effect of SLC35G1 knockdown on citrate uptake in human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells, a commonly used model for studying intestinal absorbency (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Yee, 1997</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></italic>), in the absence of Cl<sup>-</sup>. As shown in <italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></italic>, citrate uptake was significantly reduced following RNA interference with siRNAs targeting SLC35G1 mRNA, providing evidence of the involvement of SLC35G1 in intestinal citrate absorption. The reduction in citrate uptake was not indicative of off-target effects, as multiple siRNAs with distinct nucleic acid sequences yielded similar reductions. Moreover, the expression of SLC35G1 mRNA was reduced by these siRNAs, confirming successful silencing of SLC35G1 (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></italic>). The correlation between the decrease in citrate uptake and mRNA levels suggests that SLC35G1 is primarily involved in citrate uptake. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that endogenous SLC35G1 in polarized Caco-2 cells cultured on Transwell membranes was also localized on the basolateral membranes (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></italic>). Taken together, these results indicate that intestinal citrate transport at the basolateral membrane is primarily mediated by SLC35G1. Additionally, it acts cooperatively with NaDC1, which is reported to be highly expressed in the jejunum (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Pajor, 1995</xref></italic>), for citrate absorption on the apical membrane, as illustrated in <italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></italic>.</p>

<p>Our findings suggest that SLC35G1 is localized on the basolateral side of intestinal epithelial cells and, to our knowledge, is the first transporter identified with chloride-sensitivity, which is a unique characteristic to render with the directional transport function for an SLC transporter. These findings pave the way for several follow-up directions related to the molecular basis of the intestinal absorption of various compounds, including nutrients and drugs.</p>

<p>The cDNA for human SLC35G1 was cloned using a reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-based method, as previously described (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Mimura et al., 2017</xref></italic>). Briefly, an RT reaction was performed to obtain a cDNA mixture, using 1 μg of the human intestine total RNA (BioChain Institute, Newark, CA), an oligo(dT) primer, and the highly efficient reverse transcriptase ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The SLC35G1 cDNA was then amplified by PCR, using KOD plus polymerase (Toyobo) and the following primers: forward primer, 5′-GAGATGCGGCCTCAGGACAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TAGCCTCCCCACCCATATCCC-3′. These primers were designed based on the GenBank sequences for SCL35G1 (accession number: NM_001134658.2). The second PCR was performed using the initial PCR product as a template, with a forward primer containing an EcoRI restriction site (underlined), 5′-A<underline>GAATTC</underline>CGAGATGCGGCCTCAGGAC-3′, and a reverse primer containing an XbaI restriction site (underlined), 5′-GT<underline>TCTAGA</underline>TGTGTGCGTATGCTG-3′.

<title>Uptake study</title>
<p>First, we established MCDKII cells stably expressing SLC35G1 as previously described (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Yamamoto et al., 2010</xref></italic>). Briefly, MDCKII cells were transfected with the plasmid carrying the SLC35G1 cDNA, using Lipofectamine 2000 as a transfection reagent. The cells were then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 800 μg/mL G418 for 2–3 weeks. Subsequently, G418-resistant clones were selected and assessed for the transport of [<sup>14</sup>C]citrate. MDCKII cells stably expressing SLC35G1 with high citrate transport activity were used in subsequent studies.</p>
<p>MDCKII cells stably expressing SLC35G1 (1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL, 1 mL/well) were grown in 24-well plates for 48 h until they reached confluence. For standard transport assays, cells were preincubated in substrate-free uptake buffer, which was Hanks’ solution modified to reflect cytosolic conditions (142.06 mmol/L K-gluconate, 0.812 mmol/L MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.379 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.441 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.952 mM Ca-gluconate, 25 mM D-glucose) and supplemented with 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES; pH 5.5), for 5 min. Subsequently, uptake assays were initiated by replacing the substrate-free uptake buffer with an uptake buffer containing a [<sup>14</sup>C]citrate (0.25 mL). For initial uptake analysis experiments, the uptake period was set to 10 min in the initial phase, in which uptake was in proportion to time. Other experiments were conducted in a time-dependent manner, as specified. When examining the effects of various compounds on citrate uptake, the test compounds were added to the buffer only during the uptake period. All procedures were performed at 37°C. Assays were stopped by adding 2 mL of ice-cold substrate-free uptake buffer, followed by two washes with an additional 2 mL of the same buffer. The cells were solubilized in 0.5 mL of 0.2 mol/L NaOH solution containing 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and the associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting for uptake evaluation. The cellular protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method, using bovine serum albumin as the standard (3). In experiments to examine the effect of ionic conditions, K-gluconate in the control uptake solution was replaced as indicated. Uptake solutions were supplemented with 10 mM MES (pH 6.5 and below) or 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0 and above) in experiments to examine the effect of pH. In experiments to examine the effect of nigericin as an agent for intracellular acidification, a mannitol-based buffer (250 mM mannitol, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM D-glucose, 10 μM nigericin, and 20 mM MES) was used and uptake assays were conducted for 10 min at pH 5.5 and 37°C in the presence (10 μM) or absence (control) of nigericin after pretreatment for 5 min with or without nigericin under the same conditions. To estimate nonspecific uptake, uptake assays were conducted in mock cells transfected with an empty pCI-neo vector. The specific uptake of citrate by SLC35G1 was estimated by subtracting the uptake in mock cells from that in SLC35G1-transfected cells.</p>

<title>Transcellular transport study</title>
<p>MDCKII cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells on each polycarbonate membrane insert in a 12-well Transwell plate and cultured for 5 days. After removing the culture medium from both sides of the inserts, cells were preincubated for 5 min at 37°C in Hanks’ solution (136.7 mM NaCl, 5.36 mM KCl, 0.952 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.812 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.441 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.385 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, and 25 mM D-glucose) supplemented with 10 mM MES (pH 5.5) in the apical chamber and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) in the basolateral chamber. To initiate transcellular transport from the apical side to the basolateral side, 0.5 mL of the Hanks’ solution (pH 5.5) containing [<sup>14</sup>C]citrate was replaced in the apical chamber. For transport in the opposite direction (basolateral side to apical side), 1.5 mL of Hanks’ solution (pH 7.4) containing [<sup>14</sup>C]citrate was replaced in the basal chamber. To monitor transcellular transport, samples (100 μL from basal chamber and 50 μL from the apical chamber) were periodically collected, replenishing each collected volume with an equal volume of fresh buffer. At the end of the transport study, the assays were stopped by adding ice-cold Hanks’ solution (1 mL for the apical chamber and 3 mL for the basolateral chamber), followed by washing the cells twice with the same buffer. The cells were then solubilized in 0.5 mL of 0.2 M NaOH solution containing 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 1 h. The radioactivity associated with the cells was measured by liquid scintillation counting for uptake evaluation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The current manuscript provides strong evidence that the molecular function of SLC35G1, an orphan human SLC transporter, is citrate export at the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. Multiple lines of evidence, including radioactive transport experiments, immunohistochemical staining, gene expression analysis, and siRNA knockdown are combined to deduce a model of the physiological role of this transporter.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experimental approaches are comprehensive, and together establish a strong model for the role of SLC35G1 in citrate uptake. The observation that chloride inhibits uptake suggests an interesting mechanism that exploits the difference in chloride concentration across the basolateral membrane.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some aspects of the results would benefit from a more thorough discussion of the conclusions and/or model.</p>
<p>For example, the authors find that SLC35G1 prefers the dianionic (singly protonated) form of citrate, and rationalize this finding by comparison with the substrate selectivity of the citrate importer NaDC1. However, this comparison has weaknesses when considering the physiological pH for SLC35G1 and NaDC1. NaDC1 binds citrate at a pH of ~5.4 (the pKa of citrate is 5.4, so there is a lot of dianionic citrate present under physiological circumstances). SLC35G1 binds citrate under pH conditions of ~7.5, where a very small amount of dianionic citrate is present. The data clearly show a pH dependence of transport, and the authors rule out proton coupling, but the discrepancy between the pH dependence and the physiological expectations should be addressed/commented on.</p>
<p>The rationale for the series of compounds tested in Figure 1F, which includes metabolites with carboxylate groups, a selection of drugs including anion channel inhibitors and statins, and bile acids, is not described. Moreover, the lessons drawn from this experiment are vague and should be expanded upon. It is not clear what, if anything, the compounds that reduce citrate uptake have in common.</p>
<p>The transporter is described as a facilitative transporter, but this is not established definitively. For example, another possibility could involve coupling citrate transport to another substrate, possibly even chloride ion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The primary goal of this study was to identify the transport pathway that is responsible for the release of dietary citrate from enterocytes into blood across the basolateral membrane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The transport pathway responsible for the entry of dietary citrate into enterocytes was already known, but the transporter responsible for the second step remained unidentified. The studies presented in this manuscript identify SLC35G1 as the most likely transporter that mediates the release of absorbed citrate from intestinal cells into the serosal side. This fills an important gap in our current knowledge of the transcellular absorption of dietary citrate. The exclusive localization of the transporter in the basolateral membrane of human intestinal cells and the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 and the inhibition of the transporter function by chloride support this conclusion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(i) The substrate specificity experiments have been done with relatively low concentrations of potential competing substrates, considering the relatively low affinity of the transporter for citrate. Given that NaDC1 brings in not only citrate as a divalent anion but also other divalent anions such as succinate, it is possible that SLC35G1 is responsible for the release of not only citrate but also other dicarboxylates. But the substrate specificity studies show that the dicarboxylates tested did not compete with citrate, meaning that SLc35G1 is selective for the citrate (2-), but this conclusion might be flawed because of the low concentration of the competing substrates used in the experiment.</p>
<p>(ii) The authors have used MDCK cells for assessment of the transcellular transfer of citrate via SLC35G1, but it is not clear whether this cell line expresses NaDC1 in the apical membrane as the enterocytes do. Even though the authors expressed SLC35G1 ectopically in MDCK cells and showed that the transporter localizes to the basolateral membrane, the question as to how citrate actually enters the apical membrane for SLC35G1 in the other membrane to work remains unanswered.</p>
<p>(iii) There is one other transporter that has already been identified for the efflux of citrate in some cell types in the literature (SLC62A1, PLoS Genetics; 10.1371/journal.pgen.1008884), but no mention of this transporter has been made in the current manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mimura et al describe the discovery of the orphan transporter SLC35G1 as a citrate transporter in the small intestine. Using a combination of cellular transport assays, they show that SLC35G1 can mediate citrate transport in small intestinal cell lines. Furthermore, they investigate its expression and localization in both human tissue and cell lines. Limited evidence exists to date on both SLC35G1 and citrate uptake in the small intestine, therefore this study is an important contribution to both fields. However, the main claims by the authors are only partially supported by experimental evidence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors convincingly show that SLC35G1 mediates uptake of citrate which is dependent on pH and chloride concentration. Putting their initial findings in a physiological context, they present human tissue expression data of SLC35G. Their Transwell assay indicates that SLC35G1 is a citrate exporter at the basolateral membrane.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Further confirmation and clarification are required to claim that the SLC indeed exports citrate at the basolateral membrane as concluded by the authors. Most experiments measure citrate uptake, but the authors state that SLC35G1 is an exporter, mostly based on the lack of uptake at physiological conditions faced at the basolateral side. The Transwell assay in Figure 1L is the only evidence that it indeed is an exporter. However, in this experiment, the applied chloride concentration was not according to the proposed model (120mM at the basolateral side). The Transwell assay, or a similar assay measuring export instead of import, should be carried out in knockdown cells to prove that the export indeed occurs through SLC35G1 and not through an indirect effect. Related to the mentioned chloride sensitivity, it is unclear how the proposed model works if the SLC faces high chloride conditions under physiological conditions though it is inhibited by chloride.</p>
