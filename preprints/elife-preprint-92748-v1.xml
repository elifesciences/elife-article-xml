<title>Abstract</title><p>The cerebral cortex, which is responsible for higher cognitive functions, relies on the coordinated asymmetric division cycles of polarized radial glial progenitor cells for proper development. Defects in the mitotic process of neuronal stem cells have been linked to the underlying causes of microcephaly; however, the exact mechanisms involved are not fully understood. In this study, we present a new discovery regarding the role of the membrane-deforming cytoskeletal regulator protein called Abba (also known as MTSS1L/MTSS2) in cortical development. When Abba was absent in the developing brain, it led to a halt in radial glial cell proliferation, disorganized radial fibers, and abnormal migration of neuronal progenitors. During cell division, Abba localized to the cleavage furrow, where it recruited the scaffolding protein Nedd9, and positively influenced the activity of RhoA, a crucial regulator of cell division. Notably, we identified a variant of Abba (R671W) in a patient with microcephaly and intellectual disability, further highlighting its significance. The introduction of this mutant Abba protein in mice resulted in phenotypic similarities to the effects of Abba knockdown. Overall, these findings offer valuable mechanistic insights into the development of microcephaly and the cerebral cortex by identifying Abba as a novel regulator involved in ensuring the accurate progression of mitosis in neuronal progenitor cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Development of the central nervous system occurs by proliferation of neural progenitor cells, migration and differentiation of their progeny over substantial distance. These different steps require extensive membrane remodelling and cytoskeleton dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Neuronal migration involves the coordinated extension and adhesion of the leading process along the radial glial scaffold with the forward translocation of the nucleus, which requires regulation of centrosome and microtubule dynamics by different proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying membrane dynamics during neuronal migration and morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Cell membrane curvature is a micro-morphological change involved in many important cellular processes including endocytosis, exocytosis, and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Recent studies demonstrated that members of an extended protein family, characterized by the presence of a membrane binding and deforming BAR (Bin–Amphiphysin–Rvs) domain function at the interface between the actin cytoskeleton and plasma membrane during the formation of membrane protrusions or invaginations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. These proteins have been shown to be important for proper neuronal morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and can either generate positive membrane curvature to facilitate the formation of plasma membrane invaginations (e.g. BAR, N-BAR and F-BAR domain proteins), or induce negative membrane curvature to promote the formation of plasma membrane protrusions (I-BAR and IF-BAR domain proteins)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. An important part of the membrane deforming mechanism include the interaction with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate PI(4,5)P2-rich membranes through their BAR domain and also with actin cytoskeleton through Wasp Homology-2 domain (WH2).</p>
<p>Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in several developmentally important cellular processes including neuronal migration, axonal and dendritic extension and guidance, and dendritic spines formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. We previously discovered that MIM (Missing-In-Metastasis; Mtss1), a member of the I-BAR protein family, has an important role in bending the dendritic plasma membrane in order to form dendritic spines and sculpt their morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In a more recent study, a closely related protein Abba (Mtss1L) was found to be important for exercise induced increase synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Although an important role of MIM and Abba in synapse formation and plasticity starts to emerge, information about the role of the early expression of this protein family during development is poor.</p>
<p>Mutations in BAR domain proteins are increasingly found in mental retardation disorders. For instance, altered expression and mutation of F-BAR family proteins, SrGAP2 &amp; 3, are known to be associated to neurological disorders (mental retardation, the 3p syndrome, schizophrenia, early infantile epileptic encephalopathy and severe psychomotor delay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>). Furthermore, previous whole-exome sequencing of pre-screened multiplex consanguineous families identified <italic>ABBA</italic> as a likely candidate linked to neurogenic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, suggesting that some BAR containing proteins might play important functions during brain development. Despite Abba’s potential role in neuronal development, very little is known about how this protein may lead to neurological pathology.</p>
<p>Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and plasma membrane dynamics in glial cells of the developing brain has remained poorly understood. Interestingly, the I-BAR protein Abba is the only glia-enriched regulator that has been reported so far<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We sought to determine the consequences of altered expression of <italic>Abba</italic> in radial glial progenitor (RGP) cells on cell cycle progression and neurogenesis and to test for subsequent neuronal migration. To address these issues, we used <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation to silence <italic>Abba</italic> with shRNA in embryonic mouse brains. Downregulation of Abba’s expression had a striking effect on RGP cells progression, resulting in a blocking of cytokinesis and a subsequent apoptosis. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the cytokinesis block was due to an absence of interaction with the adhesion docking protein named Nedd9 (aka CAS-L or HEF1) that is well known to be a positive regulator of RhoA signaling in mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Using FRET based monitoring of RhoA activity, we also found a significant role of Abba on RhoA activity. Moreover, we observed a defect in neuronal migration associated with an increase in neuronal apoptosis. Importantly, we identified one patient harboring a missense variant in <italic>ABBA</italic> sequence and showing specific features such as: small head circumference, mental retardation, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and craniofacial dysmorphism. We provide evidence that the (2011C&gt;T(R671W)) patient mutation likely represents a dominant loss-of-function allele.</p>
<p>Overall, our data highlights the critical role of <italic>Abba</italic> in proper cortical development in neurogenesis and migration, and provides the first evidence that <italic>ABBA</italic> is a new causative gene for cortical malformation associated with ASD.</p>

<title>Plasmids construction</title>
<p>We utilized a single short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that targeted the coding sequence for Abba20. It is worth noting that the rat and mouse Abba sequences share a high degree of similarity, with a 95% homology. The specific region targeted by the shRNA displayed 100% homology. Both Abba and Nedd9 shRNA were designed using the siRNA Wizard Software (InvivoGen ©). As a negative control, we employed a non-targeting shRNA.</p>
<p>These shRNAs were subcloned into an mU6pro vector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Additionally, a pCAG-RFP vector was co-injected to facilitate the visualization of fluorescent cells. Abba mouse full length with silent mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, ABBA human full length and human ABBA-R671W carrying vectors were made by GeneCust© (France) and subcloned into the pCAGIG-IRES-GFP vector (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA).</p>

<title>Bioinformatic methods</title>
<p>ABBA coding sequences were obtained from NCBI. The multiple sequence comparison was done by Log-Expectation (MUSCLE) method and visualized with DNASTAR MegAlign Pro. The impact of ABBA R671W on the structure and function of a human ABBA protein was predicted using PolyPhen-2 and HumVar model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Human subjects</title>
<p>Families were identified through our clinical and research programs, personal communication, as well as the MatchMaker Exchange (MME) including GeneMatcher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genematcher.org">http://www.genematcher.org</ext-link>). Informed consent for publication and analysis of photos, imaging and clinical data was obtained from the patients’ legal guardians. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed on the subject and reviewed by the investigators in accordance with Department Ethical permission number (MEC-2012387) to conduct human exome studies.</p>

<title>RhoA activity assay</title>
<p>Fluorescence from Raichu-Rac1 was imaged using a confocal microscope (LSM 710/Axio; Carl Zeiss) controlled by ZEN 2011 software (Carl Zeiss) and equipped with water immersion objective (63×/1.0 NA; Carl Zeiss). Transfected cells were illuminated with an argon laser (Lasos; Lasertechnik GmbH) at 458 nm (CFP and FRET) and 514 nm (YFP) using 0.5–10% of full laser power. Emission was collected at 461–519 nm (CFP) and 519–621 nm (FRET and YFP). The pinhole was fully opened. Scanning was performed in XY mode using 6× digital zoom that resulted in a pixel XY size of 68 × 68 nm. FRET signal was calculated as reported elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In brief, using ImageJ 1.48v software images where background subtracted and FRET image generated using three images: MDonor (CFP excitation and CFP emission filters), MIndirectAcceptor (CFP excitation and YFP emission filters), and MDirectAcceptor (YFP excitation and YFP emission filters), using the following equation: FRET = (MIndirectAcceptor − MDonor × β − MDirectAcceptor × (γ − αβ))/(1 − βδ). Coefficients α, β, δ, and γ were obtained by independent control experiments analyzing cells expressing CFP or YFP as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Coefficients α, δ, and γ were determined in cells expressing only YFP (acceptor) and calculated according to equations: α = MDonor/MDirectAcceptor; γ = MIndirectAcceptor/MDirectAcceptor; δ = MDonor/MIndirectAcceptor. Coefficient β was determined in cells expressing only CFP (donor) and calculated according to the equation: β = MIndirectAcceptor/MDonor. After generation of FRET image, intensity of FRET signal was calculated using a mask obtained from a corresponding YFP image and covering neuronal cell bodies. The images were also analysed using Pix-Fret<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup></p>

<title><italic>In Utero</italic> Electroporation</title>
<p>Animal experiments were performed in agreement with European directive 2010/63/UE and received approval N°: APAFIS#2797 from the French Ministry for Research and in agreement with the National Animal Experiment Board, Finland (license number ESAVI/18276/2018).Plasmids were transfected using intraventricular injection followed by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Timed pregnant C57BL6N mice (Janvier Labs; E14; E0 was defined as the day of confirmation of sperm-positive vaginal plug) received buprenorphine (Buprecare,0.03 mg/kg) and were anesthetized with sevoflurane/isoflurane (4%-4.5% induction, 2%-anaesthesia maintenance) 30 minutes later. For pain management, bupivacaine (2 mg/kg) was administered via a subcutaneous injection at the site of the future incision. Uterine horns were exposed, the lateral ventricle of each embryo was injected using pulled glass capillaries and a microinjector (Picospritzer II; General Valve Corporation, Fairfield, NJ, USA) with Fast Green (2 mg/ml; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) combined with the different DNA constructs at 1.5 μg/μl or with 1.5 μg/μl shRNA constructs together with 0.5 μg/μl pCAGGS-RFP. Plasmids were further electroporated by discharging a 4000 mF capacitor charged to 50V with a BTX ECM 830 electroporator (BTX Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). The voltage was discharged in five electrical pulses at 950ms intervals via 5mm tweezer-type electrodes laterally pinching the head of each embryo through the uterus. The mice were followed-up post-surgically and given buprenorphine (Buprecare 0.03 mg/kg) if needed. The number of animals has been calculated on the basis of the requirement for adequate numbers of brain slices and sections for sufficient imaging to provide statistically significant data on the effects of RNAi, small molecules, and other reagents used in the proposed analysis, plus controls.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Organotypic cultures and Live Imaging</title>
<p>To assess the impact of altered ABBA expression in the RGP cells on neurogenesis and cell cycle progression, we utilized a combination of <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation and time-lapse imaging of organotypic cultures. The organotypic cultures were prepared as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> with the following exceptions. After surrounding the brains (E17) with 4.5% UltraPure Low Melting Point Agarose (Invitrogen, 16520-100), 350 μm thick slices were cut with Vibratome 1000 Plus Sectioning System (No. 054018). Before placing the slices on a coated (83 µg/ml Laminin, Sigma L2020; 8,3 µg/ml Poly-L-Lysine, Sigma P4707) cell culture insert (Millicell, PICMORG50), sections were carefully cleaned from agarose to ensure adequate oxygenation. The inserts with slice cultures were transferred into a 6-well plate containing 1 ml of warmed slice culture medium. For live-imaging we used Andor Dragonfly 550 high speed Spinning Disc confocal equipped with Nikon Perfect Focus System, motorized XY stage, and environmental chamber. The system uses Fusion 2.0 software (version 2.1.0.48). The image acquisition was executed using Andor iXon 888 U3 EMCCD camera, 20x magnification with voxel size 0.65 x 0.65 x 0.9524 micron^3 (channel/excitation: RFP/561 nm, GFP/488 nm). Time lapse-imaging of organotypic cultures was started at E17+DIV0 with intervals of 10 minutes and total duration of 15 hours. The data was collected from 6 pups (2 scramble, 4 shRNA), 17 slices (5 scramble, 12 shRNA) and 24 areas (9 scramble, 15 shRNA; some slices were recorded from two different areas).</p>

<title>Immunostaining of Brain Slices</title>
<p>Mice brains were fixed (E17) in Antigen Fix (Diapath), Brain slices were sectioned coronally (80μm) on a vibratome (Leica microsystems). Brain slices were washed with PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4) and stained in PBS 0.3% Triton X-100 supplemented with 5% of donkey serum. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C, sections were then washed with PBS and incubated in secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature. Antibodies used in this study were: Abba (homemade), Vimentin (Millipore, MAB3400), Ki67 (Millipore, AB9260), phospho-histone H3 (Abcam, ab14955), Pax6 (biolegend, PRB-278P).</p>

<title>Cells culture and transfection</title>
<p>Rat C6 glioma cells were cultured at 37°C under a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 with a complete medium DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma) and 100 units/mL antibiotics/antimycotics. Cells were transfected using the Neon® Transfection System (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were trypsinized and counted with the cell counter SCEPTER (Millipore). Electroporation was performed with 500 000 cells and a total amount of 5 µg of DNA containing a reporter plasmid encoding RFP (1:5) and shRNAs or mismatch constructs, with the following configuration: 1860 V, 1 pulse, 20 ms. Cells were then cultured on a 6 wells plate during 2 days before RNA extraction.</p>

<title>RT-PCR and qPCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from C6 using RNeasy Plus Mini kit and cDNA was synthesized using the Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (QIAGEN). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on a Light cycler 480 using SYBR-Green chemistry (Roche) and specific primers for Abba (F: CGAGACTCGCTGCAGTATTCC and R: CCATTCACAGAGTAGCAGTCG, 113 bp), Nedd9 (Qiagen, QT01610385) and CyclophilinA (Qiagen, QT00177394) as a control probe. qPCR was performed with 5 µL of diluted cDNA template, specific primers (0.6 µM) and SYBR Green I Master Mix (7.5 µL) at a final volume of 15 µL.

<title><italic>Abba</italic> knockdown disrupted radial glia morphology</title>
<p>Previous studies of the expression pattern of <italic>Abba</italic> in the developing brain has disclosed a conspicuous expression in radial glia. In order to investigate the function of <italic>Abba</italic> in the developing brain, we used a mouse <italic>in utero</italic> RNAi approach to knockdown <italic>Abba</italic> at E14. For this purpose, we opted for shRNA knockdown using a previously validated targeting sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Revalidation of the knockdown efficiency of this target with three different Abba-shRNA (Abba-shRNA1-3) in rat C6 glioma cells showed a 70– 80% reduction of Abba mRNA and protein levels with Abba-shRNA3 (Supplemental Figure 1, Abba-shRNA3).</p>
<p>To determine whether knockdown of Abba expression alters neuronal migration, Abba-shRNA3 combined with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) construct was introduced into neural progenitor cells of mouse neocortex by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation at E14 and evaluated at E16-18 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Electroporation of E14 targets the progenitors that will migrate and populate cortical layers II/III neurons. In E17 brain sections, we observed that some neurons previously electroporated at 3 days earlier with the scrambled construct reached the cortical plate as expected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). However, <italic>in utero</italic> expression of Abba-shRNA3 induced a significant arrest of cells within the ventricular zone (VZ) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>; scramble: 24,3 ± 6.4%; n=9, Abba-shRNA3: 63,7 ± 2,9%; p&lt;0.0001; n=8). Surprisingly, we also observed a striking decrease in the total number of RFP positive cells in brain sections electroporated with Abba-shRNA3 at E17 and E18 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>; scramble: 969,2±109.0 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>; n=9, Abba-shRNA3: 311,3±28,61 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>; p&lt;0.0001; n=8).

<p>We also evaluated the impact of <italic>Abba</italic> knockdown on radial glial morphology by imaging vimentin-stained <italic>Abba</italic> knockdown cells at 3 days post-electroporation.

Control vimentin-positive cells displayed the characteristic features and polarized morphology of radial glia with processes extending from the VZ to the pial surface. In contrast, in <italic>Abba</italic> knockdown brains, vimentin-positive cells exhibited misoriented apical processes, detached end feet in the ventricular surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) and decreased number of radial glial progenitor cells in the VZ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>; scramble: 126,5 ± 13,4 cells, n=8; Abba-shRNA3: 65,1 ± 26,2 cells, n=7; p=0.0033).

<title>ABBA is required for cell cycle progression of radial glia progenitors</title>
<p>Development of the cerebral cortex occurs through a series of stages, beginning with RGPs.

RGP cells undergo mitosis only when they reach the SVZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.

<p>To test the effect of altered radial glial cell morphology on cell cycle progression, we have quantified the nuclear distance from the VS for RGP cells after electroporation of scrambled or Abba RNAi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).

More detailed examination of the impact of Abba-shRNA3 on cell cycle progression using flow cytometry showed an accumulation in S phase. Interestingly, these effect was rescued by overexpression of Abba-FL (Supplemental fig 2 G1: scramble: 45,2 ± 1,4 %, Abba-shRNA3: 37,4 ± 1,0 %, Abba-shRNA3+Abba-FL: 42,8 ± 1.3 %; S: scramble: 34,3 ± 2,8 %, Abba-shRNA3: 48,2 ± 2.7 %, Abba-shRNA3+Abba-FL: 38,9 ± 3.4; G2: scramble: 17,1 ± 2,1 %, Abba-shRNA3: 14,4 ± 2,7%, Abba-shRNA3+Abba-FL: 15,9 ± 1,9 %; n=10; p=&lt;0.001).

<p>We first tested whether Abba and Nedd9 physically interact, as suggested by the Y2H screen. To this end, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments from embryonic day 18 cortical tissue as well as C6 cells using anti-Nedd9 as well as anti-Abba antibodies. The precipitated Nedd9-Abba complex was separated on SDS-page and followed by western blot with anti-Abba and anti-Nedd9 antibodies respectively. Indeed, Abba precipitated with Nedd9 in both directions, but not using control beads from brain cortex homogenates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) and C6 cells (Supplemental figure 3). Nedd9 stability is not affected by the availability of Abba as western blots show no changes in Nedd9 expression levels in Abba-shRNA3 expressing cells (data not shown). Interestingly however, when we analyzed the localization of Nedd9, we found that Abba was required for targeting Nedd9 to the cleavage furrow/cytokinetic bridge (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).

We used a previously characterised Nedd9-shRNA to determine whether knockdown of Nedd9 expression alters RGP cells morphology and function. To this end, Nedd9-shRNA combined with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) construct was introduced into neural progenitor cells of mouse neocortex by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation at E14 and stained with the radial glial cell marker, vimentin. Interestingly, similarly to Abba knockdown, Nedd9 downregulation resulted in disruption of INM as a larger portion of progenitors accumulated close to the ventricular surface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-F</xref>; scramble: 25 ± 2.30% n=8, Nedd9-shRNA: 46.92±2.78%; n=7; p=&lt;0.0001). Using the late G2/M phases marker, PH3, we observed similar results as with Abba shRNA and point mutation no difference in number of PH3 positive cells (Supplemental figure 3C; scramble: 4.50 ± 0.18%, n=9; Nedd9-shRNA: 5.07 ± 0.35%, n=6, P=0,1135). The role of Nedd9 in cell cycle progression is consistent with previous published results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and provide evidence that both Abba and Nedd9 function to ensure correct mitotic completion of RGP cells.</p>
<p>Finally, to determine whether Abba is important for Nedd9 activity and how Abba and Nedd9 converge to regulate the cell-cycle, we assessed the activity of RhoA, a downstream signalling molecule of Nedd9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> which is important for cytokinetic actomyosin ring assembly and dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. To determine RhoA activity we used a GFP-based FRET construct for RhoA designated ‘‘Ras and interacting protein chimeric unit’’ Raichu-RhoA. In order to test the efficacy of the assay we used Calpeptin, a RhoA activator which, as expected, increased RhoA activity (% change compared to Raichu-RhoA: Calpeptin 132,2 ± 3,2 n=33; p=0.002) confirming the functionality of our assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, when Abba was silenced by shRNA there was a significant 31,5% decrease in Raichu-RhoA activity as compared to the control shRNA treated cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; scramble: 103,1.03 ± 5.3; n=102, Abba-shRNA3: 68,5 ± 2,3; n=46; p&lt;0.0001). In addition, this effect was rescued by the co-expression of shRNA insensitive plasmid carrying the full-length sequence of Abba (Abba-shRNA + Abba-FL 139,8 ± 19,6 n=26; p&lt;0.0001 compared to Abba-shRNA3). Abba-FL did not change RhoA activity significantly compare to scramble expressing cells (Abba-FL 105,2 ± 16,0; n=37). These data provide support for the function of Abba in spatial assembly of cytokinetic signaling through the Nedd9-RhoA axis.</p>

<title>Identification of <italic>ABBA</italic> missense variant R671W in an individual with neurodevelopmental syndrome</title>
<p>Mutations in genes effecting mitotic progression of neuronal progenitors have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Importantly, we identified a patient carrying a novel heterozygous missense variant in <italic>ABBA</italic> coding <italic>MTSS1l/MTSS2</italic> gene. This mutation (2011C&gt;T(R671W)) affects residues that are conserved from Zebrafish to Human and reside in exon 15 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">B</xref>). Consistent with a d<italic>e novo</italic> origin of the variant, it was not found in the parents of the affected individual or in normal controls.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging sequences showed the presence of a microcephalic brain associated with a smaller head linked to mild IQ. The patient also suffered from Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, Supplemental Table 1).

<title>Expression of R671W Human variant results in defects in mitosis and neuronal migration</title>
<p>To test the effects of the human missense variant in mouse brain development, we introduced the human <italic>ABBA</italic> cDNA encoding either wild type or patient mutation R671W into developing mouse brains by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation at E14 followed by imaging and quantification of targeted cell at E17. Interestingly, whereas wild type ABBA (ABBA-FL) expression showed no defects in radial glial morphology or neuronal migration, the R671W mutant expression resulted in disorganized radial glial fibers and accumulation of multipolar neurons in the SVZ/lower IZ with very few bipolar neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). When analyzing the distribution of electroporated neuron progenitors, we observed clear accumulation in the VZ/SVZ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>; ABBA-FL 18.67±1.44%; n=8, ABBA-R671W 39.77±2.73% n=6; P=0.0001). We also found a significant increase in RGP nuclei at the VS of the brain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, C ABBA-FL 32.56±2.58%; n=8, ABBA-R671W 50,04±2.04%; n =6; p=0.000001. Interestingly, no difference in accumulation of PH3+ cells was found (Supplemental Figure 3 B and C; Abba-human-WT 4.50 ± 0.17%; n=9, Abba-human-mutation 4.71 ± 1.98%; p=0.76; n=5), indicative of a dysfunction in neuronal maturation but a less prominent impact on cell division. In line with these results the effect of ABBA-R671W on RhoA activation was not significantly different to scramble expressing cells (142 ± 17,9 n=15). The data presented indicate that the abnormal expression of the R671W mutation, rather than the normal protein, leads to abnormal development of the developing cortex. These findings offer evidence suggesting a potential connection between the missense mutation in ABBA discovered in the patient and abnormal brain development. However, it is unlikely that the mechanism behind this phenotype is a result of ABBA-R671W acting in a dominant-negative manner on cell cycle progression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Abba was initially discovered as a novel regulator of actin and plasma membrane dynamics, specifically in radial glial C6 cells. However, its role in brain radial glial progenitor (RGP) cells in live organisms has remained unclear. In this study, we observed that decreased expression of Abba in radial glia within the cortical ventricular zone leads to impaired radial migration and disrupted organization of radial glia. Notably, knock-down of Abba specifically hindered cytokinesis in RGP cells, resulting in abnormal cell morphology, mitosis, and reduced numbers of glial and neuronal cells. The underlying mechanism behind this effect appears to involve impaired signaling through the actin regulatory protein RhoA, likely through its interaction with Nedd9 during the early and late stages of telophase. In accordance with these findings, we identified a missense variant in a patient with microcephaly and intellectual disability exhibiting similar clinical characteristics. Furthermore, overexpression of the mutant protein in cortical progenitors of mice resulted in phenotypes resembling, although not identical to, the down-regulation of <italic>Abba</italic> in the cortex. The results presented in this study highlight the critical importance of <italic>Abba</italic> in cortical development and contribute to elucidating the potential mechanism underlying abnormal brain development associated with human variants of <italic>ABBA</italic>.</p>

<title>Radial glial exiting from cytokinesis requires Abba</title>
<p>BAR proteins can interact with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-rich membranes through their BAR domain, and several studies indicate that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> play a central role in cytokinesis. Indeed, it has been reported that in mammalian cells PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> accumulates at the cleavage furrow and recruits membrane proteins required for stability of the furrow because of a role in adhesion between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane. Moreover, overexpression of proteins that bind to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> perturbs cytokinesis completion, by interfering with adhesion of the plasma membrane to the contractile ring at the furrow, but not ingression of the cleavage furrow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Immunocytochemistry of Abba shows a strong accumulation at the cleavage furrow. In addition, in absence of Abba, we observed an accumulation of cells blocked in cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). these observations and previous findings showing that Abba can interact with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-rich membranes through its BAR domain as well as with the actin cytoskeleton through Wasp Homology-2 domain (WH2), lead us suspect that Abba could link the actin contractile ring to the plasma membrane and participate in the mechanism for the invagination of the nuclear membrane during cytokinesis.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Abba interacts with Nedd9 to regulate RhoA activity</title>
<p>Here we have found that Abba interacts directly with Nedd9 and down regulation of Abba leads to significant changes in RhoA activation. Nedd9 is a focal adhesion protein involved in mitotic entry and cleavage furrow ingression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Similar to the results found in this study, previous results have shown that cells with abnormal expression of Nedd9 remain in G1 subsequently leading to cell apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. This is consistent with the view that Nedd9 triggers cells to enter mitosis. Nedd9 is known to be a positive regulator of RhoA signaling in mitosis. Indeed, activation of RhoA is required for cell rounding at early stages of mitosis and cleavage furrow ingression, and deactivation of RhoA is essential for cell abscission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, it has been shown that Nedd9 overexpression blocks cells at abscission by maintaining levels of RhoA activation, and decreased Nedd9 expression inhibits cleavage furrow ingression by non-activated RhoA pathway. In light of these results, we hypothesized that during cytokinesis at the cleavage furrow the membrane composition change and is enriched in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> leading to Abba recruitment and its interaction with Nedd9 which is essential to activate the RhoA pathway cleavage furrow ingression.</p>

<title>Role of ABBA in neuronal migration and microcephaly</title>
<p>The proper formation of the cerebral cortex relies on the sequential generation of cortical layers, which is highly dependent on the normal production, survival, and migration of neuronal progenitors. Abnormalities in these processes are associated with pathological conditions such as microcephaly, leading to impaired cognitive development. Interestingly, both downregulation of <italic>Abba</italic> and overexpression of the <italic>ABBA</italic> point mutation construct result in a similar accumulation of neuronal progenitors in the ventricular zone (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ). This may be attributed to abnormal proliferation of neuronal progenitors caused by disrupted interaction with critical proteins involved in cell cycle progression. This disruption aligns with the hypothesized impact on Nedd9 interaction and reduced RhoA activity observed in conditions of low Abba expression.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for these results could be the disruption of the predicted local tertiary structure. In this scenario, heterozygous expression of the human R671W variant would exert a dominant negative effect on <italic>ABBA</italic>’s role in brain development, leading to microcephaly and cognitive delay. This notion is supported by recent work disclosing additional patient carrying the R671W variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. In the same study the significant neurological phenotypes were observed in a drosophila model where the ortholog of human MTSS2 and MTSS1 mim was deleted. However, from a clinical genetics’ standpoint, it is unlikely to find patients with the recurrent R671W mutation without any homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations elsewhere in the <italic>ABBA</italic> gene. This could also suggest a gain-of-function effect of the R671W mutation. Supporting this notion, overexpressing ABBA-R671W in cells expressing the wild-type <italic>Abba in this study</italic> did not result in a dominant-negative decrease in RhoA activation, nor did it affect the expression of PH3 <italic>in vivo</italic>. These findings make is plausible to suggest that a mechanism responsible for the phenotype associated with overexpression of the human variant may primarily involve post-cell division processes, such as cell migration.</p>
<p>Although previous research has indicated that <italic>Abba</italic> is not expressed in mature neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, more recent studies have shown transient expression of <italic>Abba</italic> in neurons during conditions of increased neuronal plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. While our study primarily focused on Abba’s role in radial glial cell proliferation, the data also indicate an additional role in the migration of immature neurons. This is supported by the observed accumulation of Abba-shRNA3 electroporated cells in the ventricular zone. Additionally, we observed a significant decrease in process length in migrating cortical neurons with downregulated Abba and expressing ABBA-R671W mutant but interestingly dendritic processes were increased in length in neurons overexpressing <italic>ABBA</italic> (Supplemental Figure 4). Given that disorganization of radial glial progenitor cells does not lead to neuronal cell death, these findings suggest that Abba may be involved in additional molecular mechanisms in differentiated neurons. Further experiments are needed to determine whether this phenotype is intrinsic to Abba’s role in migrating neurons or if it is influenced by the disruption of guiding radial glia.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides compelling evidence for the significant role of <italic>Abba</italic> in brain development. We demonstrate that Abba’s involvement in the cell division of radial glial progenitors is a key component of this mechanism. Furthermore, these findings have translational relevance as they contribute to a better understanding of the putative mechanisms underlying human variants associated with microcephaly and developmental disabilities.</p>

<p>The manuscript investigates the role of the membrane-deforming cytoskeletal regulator protein Abba in cortical development and its potential implications for microcephaly. It is a valuable contribution to the understanding of Abba's role in cortical development. The strengths and weaknesses identified in the manuscript are outlined below:</p>
<p>Clinical Relevance:</p>
<p>The authors identified a patient with microcephaly and a patient with an intellectual disability harboring a mutation in the Abba variant (R671W) adding a clinically relevant dimension to the study.</p>
<p>Mechanistic Insights:</p>
<p>The study offers valuable mechanistic insights into the development of microcephaly by elucidating the role of Abba in radial glial cell proliferation, radial fiber organization, and the migration of neuronal progenitors. The identification of Abba's involvement in the cleavage furrow during cell division, along with its interaction with Nedd9 and positive influence on RhoA activity, adds depth to our understanding of the molecular processes governing cortical development. Though the reported results establish the novel interaction between Abba and Nedd9, the authors have not addressed whether the mutant protein loses this interaction and whether that results in the observed effects.</p>
<p>In Vivo Validation:</p>
<p>The overexpression of mutant Abba protein (R671W) resulting in phenotypic similarities to Abba knockdown effects supports the significance of Abba in cortical development.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Carabalona and colleagues investigated the role of the membrane-deforming cytoskeletal regulator protein Abba (MTSS1L/MTSS2) in cortical development to better understand the mechanisms of abnormal neural stem cell mitosis. The authors used short hairpin RNA targeting Abba20 with a fluorescent reporter coupled with in-utero electroporation of E14 mice to show changes to neural progenitors. They performed flow cytometry for in-depth cell cycle analysis of Abba-shRNA impact on neural progenitors and determined an accumulation in the S phase. Using culture rat glioma cells and live imaging from cortical organotypic slides from mice in utero electroporated with Abba-shRNA, the authors found Abba played a prominent role in cytokinesis. They then used a yeast-two-hybrid screen to identify three high-confidence interactors: Beta-Trcp2, Nedd9, and Otx2. They used immunoprecipitation experiments from E18 cortical tissue coupled with C6 cells to show Abba's requirement for Nedd9 localization to the cleavage furrow/cytokinetic bridge. The authors performed a shRNA knockdown of Nedd9 by in-utero electroporation of E14 mice and observed similar results as with the Abba-shRNA. They tested a human variant of Abba using in-utero electroporation of cDNA and found disorganized radial glial fibers and misplaced, multipolar neurons, but lacked the impact of cell division seen in the shRNA-Abba model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A fundamental question in biology about the mechanics of neural stem cell division.</p>
<p>Directly connecting effects in Abba protein to downstream regulation of RhoA via Nedd9.</p>
<p>Incorporation of human mutation in ABBA gene.</p>
<p>Use of novel technologies in neurodevelopment and imaging.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unexplored components of the pathway (such as what neurogenic populations are impacted by Abba mutation) and unleveraged aspects of their data (such as the live imaging) limit the scope of their findings and leave significant questions about the effect of ABBA on radial glia development.</p>
<p>(1) The claim of disorganized radial glial fibers lacks quantifications.</p>
<p>
On page 11, the authors claim that knockdown of Abba leads to changes in radial glial morphology observed with vimentin staining. Here they claim misoriented apical processes, detached end feet, and decreased number of RGP cells in the VZ. However, they do not provide quantification of process orientation to better support their first claim. Measurements of radial glia fiber morphology (directionality, length) and angle of division would be metrics that can be applied to data. Some of these analyses could be done in their time-lapse microscopy images, such as to quantify the number of cell divisions during their period of analysis (though that is short-15 hours).</p>
<p>(2) It is unclear where the effect is:</p>
<p>-In RG or neuroblasts? Is it in cell cleavage that results in the accumulation of cells at VZ (as sometimes indicated by their data like in Figure 2A or 4D)? Interrogation of cell death (such as by cleaved caspase 3) would also help. Given their time-lapse, can they identify what is happening to the RG fiber? The authors describe a change in &quot;migration&quot; but do not show evidence for this for either progenitor or neuroblast populations. Given they have nice time-lapse imaging data, could they visualize progenitor versus young neuron migration? Analysis of neuroblasts (such as with doublecortin expression in the tissue) would also help understand any issues in migration (of neurons v stem cells).</p>
<p>-At cleavage furrow? In abscission? There is high-resolution data that highlights the cleavage furrow as the location of interest (Figure 3A), however, there is also data (Figure 3B) to suggest Abba is expressed elsewhere as well and there is an overall soma decrease. More detail of the localization of Abba during the division process would be helpful for example, could cleavage furrow proteins, such as Aurora B, co-localization (and potentially co-IP) help delineate subpopulations of Abba protein? Furthermore, the FRET imaging is a unique way to connect their mutation with function - could they measure/quantify differences at furrow compared to the rest of soma to further corroborate that the Abba-associated RhoA effect was furrow-enriched?</p>
<p>-The data highlights nicely that a furrow doesn't clearly form when ABBA expression and subsequent RhoA activity are decreased (in Figure 3 or 5A). Does this lead to cells that can't divide because of poor abscission, especially since &quot;rounding&quot; still occurs? Or abnormal progenitors (with loss of fiber or inability to support neuroblast migration)? Or abnormal progression of progenitors to neuroblasts?</p>
<p>(3) Limited to a singular time point of mouse cortical development</p>
<p>On page 13, the authors outline the results of their Y2H screen with the identification of three high-confidence interactors. Notably, they used an E10.5-E12.5 mouse brain embryo library rather than one that includes E14, the age of their in-utero electroporation mice. Many of the authors' claims focus on in-utero electroporation of shRNA-Abba of E14 mice that are then evaluated at E16-18. Justification for the focus on this age range should be included to support that their findings can then be applied to all mouse corticogenesis.</p>
<p>(4) Detail of the effect of the human variant of the ABBA mutation in mice is lacking.</p>
<p>Their identification of the R671W mutation is interesting and the IUE model warrants more characterization, as they did with their original KD experiments.</p>
<p>-Could they show that Abba protein levels are decreased (in either cell lines or electroporated tissue)?</p>
<p>-While time-lapse morphology might not have been performed, more analysis on cell division phenotype (such as plane of division and radial glia morphology) would be helpful.</p>
