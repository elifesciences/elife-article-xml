<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP43) proteinopathy, characterized by the mislocalization and aggregation of TDP43, is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In this study, we describe the development of a new model of TDP43 proteinopathy using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. Utilizing a genome engineering approach, we induced the mislocalization of endogenous TDP43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm without mutating the TDP43 gene or using chemical stressors. Our model successfully recapitulates key early and late pathological features of TDP43 proteinopathy, including neuronal loss, reduced neurite complexity, and cytoplasmic accumulation and aggregation of TDP43. Concurrently, the loss of nuclear TDP43 leads to splicing defects, while its cytoplasmic gain adversely affects microRNA expression. Strikingly, our observations suggest that TDP43 is capable of sustaining its own mislocalization, thereby perpetuating and further aggravating the proteinopathy. This innovative model provides a valuable tool for the in-depth investigation of the consequences of TDP43 proteinopathy. It offers a clinically relevant platform that will accelerate identification of potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of TDP43-associated neurodegenerative diseases including sporadic ALS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the relentless degeneration of motor neurons (MNs) in both the brain and spinal cord (R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brown and Al-Chalabi 2017</xref>). This degeneration precipitates a cascade of symptoms including muscle weakness, atrophy, and paralysis, eventually leading to respiratory failure and death typically within three to five years after the onset of symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hardiman et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>A hallmark of ALS pathology is the aberrant behavior of the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (hereafter TDP43). In ALS patients, TDP43, which normally resides in the nucleus, becomes mislocalized, forming aggregates in the cytoplasm of neurons and glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Neumann et al. 2006</xref>). This phenomenon, termed TDP43 proteinopathy, is implicated in the majority of ALS cases and is considered a central player in the diseaseâs pathogenesis (S.-C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ling, Polymenidou, and Cleveland 2013</xref>). TDP43 proteinopathy is a common feature in multiple age-associated neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, Limbic-predominant age-related TDP43 encephalopathy (LATE), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimerâs disease (AD) (de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boer et al. 2020</xref>). TDP43 (encoded by <italic>TARDBP</italic>) is an RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in RNA metabolism, encompassing RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Donde et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Polymenidou et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arnold 2012</xref>; J. P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ling et al. 2015</xref>), stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">SidibÃ© et al. 2021</xref>), and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nagano et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chu et al. 2019</xref>) thus ensuring proper neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gimenez et al. 2023</xref>). For example, recent studies have demonstrated cryptic exon (CE) inclusion triggered by loss of nuclear TDP43 (J. P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ling et al. 2015</xref>), especially in transcripts of important neuronal genes <italic>UNC13A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ma et al. 2022</xref>) and <italic>STMN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Klim et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Melamed et al. 2019</xref>). Additionally, TDP43 associates with the microRNA biogenesis machinery and affects microRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buratti et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kawahara and Mieda-Sato 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Paez-Colasante et al. 2020</xref>). Accordingly, widespread dysregulation of microRNA levels have been reported in spinal tissue obtained post-mortem from sporadic ALS cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Reichenstein et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Emde et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Figueroa-Romero et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gagliardi et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Current cellular models aimed at investigating TDP43 mislocalization involve mutating the TDP43 nuclear-localization signal, using mutant versions identified in familial ALS patients, or the use of pharmacological agents to induce stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barmada et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zuo et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ziff et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Walker et al. 2015</xref>). Despite the insights gained from these models, they harbor inherent limitations. Overexpression may not represent physiological conditions, TDP43 is found to be mutated in &lt;0.5% of all ALS cases, and pharmacological induction might induce events unrelated to the disease. Further, CEs identified in ALS/FTD cases are poorly conserved beyond primates, making it challenging to investigate the contribution of splicing defects to ALS pathophysiology using animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baughn et al. 2023</xref>). Human induced pluripotent technology (iPSCs) offers a powerful platform that addresses some of these issues with animal models, enabling the development of human models of ALS <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Giacomelli et al. 2022</xref>). A recent study employed sporadic ALS (spALS) spinal cord extracts to induce TDP43 proteinopathy in iPSC-derived MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Smethurst et al. 2020</xref>). However, the modelâs utility is limited by the small percentage of neurons showing TDP43 pathology and the difficulty in producing spALS spinal extracts consistently and in large quantities.</p>
<p>In this study, we present an innovative human model of TDP43 proteinopathy that allows us to trigger cytoplasmic mislocalization of endogenous non-mutated TDP43 on demand in healthy control iPSC-MNs at scale (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This technological advancement offers an unprecedented level of insight into TDP43 proteinopathy and its role in ALS.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>We fused green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C-terminus of <italic>TARDBP</italic> in its endogenous locus in healthy control iPSCs using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and selected iPSC clones with a homozygous knock-in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). We initially ascertained that the integration of GFP did not adversely impact the differentiation of iPSCs into motor neurons (MNs). To this end, iPSCs engineered with TDP43-GFP were subjected to differentiation directed towards the MN lineage, employing protocols we had established in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Namboori et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hawkins et al. 2022</xref>). Based on the expression of established MN markers - ISLET1 (ISL1) and neurofilament-M (NF-M) - we confirmed that the edited iPSCs (with GFP integration) efficiently differentiated into MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, the TDP43-GFP knock-in MNs did not show significantly altered expression levels of <italic>TARDBP</italic>, <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic>, nor did it cause any upregulation of cryptic transcripts in <italic>STMN2</italic> or <italic>UNC13A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref>). Overall, these results support the premise that the GFP knock-in had no detrimental effects on the iPSCsâ ability to differentiate into MNs or TDP43 function.</p>
<p>These engineered iPSCs, hereafter called TDP43-GFP iPSCs, were differentiated into MNs (called TDP43-GFP MNs) where â¼80% of the cells in culture immunostained positive for ISL1. We expressed an anti-GFP nanobody (12kDa) using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) in the TDP43-GFP MNs. Expression of the nanobody (deemed the control nanobody) did not affect TDP43 localization from the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We engineered the nanobody with a nuclear export signal (NES). Expression of the NES-nanobody in the TDP43-GFP neurons caused relocation of the fusion protein to the cytoplasm with a concomitant loss in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). We observed that TDP43 mislocalization leads to reduced dendrite complexity and neuronal soma swelling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>) and an increase in cleaved caspase-3 activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>), which is an indicator of apoptosis. We confirmed that expression of the nanobodies in unedited iPSCs did not lead to apoptosis activation or dendrite defects, confirming that the observed phenotypes are due to TDP43 mislocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig. 2C</xref>). Additionally, we observed TDP43 puncta reminiscent of aggregates in the cytoplasm of MNs displaying mislocalized TDP43 that varied in size and number across individual neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Having demonstrated that our model can recapitulate cellular features observed in sporadic ALS, we next explored the molecular consequences triggered by TDP43 proteinopathy. Previous studies have highlighted the prevalence of alternative splicing defects affecting transcripts expressed from <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic> in ALS (A.-L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ma et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Klim et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Melamed et al. 2019</xref>). These splicing defects are considered hallmarks in the progression of the disease. Given the significance of this phenomenon, we sought to ascertain if MNs expressing the NES nanobody exhibit these characteristic splicing defects. We performed RT-qPCR analysis on motor neurons that expressed the control or NES nanobody. The results strikingly mirrored the commonly observed ALS profile, showing inclusion of cryptic exons in both <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic> and a reduction in the abundance of canonical transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig. 2D</xref>). This demonstrated that our model proficiently recapitulates the critical molecular features observed in sporadic ALS.</p>
<p>Next, we ventured to explore the molecular consequences triggered by TDP43 proteinopathy across the whole transcriptome. We performed transcriptomic analysis on day 40 TDP43-GFP MNs to assess changes in the gene expression profiles due to TDP43 mislocalization. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that the primary axis of variance (90%) is related to the expression of the control and NES nanobody while the much smaller 2<sup>nd</sup> PC component related to the two clones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Subsequently, we conducted a differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 and visualized the results via a volcano plot. Our analysis revealed differential expression of hundreds of genes with a fold change of â¥ 2 and false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.01, suggesting a profound impact of TDP43 dysfunction on the transcriptome of MNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the differentially expressed genes highlighted a significant enrichment of pathways related to synaptic dysfunction and cytoskeletal defects in axons and dendrites amongst downregulated genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). This finding is of considerable relevance to ALS pathogenesis, as neurons affected by ALS often exhibit impairments in these functions. In contrast, upregulated genes were enriched for GO terms related to RNA processing including the nonsense mediated decay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Given that alternative splicing (AS) defects are a hallmark of sporadic ALS, we utilized Leafcutter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li et al. 2018</xref>) to analyze potential alternative splicing in MNs caused by TDP43 mislocalization. Our analysis identified alterations in the splicing of 175 genes, including <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic> (ÎPSI &gt; 0.1, adjusted p-value &lt; 0.01). To gain functional insights into these splicing defects, we performed pathway enrichment analysis on affected genes, identifying a significant enrichment of terms related to synaptic development (FDR &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, to gain mechanistic understanding of the role of TDP43 in the observed splicing defects, we compared the splicing results with TDP43 eCLIP data generated in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tam et al. 2019</xref>). Interestingly, only 35% of the splicing changes were proximal to a TDP43 binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">4</xref>). This suggests that the loss of TDP43 from the nucleus may be responsible for a subset of the observed splicing defects but not all. This indicates the possibility of additional indirect underlying mechanisms that may include dysregulation of other RBPs or epitranscriptomic modifications of the RNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">McMillan et al. 2023</xref>). To gain deeper insights into the observed splicing patterns due to TDP43 mislocalization, we employed the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing platform to generate RNA-seq data at the isoform level. Our investigation predominantly focused on <italic>STMN2</italic> due to its significance in ALS and a substantial number of reads (&gt;100) mapping to this gene. Employing our FICLE pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Leung et al. 2023</xref>), we identified a total of 476 isoforms related to <italic>STMN2</italic>. Out of these, 17 isoforms were congruent with the exonic structure of known reference isoforms. Notably, 40 isoforms, accounting for 8.4% of the total, were characterized by a cryptic exon (CE) starting at chr8:80529057 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). These isoforms with the CE were exclusively expressed in TDP43-GFP MNs that expressed the NES nanobody. Furthermore, the ONT data revealed that <italic>STMN2</italic> isoforms exhibit variable CE lengths, with different CE lengths corresponding to widely varying expression levels of the parent isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>). Importantly, the isoforms containing the CE were predominantly short, truncated, and predicted to be non-protein coding. Surprisingly, four of these CE-containing isoforms manifested a novel exon, 114 bp in length, positioned upstream of the CE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). Our findings reveal a potentially significant variability in the splicing alterations induced by TDP43 proteinopathies, even within a single gene. This highlights the power of using long-read sequencing as a method for uncovering nuanced changes in splicing alterations in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>We compared our splicing results with publicly available transcriptomic data generated from cortical neuronal nuclei with or without TDP43 purified from ALS patient tissue post-mortem. At a stringent FDR threshold of 0.01 and ÎPSI &gt; 0.1, we detected 90 genes as alternatively spliced in nuclei that showed a loss of TDP43 using Leafcutter. Thirty-four out of these 90 genes were also detected in our iPSC model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), indicating strong concordance between the iPSC model and patient data, despite the differences in sample origin and neuronal subtype. Importantly, all 34 genes displayed an identical splicing event. To evaluate whether the observed splicing changes were due to nuclear loss of TDP43, we compared our splicing results with transcriptomic data generated in iPSC-derived MNs and iNeurons after TDP43 knockdown (KD) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). In accordance with the model that nuclear loss of TDP43 drives splicing changes, we observed a significant overlap between splicing defects due to a global loss of TDP43 and our mislocalization model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). However, a number of genes that displayed splicing changes due to TDP43 mislocalization were not affected by TDP43 KD in either dataset (143 genes for the GSE121569 and 79 genes for the PRJEB42763 dataset). This indicates that nuclear loss of TDP43 alone cannot entirely explain the widespread defects in AS.</p>
<p>To generate a robust list of AS events associated with TDP43 pathology, we compared genes identified in our RNA-seq data with those from ALS/FTD post-mortem tissue. We applied an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.01 and a ÎPSI &gt; 0.1. Additionally, to ensure further confidence in the identified changes, we required that each event be statistically significant at a stringent p-value threshold of 1e-4 in at least one dataset. Our analysis identified 12 genes, including <italic>STMN2</italic> and <italic>UNC13A</italic>, that we further investigated using RT-qPCR. This confirmed AS events in all the genes identified, where 9/12 genes displayed a decrease in expression of their canonical transcript levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Further, most of these genes also displayed AS changes due to TDP43 KD in iPSC-MNs, although the extent of these changes for a subset of the genes tested was less dramatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
<p>A key drawback with earlier TDP43 models was the inability to characterize early changes after TDP43 mislocalization in neurons. To enable inducible control of TDP43 cytoplasmic localization in our model, we expressed the nanobody under a doxycycline-inducible promoter, and the entire circuit was knocked into the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus in the E8 homozygous TDP43-GFP iPSCs. We called these iPSCs TDP43-GFP-CTRL or TDP43-GFP-NES iPSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We first confirmed that we could induce TDP43 mislocalization in the TDP43-GFP-CTRL/NES iPSC-derived MNs using doxycycline (Dox). Dox (1 Âµg/ml) triggered significant TDP43 mislocalization in the TDP43-GFP-NES MNs, while the TDP43-GFP-CTRL MNs, and the TDP43-GFP-NES MNs without Dox, maintained nuclear TDP43 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Further, we observed cytoplasmic TDP43 puncta in the NES line (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), and a significant increase in phosphorylated TDP43 without a change in the total TDP43 protein levels upon mislocalization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, 3E). We noted that the TDP43 mislocalization alone did not induce significant levels of G3BP1+ stress granules (SG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). When treated with sodium arsenite, both control and NES MNs displayed cytoplasmic SG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). However, in NES MNs treated with SA, only a subset of cytoplasmic TDP43 puncta co-localized with G3BP1+ stress granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<p>To detect early changes in expression and splicing post-TDP43 mislocalization, we performed a time-course analysis of TDP43-GFP-NES at 4-, 8-, 12-, and 24-hours post-Dox addition. Notably, we observed TDP43 mislocalization as early as eight hours after Dox treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), which was accompanied by significant AS errors in all 12 genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). This suggests that dysfunctional AS could be one of the incipient molecular events in ALS pathogenesis due to TDP43 mislocalization. Transcriptomic analysis of day 40 MNs uncovered splicing defects including cryptic exon inclusions and isoform switching in 494 genes (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.01 and ÎPSI &gt; 0.1), with significant enrichment in pathways related to synaptic function and the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

<p>A significant area of research in the field of ALS involves pinpointing the upstream triggers responsible for causing the mislocalization of TDP43. The underlying premise of these investigations is that eliminating the trigger may potentially reverse the mislocalization of TDP43. However, it remains to be confirmed whether this hypothesis holds true. We wanted to ascertain whether TDP43, once mislocalized, self-perpetuates in its mislocalized state even after the initial trigger has been removed.</p>
<p>To investigate whether TDP43 mislocalization is self-perpetuating, we tagged both the control and NES nanobody with a V5 tag to track their expression. These were introduced into TDP43-GFP MNs using lentiviruses under a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible promoter. We induced TDP43 mislocalization by adding Dox to iPSC-derived MNs at day 20. After five days (day 25), Dox was withdrawn, and neurons were harvested 21 days later (day 46). As a benchmark of successful mislocalization, cultures were continuously treated with Dox (Constant Dox), while neurons expressing the control nanobody served as controls, displaying nuclear TDP43. TDP43 localization was assessed using immunofluorescence microscopy, and nanobody expression was evaluated via V5 immunostaining.</p>
<p>As expected, neurons in the Constant Dox NES condition exhibited significant TDP43 mislocalization, while TDP43 remained nuclear in the Constant Dox control MNs, confirming the specificity of Dox-induced mislocalization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). Following Dox withdrawal, TDP43 localization was largely restored to the nucleus. However, a subset of neurons retained cytoplasmic TDP43 even after 21 days (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Super-resolution microscopy further revealed persistent cytoplasmic TDP43 in these neurons, despite near undetectable nanobody expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), suggesting that in some cells, TDP43 mislocalization may become self-sustaining. Our data indicates that removal of the initial trigger maybe insufficient to completely reverse TDP43 once it has been mislocalized.</p>

<p>Finally, since TDP43 is involved in microRNA biogenesis, we sought to analyze changes in the microRNA profiles associated with TDP43 mislocalization. For this purpose, we carried out small RNA sequencing on day 40 MNs after triggering TDP43 mislocalization at day 20 by the addition of doxycycline. Our analysis revealed a striking alteration in the landscape of microRNA expression as a result of TDP43 mislocalization. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct separation of the control and mislocalized samples (PC1 77%), emphasizing the profound impact of TDP43 mislocalization on microRNA profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Supplementary Fig. 10A</xref>).</p>
<p>Around 150 microRNAs were found to be significantly altered (FDR &lt; 0.01 and fold change â¥ 1.5) upon TDP43 mislocalization. Our data captured downregulation of the microRNAs miR-218, and miR-9, which have previously been shown to be downregulated in ALS MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Reichenstein et al. 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang et al. 2013</xref>). Interestingly, these changes were not unidirectional; almost equal numbers of microRNAs were upregulated or downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Supplementary Fig. 10B</xref>). The results of this study indicate that TDP43 mislocalization leads to global dysregulation of microRNA expression in iPSC-derived MNs. However, it is noteworthy that our observations contrast with those found in postmortem tissue studies, where all differentially expressed microRNAs were reported to be downregulated. This divergence in findings may suggest that the uniform downregulation observed in postmortem tissues could be attributed to changes that are triggered by end-stage dying neurons, which might not represent the whole spectrum of molecular alterations especially early in the disease progression.</p>
<p>We wanted to evaluate whether alterations in microRNA expression profiles induced by TDP43 mislocalization are congruent with the changes caused by TDP43 knockdown. For this investigation, small RNA sequencing was utilized to assess microRNA expression in motor neurons (MNs) at day 30 following the knockdown of TDP43 using shRNAs. Again, principal component analysis revealed a distinct separation between all control and TDP43 knockdown samples, indicating a clear impact of TDP43 knockdown on microRNA expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Supplementary Fig. 10C</xref>). However, a striking contrast was observed in the number of microRNAs affected by TDP43 knockdown as compared to TDP43 mislocalization. Specifically, in the case of TDP43 knockdown, only one microRNA (miR-1249-3p) exhibited a significant change (FDR &lt; 0.01 and a fold change of 1.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Supplementary Fig. 10D</xref>). This is in stark contrast to the observations made when TDP43 was mislocalized, where over 150 microRNAs displayed altered expression. To avoid setting thresholds in our comparisons, we first ranked the microRNAs impacted by TDP43 knockdown based on their fold changes. Subsequently, we utilized gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to determine if the microRNAs disrupted by TDP43 mislocalization significantly coincided with our knockdown data. We observed a substantial overlap between microRNAs that were downregulated due to TDP43 mislocalization and those downregulated following TDP43 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Supplementary Fig. 10E</xref>). However, we did not observe a significant overlap for microRNAs that were upregulated in both scenarios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Supplementary Fig. 10F</xref>). Our data suggests that mislocalized TDP43 selectively affects the expression of a subset of microRNAs. Additionally, these observations highlight the possibility that the nuclear loss and cytoplasmic gain of TDP43 induce distinct molecular alterations within motor neurons that converge to hasten neuronal dysfunction and demise.</p>
<p>However, we acknowledge that another explanation for the observed differences between microRNA dysregulation and splicing could be the extent of nuclear TDP43 loss. Our knockdown approach resulted in a 60% reduction in TDP43 transcripts. Though this was sufficient to cause splicing defects, it is possible that microRNA dysregulation might be more resilient to TDP43 loss as compared to splicing changes.</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>We could not confirm whether the observed cytoplasmic puncta are true aggregates. Attempts to immunostain neurons for phosphorylated TDP43 were unsuccessful. Using the Cosmo Bio antibody (TIP-PTD-M01A), we detected no signal, while the Proteintech antibody (22309-1-AP) showed nuclear phosphorylation even in control neurons. To address this, we performed western blot analysis with the Cosmo Bio antibody, which clearly detected hyperphosphorylated TDP43 in whole-cell lysates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, E</xref>). Given these results, we refer to these structures as âpunctaâ rather than aggregates.</p>
<p>TDP43 undergoes alternative splicing within exon 6 in response to induced hyperexcitability in iPSC-derived iNeurons, generating truncated proteins. These isoforms are detected in lumbar motor neurons; however, their levels remained unchanged between ALS patient and healthy tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Weskamp et al. 2020</xref>). Since our GFP tag is positioned on the C-terminus, our system cannot manipulate these truncated fragments as the tag is lost in these isoforms. But these isoforms, if present, should be detectable using the Proteintech antibody against total TDP43, which recognizes N-terminal TDP43 epitopes. However, western blot analysis, even 20 days after inducing TDP43 mislocalization, showed no truncated fragments. This suggests that TDP43 mislocalization alone is insufficient to generate significant levels of truncated isoforms.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In summary, our unique iPSC model of TDP43 proteinopathy offers an unprecedented access to investigate cellular and molecular events in human neurons in a temporal fashion downstream of TDP43 mislocalization. This model faithfully captures the neuronal loss and cytoplasmic accumulation characteristics of TDP43 proteinopathies. Beyond neurons, our model paves the way for inquiries into the roles of non-neuronal cells, such as oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, which also exhibit TDP43 proteinopathy, in contributing to neuronal dysfunction in a cell non-autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barton et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">James et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Smethurst et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Licht-Murava et al. 2023</xref>).

Cells were caudalized by treatment with 0.1 ÂµM retinoic acid starting at day 2 and ventralized with 1 ÂµM purmorphamine starting at day 4 and continued until day 10. At day 8, progenitors were replated onto poly-D-lysine/laminin coated wells and differentiated with 10 ÂµM DAPT for 3 days. Undifferentiated cells were removed with a pulse of 10 Âµg/ml mitomycin-C for 1 hour at day 14. Motor neurons were subsequently maintained in N2B27 media supplemented with 10 ng/ml BDNF and GDNF, with half media changes occurring twice per week.</p>

<title>Western Blotting</title>
<p>Motor neuron samples at D40 were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer supplemented with HALTâ¢ protease phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 500 x g, for 10 minutes at 4Â°C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was used as the total protein fraction. A total of 3 Âµg protein was separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad) and transferred to 0.2 Âµm nitrocellulose membrane (Amershamâ¢ Protranâ¢) for immunoblotting. Membranes were blocked for 1 hour at RT using the Intercept-T blocking buffer (Li-Cor). Primary antibodies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) were incubated overnight at 4Â°C. Secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 hour at RT. All antibodies were diluted in Intercept-T with 0.2% Tween-20 and washed in TBST. Blots were imaged using the Li-Cor Odyssey Fc Imager. ImageJ (FIJI) was used for quantification of band intensity. All bands were normalized to alpha-tubulin.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>TDP-43 mislocalization occurs in nearly all of ALS, roughly half of FTD, and as a co-pathology in roughly half of AD cases. Both gain of function and loss of function mechanisms associated with this mislocalization likely contribute to disease pathogeneisis.</p>
<p>Here, the authors describe a new method to induce TDP-43 mislocalization in cellular models. They endogenously-tagged TDP-43 with a C-terminal GFP tag in human iPSCs. They then expressed an intrabody - fused with a nuclear export signal (NES) - that targeted GFP to the cytosol. Expression of this intrabody-NES in human iPSC derived neurons induced nuclear depletion of homozygous TDP-43-GFP, caused its mislocalization to the cytosol, and at least in some cells appeared to cause cytosolic aggregates. This mislocalization was accompanied by induction of cryptic exons in well characterized transcripts known to be regulated by TDP-43, a hallmark of functional TDP-43 loss and consistent with pathological nuclear TDP-43 depletion. Interestingly, in heterozygous TDP-43-GFP neurons, expression of intrabody-NES appeared to also induce the mislocalization of untagged TDP-43 in roughly half of the neurons, suggesting that this system can also be used to study effects on untagged endogenous TDP-43 as well as TDP-43-GFP fusion protein.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A clearer understanding of how TDP-43 mislocalization alters cellular function, as well as pathways that mitigate clearance of TDP-43 aggregates, is critical. But modeling TDP-43 mislocalization in disease-relevant cellular systems has proven to be challenging. High levels of overexpression of TDP-43 lacking an NES can drive endogenous TDP-43 mislocalization, but such overexpression has direct and artificial consequences on certain cellular features (e.g. altered exon skipping) not seen in diseased patients. Toxic small molecules such as MG132 and arsenite can induce TDP-43 mislocalization, but co-induce myriad additional cellular dysfunctions unrelated to TDP-43 or ALS. TDP-43 binding oligonucleotides can cause cytosolic mislocalization as well. Each system has pros and cons, and additional ways to induce TDP-43 mislocalization would be useful for the field. The method described in this manuscript could provide researchers with a powerful way to study the combined biology of cytosolic TDP-43 mislocalization and nuclear TDP-43 depletion, with additional temporal control that is lacking in current method. Indeed, the author see some evidence of differences in RNA splicing caused by pure TDP-43 depletion versus their induced mislocalization model. Finally, their method may be especially useful in determining how TDP-43 aggregates are cleared by cells, potentially revealing new biological pathways that could be therapeutically targeted.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The method and supporting data have some limitations.</p>
<p>â¢ Tagging of TDP-43 with a bulky GFP tag may alter its normal physiological functions, for example, phase separation properties and functions within complex ribonucleoprotein complexes. The authors show that normal splicing function of GFP-TDP-43 is maintained, suggesting that physiology is largely preserved, but other functions and properties of TDP-43 that were not directly tested could be altered.</p>
<p>â¢ Potential differences in splicing and micro RNAs between TDP-43 knockdown and TDP-43 mislocalization are potentially interesting. However, different patterns of dysregulated RNA splicing can occur at different levels of TDP-knockdown and can differ in different batches of experiments, thus it is difficult to asses whether the changes observed in this paper are due to mislocalization per se, or rather just reflect differences in nuclear TDP-43 abundance or batch effects.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic mislocalization/aggregation of the DNA and RNA binding protein TDP-43 are pathological hallmarks of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Prior work has demonstrated that depletion of TDP-43 from the nucleus leads to alterations in transcription and splicing. Conversely, cytoplasmic mislocalization/aggregation can contribute to toxicity by impairing mRNA transport and translation as well as miRNA dysregulation. However, to date, models of TDP-43 proteinopathy rely on artificial knockdown- or overexpression-based systems to evaluate either nuclear loss or cytoplasmic gain of function events independently. Few model systems authentically reproduce both nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic miscloalization/aggregation events. In this manuscript, the authors generate novel iPSC-based reagents to manipulate the localization of endogenous TDP-43. This is a valuable resource for the field to study pathological consequences of TDP-43 proteinopathy in a more endogenous and authentic setting. However, in the current manuscript, there are a number of weaknesses that should be addressed to further validate the ability of this model to replicate human disease pathology and demonstrate utility for future studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The primary strength of this paper is the development of a novel in vitro tool.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are a number of weaknesses detailed below that should be addressed to thoroughly validate these new reagents as more authentic models of TDP-43 proteinopathy and demonstrate their utility for future investigations.</p>
<p>(1) The authors should include images of their engineered TDP-43-GFP iPSC line to demonstrate TDP-43 localization without the addition of any nanobodies (perhaps immediately prior to addition of nanobodies). Additionally, it is unclear whether simply adding a GFP tag to endogenous TDP-43 impact its normal function (nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, regulation of transcription and splicing, mRNA transport etc).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included images of the untransduced day 20 MNs derived from the engineered TDP43-GFP iPSC lines and the unedited line (Supplementary Fig. 1B).</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewerâs concern about the potential impact of the GFP tag on TDP43's normal function. To address this, we have validated the functionality of TDP43 by assessing the inclusion of cryptic exons in highly sensitive targets such as <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic>, both of which are known to be directly regulated by TDP43.</p>
<p>We compared MNs derived from the unedited parent line with the TDP43-GFP MNs prior to nanobody addition. As measured by qPCR, cryptic exon inclusion in <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic> was not observed in the unedited or edited TDP43-GFP MNs (Supplementary Fig.1C), confirming that the tagging does not induce splicing defects by itself. The cryptic exon inclusion in <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic> were only observed in TDP43-GFP MNs expressing the NES nanobody (Supplementary Fig. 2D). These findings were further supported by our next-generation sequencing data, which also showed that cryptic exon inclusion was specific to the TDP43 mislocalization condition (Supplementary Fig.3 and 4).</p>
<p>Thus, we have strong evidence that the GFP-tagged TDP43 behaves similarly to the wild-type protein and does not interfere with its function in our model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Can the authors explain why there is a significant discrepancy in time points selected for nanobody transduction and immunostaining or cell lysis throughout Figure 1 and 2? This makes interpretation and overall assessment of the model challenging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For the phenotypic data shown in Fig.1, we added the AAVs at day 18 or 20 and analyzed the cells at day 40. For the phosphorylated TDP43 western blot (revised Fig. 3D), cells were treated with doxycycline at day 20 to induce nanobody expression and samples were harvested at day 40. Thus, cells were harvested between days 20 or 22 after adding the nanobodies. The onset of transgene expression when using AAVs in neurons typically display slow kinetics. We observed TDP43 mislocalization in less than 50% of the neurons after 7 days post-transduction that peaked at 10-12 days after addition of the nanobodies, when more than 80% of the cells displayed TDP43 mislocalization. Hence, we do not believe that a two-day difference significantly alters the interpretation of the data.</p>
<p>The decision to harvest neurons at day 30 for the qPCR data was taken to investigate whether the splicing changes seen at day 40 from the transcriptomics analysis can be detected well before the phenotypes observed at day 40.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors should further characterize their TDP-43 puncta. TDP-43 immunostaining is typically punctate so it is unclear if the puncta observed are physiologic or pathologic based on the analyses carried out in the current version of this manuscript. Additionally, do these puncta co-localize with stress granule markers or RNA transport granule markers? Are these puncta phosphorylated (which may be more reminiscent of end-stage pathologic observations in humans)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have tried immunostaining neurons for phosphorylated TDP43. However, our immunostaining attempts were unsuccessful. Depending on the antibody, we either saw no signal (antibody from Cosmo Bio, TIP-PTD-M01A) or even the control neurons displayed detectable phosphorylation within the nucleus (antibody from Proteintech 22309-1-AP). Consequently, we performed western blot analysis using an antibody from Cosmo Bio, (TIP-PTD-M01A) that clearly shows hyperphosphorylation of TDP43 in whole cell lysates (Fig. 3D, E). Hence, we have referred to these structures as puncta and not aggregates (Page 4).</p>
<p>To assess co-localization of the puncta with stress granules, we immunostained for the stress granule marker G3BP1. This was done in MNs that were treated with sodium arsenite (SA) or PBS as a control. In the PBS treated control MN cultures, TDP43 mislocalization alone did not induce stress granule formation. G3BP1+ stress granules were only observed following SA stress (0.5 mM, 60 minutes). Further, only a subset of TDP43 puncta overlapped with these stress granules (Supplementary Fig. 7) (Page 6).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors should include multiple time points in their evaluation of TDP-43 loss of function events and aggregation. Does loss of function get worse over time? Is there a time course by which RNA misprocessing events emerge or does everything happen all at once? Does aggregation get worse over time? Do these neurons die at any point as a result of TDP-43 proteinopathy?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a time course to analyze TDP43 mislocalization and its consequences would be ideal. However, the mislocalization of TDP43 across neurons is not a coordinated process. At each given time instance, neurons display varying levels of TDP43 mislocalization. Answering the questions raised by the reviewer would require tracking individual neurons in real time in a controlled environment over weeks. Unfortunately, we currently do not have the hardware to run these experiments. However, we do observe increased levels of cleaved caspase 3 in MNs expressing the NES nanobody, indicating that these neurons indeed undergo apoptosis by day 40 (Fig.1).</p>
<p>We have, however, analyzed changes in splicing using qPCR for 12 genes over a time course starting as early as 4 hours after inducing mislocalization. We detect time-dependent cryptic splicing events in all genes as early as 8 hours after doxycycline addition, coinciding with the appearance TDP43 mislocalization (Fig. 4A, B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Can the authors please comment on whether or not their model is &quot;tunable&quot;? In real human disease, not every neuron displays complete nuclear depletion of TDP-43. Instead there is often a gradient of neurons with differing magnitudes of nuclear TDP-43 loss. Additionally, very few neurons (5-10%) harbor cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates at end-stage disease. These are all important considerations when developing a novel authentic and endogenous model of TDP-43 proteinopathy which the current manuscript fails to address.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As shown in Fig .1, the neurons expressing the NES-nanobody display a wide range of mislocalization as assessed by the % of nuclear TDP43 present. By titrating the amount of AAVs added to the culture, the model can be tuned to achieve a wide gradient of TDP43 mislocalization.</p>
<p>We calculated the size and percentage of neurons displaying TDP43 puncta. The size and the number of aggregates varies across the neurons that display TDP43 mislocalization. Around 50% of the neurons displayed small (1  um<sup>2</sup>) puncta while large puncta (&gt; 5  um<sup>2</sup>) were observed in &lt;10% of the cells, similar to observations in patient tissue (Fig. 1F).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>TDP-43 mislocalization occurs in nearly all of ALS, roughly half of FTD, and as a co-pathology in roughly half of AD cases. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mechanisms associated with this mislocalization likely contribute to disease pathogeneisis.</p>
<p>Here, the authors describe a new method to induce TDP-43 mislocalization in cellular models. They endogenously tagged TDP-43 with a C-terminal GFP tag in human iPSCs. They then expressed an intrabody - fused with a nuclear export signal (NES) - that targeted GFP to the cytosol. Expression of this intrabody-NES in human iPSC-derived neurons induced nuclear depletion of homozygous TDP-43-GFP, caused its mislocalization to the cytosol, and at least in some cells appeared to cause cytosolic aggregates. This mislocalization was accompanied by induction of cryptic exons in well characterized transcripts known to be regulated by TDP-43, a hallmark of functional TDP-43 loss and consistent with pathological nuclear TDP-43 depletion. Interestingly, in heterozygous TDP-43-GFP neurons, expression of intrabody-NES appeared to also induce the mislocalization of untagged TDP-43 in roughly half of the neurons, suggesting that this system can also be used to study effects on untagged endogenous TDP-43 as well as TDP-43-GFP fusion protein.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A clearer understanding of how TDP-43 mislocalization alters cellular function, as well as pathways that mitigate clearance of TDP-43 aggregates, is critical. But modeling TDP-43 mislocalization in disease-relevant cellular systems has proven to be challenging. High levels of overexpression of TDP-43 lacking an NES can drive endogenous TDP-43 mislocalization, but such overexpression has direct and artificial consequences on certain cellular features (e.g. altered exon skipping) not seen in diseased patients. Toxic small molecules such as MG132 and arsenite can induce TDP-43 mislocalization, but co-induce myriad additional cellular dysfunctions unrelated to TDP-43 or ALS. TDP-43 binding oligonucleotides can cause cytosolic mislocalization as well. Each system has pros and cons, and additional ways to induce TDP-43 mislocalization would be useful for the field. The method described in this manuscript could provide researchers with a powerful way to study the combined biology of cytosolic TDP-43 mislocalization and nuclear TDP-43 depletion, with additional temporal control that is lacking in current method. Indeed, the authors see some evidence of differences in RNA splicing caused by pure TDP-43 depletion versus their induced mislocalization model. Finally, their method may be especially useful in determining how TDP-43 aggregates are cleared by cells, potentially revealing new biological pathways that could be therapeutically targeted.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The method and supporting data have limitations in its current form, outlined below, and in its current form the findings are rather preliminary.</p>
<p>(1) Tagging of TDP-43 with a bulky GFP tag may alter its normal physiological functions, for example phase separation properties and functions within complex ribonucleoprotein complexes. In addition, alternative isoforms of TDP-43 (e.g. &quot;short&quot; TDP-43, would not be GFP tagged and therefore these species would not be directly manipulatable or visualizable with the tools currently employed in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>With reference to our answer above, we have confirmed using qPCR and RNA-seq analysis that adding a GFP tag to the C-terminus of TDP43 does not result in an appreciable loss of functionality. We do not observe any cryptic exon inclusion in <italic>STMN2</italic> and <italic>UNC13A</italic>. Cryptic exon inclusion in these genes, especially <italic>STMN2</italic>, has been recognized as a very sensitive indicator of TDP43 loss of function (Supplementary Fig 1C, Supplementary 2D, Fig. 3, Fig.4)</p>
<p>We acknowledge that truncated alternatively spliced versions of TDP43 will lose the GFP-tag and cannot be manipulated with our system. Since our GFP tag is positioned on the C-terminus, our system cannot manipulate these truncated fragments as the tag is lost in these isoforms. But these isoforms, if present, should be detectable using the Proteintech antibody against total TDP43, which recognizes N-terminal TDP43 epitopes. However, western blot analysis, even 20 days after inducing TDP43 mislocalization, showed no truncated fragments. This suggests that TDP43 mislocalization alone is insufficient to generate significant levels of truncated isoforms. We have added this section to the Limitations paragraph (page 9).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The data regarding potential mislocalization of endogenous TDP-43 in the heterozygous TDP-43-GFP lines is especially intriguing and important, yet very little characterization was done. Does untagged TDP-43 co-aggregate with the tagged TDP-43? Is localization of TDP-43 immunostaining the same as the GFP signal in these cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The purpose of the heterozygous experiments was to see whether mislocalized TDP43 could potentially trap the untagged TDP43. If this was not the case, we would have seen a maximum of 50% of the TDP43 signal mislocalized to the cytoplasm. The fact that a sizeable proportion of cells had significantly higher levels of TDP43 loss from the nucleus, indicates that mislocalized TDP43 can indeed trap the untagged protein fraction. We used GFP immunostaining to identify the tagged TDP43 while an antibody against the endogenous TDP43 protein was used to detect total TDP43 levels. In the cells that show near complete loss of nuclear TDP43, the total TDP43 signal coincides with the GFP (tagged TDP43) signal. We are unable to distinguish the untagged fraction selectively as we do not have an antibody that can detect this directly.</p>
<p>But we agree with the reviewer that these observations need further detailed follow-up that we are unable to provide currently. Hence, we have removed this figure from the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The experiments in which dox was used to induce the nanobody-NES, then dox withdrawn to study potential longer-lasting or self-perpetuating inductions of aggregation is potentially interesting. However, the nanobody was only measured at the RNA level. We know that protein half lives can be very long in neurons, and therefore residual nanobody could be present at these delayed time points. The key measurement to make would be at the protein level of the nanobody if any conclusions are be made from this experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer has highlighted an important point. To address this issue, we tagged the nanobodies with a V5 tag that allowed us to directly measure nanobody levels within cells. After Dox withdrawal, we indeed observed significant expression of the nanobody within cells even after two weeks of Dox withdrawal. Extending the time point to three weeks allowed complete loss of the nanobody in most neurons. However, in contrast to our observations at two weeks, this was accompanied by a reversal of TDP43 mislocalization in these neurons at three weeks (Fig. 5).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, in less than 10% of the neurons, we observed &gt;80% of the total TDP43 still mislocalized to the cytoplasm, despite nearly undetectable levels of the nanobody. Super-resolution microscopy further revealed persistent cytoplasmic TDP43 in these neurons that did not overlap with residual nanobody signal. This suggests that in these neurons, the nanobody was no longer required to maintain TDP43 mislocalization (Fig. 5, page 7)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Potential differences in splicing and microRNAs between TDP-43 knockdown and TDP-43 mislocalization are potentially interesting. However, different patterns of dysregulated RNA splicing can occur at different levels of TDP-knockdown, thus it is difficult to assess whether the changes observed in this paper are due to mislocalization per se, or rather just reflect differences in nuclear TDP-43 abundance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This a fair point. It is possible that microRNA dysregulation might require a greater loss of nuclear TDP43 and maybe more resilient to TDP43 loss as compared to splicing. We have acknowledged this in the discussion section (page 9).</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) It would be helpful to include nuclear vs cytoplasmic ratios of TDP-43 instead of simply &quot;% nuclear TDP-43&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have used % nuclear TDP43 as these values have biologically meaningful upper and lower bounds, which makes it easier to compare across experiments. We found that using a ratio of nuclear vs cytoplasmic TDP43 intensities displayed higher variability and a wider range.</p>
<p>We have re-labelled the y-axis as â% Nuclear TD43 / soma TDP43â to make our quantification clearer. The conversion from % nuclear TDP43 to N/C is straightforward. If the % nuclear TDP43 is X, then the N/C ratio can be calculated as X / (100-X). For example, a % nuclear TDP43 of 80% would amount to an N/C ratio of 80/20 = 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The axis descriptions in Figure 1D are very unclear. While this is described better in the figure legend, it would be beneficial to have a more descriptive y-axis title in the figure (which may mean increasing the number of graphs).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Axis descriptions and figures changed as recommended.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 1, the time points at which iPSNs were transduced with nanobody and/or fixed for immunostaining is somewhat inconsistent across all panels. This hinders interpretation of the figure as a whole. The authors should use same transduction and immunostaining time points for consistency or demonstrate that the same phenotype is observed regardless of transduction and immunostaining day as long as the time in between (time of nano body expression) is consistent. Subsequently, in Figure 2, a different set of time points is used.</p>

<p>Please see our response in the public comments above</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 1, please show individual data points for each independent differentiation to demonstrate the level of reproducibility from batch to batch.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Data points have been shown per replicate (Supplementary Fig. 2)</p>
<p>We have refined our approach for phenotypic analysis to improve consistency across different clones. Previously, we set thresholds on % nuclear TDP43 to distinguish MNs with nuclear versus mislocalized TDP43. This was done by ranking all cells based on % nuclear TDP43 and applying quantile-based thresholdsâdesignating the top 25% as control and the bottom 25% as mislocalized, ensuring equal number of cells per category. However, we observed significant variability in thresholds across clones. For instance, the E8 clone had thresholds of 96% and 29%, while the E5 clone had 93% and 40%.</p>
<p>To address this, we reanalysed the data using a standardized three-bin approach:</p>
<p>(1) Control: MNs expressing the control nanobody.</p>
<p>(2) Low-Moderate Mislocalization: MNs expressing the NES nanobody with &gt; 40% nuclear TDP43.</p>
<p>(3) Severe Mislocalization: MNs expressing the NES nanobody with &lt; 40% nuclear TDP43.</p>
<p>This approach ensured a more reliable comparison of TDP43 mislocalization effects across experiments. The conclusions remain the same.</p>

<p>(1) In general more robust quantification of many of the described phenotypes are necessary. In particular, no apparent quantification of cytosolic mislocalization was performed in Figure 1, or quantification of mislocalization of Figure 3F. It is unclear in the western blot in Fig 1G if TDP-43 signal were normalized to total protein, and of note it seems that expression of the intrabody-NES reduced total proteins in the western blots that were shown. No quantification or measurement of the insoluble material was done or shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have quantified cytosolic mislocalization of TDP43 (Fig. 1C). The y-axis indicates the total TDP43 signal observed in the nucleus as a percentage of the total signal observed in the soma (including the nucleus). This value has the advantage of ranging between 100% (perfectly nuclear) to 0% (complete nuclear loss). The boxplots indicate that expression of the NES-nanobody results in a range of cytosolic mislocalization with a median value around 40% of the TDP43 remaining in the nucleus.</p>
<p>Western blot data in previous Fig. 1G was normalized to alpha-tubulin. We were unable to get a good signal for the insoluble fraction. From the alpha-tubulin alone, it cannot be concluded that NES-nanobody results in a decrease in total protein levels. In the revised western blot for phosphorylated TDP43 (Fig. 3D, E), we have quantified total and phosphorylated TDP43. Here, we observe a six-fold increase in the levels of phosphorylated TDP43 without a significant change in total TDP43 protein levels.</p>
<p>To avoid potential mis-interpretation of our results, we have now removed the previous Fig. 1G.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Additional images of nearly all microscopy data at higher magnifications would be required to better evaluate TDP-43 localization. Ideally including images for each channel in addition to merged images, and especially for key figures such as Figure 1B, 3B, 3F.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Better images have been provided.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) No control images were shown for Figure 1F and 3F. It is unclear what the bright punctate spots of cytoplasmic TDP-43 GFP signal represent. Are these true aggregates? If so, additional characterization would be required before such conclusions can be made, beyond the relatively superficial western blot analysis that was done in Figure 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Control images have now been provided (Figure 1E). As we mentioned above, immunostaining analysis to characterize whether the aggregates are phosphorylated failed to provide a clear signal. However, we have now confirmed that the mislocalized TDP43 is indeed hyper-phosphorylated (Figure 3D, E). We have acknowledged this in the main text, and have referred to these as puncta reminiscent of aggregates (Page 4, Page 6).</p>
