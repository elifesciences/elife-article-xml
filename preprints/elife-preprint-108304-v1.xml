<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Every mammalian body compartment that opens to the outside world has microbial life associated with it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Until recently, the healthy lung was thought to be a sterile environment; however, recent work has demonstrated that the lower respiratory tract is colonized by a complex and roughly stable microbiome that impacts the health of the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. For years, the airway microbiota have been theorized to be gatekeepers of respiratory health, as pathogens entering the airway make contact with its microbiota prior to or coincident with their interactions with host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. While the latter interactions have been studied in detail, little is known about pathogen-microbiome interactions in the airway.</p>
<p>It has been hypothesized that pathogen establishment in the airway could be halted by its microbiota through either indirect or direct competition with the pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. During indirect competition, airway microbiota would modulate the host immune response to increase surveillance, promoting rapid recognition and clearance of foreign microbes including pathogenic organisms. During direct competition, the airway microbiota would competitively exclude a pathogen through production of inhibitory specialized metabolites, and/or by occupying a nutritional niche that would otherwise be used by the pathogen. Enhancement of these defense mechanisms might be achieved through addition of health-promoting microbes (probiotics) directly to the lower airway, an approach that has been demonstrated to prevent pneumococcal and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infection previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While these studies have shed light on the utility of lower airway probiotics for preventing two specific infections, greater understanding of the principles that dictate probiotic efficacy would allow rapid identification of probiotics with therapeutic potential against many pathogenic targets. To enable development of these therapies in the future, pipelines for probiotic nomination need to be made which can rapidly and cheaply identify effective therapies. Further, systematic analysis of the mechanism of action of these probiotics would allow fine-tuned control of their activity allowing for more reliable therapeutic outcomes in the clinic.</p>
<p>Here, we seek to fill this gap in knowledge by systematically characterizing factors that make efficacious lower airway probiotics that can competitively exclude a model pathogen, <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> (<italic>Bt</italic>), from the lung environment. Specifically, we hypothesize that negative microbial interactions between a probiotic and pathogen better protect the host against infection. Our systematic study of the microbial ecology of these organisms enables development of a pipeline for nomination of effective single and multi-organism probiotics that, to this point, remain underdeveloped. We show that using our pipeline, we can accurately identify pairwise combinations of organisms with enhanced activity against <italic>Bt</italic>. Finally, we test the ability of these prophylactically administered probiotics to promote survival during a challenge with <italic>Bt in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Isolation and characterization of candidate probiotics</title>
<p>To develop a system for testing the efficacy of lower airway probiotics in preventing infection, it was first necessary to identify a suitable pathogen to investigate. <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> (<italic>Bt</italic>) is a pathogen of mice that is genomically similar to several human pathogens including <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei, Burkholderia mallei</italic> and organisms of the <italic>Burkholderia cepacia complex,</italic> the latter of which poses a high risk of mortality for cystic fibrosis patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Thus, <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> is an appropriate subject of study for our purposes as it is safe, infectious in mice and a good model of several pathogens with clinical relevance.</p>
<p>To acquire candidate probiotics for use in the lower airway, we sought organisms which would be able to survive in the lower airway for an extended period of time and be capable of tolerating its low-nutrient environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that organisms directly isolated from the airway would fulfill this criterion, as they are already well-adapted to the environment and may be more immunologically tolerated by the host. To isolate candidate probiotics, the trachea and lungs were collected from C57Bl/6j mice, homogenized, and plated onto five different solid growth media, either directly or after an initial period of culture in blood bottles. Tissues that should be sterile (liver and spleen) were collected from the same mice and processed in parallel, in order to recover any contaminants [“background” (B) strains] inadvertently introduced through our bacterial isolation procedures. Bacterial colonies were repeatedly streaked on LB agar to recover clonal isolates for whole-genome sequencing. In total, 28 isolates recovered from the lower airway tissues were further characterized for use as airway probiotics.</p>
<p>Prior work on the lung microbiome has led to the widely held hypothesis that many of its constituents originate from the oral and/or nasal microbiome and are unable to actively replicate and persist in the lower airway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. We therefore sought to identify airway isolates that are capable of active growth in the lower respiratory tract, with the supposition that they should be better equipped to re-colonize the airway and compete against an invading pathogen. To do this, the airway isolates were cultured in lung simulating medium (LSM), which is based on the nutrient composition of sputum samples from cystic fibrosis patients, and therefore is thought to approximate the nutritional environment of the lower respiratory tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. We found that 10 of 28 airway isolates tested were capable of robust growth (&gt;1 doubling within 48 hours) in LSM (Figure S1). These 10 isolates, and model pathogen <italic>Bt</italic>, are arrayed on a phylogenomic tree (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), and are henceforth referred to as candidate probiotics (CPs).</p>

Percent growth of <italic>Bt</italic> is calculated as the CFU in co-culture at 24 hours divided by the CFU in the <italic>Bt</italic> monoculture at 24 hours multiplied by 100. Co-culture inhibition was tested for multiple starting densities of CP (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> x-axis). Starting densi­ ty of <italic>Bt</italic> and CP at a 1:1 ratio are 3.33×104 CFU/ml per organism. <italic>Bt</italic> monoculture is inoculated at 3.33×10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml.

</fig>
<p>The phylogenetic assignments of the CPs were compared to those of airway microbiome constituents previously identified through 16S rRNA profiling of mouse airway tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. This analysis revealed that the taxonomic groups to which the CPs belong are well represented in the mouse airway microbiome (Tables S1-3). For example, we found that all 9 of the species to which the CPs belong were detected in at least 1 of 4 previous airway microbiome profiling efforts, with 7 of the 9 species detected in more than 1 profiling effort. In contrast, only 1 of the 9 species to which the B strains (contaminants recovered from liver and spleen) belong was detected, in only 1 of the 4 profiling efforts. Similarly, 3 of the 4 genera to which CPs belong were detected in all 4 profiling efforts (whereas for B strains, only 3 of 9 genera were detected in all 4 efforts); and all 4 of the families to which the CPs belong were detected in all 4 profiling efforts (whereas for B strains, only 6 of 8 families were detected in all 4 efforts). These results indicate that the CPs belong to taxonomic groups that are typically well represented in mouse airway microbiome, consistent with the idea that they are airway microbiome constituents that have been recovered into culture.</p>
<p>Next, we aimed to identify CPs capable of inhibiting <italic>Bt</italic> during co-culture in LSM, with the hypothesis that they might also inhibit <italic>Bt</italic> in the lower respiratory tract and therefore serve as efficacious probiotics. Expression of antagonistic phenotypes is dependent on several factors including the cell density relative to the available resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we decided to assay interbacterial interactions in LSM across varying cell densities, with the hypothesis that this would enable us to capture information about CP potency. Each CP was co-cultured with <italic>Bt</italic> in LSM at different relative ratios (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We found that the CPs showed a range of activities, including negative interactions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> top 6 plots) and positive interactions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> lower 4 plots) with <italic>Bt</italic>; the potency of each CP, as indicated by IC50 value, is shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Production of a specialized metabolite plays a role in the antagonistic activities of CP8</title>
<p>Next, we sought to better understand the mechanism(s) of the observed negative interactions. First, we hypothesized that those CPs that strongly inhibit <italic>Bt</italic> may do so by simply growing at a faster rate than the pathogen thus dominating the environment. However, we found no correlation between doubling time of the CPs in LSM and their <italic>Bt</italic> antagonism (r = −0.21, P = 0.155, 95% CI [−0.47 to 0.088], N = 49). It has been shown previously that bacteriophages can modulate interbacterial competition, and some that can target <italic>Bt</italic> have been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>;</sup> therefore, we next hypothesized that some of the negative interactions between CPs and <italic>Bt</italic> might be mediated through production of <italic>Bt</italic>-targeting phages. To test this, we attempted to recover phages from each CP using standard methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, and tested the resulting product against <italic>Bt</italic> in plaque assays (Figure S2). We found that none of the CPs appeared to produce a phage that could effectively lyse <italic>Bt</italic>.</p>
<p>Given this information, we next hypothesized that these negative interactions could be direct, through chemical attack (ie. production of inhibitory metabolites); or indirect, through occupying a shared metabolic niche with the pathogen. First, we investigated the presence of inhibitory metabolites by growing <italic>Bt</italic> in sterilized co-culture supernatant from itself and a CP. We predicted that if <italic>Bt</italic>-inhibiting secondary metabolites were produced by a given CP during co-culture in LSM, then the conditioned medium recovered from the co-culture would inhibit growth of <italic>Bt</italic>. To test this, each negatively-interacting CP was co-cultured with <italic>Bt</italic> for 72 hours, filter sterilized, and combined with double-concentrated LSM to serve as medium for <italic>Bt</italic> growth curves (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that the co-culture supernatant from only one of the airway isolates (CP8) significantly reduced growth of <italic>Bt</italic> compared to supernatant from a <italic>Bt</italic> monoculture (negative control) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). This indicated that CP8 likely produced a specialized metabolite and was engaging in interference competition. To confirm our findings, we performed agar diffusion assays on all inhibitory CPs and found that, aside from CP8, none produced a zone of inhibition on a lawn of <italic>Bt</italic> (data not shown).</p>

<p>(A) Schematic representation of supernatant inhibition experiment workflow. Superna­ tant from a <italic>Bt</italic> and CP co-culture or from <italic>Bt</italic> monoculture (supernatant) is mixed 1:1 with 2x LSM. This mixture is used as the growth medium for subsequent <italic>Bt</italic> growth curves. Fold-change in <italic>Bt</italic> growth is calculated by dividing the maximum growth of <italic>Bt</italic> in co-culture supernatant by the maximum growth of <italic>Bt</italic> grown in supernatant from itself. (B) Left: Heatmap of fold-change in max CFU of <italic>Bt</italic> grown in supernatant from each inhibitory CP and <italic>Bt</italic> co-cul­ ture relative to <italic>Bt</italic> grown in supernatant from itself. Co-culture supernatant was collected at 72 hours. A fold-change of 1 indicates no difference in growth in co-culture supernatant compared to <italic>Bt</italic> growth in supernatant from itself. A fold-change less than 1 indicates a reduction in patho­ gen growth. Right: Boxplot of growth inhibition by CP8 supernatant. Data are represented as mean± SD.

</fig>
<p>To understand the degree to which CP8’s secondary metabolite is responsible for mediating the competitive phenotype observed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, we aimed to create a knockout of this molecule in CP8. Previously, we used antiSMASH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> to identify biosynthetic gene clusters in the CP8 genome sequence, and found that CP8 likely produces 19 specialized metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. A review of the literature revealed that biosynthesis of many of these specialized metabolites is dependent on Sfp, a phosphopantetheinyl transferase which catalyzes their conversion to the active holo-form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that knocking out the <italic>sfp</italic> gene in CP8 would yield a mutant with an inability to produce a specialized metabolite with inhibitory capabilities against <italic>Bt</italic>. A clean deletion of the <italic>sfp</italic> gene was made in CP8, and the resulting mutant (CP8Δ<italic>sfp</italic>) was found to produce a smaller zone of inhibition in an agar diffusion assay, indicating that interference competition was reduced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, growth curves of wildtype CP8 and the CP8Δ<italic>sfp</italic> mutant were performed, which showed no growth defect in the mutant strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that its reduction in interference competition was not due to a growth defect. Finally, a competition assay was performed using the CP8Δ<italic>sfp</italic> mutant. The mutant showed reduced inhibitory activity compared to wildtype CP8 and, in contrast, demonstrated a positive interaction with <italic>Bt</italic> when interference competition was disrupted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>Metabolic niche overlap is indicative pathogen and CP antagonism</title>
<p>While production of an inhibitory metabolite appeared to be the primary mode of inhibition for CP8, 5 other CPs showed a negative interaction with <italic>Bt</italic> but did not appear to produce specialized metabolites. Previous work has shown that competition for a shared metabolic niche is an important mediator of interbacterial interactions in bacterial communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of <italic>Bt</italic> by these 5 CPs may be due to metabolic niche overlap. Specifically, we postulated that passive consumption of a limiting resource by the CP could reduce the supply to <italic>Bt,</italic> thus inhibiting its growth.</p>
<p>The Redfield Ratio describes the stoichiometric relationship between carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus which supports life on earth and is canonically 106:16:1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Recent work has shown that this ratio is variable across body sites, with areas like the mouth and gut being more carbon rich, and the airways being relatively carbon poor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Similar to the upper airway, LSM is carbon limiting, with a C:N:P ratio of approximately 88:14:1. This suggests that carbon may be the limiting nutrient in the lower airway and thus, may be the limiting resource in the airway niche. We predicted that if carbon was limiting, then supplementation of LSM with additional carbon would reduce the antagonism between the CP and <italic>Bt</italic>. To test this, LSM was supplemented with 43mM glucose to increase the C:N:P ratio to 101:14:1. We observed a leftward shift of the dose-response curve for CP7 in the additional carbon condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), and a significant reduction in inhibition at a 1:100 ratio (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). A similar result was observed when the same experiment was conducted with CP19 (Figure S3). These results suggest that with increased carbon abundance there is a reduction in antagonism, consistent with the idea that, under the carbon limiting conditions of the airway, carbon is the primary nutrient for which CPs and <italic>Bt</italic> are competing.</p>

<p>Further, we sought to explore the extent to which metabolic overlap with <italic>Bt</italic> for carbon sources could predict inhibitory capabilities of each CP. To do this, we assayed the growth of each CP and <italic>Bt</italic> in each individual carbon source from LSM to determine which carbon sources could be utilized by each organism (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). <italic>Bt</italic> showed a wide range of metabolic potential and was able to grow on every carbon source presented except for ornithine. This is perhaps unsurprising as it has been shown previously that pathogens acquire new metabolisms in order to survive in their host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Conversely, the CPs displayed diverse metabolic activity, with CP4 and CP7 appearing most similar to <italic>Bt</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Each carbon source in LSM is used both for production of biomass as well as the primary electron donor to generate energy via aerobic respiration. In the niche exclusion hypothesis, a competitive advantage can be obtained for an organism that is able to consume those resources that would otherwise fuel aerobic respiration of a competitor. We therefore hypothesized that those CPs that are capable of sharing a greater proportion of carbon-derived electrons with <italic>Bt</italic> would have more potent antagonism of the pathogen by covering a greater percentage of the energetic niche (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). On this assumption, we built a simple index of niche overlap which weights each carbon source in LSM utilized by a given CP by the theoretical electron contribution of that given source, with the belief that such a metric could identify probiotics capable of achieving maximal niche coverage. We hypothesized that weighting each carbon source by its theoretical electron contribution would improve the accuracy of the niche index, as those sources which contribute more electrons represent a greater proportion of the energetic niche and therefore have a potentially greater impact on antagonistic phenotypes. Niche Index (NI) is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>First, the number of electron equivalents generated by each carbon source is calculated assuming the complete oxidation of these sources to carbon dioxide under standard conditions. The electron equivalents are then multiplied by the total number of molecules of the carbon source in the media. This yields the total electron equivalents for each carbon source per liter of media. These values are held in vector <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="578711v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.
<disp-formula id="disp-eqn-1">
<graphic xlink:href="578711v2_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The weighted value for each carbon source is:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="578711v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
For all CPs and <italic>Bt</italic>, a carbon utilization vector is generated. If a carbon source is consumed, then i = 1, if it is not able to be consumed, then i = 0.
<disp-formula id="disp-eqn-3">
<graphic xlink:href="578711v2_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
To calculate the Niche Index of each CP with <italic>Bt</italic>, the Hadamard product of the carbon utilizations vectors for each CP and <italic>Bt</italic> are multiplied by the weighting vector. The resulting value represents the electron equivalents utilized by both the CP and <italic>Bt</italic>. This value is divided by the electron equivalents utilized by <italic>Bt</italic> alone. Thus, the equation for Niche Index is: :
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="578711v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
NI is higher when a given CP shares a greater number of carbon-derived electrons with <italic>Bt.</italic> To evaluate the association between the co-culture interaction with <italic>Bt</italic> and the NI of each CP, a non-parametric spearman rank-order correlation was performed with the null hypothesis that there is no monotonic association between the two variables. We found that NI is negatively associated with the co-culture growth of <italic>Bt</italic> with a given CP at a 1:1 ratio (r = −0.64, P &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI [−0.79 −0.43], N = 49) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Since CP8’s potency is primarily due its secondary metabolite production (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), percent growth of the pathogen in co-culture with the CP8Δ<italic>sfp</italic> mutant was used in this analysis to understand how NI relates to CP8’s interaction with <italic>Bt</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). While here we have used Niche Index to calculate niche overlap between CPs and <italic>Bt</italic> in LSM, this model is generalizable and can be used to calculate the niche overlap between organisms in any media with a known molar carbon composition.</p>
<p>To confirm our hypothesis that those organisms that consume a greater number of carbon-derived electrons with <italic>Bt</italic> are more antagonistic, we performed exometabolomics on supernatants from 3 CPs. These 3 CPs represent a range of inhibition strengths and niche indexes, with CP7 being the most potent (IC50 = 0.001172 NI = 0.875), CP19 displaying moderate potency (IC50 = 0.006604 NI = 0.775) and CP8 being the least potent (IC50 = 2.316 NI = 0.351). Each of these CPs was combined with <italic>Bt</italic> at their respective IC90 and co-incubated for 36 hours. Supernatants from these CPs at 36 hours show that more potent CPs consume a statistically greater amount of carbon from the media than less potent CPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). At 24 hours where the degree of inhibition of <italic>Bt</italic> by each CP is the same, more potent probiotics consume fewer carbon-derived electrons than less potent competitors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that certain carbon sources were being prioritized, allowing more antagonistic CPs to have the same net effect on <italic>Bt</italic> while consuming fewer electrons. Further, we speculated that if high priority carbon sources were to be identified, perhaps the consumption of a smaller set of these high priority carbon sources could predict activity with similar accuracy to the Niche Index.</p>
<p>From the exometabolomics data, consumption of three carbon sources, lactate, proline and aspartic acid are prioritized more at 24 hours by the most potent candidate probiotic, CP7, than the least potent, CP8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Furthermore, we found that a CP’s ability to generate biomass on lactate (the second most abundant carbon source in LSM) was a good predictor of its ability to inhibit the pathogen (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>), suggesting that the ability to consume lactate in co-culture may be important for pathogen control. Overall, these results indicate that consumption of specific resources can have an especially strong influence on niche exclusion, with consumption of a specific carbon source (lactate) appearing to play a key role in niche exclusion of <italic>Bt</italic> by the most potent of the CPs (CP7). While these results are promising building blocks for the development of a metric of activity based upon a smaller feature set, a larger screen of candidate probiotics may be necessary to understand the generalizability of these features. Further, future efforts to develop this model should take into account a CP’s uptake rate for a given resource as this may influence antagonism and reveal features of the metabolic niche that have disproportionate significance to interbacterial interactions.</p>

<title>Niche overlap aids in the identification of efficacious multi-organism probiotics</title>
<p>While our work showed that 6 of the CPs were potent inhibitors of <italic>Bt</italic> growth in co-culture, 4 were poor inhibitors or actually promoted <italic>Bt</italic> growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Having found that NI is well correlated with CP activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, we hypothesized that this metric could be altered to identify pairwise combinations of poor-performing CPs with enhanced antagonism.

We hypothesized that combinations with lower NIF values would have optimal coverage of the <italic>Bt</italic> niche space while minimizing niche overlap between two CPs.

We calculated NIF for every pairwise combination of the 7 least antagonistic CPs from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. This generated a matrix of CP combinations and their respective NIF values (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). To test this metric’s capability to identify inhibitory combinations of CPs, we chose to evaluate pairwise combinations with the three lowest NIF values, a moderate value and a high value using competition assays.</p>
<p>In these experiments, two CPs were combined at a 1:1 ratio such that the total CP concentration at a given ratio was the same as their individual CP counterparts. This enabled us to directly compare activity of an individual CP and the activity of a combination of two CPs at a given ratio as the total cell density was the same in each. From competition assays, we determined that NIF was able to predict combinations with enhanced and reduced <italic>Bt</italic> antagonism as reflected by their relative IC50 values (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C,D</xref>,E, Figure S4 and Table S4).</p>
<p>For one combination, CP8 and CP19, we sought to understand the mechanism by which antagonism was being enhanced. First, to understand the effect of the interaction on all members of the co-culture, we performed growth curves of each strain (CP8, CP19 and <italic>Bt</italic>) in co-culture and compared their individual abundances when grown together to their growth in monoculture using qPCR (Figure S5). Reduced growth in co-culture of all three organisms in comparison to monoculture (Figure S1) classifies this antagonistic interaction as true competition. To better understand how CP8 and CP19 may enhance each other’s antagonistic impact on <italic>Bt</italic>, we performed exometabolomics analysis on supernatant from this combination. At 24 hours, significantly more lactate was consumed per cell by the CP8/CP19/<italic>Bt</italic> co-culture than by the CP8/<italic>Bt</italic> co-culture or CP19/<italic>Bt</italic> co-culture (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Similarly to the single isolate studies, this result once again suggests that lactate utilization may be important for antagonism of <italic>Bt</italic> in an airway-simulating environment.</p>
<p>To further investigate how the combination of CP8 and CP19 more effectively inhibits the pathogen, we performed a competition assay using the CP8Δ<italic>sfp</italic> mutant in combination with CP19 to understand the degree to which secondary metabolite production was responsible for their combined effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). When wildtype CP8 was replaced with the CP8Δ<italic>sfp</italic> mutant, there was a significant reduction in <italic>Bt</italic> inhibitory activity compared to the wildtype CP8/CP19 combination. Together, these findings suggest that both consumption of specific carbon sources and secondary metabolite production are important for activity of the CP8/CP19 combination and likely enable <italic>Bt</italic> inhibition activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). While the concept of NIF suggests that coverage of the pathogen niche may be responsible for the observed activity in other combinations, further investigation needs to be done to understand these interactions in more detail.</p>

<title>CPs provide protection against infection</title>
<p>Having observed the ability of the CPs to compete with <italic>Bt</italic> in an <italic>in vitro</italic> airway-simulating environment, we were encouraged to test their ability to confer protection against respiratory <italic>Bt</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Firstly, we hypothesized that those CPs which colonized at high density over an extended period of time would provide better protection against <italic>Bt</italic> infection. To test the airway colonization capabilities of the CPs, we administered each to C57Bl/6j mice at 10<sup>6</sup> CFU via oropharyngeal aspiration (OPA). After a period of 7 days, the lungs and trachea were assessed for CP load via CFU enumeration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We found that several CPs were able to colonize the airway for the duration of the 7-day period (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). We were particularly interested in those CPs displaying airway colonization (mean airway CFU load of &gt;10 CFU), as these would seem most likely to be capable of protecting against respiratory <italic>Bt</italic> infection.</p>

<p>We screened both colonizing and non-colonizing CPs for their ability to confer protection in a mouse model of respiratory <italic>Bt</italic> infection. In these studies, 10<sup>6</sup> CFU of each of 6 CPs was administered to the airway of C57Bl/6j mice via OPA. Following a period of 3, 5, or 7 days, <italic>Bt</italic> was administered to the airway and mortality was monitored for 10 days following <italic>Bt</italic> challenge (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Mice administered no CP prior to <italic>Bt</italic> challenge showed high mortality, only rarely surviving past day 4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, mice administered certain CPs prior to <italic>Bt</italic> challenge showed significantly reduced mortality (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Five of the six CPs were protective when administered 3 days prior to <italic>Bt</italic> challenge; CP17 was protective when administered at 3 or 5 days prior to <italic>Bt</italic> challenge; and CP19 was protective when administered at 3, 5, or 7 days prior to <italic>Bt</italic> challenge.</p>
<p>We observed that the most protective probiotics, CP19 and CP17, were predicted to have the highest niche overlap with <italic>Bt</italic> via their NI values and also showed an ability to inhibit in competition assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the CPs that did not inhibit <italic>Bt</italic> in competition assays yet do robustly colonize (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) (i.e. CP13, CP20, and CP26) showed no significant protection when administered 5 or 7 days prior to <italic>Bt</italic> challenge (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). A notable exception to this trend was CP8, which showed inhibition in competition assays as well as robust colonization, but showed no significant protection of mice challenged with <italic>Bt</italic>. This suggests that niche overlap with the pathogen may be more predictive of the protective capabilities of a probiotic than secondary metabolite production.</p>
<p>Finally, we sought to understand if NI<sub>CP</sub> was related to CP protection efficacy. To test this, we performed a non-parametric spearman rank correlation analysis with the null hypothesis that there existed no relationship between the number of days surviving after pathogen exposure and NI<sub>CP</sub> when CP treatment was performed 3, 5 or 7 days in advance of infection. We found a moderate relationship between survival and NI<sub>CP</sub> when CPs are dosed 3 days prior to infection (r = 0.48, P&lt;0.0001, 95% CI [0.33 to 0.62], N = 115), a very strong relationship when dosed 5 days prior (r = 0.77, P&lt;0.0001, 95% CI [0.60 to 0.88], N = 40) and a strong relationship when dosed 7 days prior (r = 0.66, P&lt;0.0001, 95% CI [0.52 to 0.77], N = 89) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, those CPs (ie. CP13, CP20 and CP26) which do not show inhibition in competition experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) conferred a significant survival benefit only when administered 3 days prior to infection. This suggests an alternative mechanism of protection at this timepoint which our model does not capture, such as competition for resources other than carbon (eg. other nutrients) or immune priming. While it appears that NI is a reasonable indicator of the protective effects of a CP <italic>in vivo</italic>, additional development of this model will need to be done to better capture the host environment, improve prediction and determine the extent to which it can be used to nominate efficacious probiotics in the future.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The human respiratory tract microbiome composition has been linked to both respiratory health and the occurrence of respiratory infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. As a result of this connection, manipulation of the lower airway microbiome is an attractive strategy for anti-infective therapies. Airway microbiome modulation via supplementation with probiotics has previously shown success in preventing infections; however, these studies lack a more broad and systematic analysis which is necessary to learn generalizable principles for the design of efficacious airway probiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this work, we developed a system that probes interactions between airway-derived candidate probiotics (CPs) and a model respiratory pathogen <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> (<italic>Bt</italic>). From this exploration, we find that consumption of shared resources explains the majority of antagonistic phenotypes between CPs and <italic>Bt in vitro</italic>. Specifically, consumption of shared carbon sources seems to play an important role in these interactions. As a result, a metric of niche overlap, Niche Index (NI), is correlated with CP inhibitory activity <italic>in vitro</italic> in most instances. Furthermore, we use these same principles to design combinations of CPs with enhanced antagonism against <italic>Bt</italic>. We explore the mechanism by which one combination, CP19 and CP8, exploits both metabolic niche exclusion and inhibitory metabolite production to its advantage in competing with <italic>Bt</italic>. Finally, we find that several CPs are able to re-colonize the mouse airway for at least 7 days, and that two CPs (CP19 and CP17) significantly reduce mortality in mice subjected to otherwise lethal respiratory <italic>Bt</italic> challenge. While it appears that there is a relationship between the NI and the protective capabilities of a CP, further preclinical experiments will need to be done to determine if NI alone can guide formulation of airway probiotics with clinical applicability. Further, consideration of potential effects from patient genetic background, environment, host immune response, and cross-feeding must also be explored.</p>
<p>The method described here is a step towards a more rapid, inexpensive, and effective means of identifying efficacious probiotics, all factors that have stalled probiotic development previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Selection of these probiotics based on their niche-exclusion capabilities, as demonstrated here, also has the potential to enable development of probiotics with better safety profiles. While probiotics with the ability to produce inhibitory small molecules can be identified easily, pathogens can rapidly evolve to evade this form of antagonism. In comparison, probiotics which occupy a niche may leave a pathogen with fewer strategies to evolve resistance, allowing long-term efficacy and more predictable effects on health in clinical applications.</p>
<p>Another great challenge for clinical development of airway probiotics is potency. In order to allow for adequate oxygen exchange in the lungs, alveoli need to remain unobstructed and, thus, colonization of the lung with a large dose of bacteria may result in undesirable outcomes. Therefore, probiotics which require extremely low doses to achieve a protective effect are desirable. Our methodology shows potential for repurposing of organisms that are typically poor performers for use in highly potent multi-organism formulations.</p>
<p>In this work, we found that one way that multi-organism probiotics defend against a pathogen is through consumption of available carbon sources which would otherwise feed the pathogen. In particular, lactate consumption appears to be important for efficacy. Several studies have found that there is increased lactate in the lung during inflammatory exacerbations, which could feed pathogen growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that consumption of lactate is important for fitness in the host and pathogenesis for several different bacterial pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Theoretically, if probiotics that preferentially consume lactate can be designed, they may be useful in controlling infections in hosts with inflammatory lung conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Broadly, we hypothesize that airway probiotics may have functionality by stopping the positive feedback loop of infection. In this model, pathogen infiltration into the lung and growth results in inflammation and cellular injury, causing a leak of nutrient-rich fluids into the alveolar compartment, which further promotes pathogen growth (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> (left))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Airway probiotics might stop this feedback loop by depleting nutrient abundance in the local lung environment, thereby limiting pathogen growth (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> (right))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Given this model, probiotics which interfere with pathogen metabolism could be forward-designed to work optimally within these environments in order to maximize potency and efficacy.</p>

<p>Left: During lower airway infection, bacterial growth elicits inflammation from the host, with concurrent endothelial and epithelial injury. Intra-alveolar oedema introduces additional nutrients from the blood into the alveoli and lung lumen, enabling further growth of the pathogen. This positive feedback loop results in uncontrolled growth of the pathogen, ultimately facilitating its instantiation. Right: Probiotics delivered directly to the lower airway may limit infection by reducing nutrient abundance after oedema, which prevents further growth of the pathogen and thereby breaks the infection-promoting feedback loop.</p></caption>

<p>The native airway microbiome, and its interactions with host cells and incoming pathogens, is only partially understood, making development of airway probiotics a challenge. As our knowledge grows, health-promoting functionalities could be introduced into the lower respiratory tract, through supplementation with microbiome constituents in unaltered state (as demonstrated here) or with engineered properties, such as novel metabolisms. However, for utility in the clinic, numerous questions will need to be answered about the predictability, long-term safety and reliability of airway probiotics as alternatives or additions to antibiotic therapies. To improve this nomination pipeline further, future models should incorporate elements which have been shown to influence interbacterial antagonism previously such as the rate of consumption of shared resources and and the impact of sudden alterations in resource availability as might occur in acute lung injury. To ensure safety, evolution of the CP in the airway should be monitored over time, and the potential contribution of cross-feeding between CP and pathogen should be investigated. Additionally, future efforts will need to focus on reliable probiotic delivery modalities, formulation stability, and potential for variance in colonization, protection, and immunogenic responses in different hosts and environmental contexts. Work is currently underway to understand the generalizability of the findings here to models of other respiratory diseases, and to evaluate their safety and efficacy for therapeutic applications.</p>

            <p>A <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> E264 strain that constitutively expresses GFP was provided by Daniel J. Hassett (University of Cincinnati College of Medicine; Cincinnati, OH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. The candidate probiotic (CP) isolates were recovered from the lower respiratory tracts of healthy mice using a culturomics approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. All animal work was conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol 304) and Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC, protocol 2021-010). LLNL is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International, and is Public Health Service-Assured (PHS assurance A3184-01). Briefly, airway (trachea and lung) tissues were collected from 24 mice (C57Bl/6j, 10-20 weeks), homogenized in 500 uL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and used to inoculate five different solid growth media [tryptic soy (TS); TS + 5% sheep’s blood; M9 minimal salts + 0.2% glucose; brain-heart infusion (BHI); and Luria broth (LB) (Teknova; Hollister, CA)] as well as three different BACTEC blood bottles [Plus Aerobic/F; Plus Anaerobic/F; and Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F (Becton Dickinson; Franklin Lakes, NJ)]. The inoculated solid growth media were incubated at 37C for seven days. The inoculated blood bottles were incubated with shaking (250 rpm) for 1-5 days, and 100 uL aliquots were periodically withdrawn for use in inoculating the five different solid growth media, which were then incubated at 37C for seven days. All colonies detected on the solid growth media were individually transferred to LB agar and, after further incubation at 37C for 1-3 days, streaked to single colonies on fresh LB agar. A representative single colony from each Petri plate was used to inoculate LB liquid and solid media, and these cultures incubated at 37C for 1-3 days for use in preparing frozen glycerol stocks as well as extraction of genomic DNA for sequencing. Sterile tissues (liver and spleen) that were collected from the same mice using a second set of dissection instruments were processed in parallel, in order to recover contaminants of the bacterial isolation procedures [referred to as “background” (B) strains].</p>

<p>This study reports a <bold>valuable</bold> method to predict the capacity of a candidate probiotic bacterium to metabolically outcompete a bacterial pathogen in the ecological niche of the murine respiratory tract (niche exclusion) based on the overlap of used carbon sources in vitro. The in vivo confirmation of the in vitro/in silico predicted efficacy is, at this stage, <bold>incomplete</bold> and would require more persuasive experimental evidence for the elimination of alternative mechanisms of action.</p>

<p>A summary of what the authors were trying to achieve:</p>
<p>(1) Identify probiotic candidates based on the phylogenetic proximity and their presence in the lower respiratory tract based on phylogenetic analysis and on meta-analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing of mouse lung samples.</p>
<p>(2) Predefine probiotic candidates with overlapping and competing metabolic profiles based on a simple and easy-to-applicable score, taking carbon source use into consideration.</p>
<p>(3) Confirm the functionality of these candidate probiotics in vitro and define their mechanism of action (niche exclusion by either metabolic competition or active antibacterial strategies).</p>
<p>(4) Confirm the probiotic action in vivo.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors attempt to go the whole 9 yards from rational choice of phylogenetic close lower respiratory tract probiotics, over in silico modelling of niche index based on use of similar carbon sources with in vitro confirmation, to in vivo competition experiments in mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The use of a carbon source is defined as growth to OD600 two SD above the blank level. While allowing a clear cutoff, this procedure does not take into account larger differences in the preferences of carbon sources between the pathogen and the probiotic candidate. If the pathogen is much better at taking up and processing a carbon source, the competition by the probiotic might be biologically irrelevant.</p>
<p>(2) The authors do not take into account the growth of candidate probiotics in the presence of Bt. In monoculture, three of the four most potent candidate probiotics grow to comparable levels as Bt in LSM.</p>
<p>(3) Niche exclusion in vivo is not shown. Mortality of hosts after infection with Bt is not a measure for competition of CP with the pathogen. Only Bt titers would prove a competitive effect. For CP17, less than half of the mice were actually colonized, but still, there is 100% protection. Activation of the host immune system would explain this and has to be excluded as an alternative reason for improved host survival.</p>
<p>Appraisal:</p>
<p>(1) Based on phylogenetic comparison and published resources on lower respiratory tract colonizing bacteria, the authors find a reasonably good number of candidate probiotics that grow in LSM and successfully compete with the pathogenic target bacterium Bt in vitro.</p>
<p>(2) In vivo, only host survival was tested, and a direct competition of CP with Bt by testing for Bt titers was not shown.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>Niche exclusion based on competition for environmentally provided metabolites is not a new concept and was experimentally tested, e.g. in the intestine. The authors show here that this concept could be translated into the resource-poor environment of the respiratory tract. It remains to be tested if the LSM growth-based competition data in vitro can be translated into niche exclusion in vivo.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study aims to establish a rational framework for designing bacterial probiotics against respiratory infections. The central hypothesis is that in vitro antagonism, particularly through metabolic niche overlap with a pathogen, predicts in vivo efficacy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Systematic pipeline: The study integrates bacterial isolation, in vitro characterization, model development, and in vivo validation into a cohesive workflow.</p>
<p>(2) Quantitative model: The introduction of the Niche Index (NI) and Niche Index Fraction (NIF) provides a novel, quantitative tool for predicting probiotic efficacy based on ecological principles.</p>
<p>(3) Mechanistic insight: The work dissects different modes of action, clearly demonstrating that inhibition can be driven by specialized metabolite production (CP8) or carbon resource competition (e.g., CP7), with lactate utilization identified as a key factor.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Limited model generalizability: The predictive power of the NI model is not universal. It fails to account for the in vivo inefficacy of CP8 (a metabolite-dependent inhibitor) and cannot explain the short-term protection conferred by some non-inhibitory CPs in vivo, suggesting unmodeled mechanisms like immune priming are at play.</p>
<p>(2) Preliminary nature of key findings: The emphasis on lactate consumption as a critical predictor, while interesting, is not sufficiently explored to establish its general importance beyond the specific strains and conditions tested.</p>
<p>Appraisal:</p>
<p>The authors successfully achieve their aim of establishing a rational probiotic-design pipeline. The data robustly support the conclusion that metabolic niche overlap predicts efficacy for many strains, while also clearly delineating the model's limitations, as acknowledged by the authors.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>This work provides a valuable methodological framework for hypothesis-driven probiotic discovery. The quantitative Niche Index offers immediate utility to the field and, with further refinement, has the potential to become a fundamental tool for developing respiratory therapeutics.</p>
