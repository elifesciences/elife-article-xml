<title>Abstract</title><p>Lipid metabolism plays a critical role in cancer metastasis. However, the mechanisms through which metastatic genes regulate lipid metabolism remain unclear. Here, we describe a new oncogenic-metabolic feedback loop between the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor ZEB2 and the key lipid enzyme ACSL4 (long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4), resulting in enhanced cellular lipid storage and fatty acid oxidation to drive breast cancer metastasis. Functionally, Depletion of ZEB2 or ACSL4 significantly reduced lipid droplets (LD) abundance and cell migration. ACSL4 overexpression rescued the invasive capabilities of the ZEB2 knockdown cells, suggesting that ACSL4 is crucial for ZEB2-mediated metastasis. Mechanistically, ZEB2 activated ACSL4 expression by directly binding to the ACSL4 promoter. ACSL4 binds to and stabilizes ZEB2 by reducing ZEB2 ubiquitination. Notably, ACSL4 not only promotes the intracellular lipogenesis and lipid droplet accumulation but also enhances fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and ATP production by upregulating the FAO rate-limiting enzyme CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 isoform A). Finally, we demonstrated that ACSL4 knockdown significantly reduced metastatic lung nodes in vivo. In conclusion, we reveal a novel positive regulatory loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4, which promotes LD storage to meet the energy needs of breast cancer metastasis, and identify the ZEB2-ACSL4 signaling axis as an attractive therapeutic target for overcoming breast cancer metastasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>More than 90% of breast cancer-related deaths are due to metastasis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fahad Ullah, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Park et al., 2022</xref>). Current treatments, including endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, are ineffective in preventing breast cancer metastasis and remain the greatest clinical challenge for breast cancer treatment(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barzaman et al., 2020</xref>). Cancer metastasis is associated with a process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Luond et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mittal, 2018</xref>). EMT is a pre-metastatic state in which epithelial cells lose their tight junctions and convert to migratory mesenchymal cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dongre and Weinberg, 2019</xref>). It has become increasingly recognized that metabolic reprogramming during the EMT process contributes to metastasis and tumorigenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sciacovelli and Frezza, 2017</xref>). Metastatic invasion is a highly energy-intensive process(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mosier et al., 2021</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that lipid metabolic reprogramming plays a critical role in meeting the energy requirements of metastatic invasion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Snaebjornsson et al., 2020</xref>). Elucidating the mechanism by which reprogrammed lipid metabolism helps us exploit novel and attractive targets for metastatic therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>Lipid metabolism includes a complex network of pathways that regulate fatty acid (FA) synthesis, storage, and degradation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Maan et al., 2018</xref>). For lipid anabolism, FA are stored in a dynamic organelle called a lipid droplet, which is composed of a monolayer of phospholipids that covers a hydrophobic core containing neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesteryl esters (CE)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cruz et al., 2020</xref>). Lipid droplets (LD) accumulation is associated with aggressiveness in many cancer types(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Antunes et al., 2022</xref>), including breast(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zembroski et al., 2021</xref>), brain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Taib et al., 2019</xref>), liver(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Niu et al., 2021</xref>), lung(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jin and Yuan, 2020</xref>), and prostate(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Roman et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, the aggregation of FA in LD is considered a priming state to prepare for metastasis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Petan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rozeveld et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Senga et al., 2018</xref>). In the case of need, FA can be released and oxidized for energy support. For example, it has been reported that fatty acids stored in lipid droplets were a crucial resource in fueling the metastatic process in pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rozeveld et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, previous studies have suggested that metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) depends on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to produce high ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Camarda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wright et al., 2017</xref>). Although lipid metabolism is crucial for cancer metastasis, the signalling pathway that regulates lipid metabolic reprogramming during breast cancer metastasis remains unclear.</p>
<p>Dysregulation of lipid metabolic enzymes has been documented in cancer metastasis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Luo et al., 2017</xref>). Long-chain fatty acyl synthetase (ACSL) 4 belongs to the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase ligase enzyme family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Quan et al., 2021</xref>; Rossi Sebastiano and Konstantinidou, 2019). ACSL4 catalyses the conversion of long-chain FAs to acyl-CoAs, a necessary step for free long-chain FAs to enter the next metabolic pathway(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kuwata and Hara, 2019</xref>). The increased expression and activity of ACSL4 have been observed in many cancer types and are well-known biomarkers of ferroptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Doll et al., 2017</xref>). Although it has been reported that ACSL4 is a tumor suppressor that activates ferroptosis, many studies have suggested that ACSL4 is an oncogene that contributes to tumor progression. For example, ACSL4 promotes Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation and metastasis via lipogenesis and lipid droplet accumulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Niu et al., 2021</xref>). In prostate cancer, ACSL4 promotes cell growth, invasion, and hormonal resistance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). The function of ACSL4 in breast cancer has been implicated in hormone therapy resistance involving the regulation of energy-dependent transporter expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Orlando et al., 2019</xref>). However, regulation of lipid metabolism by ACSL4 during breast cancer invasion remains unclear.</p>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrate a novel positive feedback loop between the EMT transcription factor ZEB2 and the essential lipid metabolic enzyme ACSL4, resulting in enhanced cellular lipid droplet accumulation and fatty acid oxidation to drive breast cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, ZEB2 activates ACSL4 expression by directly binding to the ACSL4 promoter. ACSL4 stabilizes and upregulates ZEB2 via transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In addition, we also provide evidence that overexpression of ZEB2 or ACSL4 is associated with worse prognosis in advanced breast cancer. Our findings provide insights into lipid metabolic mechanisms during the EMT process and reveal a novel oncogenic-metabolic pathway critical for breast cancer EMT and metastasis.</p>

<title>Migration and invasion assay</title>
<p>A wound healing assay was performed to examine the migratory ability of the cells. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 4×10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in a complete medium at 37 °C. Until cells reached 80-90% density, a sterile plastic tip was used to create a wound line across the surface of the plates. The suspended cells were discarded. After The cells were cultured in reduced serum DMEM medium in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 °C for 48 hours. Images were obtained using a phase-contrast microscope. Each assay was performed in triplicates.</p>
<p>The cell invasion capacity was measured using Matrigel-coated Transwell chambers (8.0 μm; Corning Inc.). Briefly, cells were suspended in 200 μL serum-free medium and seeded in the upper chamber of a Transwell. The lower chamber of the Transwell was filled with medium containing 10% FBS-containing medium. The Transwell chambers were then incubated at 37 °C. After culturing for 24 hours, the Transwell holes were penetrated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes and then stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution for 15 minutes. Invading cells were imaged and counted in five random fields.</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Untargeted lipidomics and proteomics</title>
<p>Cell Lipids were extracted in a chloroform-methanol mixed solution (2:1, -20 °C). The extracted cell lysates were immersed in liquid nitrogen and frozen for 5 minutes. The extracted cell lysates were placed in a 2 ml adapter, and the above steps were repeated twice. Samples were then centrifuged to pellet the proteins (5 minutes, 12000 rpm), and the supernatant was stored for analysis in a vacuum centrifugal concentrator. The sample was dissolved in 200 μl isopropanol, filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane, and detected by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). The lipidomics data were analyzed using LipidSearch software (version 4.0). The software identified intact lipid molecules based on their molecular weight and fragmentation pattern using an internal library of predicted fragment ions per lipid class. The spectra were then aligned based on retention time and the MS1 peak areas were quantified across the sample conditions. Excel 2010 was used to calculate intensity, and the R program (version 3.2.5) was used for data manipulation and statistical analyses, including unsupervised hierarchical clustering and heatmap visualization.</p>

<title>ZEB2 and ACSL4 are overexpressed and correlated in highly invasive breast cancer cells</title>
<p>To explore the molecular mechanism of highly invasive breast cancer, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of wild-type and two drug-resistant luminal breast cancer cell lines. Significant changes in 6155 genes (P &lt; 0.05). Notably, EMT and stemness genes such as ZEB2, SNAIL, TWIST, TRAIL, Gli2, WNT, and AKT3, which are overexpressed in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), were significantly upregulated in drug-resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). In contrast, differentiated genes such as FOXA1, ERα, E-cadherin, and GATA3, which are highly expressed in the luminal subtype, were significantly downregulated (Supplementary Fig. S1B), suggesting that drug-resistant cells underwent EMT and became stem-like cells. We noticed that the rate-limiting enzymes of fatty acid metabolism, long-chain fatty acyl synthetase 4 (ACSL4), and EMT transcription factor ZEB2 were among the top 200 upregulated (&gt;1.5-fold) genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To verify these findings in the clinical sample, we analyzed ZEB2 and ACSL4 expression in TCGA database and found that ACSL4 expression was positively correlated with ZEB2 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, r=0.7657, p&lt;0.001) and inversely correlated with ERα expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, r=-0.3312, p&lt;0.001). Using the Kaplan–Meier plotter database, we compared the post-progression survival (PPS) between ACSL4 or ZEB2 high- and low-expression breast cancer patients. We found that patients with higher ACSL4 or ZEB2 expression had worse prognosis than patients with advanced breast cancer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). It is worth noticing that there is no difference in the overall survival between ACSL4 or ZEB2 high and low-expression breast cancer patients (supplementary Fig. S2).</p>

<p>To confirm this correlation, we performed western blot analysis and found that Basal-like and Taxol-resistant cell lines, which lack ERα expression, showed high expression of ZEB2 and ACSL4, whereas low or no ZEB2 and ACSL4 expression was detected in luminal subtype cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Consistently, tissue samples from nine breast cancer patients had similar expression patterns, with ZEB2 and ACSL4 being relatively highly expressed in ER-negative patient samples (patients 6, 7, 8, and 9) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). The immunohistochemistry staining assay, shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>, also confirmed that ACSL4 and ZEB2 expression was elevated in ERα-negative breast carcinomas compared with ERα-positive breast carcinomas. Taken together, these results indicate that ACSL4 and ZEB2 are correlated and overexpressed in highly invasive breast cancers.</p>

<title>Overexpression of ACSL4 contributes to ZEB2-mediated breast cancer invasion</title>
<p>Because ACSL4 is overexpressed in highly invasive breast cancer cells, we hypothesized that ACSL4 is essential for driving breast cancer migration and invasion. We then established a stable ACSL4 overexpressed MCF7 cell line, which was less aggressive than the basal-like breast cancer cells. The overexpression of ACSL4 significantly enhanced the metastatic and invasive capacities of MCF7 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Conversely, ACSL4 knockdown by shRNA significantly reduced the metastatic and invasive capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells compared to that of the control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). We also observed that the metastatic and invasive abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly reduced in ZEB2 knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). To investigate the downstream genes regulated by ACSL4, we performed RNA sequencing analysis and identified that the tight junction and focal adhesion pathways were among the most upregulated pathways in ACSL4 knockdown cells compared to control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). To verify the RNA-seq results, we examined the expression of adhesion-related genes by immunoblotting and found that after silencing of ACSL4 and ZEB2, the luminal epithelial marker E-cadherin was increased, whereas the mesenchymal markers vimentin and N-cadherin were decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). These results confirm the essential role of ACSL4 in breast cancer invasion and migration.</p>

<title>ACSL4 and ZEB2 promote Lipid droplet production and lipogenesis</title>
<p>ACSL4 is a member of the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase family, which catalyzes the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into their active forms. However, the mechanism by which ACSL4 regulates lipid metabolism in breast cancer remains unclear. A previous study revealed that ACSL4 promotes lipid droplets (LD) accumulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Niu et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we measured the basal LD content of breast cancer cells, including MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and Taxol-resistant MCF-7 cells. The basal number and size of lipid droplets were significantly larger in MDA-MB-231 and Taxol-resistant MCF-7 cells, both of which are highly invasive breast cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Fluorescence microscopy revealed that ACSL4 co-localized with LD in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). Notably, ACSL4 knockdown reduced cytoplasmic LD abundance and LD-containing cells in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Consistently, cytoplasmic LD abundance and LD-containing cells was significantly reduced in ZEB2-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>Lipid droplets are phospholipid monolayers containing a hydrophobic core comprising triacylglycerols (TG) and cholesterol esters (CE). As ACSL4 promotes intracellular LD accumulation in breast cancer cells, we investigated the effect of ACSL4 on the lipid composition of breast cancer cells. Untargeted Lipidomic analyses revealed that ACSL4 knockdown breast cancer cells had a reduced ability to incorporate long-strain monounsaturated (18:1, 17:1, 22:1, 24:1, 26:1) and saturated FA (16:0, 18:0, 24:0, 26:0) into triacylglycerol and phospholipids (PL), indicating that ACSL4 promotes the incorporation of long-chain monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids into triacylglycerol and phospholipids in these cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Moreover, all these lipids, including triacylglycerol, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters, decreased the incorporation of several polyunsaturated FA, such as 22:6, 20:4, 22:4, and 22:5, in ACSL4 depleted cells as reported previously (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and Supplementary Fig. S5A)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Doll et al., 2017</xref>). Consistently, the total amount of different lipid species, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S5B, were significantly decreased after ACSL4 knockdown. All together, these results suggest that ACSL4 directs the long train of free fatty acids into lipid anabolism to form different lipid species in the LD or other cellular membranes.</p>

<title>Exogenous fatty acid promotes LD accumulation and fuel cell invasion</title>
<p>A previous study reported that some tumors tended to increase their intake of extracellular fatty acids to promote migration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rozeveld et al., 2020</xref>). As we observed that depletion of ACSL4 greatly reduced cytoplasmic LD abundance and invasive potential in basal-like breast cancer cells, we hypothesized that LD accumulation is an important step prior to breast cancer invasion. To verify our hypothesis, we examined whether exogenous fatty acids contributed to LD accumulation and the invasive ability of breast cancer cells. Exogenous oleic acid (OA) was added to the cell culture medium. Treatment with oleic acid dramatically enhanced LD abundance in the cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), indicating that breast cancer cells tend to store lipids in LD for energy reserves. Next, we assessed the effects of exogenous oleic acid treatment on cell migration. Transwell and Wound healing assays revealed that oleic acid-treated cells exhibited significantly enhanced invasive and metastatic capacities compared with control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>).</p>

<title>ACSL4 and ZEB2 stimulate long-chain fatty acid oxidation and ATP generation in BLBC Cells</title>
<p>To explore the mechanisms by which ACSL4 regulates lipid metabolism, we performed RNA sequencing to investigate downstream pathways and genes regulated by ACSL4. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the FAO pathway was among the top 20 regulated pathways (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). ACSL4 knockdown reduced the expression of genes involved in the FAO pathways (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Importantly, we observed that the FAO rate-limiting enzyme CPT1A was significantly reduced in ACSL4 knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Reverse transcription PCR confirmed that deletion of ACSL4 significantly reduced the expression of CPT1A, but did not affect the expression of CPT1B and CPT1C (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Consistently, ACSL4 silencing reduced CPT1A protein expression (supplementary Fig. S6A). In addition, levels of other lipid metabolic enzymes, such as ATGL, FASN, and SREBP2, were significantly decreased after ACSL4 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S6B). As ACSL4 knockdown decreased CPT1A expression, we reasoned that ACSL4 might stimulate fatty acid oxidation in highly invasive breast cancer. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was calculated in ACSL4 or ZEB2 silencing and control cells. We observed that the OCR rate derived from long-chain fatty acids was significantly reduced in ACSL4 or ZEB2 silencing cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>), suggesting the metabolic advantage of increased long-chain fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).</p>

<title>ZEB2 transcriptionally activates the expression of ACSL4</title>
<p>ZEB2 is a crucial transcription factor involved in EMT. Because ZEB2 and ACSL4 were highly correlated in the clinical samples in TCGA database, we investigated whether ACSL4 is a direct downstream target of ZEB2. Silencing of ZEB2 by siRNA in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly reduced ACSL4 mRNA levels and protein expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> B). We found that the ACSL4 promoter contained four canonical ZEB2-binding E-boxes (CAGGT/CACCT) located at -287, -965, -1038, and -1116 of the ACSL4 promoter, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Therefore, we cloned five segments of the ACSL4 promoter and a control segment to generate promoter-luciferase constructs, based on the location of these E-boxes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). ZEB2 overexpression significantly enhanced the luciferase activity of all five E-box-containing segments of the ACSL4 promoter, whereas no significant change was observed in the control segment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). To examine whether ZEB2 directly binds to the ACSL4 promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using four sets of primers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Primer set 1, which covered segment 1, consistently exhibited apparent ZEB2 binding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref>).

<title>ACSL4 reduces ZEB2 mRNA expression and protein stabilization</title>
<p>We hypothesized that ACSL4 regulates the expression of ZEB2. We then performed quantitative PCR and immunoblotting and observed that both ZEB2 mRNA and protein levels were reduced after the depletion of ACSL4 in the two BCSC cell lines (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). A previous study has reported that ACSL4 regulates c-Myc protein stability in HCC. We reasoned that ACSL4 might in turn regulate the stability of ZEB2. Therefore, we performed a ubiquitination assay to investigate whether ACSL4 regulates ZEB2 protein stability via ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin and myc-ZEB2 expression vectors along with either an empty vector or an ACSL4 overexpression vector. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>, the expression of ACSL4 caused a significant decrease in the ubiquitination of ZEB2, suggesting that ACSL4 attenuated the ubiquitin proteolysis of ZEB2. Notably, co-IP assays revealed a specific interaction between ACSL4 and ZEB2 proteins, supporting the notion that ZEB2 and ACSL4 are present in a protein complex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). To further confirm the role of ACSL4 in the regulation of ZEB2 proteolysis, cycloheximide was added to the cell medium to block the synthesis of new proteins. Interestingly, endogenous ZEB2 protein levels were almost completely suppressed in ACSL4 knockdown cells from 0h to 8h time points (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>). This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that ZEB2 mRNA levels were significantly suppressed by the ACSL4 knockdown. Conversely, ZEB2 protein maintained a relatively steady level at 6 hours in ACSL4 overexpressing cells compared with control cells that undergone obvious ZEB2 proteolysis at 4 hours after adding CHX, indicating an increased ZEB2 protein stability in ACSL4 overexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that ACSL4 not only stabilizes the ZEB2 protein by attenuating its ubiquitination but also upregulates ZEB2 mRNA expression. Therefore, ACSL4 regulates ZEB2 through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.</p>

<title>ACSL4 knockdown inhibits lung metastasis of BLBC in the animal model</title>
<p>To further validate our in vitro findings, we examined the effect of ACSL4 on lung metastasis of breast cancer cells in an animal model. Depletion of ACSL4 resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth and lung colonization of highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). In contrast, the control group showed significantly more lung metastatic nodules (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>) and rapid tumor growth (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8D</xref>). Immunohistochemistry confirmed a striking downregulation of ACSL4, accompanied by ZEB2 and vimentin, compared to those in the control group (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>).</p>

<p>To further validate the role of LD in ACSL4 high-expression cells, we examined LD content in frozen sections of the two groups. Consistent with the in vitro results, there was an obvious reduction in LD accumulation in the ACSL4 depletion tissue compared to that in control tissue (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that ACSL4 promotes the lung metastasis of breast cancer cells in vivo.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The rewiring of metabolic pathways during EMT has only recently been recognized. In addition to glycolysis, dysregulated lipid metabolism has been shown to contribute to cancer invasion and metastasis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Corbet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Soukupova et al., 2021</xref>). Many EMT-driving factors have been found to reprogram the lipid metabolic pathways by regulating metabolic enzymes. For example, TGF-β, a major driver of EMT, activates fatty acid synthase (FASN) and forms a FASN-TGFβ1-FASN positive loop in cisplatin-resistant cells, resulting in EMT induction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hua et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). However, the direct regulation of lipid enzymes by EMT factors remains to be elucidated. Herein, we demonstrated that the lipid rating-enzyme ACSL4 is a direct downstream target of the EMT transcription factor ZEB2 in controlling lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, ZEB2 activates ACSL4 mRNA expression by directly binding to its promoter, which contains four ZEB2 consensus sequences. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between ZEB2 and ACSL4 expression levels in clinical breast cancer samples. ACSL4 re-expression rescues the migration ability of ZEB2-depleted cells. These observations indicated that ACSL4 is crucial for ZEB2-mediated metastasis.</p>
<p>We also demonstrated that ACSL4 directly binds to and stabilizes ZEB2 by reducing its ubiquitination. Our results are consistent with a recent report that ACSL4 stabilizes the oncoprotein c-Myc via the ubiquitin-proteasome system(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). We propose that as an LD enzyme, ACSL4 may participate in the protein degradation system of LD. This is likely to be a novel function of ACSL4. Interestingly, a recent study reported that lipid droplets recruit Numb through the AP2A/ACSL3 complex to promote Numb degradation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, it is likely that lipid droplets act as a platform for protein degradation. Additionally, ACSL4 promoted ZEB2 expression as the mRNA level of ZEB2 was significantly reduced after ACSL4 knockdown. Therefore, ACSL4 regulates ZEB2 not only via a post-transcriptional mechanism but also via a transcriptional mechanism. Notably, the relationship between ZEB2 and ACSL4 could form a positive feedback loop: ZEB2 transcriptionally activates ACSL4, and conversely, ACSL4 stabilizes the ZEB2 protein by reducing its ubiquitination. Amplification of either gene might therefore lock this loop in an active state, resulting in the enhanced invasive and metastatic capabilities of breast cancer cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported that ACSL4 could act as a tumor suppressor or oncogene, depending on the specific cancer type and tissue environment(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Grube et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, ACSL4 could either be located at the cytomembrane or at the lipid droplets and endoplasmic reticulum membrane, indicating the different functions of ACSL4(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Quan et al., 2021</xref>). The cytomembrane ACSL4 is likely responsible for dictating ferroptosis sensitivity by shaping the plasma membrane lipidome, whereas ACSL4 localized to lipid droplets has other functions. We provide evidence that ACSL4, which is located in lipid droplets, is a pro-metastatic factor that promotes invasion and migration. Notably, we demonstrated that ACSL4 depletion significantly suppressed the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ACSL4 and ZEB2 were found to be preferentially expressed in basal-like breast cancer cells and clinical samples that lacked ERα expression, indicating that they are promising targets for highly invasive breast cancer. Survival analysis revealed that high expression of ACSL4 or ZEB2 is associated with worse post-progression survival than low expression in patients with breast cancer. It is worth noting that there was no difference in the overall survival between ACSL4 or ZEB2 high- and low-expression breast cancer patients (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that ACSL4 and ZEB2 could specifically be used as prognostic markers for advanced breast cancer, and these axes hold promise as new metabolic therapeutic targets for advanced breast cancer.</p>
<p>Although ACSL4 has been shown to play an essential role in metastasis in many types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Maloberti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), its mechanism of ACSL4-mediated metastasis is not fully understood. ACSL4 is a member of the long-chain fatty acetyl-CoA synthetase enzyme family that catalyzes fatty acids to their active form, acyl-CoA, which can be directed to anabolism or catabolism, depending on the cellular background. We observed that the knockdown of ACSL4 significantly reduced the number and size of LD, indicating that fatty acids were directed to anabolism to form LD by ACSL4. Indeed, it has been shown that fatty acids are stored in LD before entering fatty acid oxidation, and the formation of LD is required for fatty acids oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Petan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Welte and Gould, 2017</xref>). This is in line with our observation that exogenous fatty acids (oleic acid) significantly enhance lipid droplet accumulation and migration. Importantly, lipidomic analysis revealed that the knockdown of ACSL4 significantly decreased the incorporation of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids into different species of lipids, including triacylglycerols (TAG), phospholipids (PE, PC), and cholesteryl esters (CE). Consistently, Frozen tissue sections from a metastatic animal model confirmed that high ACSL4 expression was accompanied by apparent LD accumulation. These results suggest that ACSL4 is a crucial regulator that promotes lipid storage during breast cancer metastasis. Interestingly, knockdown of ACSL4 restored the expression of E-cadherin, an essential adhesion molecule, indicating that ACSL4 promotes tumor invasion through multiple mechanisms.</p>
<p>Reprogramming of lipid metabolism is an essential step in metastasis. Lipid droplets are highly dynamic monolayer membrane-bound organelles involved in energy utilization, signal transduction, and cancer invasion. The number and size of LD are associated with cancer aggressiveness(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cruz et al., 2020</xref>). We observed that highly invasive breast cancer cells were enriched with LD. Using fluorescence microscopy, we noticed that the number of LD was significantly reduced after cell migration. Our findings are in line with a recent study showing that LD undergo lipolysis during the process of migration in pancreatic cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rozeveld et al., 2020</xref>). It is likely that fatty acids are released from lipid droplets and form acyl-CoA, which enters OXPHOS to support the energy needed for metastasis. Therefore, these data support the notion that increased LD accumulation is a priming state prior to metastasis, and that LD are crucial resources to fuel the process of metastasis.</p>
<p>In addition, we observed that ACSL4 also participates in FA catabolism, as the long-chain fatty acid-derived OCR rate and ATP production were significantly reduced in ACSL4-depleted cells, indicating that ACSL4 is essential for FAO stimulation. Our results are in line with a recent study that reported that hexokinase 2 enhances tumorigenicity by activating the ACSL4-mediated fatty acid β-oxidation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, the expression of CPT1, a rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, was significantly reduced in the ACSL4-depleted cells. Among the three isoforms of CPT1, CPT1A is the only isoform regulated by ACSL4. We proposed that ACSL4 promotes FAO and ATP production by upregulating CPT1A, thereby providing energy support for breast cancer metastasis. Our results reveal the mechanism of previous findings that FAO is a critical energy pathway in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Camarda et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the finding that ACSL4 promotes FAO to fuel metastasis, we observed that lactate levels did not change after ACSL4 knockdown, suggesting that glycolysis is not involved in ACSL4-mediated energy metabolism. Therefore, we propose a model in which cell migration is a multistep process accompanied by dynamic cellular lipid metabolic changes. At the pre-metastatic stage, ACSL4 enhances LD accumulation by promoting lipogenesis. During metastasis, ACSL4 stimulates fatty acid oxidation to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we provide insights into the mechanistic links between EMT and lipid metabolism and identify the ZEB2/ACSL4 axis as a novel metastatic metabolic pathway that stimulates both lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, resulting in enhanced breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Importantly, our results demonstrate that ACSL4 is a direct downstream target of ZEB2 in controlling lipid storage and LD accumulation, which are important steps and energy pools for metastasis. Clinically, our findings identified ZEB2-ACSL4 signalling as an attractive therapeutic target for overcoming breast cancer metastasis. Elevated ACSL4 levels can be used as an effective marker for predicting cancer progression in patients with advanced breast cancer.</p>

<p>In this study, Jiamin Lin et al. investigated the potential positive feedback loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4, which regulates lipid metabolism and breast cancer metastasis. They reported a correlation between high expression of ZEB2 and ACSL4 and poor survival of breast cancer patients, and showed that depletion of ZEB2 or ACSL4 significantly reduced lipid droplets abundance and cell migration in vitro. The authors also claimed that ZEB2 activated ACSL4 expression by directly binding to its promoter, while ACSL4 in turn stabilized ZEB2 by blocking its ubiquitination. While the topic is interesting, there are several major concerns with the study and its conclusions are not convincing.</p>
<p>1. Figure 1A, the clinical relevance or biological significance of drug-resistant luminal breast cancer cell lines with metastatic cancer is questionable. Additionally, the RNA-seq analysis lacked multiple test correction for differential gene expression analysis, and no fold-change cut-off was used, leading to incorrect thresholds and wrongly identified significant signals.</p>
<p>2. Figure 1D-E, the clinical associations between ACSL4 and ZEB2 overexpression and poor patient survival are not justified. The authors used an old web tool, the Kaplan-Meier plotter database, based on microarray data, to perform the analysis. The reviewer repeated the analysis and found that multiple microarray probes for ZEB2 were available, leading to opposite results when different probes were selected. The reviewer also repeated the analysis using more reliable TCGA RNA-seq data and found no correlation between ASCL4 or ZEB2 expression and post-progression survival.</p>
<p>3. Figure 1I relied on IHC to support the negative correlation between ACSL4 and Erα expression, but the small sample size limits the power to establish the relationship and the results are not definitive without further replication or biological investigation. The authors should provide more detailed and comprehensive analysis, including appropriate statistical tests, to ensure the findings are robust and reliable.</p>
<p>4. Figure 3B-C lacks justification of the differences by showing only one field without any internal control for exposure. The reviewer suggests to show additional fields where cells with both efficiently and inefficiently knocked-down are present, to justify the robustness of the results. This can also be achieved by mixing control and knockdown cells.</p>
<p>5. Figure 4A-D, oleate-induced cell migration is a well-documented feature across different cancer types. To make it more relevant to the current study, the authors should examine multiple cell lines with high and low ZEB2/ACSL4 expression to determine the underlying relevance.</p>
<p>6. Figure 4E, it is difficulty to conclude that cancer cells utilize stored lipids during migration to fuel metastasis based on current data. Do you see any evidence of lipid signal decreasing in the leading edge of the scratch wound-healing migration assay? The authors should also compare signals between unmigrated and migrated cells in the transwell assay.</p>
<p>7. Figure 6 warrants a genome-wide ChIP-seq to justify direct regulation of ASCL4 promoter by ZEB2. The reviewer's analysis of publicly available ZEB2 ChIP-seq in multiple cell types detected no ZEB2 binding signaling within {plus minus} 5 kb of ASCL4 promoter.</p>
<p>8. Figure 7 presents a series of self-contradictory results. Figure 7C, why no significant change in ZEB2-MYC expression was observed in the presence of ACSL4 and/or HA-Ubi? In Figure 7 E&amp;G, why robust ACSL4 expression is present in the control group in (E) but not in (G)? Additionally, why there is no degradation in ZEB2 baseline level over time in the shACSL4 group in (E)? These raise severe concerns about the data quality.</p>
<p>9. Figure 7D, the IP result of ACSL4 is not justified as there is no enrichment of ACSL4 in the IP compared to input. With the current data, it is hard to justify that there is any direct interaction. Moreover, based on IF data in Figure 3B-C, ACSL4 is exclusively localized in the cytoplasm, while ZEB2 is exclusively localized in the nucleus. It is hard to believe there is any direct interaction and mutual regulation.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors validated a positive feedback loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4 in breast cancer, which regulates lipid metabolism to promote metastasis.</p>
<p>Overall, the study is original, well structured, and easy to read. Despite the reliability of the data discussed in this article, there are still some deficiencies that need to be addressed through further explanation.</p>
<p>Major issues:</p>
<p>1. The authors demonstrated that ACSL4 regulates ZEB2 not only via a post-transcriptional mechanism but also via a transcriptional mechanism. The authors have not provided a comprehensive explanation of the specific mechanism in this paper. Therefore, it is recommended that the author delve into the potential mechanisms in the discussion section. For example, related mechanisms affecting ZEB2 ubiquitination degradation, as well as factors affecting ZEB2 upstream transcriptional regulation, etc.</p>
<p>2. To further clarify the interaction of ZEB2 and ACSL4, it is best to perform in vitro glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay and immunofluorescence assay.</p>
<p>3. In Figure 7B, the protein level of ZEB2 seems not to be altered in BT549 BCSC cell line after the depletion of ACSL4.</p>
<p>4. EMT is characterized by changes in cell morphology, so the staining of cytoskeletons with Phalloidin is needed.</p>
<p>5. Additional breast cancer cases or cohorts (such as TMA) should be used to validate the positive correlation between ACSL4 and ZEB2 expression through IHC analysis.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Lin et al. reveals a novel positive regulatory loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4, which promotes lipid droplets storage to meet the energy needs of breast cancer metastasis. It is of interest, however, some concerns should be addressed to strengthen the finding.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>1. The effect of ZEB2 overexpression is not fully demonstrated in the whole study. This point should be addressed.</p>
<p>2. Does the addition of oleate restore the ability of migration or invasion in ACSL4 knockdown cells?</p>
<p>3. Which cellular compartment does ACSL4 localize in and interact with ZEB2 to stabilize ZEB2?</p>
<p>4. The ubiquitination assay and Co-IP assay are just performed in HEK293T cells. This result should be confirmed in MDA-MB-231 cells or Taxol-resistant MCF-7 cells.</p>
<p>5. How does ACSL4 regulate ZEB2 at the mRNA level？Please verify.</p>
<p>6. In Fig. 2F, the silencing efficiency for ACSL4 and ZEB2 should be shown. In addition, the protein level of ZEB2 or ACSL4 in shZEB2 and shZEB2+ACSL4 groups should also be addressed.</p>
<p>7. What is the survival status of patients with both high expression of ACSL4 and ZEB2 in TCGA. In addition, more survival data from databases especially patients with both high expression of ACSL4 and ZEB2 are needed to analyze to support the finding.</p>
