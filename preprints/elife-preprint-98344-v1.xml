<title>Abstract</title><p>Since the precursor frequency of naïve T cells is extremely low, investigating the early steps of antigen-specific T cell activation is challenging. To overcome this detection problem, adoptive transfer of a cohort of T cells purified from T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic donors has been extensively used but is not readily available for emerging pathogens. Constructing TCR transgenic mice from T cell hybridomas is a labor-intensive and sometimes erratic process, since the best clones are selected based on antigen-induced CD69 upregulation or IL-2 production in vitro, and TCR chains are PCR-cloned into expression vectors. Here, we exploited the rapid advances in single cell sequencing and TCR repertoire analysis to select the best clones without hybridoma selection, and generated CORSET8 mice (CORona Spike Epitope specific CD8 T cell), carrying a TCR specific for the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Implementing newly created DALI software for TCR repertoire analysis in single cell analysis enabled the rapid selection of the ideal responder CD8 T cell clone, based on antigen reactivity, proliferation and immunophenotype in vivo. In contrast, a traditional method based on hybridoma technology was unsuccessful. Identified TCR sequences were inserted as synthetic DNA into an expression vector and transgenic CORSET8 donor mice were created. After immunization with Spike/CpG-motifs, mRNA vaccination or SARS-CoV2 infection, CORSET8 T cells strongly proliferated and showed signs of T cell activation. Thus, a combination of TCR repertoire analysis and scRNA immunophenotyping allowed rapid selection of antigen-specific TCR sequences that can be used to generate TCR transgenic mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the key features of adaptive immunity is the enormous receptor diversity of lymphocytes, which is estimated to cover over 10<sup>10</sup> unique sequences for T cells alone ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lythe et al., 2016</xref>). This empowers the adaptive immune system to tackle an infinite number of invaders. Every single clone cannot expand before antigen encounter because of space constraints and therefore circulates at extremely low precursor frequency. This low precursor frequency has impeded the detailed study of early antigen-specific T cell responses <italic>in vivo</italic>, despite the advent of peptide-MHC tetramers that can detect rare antigen-specific cells after whole body enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Altman and Davis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dileepan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Moon et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Shin et al., 2023</xref>). To overcome this detection problem, adoptive transfer of a cohort of naive T cells derived from T cell receptor transgenic mice (TCR Tg), which harbour high numbers of a single clonotypic T-cell population, has been extensively used. This technique allowed the tracking of clonal activation, expansion, differentiation and migration to many model antigens and pathogens, even in early phases of the adaptive immune response, which has greatly contributed to answering key questions in T cell biology in vaccinology, infectious models, cancer, autoimmunity and allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Attridge and Walker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coquet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kisielow et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Miura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Oxenius et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Although many TCR transgenic mouse models are now commercially available and are extensively used in many fields, it is sometimes still needed to rapidly generate a new TCR transgenic mouse. This is certainly the case for emerging pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, for which no research tools were readily available in 2019. The generation of TCR Tg mice necessitates the selection of a functionally relevant TCR clone whose TCR Vα- and Vβ-chains are subsequently expressed in a vector that is highly expressed in thymocytes, causing an effective skewing from a polyclonal to a monoclonal repertoire due to allelic exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Irving et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). To obtain clonotypic information, the coding sequence for the TCR α- and β-chains are extracted from antigen-reactive T cell clones. The most often used method to find rare antigen-reactive clones relies on immunization of mice with relevant antigen, and the <italic>ex vivo</italic> generation of easily expandable immortal T hybridoma cells from splenocytes. Hybridomas are then selected for reactivity to immunodominant peptides, often independent of cellular phenotype or function, but merely based on upregulation of CD69 or production of IL-2 as a sign for antigen sensitivity. From these hybridomas, the coding regions for the Vα- and Vβ-chain can be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-cloned into a CD4 expression vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Vanheerswynghels et al., 2018</xref>)</p>
<p>The successful selection of a TCR clone that can be used for transgenesis and ultimately as a T cell donor to study antiviral responses depends on two key factors: first, the T cell epitope needs to be antigenic, immunogenic, and stable across pathogenic variants. Second, the TCR clone needs sufficient affinity to the epitope presented on an MHC molecule, as this determines the strength and kinetics of the immune response. In other words, affinity of the TCR determines the proliferative advantage of an effector cell or the tendency to form long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kavazović et al., 2018</xref>). Often, the selection process based on hybridoma selection yields multiple epitope specific clones that upregulate CD69 or IL-2, and only minimal functional parameters are checked before prioritizing one clone to proceed with. This can result in the generation of TCR Tg mice whose T cells do not respond optimally in a biological setting, fail to compete with endogenous polyclonal T cells upon adoptive transfer, or fail to form memory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bartleson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Milam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Weber et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we provide an optimized approach for TCR clone selection that no longer requires hybridoma technology but capitalizes on recent technological advances in the single cell sequencing field that combine analysis of cellular heterogeneity of responding T cells with immune receptor profiling (VDJseq). We have recently developed the interactive DALI software tool, which is an R software package which allows for fast identification and analysis of T- and B cell receptor diversity in high-throughput single-cell sequencing data using command line or a graphical user interface (GUI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Verstaen et al., 2022</xref>). Owing to the browser-based interactive GUI, immunologists having limited coding experience can effectively analyze these complex datasets. The DALI tool facilitates linking TCR clonotype information to functional properties, immunophenotype and precursor frequency of individual T cells within a polyclonal response to vaccination or infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Information like clonotype diversity, clonotype expansion and differentially expressed genes between clonotypes allows for rationalized TCR sequence selection, and for generation of TCR Tg mice.</p>
<p>As a proof of concept that this strategy is helpful, we generated CD8 TCR Tg mice carrying a TCR specific for a Spike Epitope of the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus. We first generated a (<bold>COR</bold>ona <bold>S</bold>pike <bold>E</bold>pitope specific CD<bold>8 T</bold> cell) <bold>CORSET8</bold> line based on traditional T cell hybridoma technology and selection, which eventually yielded a poorly reactive TCR transgenic line. As an alternative, rationalized approach, we applied scRNA and TCR sequencing and subsequent analysis of the T cell clones via the DALI tool. This latter approach allowed us to a priori evaluate key characteristics required for the development of TCR Tg T cells, including cytokine production, cellular phenotype, and physiologically relevant clonal expansion. Importantly, the generation of fully functional TCR transgenic mice took only a fraction of the workload and time in comparison to the classical approach. CORSET8 mice and the resulting transgenic T cells were thoroughly evaluated by <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> methods following vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The streamlined method for generating TCR Tg mice, as presented here, offers an attractive approach for future TCR Tg mouse development.</p>

<title>Generation of CORSET8 mice based on hybridoma technology</title>
<p>Designing a TCR transgenic mouse starts with the selection of the antigen epitope to which the TCR is addressed using peptide libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhuang et al., 2021</xref>) and/or computational scanning combined with a cellular activity assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Erez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Vandersarren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Vanheerswynghels et al., 2018</xref>). In a first approach to generate CORSET8 Tg mice, we used the IEDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Vita et al., 2018</xref>) to predict the most promising MHCI binding Spike epitopes and made use of the classical hybridoma technology to create the transgenic mice. To induce Spike reactive T cells, we immunized C57BL/6 mice by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of Spike protein and CpG adjuvant every 14 days for a total of three immunisations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 II</xref> and Suppl. Fig. 1). After fusion of these reactive T cells to the BW5147 lymphoma, the obtained T-cell hybridoma clones were scored for their IL-2 production upon stimulation with a Spike peptide pool (INITRFQTL, IWLGFIAGL, GNYNYLYRL, VVFLHVTYV, FQFCNDPFL). Compared to medium control, clone 47 had the strongest fold increase in IL-2 (Suppl. Fig. 1A). This clone also upregulated CD69 in the presence of the Spike peptide pool (Suppl. Fig. 1B). Therefore, clone 47 was prioritized and used for the generation of a TCR Tg mouse. However, CD8 T cells from the newly generated CORSET8 mice did not respond to Spike peptide or Spike protein in a BM-DC co-culture experiment (Suppl. Fig. 1C). To check if CORSET8 mice had transgenic T cells with a functioning TCR at all, we crossed these mice with <italic>Rag1</italic>-deficient mice that are unable to generate polyclonal T cells. We readily detected CD8 T cells even on the <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> background (Suppl. Fig. 1D), demonstrating that the TCR was expressed and was of high enough affinity to cause positive selection of CD8 T cells, and therefore functional. Due to the lack of responsiveness, we discontinued this mouse line immediately after it was generated, illustrating that the design of a useful TCR Tg mouse model is an erratic process that can be optimized.</p>

<title>Generation of CORSET8 mice based on single cell and TCR repertoire analysis</title>
<p>Given the unsuccessful generation of CORSET8 mice using the classical hybridoma approach, we decided to rationalize clone selection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To this end, we immunized mice as described in the previous section (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 II</xref>). From these mice, we sorted splenic T cells and used an MHC class I tetramer to discriminate Spike-reactive and non-reactive T cells (Suppl. Fig. 2). The tetramer identifies CD8 T cells directed to a conserved and highly immunogenic epitope (VNFNFNGL) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The latter has been confirmed by multiple studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carmen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Erez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhuang et al., 2021</xref>). A naïve mouse was taken along as a backdrop for the cellular phenotypes. Ultimately, we subjected 3 samples for single cell sequencing: Tetramer positive T cells originating from the immunised mice, Tetramer negative T cells originating from the immunized mice, and tetramer negative T cells originating from the naïve control mouse. Clustering of these cells revealed different cellular clusters among sorted CD8 T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Tetramer+ cells formed a distinct cluster on the UMAP reduced dimensional space (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The highest differentially expressed genes of the different clusters are plotted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>. A subgroup of Tetramer+ cells had a distinct phenotype, marked by increased expression of proliferation and activation markers such as <italic>Mki67</italic> and <italic>Gzmb a</italic>nd transcription factors regulating CD8 effector differentiation such as <italic>Tbet</italic> and <italic>Bhlhe40</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sullivan et al., 2003</xref>), highlighting their activated T effector state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). Next, TCRseq data was linked to the Seurat object using our DALI tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Verstaen et al., 2022</xref>), which allows for command line or GUI analysis of TCR data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Upon subsetting and reclustering of the Tetramer+ cells from immunized mice, 3 clusters were defined, of which cluster 1 showed high expression of <italic>Mki67</italic>, while both cluster 0 and 1 showed high expression of <italic>Ifng</italic> and activation markers <italic>Cd69</italic> and <italic>Nr4a1</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-F</xref>). Assessing clonal expansion, we found that cluster 0 and 1 contained highly expanded clones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). When assessing clonal expansion in more detail, we found clonotype1 to be highly expanded in cluster 0 and 1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H-I</xref>). Given the phenotypic characteristics of the cells harbouring this clonotype, and the observed clonal expansion, we decided to continue using this clonotype for the generation of TCR Tg mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>). The selected Vα and Vβ TCR sequences were ordered as gBlocks (IDT) and subsequently cloned into the CD4 expression vector p428 via SalI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Vanheerswynghels et al., 2018</xref>). Injection fragments we excised from the p428 backbone by NotI digestion, gel purified and injected into fertilized C57BL/6 oocytes.</p>

<title>CORSET8 mice exhibit normal T cell populations and TCR Tg cells recognize target peptide <italic>ex vivo</italic></title>
<p>The distribution of splenic CD4 T and CD8 T cells was unaltered in the newly generated CORSET8 mice compared to wildtype mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Both CD4 T and CD8 T cells displayed a normal frequency of naïve (CD62L<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>−</sup>), central memory (CD62L<sup>+</sup> CD44<sup>+</sup>) and effector (CD62L<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>) T cell populations, although there was a small but significant increase in the central memory pool, as expected based on the phenotype of the cells harboring clonotype 1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Staining of the splenocytes with the Spike Tetramer that was initially used to identify target epitope directed T cells, revealed that about 70% of total CD8 T cells of the CORSET mice on a <italic>Rag1</italic> sufficient background were transgenic cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Next, we aimed to functionally evaluate the generated CORSET8 TCR Tg T cells. Therefore, we co- cultured BM-DCs and Cell Tracer Violet (CTV)-labelled CORSET8 T cells in the presence of increasing doses of Spike peptide (VNFNFNGL, 0-10 µg/ml) for 4 days. The dilution of the cell proliferation dye CTV reflects the augmented proliferation of the CORSET8 cells in correspondence with the antigenic dose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Notably, the CORSET8 cells responded to minute doses of Spike peptide (10 pg/ml), illustrating that the CORSET8 cells express a strong affinity TCR. Furthermore, the CD4 and CD8 T cell distribution in the thymus of the CORSET8 Tg animals showed significant skewing to the CD8+ T cell subset, which also hinted towards successful transgene expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>

<p>As a final validation of our mouse model, we used the CORSET8 cells in a SARS-CoV-2 infection model, conducted under BSL3 conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). As wildtype mice are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we made use of K18-hACE2 Tg mice, the standard mouse model for SARS-CoV-2 research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Moreau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Rathnasinghe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Winkler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yinda et al., 2021</xref>). hACE2<sup>Tg/wt</sup> mice and their control wildtype littermates were infected with 450 pfu SARS-CoV-2 or mock.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Adoptive transfer models using TCR transgenic mice as donors of antigen reactive T cells have made it possible to study early T cell responses at clonal level, which is otherwise very strenuous given the extensive variety of polyclonal T cell clones. This broad variety causes low progenitor frequency of any given clone in the pre-immune repertoire, rendering the tracking of early responses exceedingly difficult. In addition, these models confer a significant advantage to T cell research, as they allow to study the functional status of antigen-specific T cells, but also cell-fate decisions to effector cells, Tfh cells or memory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Grayson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tubo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">West et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The standard method for generating TCR Tg mice comprises immunization of an animal, isolation of T cells out of lymphoid organs and examination of T cell reactivity by i<italic>n vitro</italic> restimulation of T cell hybridoma clones. T cell receptors are then identified crudely using PCR primers and antibodies from the antigen-specific T cell clones, often without knowing the detailed sequence of the Vα and Vβ chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barnden et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bosteels et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coquet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nindl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Oxenius et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Plantinga et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Vanheerswynghels et al., 2018</xref>). The generation of functional TCR Tg mouse models depends on several key steps. A first essential step is the selection of the antigen epitope, which is either done by using peptide libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhuang et al., 2021</xref>) or by computational scanning combined with a cellular activity assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Erez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Vandersarren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Vanheerswynghels et al., 2018</xref>). Second, the selected T cell clones need to be able to mount antigen specific responses. The only way that currently TCRs are screened for this essential characteristic is by stimulating them with antigen peptide or co-culture with antigen-pulsed BM-DCs, whereafter their proliferation, CD69 upregulation and IL-2 cytokine production is assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bosteels et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coquet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nindl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Oxenius et al., 1998</xref>). While these assays report on the potential to activate the TCR bearing clone, it does not inform on fitness/competition of the ensuing clone in a polyclonal environment, nor is it known what the effect of the TCR will be on Tg T cell development into the cell-fate of interest. The importance of the latter has been highlighted by multiple publications. By integrating a single (TCR-transgenic) T cell clone with high- or low-affinity ligands, the impact of affinity on effector and memory potential has been examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Knudson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zehn et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, whereas effector cells are mainly found amongst high-affinity clones, memory cells recognize antigens with lower affinity and benefit from more clonal diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kavazović et al., 2018</xref>). Distinct mechanisms drive effector/memory development in high- and low-affinity T cells, such as regulation of IL-12R signalling, T-bet and Eomes expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Knudson et al., 2013</xref>). It has also been shown that upon weak TCR-ligand interactions, expansion of activated naïve T cells will stop earlier than after strong TCR-ligand interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zehn et al., 2009</xref>). On top of that, tonic signalling also determines cell-fate decisions. For instance, using CD4 TCR-transgenic mice, it has been shown that the strength of tonic signalling determines whether the cells will become Tfh cells or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bartleson et al., 2020</xref>)The same authors showed that the potential to react to tonic MHC signals, reflected by the potential of a clone to upregulate CD5, can also profoundly influence whether a given TCR will induce and immediate effector proliferative response, or rather give a memory response, even when the affinity of two clones for the same immunodominant epitope is nearly identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Milam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Weber et al., 2012</xref>). The affinity bias of the TCR-MHC interaction leading to long term memory and residence, particularly in tissues are still not clear. We predict that the method that we propose here which is based on selection of TCRs based on immunophenotype could lead to selection of clones and generation of TCR Tg T cells whose T cells are biased to become either immediate effectors or long-term memory cells.</p>
<p>Given the costs and time investment to generate TCR Tg mice, other labs have also invested in optimizing the strenuous process. For example, Holst. <italic>et al</italic>. (2006) introduced a new model called a retrogenic (‘retro’ from retrovirus and ‘genic’ from transgenic) mouse which significantly speeds up the process by using retrovirus-mediated stem cell gene transfer of the TCR alpha and beta sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Holst et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Guo et al. (2016)</xref> described an efficient system for antigen-specific αβTCR cloning and CDR3 substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, they introduced a novel reporter cell line (Nur77-GFP Jurkat 76 TCRα<sup>−</sup>β<sup>−</sup>) to characterize functional activity of these αβ and γδ TCRs. More recently, a CRISPR-mediated TCR replacement technique was introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Legut <italic>et al</italic>. (2018)</xref> where the endogenous TCRβ sequence gets replaced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Legut et al., 2018</xref>). In this way, issues like competition with the endogenous TCRs for surface expression or mispairing between endogenous and transgenic TCRs (mixed dimer formation) are excluded. T cell receptor exchange (TRex) mice, where the TCR sequence is integrated in the T-cell receptor α constant (TRAC) locus, results in the expression steered by the endogenous promoter and regulatory flanking regions and circumvents the problem of random integration of the construct in the mouse genome. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Rollins <italic>et al</italic>. (2023)</xref> extended the TRex-method by disrupting the expression of the gene to which their Tg TCR was directed to, thereby circumventing T cell tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Rollins et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In an attempt to further rationalize and streamline the selection of functional T cell clones, with high fitness and phenotype of interest, we combined single cell gene expression and TCR analysis. To generate our CORSET8 mice, we selected a T cell clone that expressed proliferation markers (<italic>Mki67</italic><sup>+</sup>), produced cytokines (<italic>Ifng</italic><sup>+</sup>), and had the potential to become a memory cell (<italic>Cd69</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>Tcf7<sup>+</sup></italic>, <italic>Sell<sup>−</sup></italic>). This approach, in which we rationalize every step of TCR Tg mouse generation, can be used to any antigen of interest. Of note, the newly generated DALI tool is user-friendly and free to use, even for immunologists with limited bioinformatics background. We found this approach to be highly time efficient compared to classical methods (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> for timelines), albeit with increased reagent costs for single cell sequencing. Nonetheless, the rationalized selection of TCR clones might circumvent the expensive generation of poorly functional TCR Tg mouse lines, which additionally conflicts with the reduction arm of the 3R principle.</p>

Normalization, detecting highly variable genes, finding clusters, and creating UMAP plots and marker gene identification was done using the Seurat pipeline (v3.1.5). Potential doublets were removed from the analysis. TCR data was integrated into the Seurat object using DALI 2.0.0 for downstream analysis.</p>

<title>Generation of CORSET8 mice starting from DALI derived TCR sequences</title>
<p>The selected Vα and Vβ TCR sequences were ordered as gBlocks (IDT) and subsequently cloned into the CD4 expression vector p428 via SalI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Vanheerswynghels et al., 2018</xref>). Injection fragments we excised from the p428 backbone by NotI digestion, gel purified and injected in an equimolar solution of 1 ng/μL into fertilized C57BL/6 oocytes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Debeuf et al. introduce a new, fast method for the selection of suitable T cell clones to generate TCR transgenic mice, a method claimed to outperform traditional hybridoma-based approaches. Clone selection is based on the assessment of the expansion and phenotype of cells specific for a known epitope following immune stimulation. The analysis is facilitated by a new software tool for TCR repertoire and function analysis termed DALI. This work also introduces a potentially invaluable TCR transgenic mouse line specific for SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The newly introduced method proved successful in the quick generation of a TCR transgenic mouse line. Clone selection is based on more comprehensive phenotypical information than traditional methods, providing the opportunity for a more rational T cell clone selection.</p>
<p>The study provides a software tool for TCR repertoire analysis and its linkage with function.</p>
<p>The findings entail general practical implications in the preclinical study of a potentially very broad range of infectious diseases or vaccination.</p>
<p>A novel SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific TCR transgenic mouse line was generated.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors attempt to compare their novel method with a more conventional approach to developing TCR transgenic mice. In this reviewer's opinion, this comparison appears imperfect in several ways:</p>
<p>• Work presenting the &quot;traditional&quot; method was inadequate to justify the selection of a suitable clone. It is therefore not surprising that it yielded negative results. More evidence would have been necessary to select clone 47 for further development of the TCR transgenic line, especially considering the significant time and investment required to create such a line.</p>
<p>• The comparison is somewhat unfair, because the methods start at different points: while the traditional method was attempted using a pool of peptides whose immunogenicity does not appear to have been established, the new method starts by utilising tetramers to select T cells specific for a well-established epitope.</p>
<p>• Given the costs and time involved, only a single clone could be tested for either method, intrinsically making a proper comparison unfeasible. Even for their new method, the authors' ability to demonstrate that the selected clone is ideal is limited unless they made different clones with varying profiles to show that a particular profile was superior to others.</p>
<p>In my view, there was no absolute need to compare this method with existing ones, as the proposed method holds intrinsic value.</p>
<p>While having more data to decide on clone selection is certainly beneficial, given the additional cost, it remains unclear whether knowing the expression profiles of different proteins in Figure 2 aids in selecting a candidate. Is a cell expressing more CD69 preferable to a cell expressing less of this marker? Would either have been effective? Are there any transcriptional differences between clonotype 1 and 2 (red colour in Figure 2G) that justify selecting clone 1, or was the decision to select the latter merely based on their different frequency? If all major clones (i.e. by clonotype count) present similar expression profiles, would it have been necessary to know much more about their expression profiles? Would TCR sequencing and an enumeration of clones have sufficed, and been a more cost-effective approach?</p>
<p>Lastly, it appears that several of the experiments presented were conducted only once. This information should have been explicitly stated in the figure legends.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors seek to use single-cell sequencing approaches to identify TCRs specific for the SARS CoV2 spike protein, select a candidate TCR for cloning, and use it to construct a TCR transgenic mouse. The argument is that this process is less cumbersome than the classical approach, which involves the identification of antigen-reactive T cells in vitro and the construction of T cell hybridomas prior to TCR cloning. TCRs identified by single-cell sequencing that are already paired to transcriptomic data would more rapidly identify TCRs that are likely to contribute to a functional response. The authors successfully identify TCRs that have expanded in response to SARS CoV2 spike protein immunization, bind to MHC tetramers, and express genes associated with functional response. They then select a TCR for cloning and construction of a transgenic mouse in order to test the response of resulting T cells in vivo following immunization with spike protein of coronavirus infection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study provides proof of principle for the identification and characterization of TCRs based on single-cell sequencing data.</p>
<p>(2) The authors employ a recently developed software tool (DALI) that assists in linking transcriptomic data to individual clones.</p>
<p>(3) The authors successfully generate a TCR transgenic animal derived from the most promising T cell clone (CORSET8) using the TCR sequencing approach.</p>
<p>(4) The authors provide initial evidence that CORSET8 T cells undergo activation and proliferation in vivo in response to immunization or infection.</p>
<p>(5) Procedures are well-described and readily reproducible.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The purpose of presenting a failed attempt to generate TCR transgenic mice using a traditional TCR hybridoma method is unclear. The reasons for the failure are uncertain, and the inclusion of this data does not really provide information on the likely success rate of the hybridoma vs single cell approach for TCR identification, as only a single example is provided for either.</p>
<p>(2) There is little information provided regarding the functional differentiation of the CORSET8 T cells following challenge in vivo, including expression of molecules associated with effector function, cytokine production, killing activity, and formation of memory. The study would be strengthened by some evidence that CORSET8 T cells are successfully recapitulating the functional features of the endogenous immune response (beyond simply proliferating and expressing CD44). This information is important to evaluate whether the presented sequencing-based identification and selection of TCRs is likely to result in T-cell responses that replicate the criteria for selecting the TCR in the first place.</p>
<p>(3) While I find the argument reasonable that the approach presented here has a lot of likely advantages over traditional approaches for generating TCR transgenic animals, the use of TCR sequencing data to identify TCRs for study in a variety of areas, including cancer immunotherapy and autoimmunity, is in broad use. While much of this work opts for alternative methods of TCR expression in primary T cells (i.e. CRISPR or retroviral approaches), the process of generating a TCR transgenic mouse from a cloned TCR is not in itself novel. It would be helpful if the authors could provide a more extensive discussion explaining the novelty of their approach for TCR identification in comparison to other more modern approaches, rather than only hybridoma generation.</p>
