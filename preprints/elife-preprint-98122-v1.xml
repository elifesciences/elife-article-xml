<title>Abstract</title><p>Striatal spiny-projection neurons (SPNs) integrate glutamatergic inputs from the motor cortex and thalamus with neuromodulatory signals to regulate motor output. <italic>In vivo</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging has demonstrated that ensembles of direct and indirect pathway SPNs (dSPNs, iSPNs) are coactive during spontaneous movement. Co-activity is statistically greater among nearby neurons, correlates with behavioral state, and undergoes plasticity in an SPN-type-specific manner under pathological conditions. This spatially clustered co-activity could reflect shared excitatory inputs. However, whether and how synaptic mechanisms generate this distinctive spatiotemporal activity is unknown. Here, we show that the Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), which regulates synaptic strength at corticostriatal synapses, is a key mediator of spatially clustered SPN co-activity. Pharmacological modulation of mGluR5 signaling bidirectionally altered movement and spatially clustered dynamics, but not the absolute level of activity of dSPNs. Targeted deletion of mGluR5 in dSPNs recapitulated the effects on spatiotemporal neural dynamics and movement demonstrating a striatum-specific effect of mGluR5. Targeted deletion of mGluR5 also produced changes in the synaptic properties of dSPNs. These results show that properties of excitatory synapses influence motor function by shaping the characteristic spatially clustered patterns of co-activity that typify dSPN activation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The dorsal striatum is central to movement initiation and to regulating the kinematics of learned movements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Synaptic plasticity in this input structure of the basal ganglia has been demonstrated to be important for motor learning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In particular, the strength of corticostriatal synapses formed between the motor cortex and spiny-projection neurons (SPNs) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) are strengthened by learning a motor sequence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> or during the acquisition of a new motor skill <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Glutamatergic, corticostriatal inputs form synapses onto two types of SPNs that are distinguished by their expression of dopamine receptor subtypes and downstream axonal projections. The D1 dopamine receptor-expressing, or direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs) project monosynaptically to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and globus pallidus internal segment (GPi). By contrast, D2 dopamine receptor-expressing SPNs (iSPNs) project indirectly to basal ganglia output nuclei via the globus pallidus external segment (GPe) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In classical models of the basal ganglia circuit, activity in dSPNs facilitates movement and activity in iSPNs inhibits movement. Therefore, the relative level of activity between the two populations predicts an animal’s motor state, for instance whether the animal is moving or at rest. This rate-model framework of striatal function garnered early support from anatomical and pharmacological observations as well as findings from studies investigating the neuropathology of striatum-related neurodegenerative disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>However, the rate-model is inconsistent with more recent observations employing <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging techniques. In these studies, where the activity of genetically defined iSPNs and dSPNs can be monitored concurrently in awake behaving animals, dSPNs and iSPNs are consistently co-active during movement initiation and procession through movement sequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. More recently, it was shown that dSPNs and iSPNs simultaneously activate with spatially clustered dynamics, and this spatiotemporal co-activity is important for motor control <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Spatiotemporal clustering, or heightened co-activity among proximal SPN pairs, is most pronounced during periods of rest as well as during transitions from rest to movement and subsides as SPNs become more active during movement progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Importantly, dopamine signaling appears to play an important role in sculpting these dynamics. The loss of dopamine diminishes the spatiotemporal coordination of iSPN activity, while heightened dopamine release de-correlates activity in dSPNs and heightens iSPN co-activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although the exact mechanisms that constrain the spatiotemporal coordination of dSPN and iSPN activity are not known, SPNs have hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials that prevent action potential generation in the absence of glutamatergic input <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Given that glutamate is required for SPN activation, and given dopamine’s role in modifying the strength of glutamatergic synapses in dSPN and iSPNs, it is likely that synaptic plasticity influences the spatiotemporal dynamics of SPN activity by regulating their collective sensitivity to convergent excitatory inputs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>dSPNs and iSPNs receive excitatory input from both the cortex and thalamus. Cortico- and thalamostriatal synapses differ in their expression of pre- and post-synaptic neurotransmitter receptors and forms of synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In particular, extensive <italic>in vitro</italic> work has demonstrated various mechanistically distinct types of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) at cortical inputs to dSPNs and iSPNs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. While the range of physiological and neuromodulatory mechanisms of corticostriatal plasticity are complex, one particularly well studied type of plasticity is endocannabinoid (eCB) dependent LTD, induced <italic>in vitro</italic> by moderate to high frequency stimulation of corticostriatal inputs paired with postsynaptic depolarization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Importantly, corticostriatal LTD requires activation of postsynaptic Gq-linked, Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). mGluR activation causes the mobilization of endocannabinoids (eCBs) from the postsynaptic neuron which act as a retrograde signal by activating presynaptic CB1 receptors reducing the release probability of glutamatergic corticostriatal synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. mGluR LTD of corticostriatal synapses occurs in both dSPNs and iSPNs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> but not at thalamostriatal synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. eCB release and retrograde signaling can also produce transient modulation of presynaptic release causing short term depression of corticostriatal synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> similar to what has been observed at synapses in several other brain regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Despite extensive <italic>in vitro</italic> work, little is known about the circumstances under which eCB-dependent synaptic modulation occurs <italic>in vivo,</italic> and therefore how it may relate to motor behavior. Moreover, it is unknown how modulation of corticostriatal synaptic strength regulates the level and/or spatiotemporal dynamics of SPN activity and how these synaptic changes relate to movement.</p>
<p>Given the prominent role of mGluR5 signaling in corticostriatal plasticity, we asked whether these receptors contribute to voluntary movement and the dynamics of dSPN activity in the DLS. We found that manipulating mGluR5 signaling had bidirectional effects on movement and the spatiotemporal dynamics of dSPN activity, with minimal effects on their overall levels of activity. Specifically, using <italic>in vivo</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging we found that pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 signaling produced a reduction in spontaneous movement and heightened the spatially clustered patterns of co-activity in dSPNs, whereas positive modulation of mGluR5 signaling had the opposite effects. Consistent with these findings, conditional knockout of mGluR5 in dSPNs (D1 cKO mice) had minimal effects on the levels of either dSPN or iSPN activity, but specifically increased the spatiotemporal coordination of dSPN activity and reduced spontaneous locomotion. Collectively, these findings suggest that synaptic plasticity mechanisms bidirectionally constrain the spatiotemporal coordination, but not the levels of dSPN activity, into states that correlate with increased or decreased locomotor activity. Our study lays the groundwork for dissociating the separable roles of the activity rates versus patterning of SPN activity in motor control and has implications for correcting any disruptions of this patterning in basal ganglia-associated diseases.</p>

<title>dSPNs exhibit spatially clustered activity that varies with movement</title>
<p>There is a strong correlation between spatiotemporal patterns of SPN activity and motor output <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, but it is not known if synaptic properties modulate this coordinated activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. To assess the activity of dSPNs during spontaneous motor behavior, we implanted gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses into the dorsolateral striatum of mice expressing Cre-recombinase in dSPNs under the control of the <italic>Drd1a</italic> promoter. A Cre dependent AAV to express GCaMP6f was introduced either by a prior stereotaxic injection of virus or by coating the lenses with a silk fibroin film containing the AAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1a</bold></xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The GRIN lens was coupled to a head-mounted miniscope for 1P imaging of somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1b</bold></xref> shows an example of a field of view from one mouse and the segmented outlines of neurons after processing of the videos (<italic>see</italic> <bold>Methods</bold>) and examples of individual dSPN Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1c</bold></xref>). Consistent with prior observations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates in dSPNs increased during periods of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1d</bold></xref><bold>, e</bold>). The probability of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> event in detected cells (defined as fluorescence change of 2.5× the baseline for each cell, <italic>see</italic> <bold>Methods</bold>) increased during movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1d</bold></xref>) and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rate increased with increasing animal velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1e</bold></xref>). Previous work has demonstrated that dSPNs and iSPNs are spontaneously co-active in spatially intermingled clusters, a feature that has been proposed to be important for action selection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. To examine this spatiotemporal coordination and its modulation by movement state, we measured dSPN coactivity using a Jaccard index of dSPN pairs as a function of the Euclidean distance between them in the DLS. This measure captures co-activity between neuron pairs (as opposed to co-inactivity) more specifically than a linear correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1f</bold></xref>; <bold>Methods</bold>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Across all cell pairs in the field-of-view for each session, a correlation matrix was generated in which, for each frame of the recording, the cell pair was scored a 1 if both cells were active, or 0 otherwise. These scores for each frame were divided by the number of events in both cells, to generate a co-activity score for that pair. Figure 1f shows schematized raster plots to demonstrate this process. Then, those values were normalized to averages measured from independently shuffled Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces for each cell in the recording (using 1000 independent shuffles for each cell trace), to control for changes in mean activity level between conditions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref></bold>). If cells were co-active independently of distance, then a plot of co-activity normalized to the shuffled data as a function of distance would be flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1g</bold></xref>). While clustered co-activity (<italic>i.e.</italic>, higher among proximal cells) would show a downward sloping curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1h</bold></xref>). Consistent with prior reports <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, this analysis revealed that co-activity among neuron pairs is markedly higher among proximal cells and decreases with increasing Euclidean distance between pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1i</bold></xref>). Furthermore, as we had previously demonstrated, co-activity among all pairs was higher during rest and decreased during periods of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1j</bold></xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>The spatiotemporal dynamics of dSPN activity is modulated by mGluR5</title>
<p>The dominant form of synaptic plasticity at corticostriatal synapses is mediated by Grp1 mGluRs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and the primary receptor of this class expressed in SPNs is mGluR5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Germline deletion of mGluR5 causes significant motor phenotypes, but it is not known how mGluR5 signaling directly affects motor function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Due to the known importance of mGluR5 in modulating synaptic weight at corticostriatal synapses, we hypothesized that pharmacological modulation of mGluR5 would affect SPN dynamics in vivo.</p>
<p>To assess the effects of modulating mGluR5 activity on dSPN dynamics during spontaneous behavior, we injected mice with vehicle or the mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator (NAM) fenobam (26 mg/kg via i.p. injection) immediately prior to a 60-minute open field test. We analyzed dSPN activity from 8 animals expressing GCaMP6f in dSPNs and implanted with GRIN lenses in the DLS (<bold>Figure2a–c</bold>). We measured activity as mice spontaneously explored an open field arena. On average we recorded from 91 dSPNs per mouse in these experiments.</p>
<p>Fenobam treatment uniformly reduced locomotion (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">e</xref></bold>), an effect that was driven more by a reduction in movement bout duration than the frequency of movement bouts (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref></bold>). Interestingly, dSPN event rates were unchanged following fenobam injection, with Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates in dSPNs increasing with spontaneous locomotor speed across the range of running speeds in both fenobam and vehicle injected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2g</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>However, fenobam treatment significantly increased the pairwise co-activity of dSPNs across the whole range of cell-cell distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2h-i</bold></xref>). As fenobam treatment reduced movement, and co-activity is modulated by movement, we further analyzed changes during periods of movement and rest. While fenobam treatment increased dSPN co-activity during both periods of rest and movement, its effects were most pronounced during periods of rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2j</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>k</bold></xref>).

Therefore, we asked whether enhancing eCB levels by preventing 2-AG degradation using the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor JZL-184 affected the spatiotemporal dynamics of dSPN activity. We administered mice with JZL-184 (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally before recording dSPN Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity for 60 minutes in an open field arena. Interestingly, in contrast to the mGluR5 PAM, JZL-184 significantly reduced rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><bold>Figure 3k</bold></xref>) but did not affect the co-activity of dSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><bold>Figure 3l</bold></xref>).

<p>Collectively these results demonstrate that potentiating mGluR5 signaling shifts dSPN dynamics to a less correlated state, while inhibiting mGluR5 signaling enhances the correlated state of dSPNs. It is notable that spontaneous dSPN activity is less correlated during periods of movement than rest, and de-correlated dSPN activity has been shown to occur in hyperkinetic states (<italic>e.g</italic>., dyskinetic and hyperdopaminergic states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>).

<title>mGluR5 reduces corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission at dSPN synapses in the dorsolateral striatum</title>
<p>Our experiments demonstrated changes in striatal dSPN network activity that correlate with changes in motor behavior mediated by pharmacologically modulating mGluR5.

Given our previous observations and the fact that SPN activity in the dorsal striatum is important for motor control, we assessed whether selective ablation of <italic>Grm5</italic> in dSPNs affected locomotion and motor learning. Tracking distance travelled in an open field we found that the D1 cKO mice had reduced spontaneous locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4d</bold></xref>) and displayed a reduction in total distance travelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4e</bold></xref>).

<p>To measure locomotion in the home cage setting, we introduced running wheels and monitored activity over 7 days.

<p>Finally, on an accelerating rotarod D1 cKO mice showed a consistently reduced latency to fall over the course of 12 training trials across three days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4g</bold></xref>).

<p>Because of the clear motor phenotype in D1 cKO mice we first measured whether there were any changes in the intrinsic or synaptic properties of dSPNs in these mice.

<p>Finally, because both dSPNs and iSPNs exhibit spatially clustered activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, and because they are synaptically connected through recurrent collaterals with stronger unidirectional iSPNs to dSPNs coupling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, it is possible that disruption of mGluR5 signaling in dSPNs may also affect the levels and spatiotemporal dynamics of activity in intermingled iSPNs.

<p>Together these results demonstrate that the manipulation of mGluR5 signaling, through pharmacological or targeted genetic means, leads to changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of activity in dSPNs with minimal effects on their overall levels of activity.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The rate-model of basal ganglia function posits that activity in dSPNs and iSPNs have distinct and opposing effects on movement. This framework is primarily based on anatomical evidence from the distinct projection targets of dSPNs and iSPNs and electrophysiological recordings in their downstream projection targets under conditions modeling parkinsonism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. These target nuclei inhibit motor control nuclei in the hindbrain mesencephalic locomotor region and thalamic regions that project to the motor cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In this context, dSPN activation is predicted to increase activity in these motor control regions to facilitate movement, while iSPN activation is predicted to decrease activity in these same regions to inhibit movement.</p>
<p>However, this classical model is not supported by recent <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging studies using fiber photometry or endoscopy to record Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in genetically specified dSPNs or iSPNs. In contrast to the predictions of the rate-model, dSPNs and iSPNs are indistinguishably responsive to increases and decreases in movement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, <italic>in vivo</italic> endoscopy has shown that overlapping clusters of dSPNs and iSPNs co-activate during movement, with small but statistical correlations between the activation of different clusters during different movement types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. These findings suggest an alternative model where, in contrast to the relative level of activity in each SPN type, the spatial patterning of co-activity among SPNs may be important for specifying proper motor output.</p>
<p>Despite the evidence that SPNs may influence movement via the coordination of their activity, the biological mechanisms responsible for these coordinated patterns are not known. Seminal <italic>in vitro</italic> electrophysiology studies demonstrated that SPNs fire action potentials coincident with large excitatory inputs that shift their resting membrane potential to transiently stable, depolarized “up” states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. These excitatory inputs arise from the cortex and thalamus. Our results suggest that the modulation of the synaptic weight, particularly at corticostriatal synapses where several forms of plasticity require mGluR5 receptors, is a crucial mechanism constraining the patterns of dSPN co-activity in states associated with movement or rest.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Spontaneous motor output correlates with the level of coactivity in dSPNs</title>
<p>In the current work, we have used pharmacological and genetic manipulations to examine how activity in dSPNs varies with movement while targeting the receptor controlling the dominant form of synaptic plasticity in the DLS. Systemic administration of the mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator, fenobam, led to significant increases in co-activity among dSPNs and reduced locomotor activity. By contrast, systemic administration of the mGluR5 positive allosteric modulator JNJ led to decreased co-activity and increased locomotion. Notably, neither pharmacological manipulation of mGluR5 led to significant changes in the rate of dSPN Ca<sup>2+</sup> events. Our results suggest a model whereby either potentiating or inhibiting mGluR5 signaling alters the recruitment of dSPNs such that the overall activity level is preserved but that the patterns of their co-activity change in a manner that corresponds to motor output. This is further confirmed by our data from animals with targeted deletion of mGluR5 in dSPNs, which similarly showed no change in event rate but an increase in co-activity.</p>
<p>Our results are consistent with prior analysis demonstrating that the co-activity among pairs of dSPNs is higher at rest and decreases during movement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Here we found that pharmacological manipulations that alter these clustered co-activity states correspondingly alter the levels of spontaneous motor output. Specifically, shifting the dSPN network to a level of higher co-activity, as with fenobam treatment or mGluR5 deletion in dSPNs, leads to a reduction in the amount of time animals spent moving. By contrast, potentiating mGluR5 receptors with systemic JNJ administration led to an increase in time spent moving and a corresponding decrease in the co-activity of dSPNs.</p>
<p>Our <italic>ex vivo</italic> electrophysiology data from cKO animals further supports these conclusions, as disrupting endogenous mGluR5 signaling in dSPNs does not result in changes in the excitability of neurons. Instead, genetic deletion of mGluR5 altered the synaptic properties of dSPNs, likely an adaptive response consistent with the established role of mGluR5 in regulating corticostriatal synaptic weights. These findings suggest that these selective changes in synaptic plasticity may underlie the altered spatiotemporal patterning of dSPN activity without changes in their overall levels of activity observed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that mGluR5 activation occurs following pairing of postsynaptic depolarization with moderate to high frequency excitatory synaptic input <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. mGluR5 activation can result in the long term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission or a more transient depression in release probability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.

<p>The lack of change in spatiotemporal coordination following systemic administration of the 2-AG degradation inhibitor JZL-184 suggests that global enhancement of eCB levels does not produce a similar outcome as modulating mGluR5 signaling. However, in contrast to selective mGluR5 modulation we did observe a reduction on overall dSPN event rates with JZL. One possibility is that a degree of synaptic specificity is required to affect clustered activation of dSPNs. Thus, JZL treatment may have exerted such broad effects on the circuit that it resulted in a different outcome for neural clustering and motor output than that observed following treatment with the allosteric modulators of mGluR5 receptors that modify synaptic weight.</p>
<p>These results support a model whereby the level of co-activity among specific groups of dSPNs is potentially important for controlling motor output. Therefore, globally altering the synaptic weights of all neurons may overshadow the results of synaptic alterations in specific subsets of SPNs. This idea is consistent with the notion that individual dSPNs may be precisely tuned to have specific roles in regulating motor output, such that altering the activity of one dSPN subgroup would not have the same effect as altering the activity of a different sub-group. This interpretation is also at odds with the classical rate-dependent models of SPN activity.</p>

<title>Role of non-dSPN mGluR5 receptors in regulating movement</title>
<p>There are notable differences in the design of our experiments using conditional deletion of mGluR5 from dSPNs and systemic administration of a negative allosteric modulator of mGluR5. Following fenobam administration, we observed a significant increase in co-activity when animals were at rest and a smaller increase during movement. Additional experiments are necessary to determine if this is also the case in dSPNs from cKO animals, but this could provide insights into the specific role of mGluR5 in dSPNs compared to its role in other cell types or brain regions affected by systemic fenobam treatment.</p>
<p>Within the striatum alone, mGluR5 is expressed in iSPNs and interneurons and modulation of these cell types by systemically administered compounds could produce changes in behavior and striatal circuit function. dSPNs receive GABAergic input from both iSPNs as well as striatal interneurons. Of particular note, parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons also receive excitatory input from the cortex and provide feedforward inhibition onto both subtypes of SPNs, and genetic disruption of mGluR5 in parvalbumin interneurons increases striatum-dependent repetitive behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The modulation of synaptic strength at these connections by fenobam and JNJ could also partly account for the effects of these compounds on dSPN activity and behavior when systemically administered, which would not occur in cKO animals.</p>
<p>Collateral inhibition between SPNs is another potential source for modulation of co-activity. <italic>In vitro</italic> electrophysiology has shown that dSPNs are more likely to form synapses onto other dSPNs, while iSPNs form synapses onto neurons of both pathways with equal probability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. However, the strength of collateral synapses formed by dSPNs appears to be smaller than that of synapses formed by iSPNs. Our analysis of iSPN activity in cKO mice suggests that iSPN circuit properties are largely normal when mGluR5 is genetically disrupted in dSPNs, perhaps reflecting the less substantial modulation of iSPN circuitry by dSPNs reported in the striatum, at least during spontaneous behavior. Whether this relationship holds across additional behavioral states remains to be addressed. Additionally, whether disruption of iSPN networks affects dSPN networks, perhaps due to stronger unidirectional iSPN-dSPN connectivity, is a key question for further research.</p>

<title>Translation implications of dSPN spatiotemporal dynamics</title>
<p>The relationship of mGluR5 pharmacology to dSPN spatial coordination and motor output is also clinically relevant to the treatment of motor disorders. Prior studies examining the spatial coordination of SPNs in parkinsonian mice demonstrated that, following dopamine depletion to model the parkinsonian state, dSPN activity was reduced but maintained spatial coordination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, when levodopa induced dyskinesia (LID) was modelled in these animals, dSPNs lost spatial coordination. In the current work, we show that pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 increases spatial coordination. It is tempting to speculate, therefore, that in the case of LID, the therapeutic efficacy of mGluR5 NAMs may involve regulation of the spatially coordinated co-activity of dSPNs. Additionally, further examination of how spatially coordinated SPN activity is disrupted in motor diseases involving basal ganglia pathology, may be a promising avenue for guiding future therapeutic development.</p>
<p>In summary our data demonstrate that the modulation of signaling that affects synaptic properties of excitatory synapses onto dSPNs is a key mediator of the normal patterns of SPN co-activity that typify the striatum’s neural ensemble dynamics in relation to spontaneous movement. These results provide further support for models where the local synchronization of SPNs (and the basal ganglia circuit in general) is a stronger determinant of motor output in than their overall levels of activity. Our results also provide a framework for future lines of inquiry to address how striatal synaptic properties shape circuit function and striatum-dependent behavior.</p>

<p>Animals were group housed with 14-hr:10-hr Light/Dark cycle and food and water were provided ad libitum. Mice of both sexes, between 4-12 months old, were used and all experiments were performed in accordance with procedures approved by the Northwestern University IACUC. To express GCaMP6f in dSPNs we used mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the drd1a promoter (D1cre) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.

<p>For mice that received a viral injection (pAAV.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40, 100833-AAV9 from Addgene) prior to GRIN lens implant, we anesthetized mice with isoflurane (2% in O<sub>2</sub>) and stereotaxically injected virus at a rate of 250LnlLmin<sup>−1</sup> into the DLS using a microsyringe with a 28-gauge beveled-tip needle (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV). Stock titer virus was diluted 1:10 with sterile PBS. The coordinates for injection were: A/P +/- 0.05 mm, M/L +/- 1.8 mm, D/V -2.4mm (from dura). For all DV coordinates, we went 0.1Lmm past the injection target and then withdrew the syringe back to the target for the injection. After each injection, we left the syringe in place for 10 minutes and then slowly withdrew the syringe. We then sutured the scalp, injected analgesic (Buprenorphine SR, 1LmgLkg<sup>−1</sup>), as well as meloxicam (2x / day for 48 hours, 5 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>), and allowed the mice to recover for at least 14Ldays.</p>

<title>Silk fibroin coating of GRIN lenses</title>
<p>For animals in which we implanted a GRIN lens coated with a fibroin:AAV mixture, we autoclaved both GRIN lenses, and a small aliquot of 5% W/V silk fibroin solution, prior to coating. Then, the sterile fibroin solution was mixed 1:1 with stock titer AAV (pAAV.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40, 100833-AAV9 from Addgene). A microsyringe with a 23 gauge flat tip needle (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) with a manual stereotaxic injector (Stoelting) was used to apply a 1µL droplet of the mixture to the tip of the GRIN lens in a biological safety cabinet. The mixture was allowed to dry slightly for 5 minutes with the droplet in contact with both the GRIN lens surface and the syringe needle tip before the syringe needle was removed, this prevented the mixture from coating the side of the lens. Once the needle was removed the droplet was allowed to fully dry to the surface of the lens for at least 1 hour before implanting. Lenses were stored at 4°C for implanting either the same day or within approximately 24 hours.</p>

<title>Surgical implantation of GRIN lens and viral transduction</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane in O<sub>2</sub> (induction 4%; maintenance 2–3%). Following verification of anesthesia, hair was trimmed from the incision site, the scalp cleaned with three alternating swabs of betadine and 70% ethanol, and an incision made through the scalp to uncover the skull. The skull surface was cleaned and verified to be level by measuring the coordinates of bregma, lambda, and two sites +/- 2mm lateral to the midline. The M/L and A/P coordinates for implantation of the GRIN lens were marked on the skull (A/P +/- 0.05 mm, M/L +/- 2 mm) and a Dremel with a sterilized 0.6-mm tip was used to remove an approximately 2-mm circular region around the implant site. The skull was cleaned, dried, and scored crosswise with a scalpel.</p>
<p>While continuously perfusing the tissue with ACSF, the dura and cortex were removed using a 26 GA blunt-end needle connected to a vacuum line until the fibers of the corpus callosum became visible, at which point a 30 GA blunt-end needle was used to carefully remove the fibers of the callosum until striatal tissue became visible under a dissecting microscope. A 1-mm or 1.8-mm diameter GRIN lens was then lowered into the aspiration site (D/V -2.4 mm), held in place using a pipette tip and vacuum line attached to the stereotax. The lens was secured to the skull using dental cement (Metabond) and cyanoacrylate glue. Buprenorphine SR, (1Lmg·kg<sup>−1</sup>) was administered following surgery, as well as meloxicam (2x / day for 48 hours, 5 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>), dexamethasone (1x / day, 0.2 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>for 7 days), and Sulfatrim (for 7 days in the drinking water).

<title>In vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and Analysis</title>
<p>All mice were habituated to the weight of the miniscope over a 60-minute session in the open field. Following habituation, we placed mice in the open field for 60 minutes each day for 1-3 days with the miniscope attached. For analysis of calcium dynamics in dSPN cKO mice, we analyzed data from the first 20 minutes of day 1 of these sessions. In the majority of animals used in these experiments, we used v3 miniscopes which required higher LED intensities compared to v4 miniscopes. Therefore, we limited recording to 20 minutes to limit photobleaching. For experiments testing fenobam, JZL and JNJ, 60 minutes of open field activity were recorded following IP injection. For these experiments we used v4 scopes which allowed for the use of lower LED intensities.</p>
<p>Fenobam (26 mg/kg) and JZL (10 mg/kg) were administered immediately prior to the test, following a 15-minute habituation. Due to its pharmacokinetics, JNJ was administered 30 minutes prior to beginning the test. Fenobam was diluted in 40% beta-cyclodextrin, 10% DMSO, JZL and JNJ were diluted in 10% DMSO and 90% corn oil.</p>
<p>We used open source V3 and V4 miniscopes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4">https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4</ext-link>) that were connected to a coaxial cable which connected to a miniscope data acquisition board (DAQ) 3.3.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Marshall and coworkers describe the effects of altering metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 activity on locomotion and related activity of D1 receptor expressing spiny projection neurons in dorsolateral striatum. The authors also examine effects of dSPN-specific constitutive mGlu5 deletion in several motor tests. Effects of inhibiting the degradation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol are also examined. Overall, this study provides intriguing new information with relevance to movement disorders and possibly psychosis. However, there are questions about the interpretation of dSPN activity in relation to movement, as well as the analysis approach. Some aspects of the study are also incomplete.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A nice combination of in vivo cellular calcium imaging, pharmacology, receptor knockout and sophisticated movement analysis are used. The authors conclude that mGlu5 expressed in dSPNs contributes to movement through effects on clustered spatial coactivity of dSPNs. Some data suggesting the story may be different in the other major SPN subpopulation (iSPNs) are also presented. The authors also suggest that mGlu5 stimulation of endocannabinoid signaling may play a role in the receptor effects. Overall, this study provides intriguing new information with relevance to movement disorders and possibly psychosis</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>(1) The relationship between coactivity and movement in this and the previous study from this group is intriguing. Can the authors offer a hypothesis as to how decreased coactivity promotes increased movement velocity (e.g. as indicated by Figures 2l and 3m, and in the previous study)? Is coactivity during rest part of a &quot;movement preparation&quot; SPN program, or is it simply the case that the actual activity of individual dSPNs starts to contribute to different aspects of movement as velocity increases (given that the majority of neurons appear to show increased event rate during movement).</p>
<p>(2) The authors focus on dSPNs until very late in the study and then provide a little intriguing data suggesting that iSPNs show no difference in coactivity in the mGlu5 cKO mice. However, the basic characterization of the relationship between iSPN coactivity and movement is missing, although Figure 5g does seem to suggest a relationship between coactivity and proximity similar to dSPNs. It would be helpful to include the type of analysis shown in Figure 1 for iMSNs.</p>
<p>(3) The use of the Jaccard similarity index in this study is not intuitive and not fully explained by the methods or the diagram in Figure 1. The more detailed explanations in the previous papers from this group seem to indicate cells are listed as &quot;coactive&quot; if they both show an above-threshold fluorescence increase during a one second time frame after converting signals to a binary &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; status. However, it seems unlikely that the activity of the neurons would be perfectly or even strongly correlated, as there is bound to be variability in the exact traces from cell to cell. Furthermore, it doesn't seem clear how many frames need to show suprathreshold signals for two neurons to be considered coactive (or does this determine the magnitude of the normalized coactivity y-axis, e.g. in Figure 1i). Thus, while the technique appears to capture some index of coactivity, it does not appear to reveal the true temporal correlations in activity that could be obtained with techniques that use all data points to assess correlations. While this technique may be well suited to determining coactivity based on action potentials, or another all-or-none type biological event, it may not be as optimal for relating calcium transients that have more nuanced features.</p>
<p>
Another question is how the one second time frame was chosen. Did the authors run a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of changing the frame duration on coactivity estimates. This might help determine if the analysis was too conservative in identifying coactive neurons.</p>
<p>
These comments may reflect a lack of understanding of the approach on the part of this reviewer. Perhaps a more detailed explanation of the method, maybe including examples of the types of calcium transients that are listed as reflecting coactivity or lack thereof, would clarify the suitability of this technique.</p>
<p>(4) The analysis of a possible 2-AG role in the mGlu5 mediated processes is incomplete and does not add much to the story. As the authors admit, inhibiting MGL globally will have widespread effects on many striatal synapses. Perhaps a dSPN-targeted approach, such as knocking out DAG lipase in dSPNs, would be more informative. For example, one might expect that this knockout would prevent the effects of the JNJ mGlu5 PAM on both movement and dSPN activity. The authors also do not provide any evidence of 2-AG involvement in the synaptic changes they report, although admittedly the role of endocannabinoids in DHPG-induced synaptic depression has been reported in several previous studies.</p>
<p>(5) It would seem to be a simple experiment to examine effects of the mGlu5 NAM in the dSPN mGlu5 cKO mice. If effects of the two manipulations occluded one another this would certainly support the hypothesis that the drug effects are mediated by receptors expressed in dSPNs. A similar argument can be made for examining effects of the JNJ PAM in the cKO mice.</p>
<p>Minor Comments:</p>
<p>(i) The use of CsF-based whole-cell internal solutions has caused concern in some past studies due to possible interference with G-protein, phosphatase and channel function (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1044743104000296">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1044743104000296</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/6/10/2915.full.pdf">https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/6/10/2915.full.pdf</ext-link>). It is reassuring the DHPG-induced LTD was still observable with this solution. However, it might be worth examining this plasticity with a different internal to ensure that the magnitude of the agonist effect is not altered by this manipulation.</p>
<p>(ii) The Kreitzer and Malenka 2007 paper may not be the best to cite in the context of dSPN-related synaptic plasticity, as these authors claimed that DHPG-induced LTD was restricted to iSPNs (an observation that has not generally been supported by subsequent work in several laboratories).</p>

<p>Strengths are that the topic is of significant interest and understudied and the combination of both genetic and pharmacological approaches. However, while there is great enthusiasm for the need to better understand mGluR5 roles in striatal circuitry, in its present form, there are three overarching concerns that significantly limit the impact of this study. First, while a Jaccard method is used to measure the spatiotemporal dynamics of dSPN activity, collectively the data herein do not support the authors' interpretation of the data that mGluR5 is a modulator of spatiotemporal dSPN dynamics. Specifically, pharmacological and genetic manipulations of mGluR5 do not differentially/preferentially modulate the activity of proximal vs distal dSPNs, therefore, it could also be interpreted that mGluR5 is blanketly boosting/suppressing all dSPN activity as opposed to differential proximal/distal spatial relationships. While this is acknowledged in the manuscript (Figure 2i), it leaves open for question the extent to which mGluR5 is modulating other aspects of dSPN activity independent of the spatiotemporal relationship across dSPNs (i.e. amplitude, firing probability, etc.). Second, while it is a strength that mGluR5 NAM, PAM, and D1 Cre mGluR5-cKO were used to bidirectionally manipulate mGluR5 signaling, the manuscript lacks a clear model of where mGluR5 is acting to affect dSPN activity. This concern can be readily addressed by treating D1 Cre mGluR5-cKO mice with the mGluR5 NAM (as described in Ln. 413-416) to determine the extent to which other sources of mGluR5 are contributing to dSPN activity. The authors' working model predicts that the NAM would have no significant effects on the D1 Grm5 cKO model. Third, there are some concerns about the statistical basis for conclusions that are drawn detailed below that when addressed will strengthen the rigor of the conclusions. Addressing these suggestions should strengthen the mechanistic understanding and further allow the authors to present a more clear working model for their findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Marshall et al. investigates the role mGluR5 in modulating the coactivity of d1 spiny projection neurons (dSPN) in the dorsolateral striatum through calcium imaging and pharmacological i.p. injections or targeted deletion of mGluR5 in dSPNs. They show a bidirectional modulation by negative and positive allosteric modulators respectively (mainly at rest) on dSPN coactivity, the increase in coactivity by the negative modulator showed qualitative similar effects on coactivity as the deletion of mGluR5 in dSPNs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall the study is well written and easy to read, with the data supporting (most of the time) the conclusion. It brings a new perspective on the role of mGluR5 in the modulation of dSPNs coactivity and its correlation with movement.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the experiments would strengthen the solidness of the study providing further information and verifying the claims of the main text with the statistics on the figure legends.</p>
