<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Fiber photometry has become a popular technique to measure neural activity in vivo, but common analysis strategies can reduce detection of effects because they con dense <italic>within-trial</italic> signals into summary measures, and discard trial-level information by averaging <italic>across-trials</italic>. We propose a novel photometry statistical framework based on functional linear mixed modeling, which enables hypothesis testing of variable effects at <italic>every trial time-point</italic>, and uses trial-level signals without averaging. This makes it possible to compare the timing and magnitude of signals across conditions while accounting for between-animal differences. Our framework produces a series of plots that illustrate covariate effect estimates and statistical significance at each trial time-point. By exploiting signal autocorrelation, our methodology yields <italic>joint</italic> 95% confidence intervals that account for inspecting effects across the entire trial and improve the detection of event-related signal changes over common multiple comparisons correction strategies. We reanalyze data from a recent study proposing a theory for the role of mesolimbic dopamine in reward learning, and show the capability of our framework to reveal significant effects obscured by standard analysis approaches. For example, our method identifies two dopamine components with distinct temporal dynamics in response to re ward delivery. In simulation experiments, our methodology yields improved statistical power over common analysis approaches. Finally, we provide an open-source package and analysis guide for applying our framework.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fiber photometry is a photonic technique used to measure neural activity in vivo. The assay quantifies bulk fluorescence emitted from fluorescent biosensors that detect neurotransmitters or physiological processes (e.g., calcium influx) with high neurochemical and cell-type specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Simpson et al., 2024</xref>). The popularity of photometry has increased nearly exponentially since its development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>), with roughly 1,500 references to it in the last year alone (See Appendix <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> for an analysis of the number of references to photometry). Although photometry is an invaluable tool, there is little consensus on analysis strategies for the data produced. Many common analysis procedures were not designed for photometry, specifically, but rather grew organically out of adapting approaches historically applied in the cyclic voltammetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Phillips et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Heien et al., 2005</xref>), EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adrian and Matthews, 1934</xref>), and electrophysiology communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fatt and Katz, 1952</xref>). Arguably the most common photometry analysis strategy proceeds by: 1) averaging event-aligned signals across trials (“trial-averaging”) and animals for comparison of different conditions (e.g., treatment/control), 2) graphing each condition’s average signal (“trace”), 3) calculating a signal summary measure (e.g., Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC)), and 4) conducting hypothesis tests (e.g., ANOVA) on that summary statistic.</p>
<p>Although these analysis conventions are parsimonious, they may dilute important patterns in the data related to, for example, individual animal differences in the timing and magnitude of signals, and the evolution of signals across trials. Part of the appeal of photometry is that probes can be implanted chronically, thereby enabling its application in sophisticated multi-session (“longitudinal”) experiments. Such designs yield, however, complex datasets in which associations between the signal and experimental variables can vary across trials (e.g., due to learning) and animals. To illustrate this, we present a typical analysis on real photometry data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coddington et al., 2023</xref>) in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. These measurements were collected on mesolimbic dopamine neurons in well trained, head-fixed animals performing a Pavlovian reward learning task. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> shows that the signals exhibit considerable heterogeneity across animals, suggesting that it can be difficult to identify one summary measure that captures the target effect in all subjects. Even within-animal, traces are highly variable across conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), trials within-session (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), and sessions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These figures illustrate how averaging the signal <italic>across trials</italic> can obscure behavior–signal associations, and how summarizing <italic>within trial</italic> signals (e.g., with AUC) can reduce one’s ability to distinguish between trial-level signals that differ in dynamics, but yield similar summary values.</p>

<p>Despite the complexity of the data, there are few analysis methods developed specifically for photometry. <italic>Encoding models</italic> of point-by-point signal–behavior relationships have been used for predicting the signal values from behavioral variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Markowitz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Willmore et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). When used for inference, how ever, these approaches only test whether or not there is an overall behavioral effect on the signal in the analyzed time-window. By not testing the association at each time point, it makes it difficult to determine when the temporal dynamics of associations are meaningful. Moreover, one model is fit per animal and thus data is not pooled across subjects, which can substantially reduce statistical power. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jean-Richard-dit Bressel et al. (2020)</xref>, the authors propose to compare photometry signals through the combi nation of <italic>permutation testing</italic> and non-parametric (cluster/subject-level) bootstraps to construct confidence intervals (CIs). This is restricted to comparisons between two conditions, however, which precludes testing for continuous variables, multi-level factors, or multivariate analyses. Investigators have analyzed data from techniques like photometry and calcium imaging by fitting <italic>pointwise generalized linear models (GLMs)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pinto and Dan, 2015</xref>), or Pearson correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Markowitz et al., 2023</xref>) to assess associations between variables and the signal at each trial time-point. However, standard GLMs and Pearson correlations do not yield valid inference when applied to multi-animal repeated measures datasets. This therefore requires one to analyze a single trial-averaged signal per animal, discarding trial-level information. Moreover, the methods do not adjust for multiple comparisons of testing at different time-points, which can inflate Type I error. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee et al. (2019)</xref> fit <italic>pointwise linear mixed models</italic> and then apply Benjamini-Hochberg correction. However, this method does not yield <italic>joint</italic> CIs and thus does not exploit the correlation between signal values across time-points. The method therefore requires one to adjust for a different test at each sample in a trial’s signal. Thus, two analyses of the same data, down-sampled with different sampling rates, could yield significant results in one analysis and not the other, simply because higher sampling rates require one to correct for more comparisons. More generally, this method can be very conservative and dramatically hinder the detection of effects.</p>
<p>In sum, we argue that existing photometry analysis approaches reduce the ability to detect effects. Summary measure analyses coarsen information by 1) condensing the photometry signal into a single statistic (e.g., AUC) that summarizes across time points <italic>within-trial</italic>, and/or 2) averaging <italic>across-trials</italic> for each animal before conducting hypothesis tests. For methods that estimate associations at each trial time-point, effects can be obscured because current approaches do not exploit the correlation across time points, do not provide <italic>joint</italic> CIs, and thus yield very conservative inference.</p>
<p>We present an analysis framework that fills this gap and extracts more nuanced information from photometry data by 1) enabling hypothesis testing of the effects of experimental variables on signals at <italic>every trial time-point</italic>, and 2) using the signal from every trial and animal in the analysis. Our proposed approach is based on functional linear mixed models and allows one to compare the temporal evolution (“temporal dynamics”) of the signal between conditions – in timing and magnitude – while accounting for between-animal differences. The statistical procedure uses 1) mixed effects modeling to enable the analysis of sophisticated nested experiments (e.g., designs that include multiple conditions, sessions, and trials), and 2) functional regression to exploit autocorrelation in the signal to calculate <italic>joint</italic> 95% CIs. These <italic>joint</italic> CIs account for examining effects throughout the entire trial, but are not overly conservative CIs. Our framework outputs a plot for each covariate in the model (e.g., behavior, cue-type), which shows whether that covariate is significantly associated with the photometry signal at each time-point. The framework therefore unifies the stages of plotting signals and then conducting hypothesis tests into a joint analysis and visualization procedure.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In this section, we introduce our photometry analysis framework based on functional linear mixed models. We focus on explaining the implementation steps and analysis outputs. We then demonstrate how the approach can be used to formulate the scientific questions posed in a recent paper, by re-analyzing their datasets and expanding their results. Finally, we conduct realistic data-driven simulations to show that our approach has desirable statistical properties for photometry analyses.</p>

<title>Functional Linear Mixed Models (FLMM)</title>
<p>Linear Mixed Models (LMM) are a class of methods for testing the association between covariates (“independent” variables) and outcomes (“dependent” variables) for repeated measures data (see Methods <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4a">section 4.1</xref> for a brief introduction to LMM). They can be used to analyze trial-level summary measures (e.g., AUCs) pooled across all trials and animals, preventing the loss of information from trial-averaging. However, this still requires condensing signals into scalar summary measures, which coarsens within trial information across time-points. In contrast, functional regression methods can be used to model a photometry time series as a “function”, which makes it possible to test the association between covariates of interest and the signal value <italic>at each time-point in the trial</italic> (see Methods <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4b">section 4.2</xref> for a brief introduction to functional regression). However, most functional regression methods require trial averaging of the signals prior to analysis, which discards trial-level information.</p>
<p>The photometry analysis framework we are introducing is based on Functional Linear Mixed Models (FLMM), which combines the benefits of LMM and functional regression to extract the information in the signal both <italic>across-</italic> and <italic>within-</italic> trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Scheipl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Davidson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morris and Carroll, 2006</xref>). By modeling covariates that can vary between 1) trial (e.g., cue-type, latency-to-press), 2) session (e.g., training stage), and 3) animal (e.g., treatment group), <italic>FLMM</italic> estimates the effects (termed <italic>functional fixed-effects</italic>) and statistical significance of those covariates for longitudinal designs. By further including <italic>functional random-effects</italic>, the framework can also estimate and adjust for between-animal differences in 1) photometry signal dynamics, and 2) effects of a covariate on the signal, within- and across-trials. In essence, this enables one to model between-animal and between-trial variability in both the “shape” of the signal, and the evolution of covariate effects across trial time-points. The result is a <italic>single plot of the coefficient estimates for each covariate</italic>, which visualizes when (and to what extent) the covariate has a statistically significant (fixed-effect) association with the photometry signal during a trial.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, we illustrate the steps in <italic>FLMM</italic> parameter estimation, which are implemented by our software (see Methods <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4c">section 4.3</xref> for details). The first input is a matrix𝕐, where column <italic>s</italic>, Y(<italic>s</italic>), contains the photometry signal value at trial time point <italic>s</italic> from every trial in every session and animal, as shown in A➀. The other inputs are covariate matrices, 𝕏 and ℤ, associated with the fixed-effects and random-effects regression coefficients, respectively. Then, for each time-point, <italic>s</italic>, we fit a LMM model to <bold>Y</bold>(<italic>s</italic>) as the outcome variable, with the conditional mean of animal <italic>i</italic> modeled as:

<title>A photometry study of the role of mesolimbic dopamine in learning</title>
<p>To demonstrate how our method can be used to answer scientific questions in photometry experiments, we reanalyzed data from a recent article proposing a new model for mesolimbic dopamine’s role in learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>; All analyses are on photometry data collected with dLight1.3b in the nucleus accumbens core.). Note that this is a different study from the one described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. We used this study for two reasons. First, the dataset exhibits many common characteristics of photometry data that can dilute effects, or even invalidate results if left unaccounted for. Second, the dataset contains data from multiple experiments, which allows us to illustrate how <italic>FLMM</italic> can be used to test hypotheses across a range of experimental designs. In this section, we discuss how <italic>FLMM</italic> handles those characteristics; in subsequent sections, we show how those hypotheses can be posed in our framework.</p>
<p>One of the most important characteristics of these data is that the dopamine (DA) measurements were collected in within-subject nested longitudinal experiments. For example, in the first behavioral task we discuss, mice were trained across multiple sessions. Each session involved delivery of a sequence of 100 sucrose rewards. The authors analyzed average dopamine (AUC) during the “reward period” time-window (aligned to the first lick after reward-delivery) as a trial (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus trials were nested in session, which were nested in animal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Photometry experiments often exhibit this type of nested longitudinal structure, which can induce correlation patterns in the data within-animal, and obscure effects if not accounted for statistically. This structure can occur in both within-subjects and between-subjects designs, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>. For example, these data exhibited high within-animal correlations across sessions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), and across trials within-session (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>

(<bold>A</bold>) Experiment trial time-windows used to construct photometry signal summary measures (AUC).

<p><italic>FLMM</italic> can model effect heterogeneity, as well as correlation patterns within- and across-trials, through the inclusion of functional random-effects. These allow one to estimate what is common across all animals, and what is unique to each. This is critical because photometry datasets often exhibit between-animal variability in co-variate–signal associations. For example, in the task described above, the time between rewards, (<monospace>IRI</monospace>: “inter-reward interval”) varied between trials unpredictably (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), and the authors reported that “reward period” AUC was correlated with IRI. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref> shows that the magnitude of this correlation varied considerably across animals and sessions. <italic>FLMM</italic> can model this variability in IRI–DA correlation magnitude through the inclusion of animal- and session-specific random effects. More broadly, by varying which covariates and random-effects are included in the model, <italic>FLMM</italic> can analyze data from experimental designs that include within- and between-subject contrasts. For ex ample, one can implement functional versions of methods like correlations, or repeated measures ANOVA, and, more generally, model a wide range of dependence structures. Finally, <italic>FLMM</italic> can accommodate missing data and subjects with different sample sizes, which are often unavoidable characteristics of photometry experiments. In <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref> we show how this dataset included photometry recordings on behavioral sessions at various stages of training that differed across animals. If not accounted for statistically, this can obscure associations between the signal and covariates. For example, average reward period AUC levels were reported to increase across sessions. Thus animals with data collected only on early sessions may appear to have lower AUC levels than other animals, which can increase uncertainty in estimates of covariate effects.</p>

<label>2.3</label>
<title>Using <italic>FLMM</italic> to test associations between signal and covariates throughout the trial</title>
<p>We first recreate an analysis of the experiment described in the previous section. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> reported, in Section “Tests 1 and 2,” that the trial-level “reward period” AUC was positively correlated with <monospace>IRI</monospace>. The authors fit separate Pearson correlations to data from each animal. To illustrate how to test this question in our framework, we show a recreation of their analysis in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>, and the <italic>FLMM</italic> analysis estimates of the IRI–DA association in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> assessed the IRI–AUC correlation in each animal separately, <italic>FLMM</italic> can test the IRI–DA association at each trial time-point and in all animals jointly, thereby improving our ability to detect effects. To implement a test most similar to the Pearson correlation, we fit an <italic>FLMM</italic> model with IRI as the (fixed-effect) covariate. Given the between-animal and between-session heterogeneity in signal profiles highlighted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, we included nested random effects to account for the variability across both subjects and sessions. The relationship is significantly positive throughout the time-window [-0.5, 1.5] sec.</p>

They quantified DA by a measure of normalized AUC of Δ<italic>F/F</italic> during a window ranging 0.5 s before to 1 s after the first lick following reward delivery. All plots are aligned to this first lick after reward delivery.

<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_fig4.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>These results corroborate the paper’s findings, and provide finer-grained details in accessible with standard analyses. For example, the temporal dynamics, revealed by <italic>FLMM</italic>, suggest that the neural signal associated with <monospace>IRI</monospace> may be composed of two distinct components. The first component rises rapidly starting at around -0.75 sec and decreases quickly after lick-onset (the first lick after reward-delivery). Since the association reaches its peak before lick-onset, the signal may reflect motivation, movement, or reward detection. The second component begins after lick-onset and rises and falls slower than the first component. The timing suggests it may track sucrose consumption. Importantly, the reward period AUC in the paper averages across these putative components. In contrast, <italic>FLMM</italic> is able to partially disentangle them through their distinct temporal dynamics, and offers insight into the role the components play in behavior. <italic>FLMM</italic> can also identify results completely obscured by standard methods. We show this by recreating an analysis in which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> report that reward period AUC was positively correlated with that trial’s <monospace>Reward Number</monospace>. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> illustrates the definition of <monospace>Reward Number</monospace>, the cumulative trials/rewards received across sessions. The finding that the <monospace>Reward Number</monospace>–AUC correlation was positive was controversial because it conflicted with the prediction of the Reward Prediction Error (“RPE”) model, a prevailing hypothesis for the role of DA in reward learning. The authors argued that RPE predicts a negative <monospace>Reward Number</monospace>–DA association, while their model (“ANCCR”) predicts a positive association. Using <italic>FLMM</italic> on the same data, we estimate that the <monospace>Reward Number</monospace>–DA association is in fact <italic>negative</italic> within-session. The discrepancy in findings arises because the analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> pools trials <italic>across sessions</italic> in a manner that does not consider the session number that a reward was delivered on. <italic>FLMM</italic> finds the effect above by accounting for the nested session/trial task structure, and suggests why it occurs by estimating changes at each trial time-point. The source of the conflicting results above is most clearly illustrated by fitting <monospace>Reward Number</monospace>–AUC correlations in each animal and session separately. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure 10</xref> we show session-specific linear regression fits overlaid on the fits from the session-pooled analysis conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref>. We parameterized session-specific models to yield intercepts (highlighted as large black circles) with the interpretation “the expected AUC value on the first trial of the session.” These intercepts tend to increase across sessions, ultimately resulting in a positive overall <monospace>Reward Number</monospace>–AUC correlation in the session-pooled analysis (see <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure 10</xref>). However, the majority of the within-session <italic>slopes</italic> are actually negative, indicating that the AUC decreases across trials <italic>within-session</italic>. The apparent disagreement between the positive <monospace>Reward Number</monospace>–AUC correlation estimated in the session-pooled analysis, and the negative <monospace>Trial Number</monospace>–AUC association identified in the within-session analysis, is an example of <italic>Simpson’s paradox</italic>. This is caused by pooling data without taking into account its hierarchical structure.</p>

The plots are aligned to the first lick after reward-delivery.

The <monospace>Session Number</monospace> effect is <italic>jointly</italic> significantly positive roughly in the interval [-0.25,0.5] sec, and peaks before lick-onset. This suggests DA increases across sessions during that interval. The <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> effect is briefly <italic>pointwise</italic> significantly positive around ∼ −0.3 sec and <italic>jointly</italic> significantly negative in the interval [0,2.5] sec.

</fig>
<p>To resolve this “paradox,” we fit an <italic>FLMM</italic> that models the nested design by including <italic>both</italic> between-session and within-session fixed-effects, as well as nested random effects. Estimating the <monospace>Session Number</monospace> and <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> functional coefficients reveals that <italic>within-session</italic> and <italic>between-session</italic> effects have distinct temporal dynamics. For example, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-E</xref> shows that the <italic>FLMM</italic> estimates that the mean signal decreases significantly <italic>within-session</italic> beginning immediately post-lick, but <italic>increases across-sessions</italic> for a brief interval around the lick. Importantly, the <monospace>Session Number</monospace>–DA association peaks and begins falling before the lick, while the <monospace>Trial Number</monospace>–DA correlation becomes significant only after the lick. Together these results suggest that DA increases across sessions in response to reward <italic>anticipation</italic>, but decreases within-session during reward <italic>consumption</italic>.</p>
<p>An alternative interpretation of the opposing within- and between-session effects is that DA rises within-session, but appears to decrease due to photobleaching. We assess this in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Appendix Section 4.3</xref>. We repeat the above analyses on the signal aligned to reward-delivery, and analyze two other behavioral experiments, collected on the same animals. These show that, <italic>within-session</italic>, DA responses increase to reward-predictive cues, but decrease to reward-delivery (predicted and unpredicted). That we can detect both within-session increases and decreases to separate events (cue-onset and reward delivery) occurring on the same trials, suggests that photobleaching is not hiding within session DA increases. In personal communications, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> agree that while photobleaching cannot be definitively ruled out, a parsimonious interpretation of these findings is that there is a DA reduction to unpredicted rewards within-session, independent of photobleaching.</p>

<title>Using <italic>FLMM</italic> to compare signal “temporal dynamics” across conditions</title>
<p>We next describe an example comparing the signal “temporal dynamics” across conditions, from Section “Tests 3 to 7” of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref>. In this experiment, each trial consisted of a presentation of a 2 sec cue, followed by reward 3 sec after cue-onset. After many training sessions, the delay was lengthened to 9 sec (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref>). On the first 9 sec delay session, the authors report that “dopaminergic cue responses [(Cue Period AUC)] showed no significant change,” relative to trials from the last short-delay session. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> argue that their finding conflicts with what an RPE hypothesis of dopamine coding would anticipate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kobayashi and Schultz, 2008</xref>). Like the authors, we compared the average signals between the last short-delay and the first long-delay sessions. However, we sought to test whether the signal “dynamics” over trial time-points changed after lengthening the delay. To directly compare the difference in signal magnitudes between short- and long-delay sessions, at each time-point, we fit a <italic>FLMM</italic> model with a single binary covariate representing short/long-delays (similar to a functional paired t-test). The <italic>FLMM</italic> estimated mean DA was significantly lower in the latter parts of the initial cue-elicited DA response (∼ 1-2.5 sec after cue-onset) on long-compared to short-delay trials (shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). This effect may have been occluded because the AUC analyzed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> was constructed by averaging signal values in a time window that contains opposing effects: the significant (relative) <italic>reduction</italic> in mean DA ∼ 0.5-2.5 sec after cue-onset (marked as interval (2) in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>), identified by <italic>FLMM</italic>, is potentially diluted in the AUC by the (non-significant) <italic>increase</italic> in the cue response in the first ∼ 0.5 sec (marked as interval (1) in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). In our reanalyses we identified other experiments where effects were obscured by the use of AUCs averaging over opposite effects (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4b">Appendix Section 4.2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>This example shows how <italic>FLMM</italic> can detect subtle effects that are difficult to identify by eye, and thus hard to construct appropriate summary measures for. For example, the delay-change effect is significant only during the falling-portion of the cue-elicited transient (0.5-2.5 sec after cue-onset). This small <italic>relative</italic> reduction (shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>) during a later portion of the cue-response is overshadowed by the much larger <italic>overall</italic> DA response immediately following (0-0.5 sec) cue-onset (shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Finally, we show animal-specific functional random-effect estimates in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E-F</xref>. These provide intuition about how <italic>FLMM</italic> adjusts for between-animal differences in the “temporal dynamics” of covariates effects.</p>
<p>We further analyze this dataset in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Appendix Section 2</xref>, to compare <italic>FLMM</italic> with the approach applied in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee et al. (2019)</xref> of fitting <italic>pointwise</italic> LMMs (without any smoothing) and applying a Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) correction. Our hypothesis was that the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee et al. (2019)</xref> approach would yield substantially different analysis results, depending on the sampling rate of the signal data (since the number of tests being corrected for is determined by the sampling rate). The proportion of time-points at which effects are deemed statistically significant by <italic>FLMM</italic> joint 95% CIs is fairly stable across sampling rates. In contrast, that proportion is both inconsistent and often low (i.e., highly conservative) across sampling rates with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee et al. (2019)</xref> approach. These results illustrate the advantages of modeling a trial signal as a function, and conducting estimation and inference in a manner that uses information across the entire trial.</p>

We next analyzed the cue period to allow com parison between the average performance of <italic>FLMM</italic>, evaluated at time-points in that time-window, with the performance of standard methods applied to the AUC summary measure. <italic>FLMM</italic> achieved roughly the nominal pointwise coverage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>), while <italic>Perm</italic> does not, likely because the cluster-bootstrap often performs poorly in small sample settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ju, 2013</xref>). <italic>FLMM</italic> yields substantially better statistical power than the other methods (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). The LMM and t-test exhibit lower power, likely because effects are diluted by analyzing summary measures. In Appendix 5.2, we present additional simulation results that demonstrate that the performance of summary measure methods is highly sensitive to minor changes in the length of the time-interval that the AUC summarizes. These results show how <italic>FLMM</italic> improves <italic>pointwise</italic> coverage and statistical power compared to standard methods and provides reasonable <italic>joint</italic> coverage.</p>

<title>Technical contribution</title>
<p>We introduced a Functional Linear Mixed Modeling framework for photometry data analysis that: 1) enables hypothesis testing at every trial time-point; 2) accounts for in dividual differences and trial-to-trial variability; and 3) allows modeling of longitudinal experimental designs. We extend the <italic>FLMM</italic> framework in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al., 2021</xref>) to enable parameter estimation with <italic>pointwise</italic> and <italic>joint</italic> 95% CIs for general random-effect specifications. Previous work provided <italic>FLMM</italic> implementations for either <italic>joint</italic> CIs for simple random-effects models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sergazinov et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Crainiceanu et al., 2024a</xref>), or <italic>pointwise</italic> CIs for nested models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Scheipl et al., 2016</xref>). However, they do not allow computation of <italic>joint</italic> 95% CIs in the presence of general random-effects specifications, which is helpful for modeling many characteristics of photometry datasets. When conducting the analyses in this paper, we found that nested random-effects specifications, enabled by our method, substantially improved model fits compared to models without nested random-effects. We describe <italic>FLMM</italic> further in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Methods section 4.3</xref> and derive our methodology in Appendix 3.</p>

<title>Evaluation of FLMM in real and synthetic datasets</title>
<p>We demonstrated the capabilities of <italic>FLMM</italic> by reanalyzing datasets from a recently published study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref>. First, we showed that the main scientific questions asked by the authors can easily be answered by specifying covariates of interest, fitting an <italic>FLMM</italic> model, and referring to the coefficient estimate plots for results. Furthermore, we showed that <italic>FLMM</italic> allows direct comparison – and testing – of differences in signal time courses between conditions, something that is difficult with standard methods relying on summary measure tests. Finally, we showed that <italic>FLMM</italic> can reveal significant effects that were tested by the authors, but obscured by summary measure analyses.</p>
<p>The specific effects identified with <italic>FLMM</italic> bear on one of the key questions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref>, namely which of two competing models – RPE and ANCCR – better describe changes in DA responses to unpredicted rewards over trials. For example, in personal communications, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> still argue that the observed DA increases <italic>across-sessions</italic> in the random IRI task may be inconsistent with RPE. However, as a result of our reanalyses, they now argue that the <italic>within-session</italic> decreases, identified by <italic>FLMM</italic>, conflict with the predictions of the initial ANCCR model presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref>. The predictive/explanatory power of RPE and ANCCR as models for measured DA responses depend, however, on their respective model specifications (e.g., RPE reward function) and is thus beyond the scope of the present work. The difficulty in comparing the two models is further compounded by a number of alternative explanations for our findings that cannot be definitively ruled out. For example, satiation or habituation may contribute to within-session DA decreases. An initial exploration suggests that this may not be the sole cause, as the temporal dynamics of within-session reductions vary between-session (Appendix <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>), despite equal levels of food-restriction. The between-session variability in dynamics may, however, reflect learning-related changes in consummatory behavior, and thus may not rule out satiation as an explanation for the within-session DA reductions. Moreover, the authors suggested that the reward-delivery mechanism produces stimuli that could act as a reward-predictive cue. Some of the DA changes may therefore reflect learning about this cue. Finally, between-session DA increases could be due to elevations in indicator expression levels over training. This was, however, explored in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> and they report that transients unrelated to reward did not increase in magnitude across sessions (see Figure S8F-H in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref>). As the authors note, if reward-related DA increases across sessions were caused by higher indicator levels, one would expect non-reward related DA activity to also rise.</p>
<p>In personal correspondence, the authors of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> offered the following possible explanations for the within-session DA decreases within the ANCCR frame work. Specifically, while the ANCCR simulations described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> did not consider the session a trial occurred on, there may be session boundary-effects in animal learning. For instance, animals may estimate the rate of reward to be lower at the start of a session, due to a degraded memory from prior sessions, or to generalization between the high reward rate within the head-fixed context and the low rate outside it. Then the systematic increase in animals’ estimate of reward rate during the session would result in a corresponding decrease in the learning rate of the reward–reward predecessor representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burke et al., 2023</xref>). If so, the magnitude of the reward-reward predecessor representation increase at reward-delivery would reduce across sessions, and result in a negative <monospace>Session Number</monospace>–DA correlation.</p>
<p>To further demonstrate the utility of <italic>FLMM</italic> in answering common neuroscience questions, we reanalyze data in which the authors tested whether, across several sessions of Pavlovian learning, DA activity “backpropagates” from reward delivery (3 sec after cue-onset) to the presentation of reward-predictive cues (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4d">Appendix Section 4.4</xref>). We argue that <italic>FLMM</italic> is well-suited to assess questions like these: the method tests how the signal <italic>timing</italic> evolves both within- and across-sessions by providing a null hypothesis test (i.e., to assess statistical significance) at each time-point. Our results align with those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref>. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amo et al. (2022)</xref> reported fiber photometry data that they argue supports the backpropagation hypothesis, despite being collected from a similar brain region and behavioral task. If researchers apply <italic>FLMM</italic> to test the backpropagation hypothesis in the future, we recommend fitting models that account for between-animal heterogeneity. Our initial exploration suggested that if the backpropagation hypothesis holds, the timing of when that “backpropagating hump” begins to transition may differ between animals. In order to thoroughly test that hypothesis, it may therefore be necessary to specify an <italic>FLMM</italic> mean model that explicitly accounts for this potential variability in timing.</p>
<p>Adjudicating between ANCCR and RPE is beyond the scope of this paper, but our findings suggest that future experiments may be needed to test the explanations proposed in light of our results. Even in the Delay Length change experiment, in which <italic>FLMM</italic> identified significant changes obscured by AUC analyses, it is not clear to us whether proposed versions of RPE and ANCCR would predict the specific change in dynamics observed. As such, modeling trial-level mesolimbic DA as a vector (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wärnberg and Kumar (2023)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lee et al. (2024)</xref>) or function may improve theories for its role in reward learning. By estimating trial-level temporal dynamics, we hope that <italic>FLMM</italic> will make it possible to further refine these theories.</p>
<p>For further evaluation of <italic>FLMM</italic>, we reanalyzed a second study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coddington et al. (2023)</xref>, see Appendix 6) that measures calcium dynamics, showing the applicability of the method to different photometry sensors. There, we demonstrate additional capabilities to: 1) model how signal “dynamics” early in training predict behavior later in training; and 2) estimate covariate interactions across both trial time-points and sessions. Finally, we carried out simulation experiments on realistic synthetic data to verify that, in small sample settings, the <italic>FLMM</italic> framework yields <italic>joint</italic> and <italic>pointwise</italic> CIs that achieve approximately 95% coverage, and improves statistical power versus the alternative approaches introduced. As <italic>FLMM</italic> commits type I errors at roughly nominal levels and outperforms methods that analyze trial-averaged data, we verify <italic>FLMM</italic> is not overly susceptible to trial-level noise or spurious correlations.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Benefits of applying <italic>FLMM</italic> to neural data</title>
<p>Beyond the technical capabilities of our method, we believe there are a number of ways in which it can enhance scientific practice. First, <italic>FLMM</italic> may reduce biases arising from summary statistic analyses. Photometry measures aggregate activity from a collection of neurons, which may contain sub-populations with different functions. By coarsening the temporal resolution, summary measures may obscure the heterogeneity of the target neural population, and bias the study of systems towards sub-populations that exhibit larger signals. Through analyzing each time-point, <italic>FLMM</italic> may help disentangle separate signal components arising from different neural sub-populations. Second, we found that <italic>FLMM</italic> made it easier to identify model misspecification, as estimate plots often provided obvious visual indications (e.g., CI magnitude varying enormously across sub-intervals of the trial). We recommend fitting a few models and selecting one based on fit criteria (e.g., AIC/BIC), without considering statistical significance. Finally, we hope <italic>FLMM</italic> will improve reproducibility by removing the need for some signal pre processing steps. Any data pre-processing will have down-stream consequences on the analysis results and interpretations from most statistical methods. In addition to possibly drowning out effects, some pre-processing steps (e.g., signal smoothing) can reduce reproducibility if the approaches differ across labs. <italic>FLMM</italic> can be used to eliminate some common pre-processing steps by including them as part of the model, or make their effect on the analysis results clearer, as we summarize in the next paragraph.</p>
<p><italic>FLMM</italic> can help model signal components unrelated to the scientific question of interest, and provides a systematic framework to quantify the additional uncertainty from those modeling choices. For example, analysts sometimes normalize data with trial-specific baselines because longitudinal experiments can induce correlation patterns across trials that standard techniques (e.g., repeated measures ANOVA) may not adequately account for. Even without many standard data pre-processing steps, <italic>FLMM</italic> provides smooth estimation results across trial time-points (the “functional domain”), has the ability to adjust for between-trial and -animal heterogeneity, and provides a valid statistical inference approach that quantifies the resulting uncertainty. For instance, session-to-session variability in signal magnitudes or dynamics (e.g., a decreasing base line within-session from bleaching or satiation) could be accounted for, at least in part, through the inclusion of trial-level fixed or random effects. Similarly, signal heterogeneity due to subject characteristics (e.g., sex, CS+ cue identity) could be incorporated into a model through inclusion of animal-specific random effects. Inclusion of these effects would then influence the width of the confidence intervals. By expressing one’s “beliefs” in an <italic>FLMM</italic> model specification, one can compare models (e.g., with AIC). Even the level of smoothing in <italic>FLMM</italic> is largely selected as a function of the data, and is accounted for directly in the equations used to construct confidence intervals. This stands in contrast to “trying to clean up the data” with a pre-processing step that may have an unknown impact on the final statistical inferences.</p>
<p><italic>FLMM</italic> is applicable in a wide range of experimental settings. We provide an analysis guide and open source package, <monospace>fastFMM</monospace> (our package is available on <monospace>CRAN</monospace> and also at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/gloewing/fastFMM">https://github.com/gloewing/fastFMM</ext-link>, which has links to our analysis guide and examples of using the package in both <monospace>R</monospace> and <monospace>python</monospace>) that is the first, to our knowledge, to provide <italic>joint</italic> CIs for functional mixed models with nested random-effects. For demonstration, we selected a dataset collected on a behavioral paradigm, photometry sensor, and signaling pathway that are well characterized, making it easier to evaluate the framework. Although selecting summary measures and time-windows to quantify is relatively easy here, this may not be the case when collecting data under new conditions. In such cases, <italic>FLMM</italic> can characterize the association between neural activity and covariates without strong assumptions about how to summarize signals. Importantly, the package is fast and maintains a low memory footprint even for complex models and relatively large datasets (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4f">Section 4.6</xref> for an example). The <italic>FLMM</italic> framework may also be applicable to techniques like electrophysiology and calcium imaging. For example, our package can fit functional generalized LMMs with a count distribution (e.g., Poisson). Addition ally, our method can be extended to model time-varying covariates. This would enable one to estimate how the level of association between signals, simultaneously recorded from different brain regions, fluctuates across trial time-points. This would also enable modeling of trials that differ in length due to, for example, variable behavioral response times (e.g., latency-to-press). In this paper, we specified <italic>FLMM</italic> models with linear co-variate–signal relationships <italic>at a fixed trial time-point</italic> across trials/sessions, to compare the <italic>FLMM</italic> analogue of the analyses conducted in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>). However, our package allows modeling of covariate–signal relationships with non-linear functions of covariates, using splines or other basis functions. One must consider, however, the trade off between flexibility and interpretability when specifying potentially complex models, especially since <italic>FLMM</italic> is designed for statistical inference.</p>
<p>To conclude, we believe research on statistical methods for fiber photometry is necessary, given the widespread use of the technique and the variability of analysis procedures across labs. We hope that our proposed <italic>FLMM</italic> framework and software further enable investigators to extract the rich information contained in photometry signals.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The framework we introduced is based on functional linear mixed models (<italic>FLMM</italic>), which is a combination of linear mixed modeling and functional regression. In this section, we introduce both of these prior to describing the <italic>FLMM</italic> approach. We then describe the analyses and modeling methods we used to reanalyze data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> (the results of which were presented in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Section 2</xref>) as well as details of the simulation scheme.

<title>Linear Mixed Models</title>
<p>Linear mixed modeling (LMM, also known as multilevel or hierarchical modeling) is a method for testing the association between covariates (i.e., “predictor” or “independent” variables) and an outcome (“dependent”) variable for repeated measures data (or multi level/longitudinal). We provide a brief description of mixed models below, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aarts et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yu et al. (2022)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Magezi (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barr et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barr (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baayen et al. (2008)</xref> for detailed descriptions of their use in neuroscience and psychology.</p>
<p>LMM enables hypothesis testing in repeated measures designs, and can account for and characterize individual differences through inclusion of “random-effects.” Conceptually, random-effects serve as animal-specific regression coefficients (one may include more than just animal-specific random-effects (e.g., session-level random-effects)). This allows the relationship between a covariate of interest (e.g., locomotion) and the outcome (e.g., lever pressing) to vary between-animals in the model, while still pooling data from all animals to estimate parameters. For example, they can be used to model between animal differences in photometry signal magnitudes on baseline conditions (e.g., on a control condition). This can allow the model to capture how variables of interest (e.g., behavior) are associated with the signal after “adjusting” for the fact that some animals may, on average, exhibit lower signal magnitudes on all conditions. While LMMs may not feel intuitive initially, they actually share connections to many familiar hypothesis testing procedures. Just as ANOVAs, t-tests, and correlations can be cast as special cases of linear models, repeated measures versions of these tests (e.g., paired sample t tests, repeated measures ANOVAs, and MANOVAs) have similar connections to linear <italic>mixed</italic> models. We recommend section 1.2-1.3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fitzmaurice et al. (2008)</xref> for more explanation of these connections. This reference also includes descriptions of the capacity of LMM (and thus FLMM) to accommodate: 1) unbalanced designs, 2) varying sample sizes across individuals, and 3) more complicated correlation structures than methods like repeated measures ANOVA.</p>
<p>In order to provide better intuition about LMM in the photometry context, we illustrate the role of random-effects in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>. In panel A, we plot data from 5 animals (photometry data from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coddington et al., 2023</xref>), with behavioral data simulated for illustrative purposes) on multiple trials, to examine the association between the signal and behavior on a test session. Averaging the signal across trials and correlating its peak amplitude with average session behavior results in only five observations, shown in the inset. In <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>, we show the alternative approach that correlates a summary of <italic>each trial</italic> (e.g., peak amplitude) with the trial-level behavioral variable. The linear regression is fit to many more observations than in the session average strategy, but the standard regression hypothesis testing procedure may now be invalid, as we violated the independence assumption by pooling repeated observations within animals. Moreover, it ignores that the numbers of samples (trials) differs between animals. We magnify the inset from <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref> in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref> to emphasize how within-subject correlation arises, at least partially, from animal to-animal variability. Indeed, the linear regressions (Ordinary Least Squares or “OLS”) fit to each animal separately differ from the fit obtained if we first pool all animals’ trial-level data (“All Animals OLS Fit”). This is expected since 1) each animal may have a different “true” regression line (i.e., individual differences), and 2) the estimated lines may differ “by chance” alone due to sampling error. An LMM allows us to pool across animals and trials but still account for individual differences through “random effects”, thereby striking a <italic>balance</italic> between i) the line fit to the trial-level data pooled across animals, and ii) the animal-level fits. In <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref> we show the fit estimated from the LMM (determined by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>), as well as the subject-specific fits that include the random-effects (defined by the <italic>sum</italic>: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for subject <italic>i</italic>). In <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref> the <italic>All Animals OLS Fit</italic> is “pulled” towards Animal 1’s data because we failed to account for the fact that more trials were recorded from Animal 1. In <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, the LMM fit accounts for differing sample sizes across animals and is no longer unduly influenced by Animal 1: it is more similar to the majority of the other animals’ subject-specific LMM fits than the OLS fit. Moreover, we see that Animal 3 in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref> has an OLS fit that differed considerably from all other animals. The LMM subject-specific fit is, however, “shrunk” towards the population fit, determined by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>

That is, the LMM estimates: i) what is common among all animals; and ii) what is unique to each animal. This imbues LMM (and its generalizations) with a flexibility that enables one to account for individual differences and to model correlated data arising from a wide range of complex experimental designs. LMM still require, however, one to analyze summary measures (e.g., AUCs) and thus their application in photometry analyses leads to discarding of within-trial signal information across time-points (the downsides of summary measure analyses are well-characterized in the statistics community (e.g., see section 1.2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fitzmaurice et al. (2008)</xref>)).</p>

<title>Functional Linear Regression</title>
<p>We now describe function-on-scalar regression, a functional data analysis method where the outcome variable is a <italic>function</italic>, rather than a scalar value. We treat the photometry time series from one trial as a “function,” which allows us to test the association between any trial-level experimental variables of interest (e.g., cue type, latency-to-press) and the photometry signal value <italic>at each time-point in the trial</italic>. For example, if photometry data for two groups is collected on one trial, one could fit a separate t-test at <italic>every</italic> time-point in the trial. The t-test at time <italic>s</italic> then assesses the mean difference between the signal magnitude of group 1 at time <italic>s</italic> and the signal magnitude of group 2 at time <italic>s</italic>. Plotting the test statistics vs. time yields a <italic>curve</italic> representing how differences between groups change over time. This provides the intuition behind the functional version of a <italic>t-test</italic>, and is a special case of the <italic>functional linear model</italic>. This functional version of the t-test differs from the common approach of comparing the groups’ signals using a single summary measure (e.g. peak amplitude in the trial).</p>
<p>In essence, the functional linear model (here we describe the <italic>function-on-scalar</italic> linear model but use functional linear model as short hand) is a linear regression with a functional coefficient <italic>β</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) across time-points <italic>s</italic>:

where <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>) ∈ ℝ and <italic>ϵ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>) ∈ ℝ are the photometry value and error term of animal <italic>i</italic> at time-point <italic>s</italic> in the signal.

This functional linear regression framework allows for testing the effects of (scalar) variables at every time-point, adjusting for multiple covariates (continuous or discrete) and their interactions. Functional regression thus exploits <italic>within-trial</italic> signal information. However, it cannot be directly used to analyze multiple trials per animal, since it assumes independence across observations of the signal <italic>between-trials</italic> (see Chapter 5 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Crainiceanu et al.

We provided an informal presentation of the approach in the Results <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2a">section 2.1</xref>, with the goal of enabling researchers with a wide range of statistical backgrounds to understand its application and results. Here, we provide a high level overview of the methodology, with further technical details provided in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Appendix section 3</xref>. <italic>FLMM</italic> models each trial’s signal as a function that varies smoothly across trial time-points (i.e., along the “functional domain”). It is thus a type of non linear modeling technique over the functional domain, since we do not assume a linear model (straight line). <italic>FLMM</italic> and other functional data analysis methods model data as functions, when there is a natural ordering (e.g., time-series data are ordered by time, imaging data are ordered by x-y coordinates), and are assumed to vary smoothly along the functional domain (e.g., one assumes values of a photometry signal at close time points in a trial have similar values). Functional data analysis approaches exploit this smoothness and natural ordering to capture additional information during estimation and inference. Our <italic>FLMM</italic> approach is based on an estimation procedure that was first proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al. (2021)</xref>. We selected this method because 1) it allows for calculation of <italic>joint</italic> 95% CIs, 2) it is readily scalable for the dataset sizes and random effect specifications needed for neuroscience experiments, and 3) it uses common syntax for model specification from the well-known <monospace>lme4</monospace> package.</p>
<p>The construction of <italic>joint</italic> CIs in the context of functional data analysis is an important research question; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al. (2021)</xref> and references therein. Each <italic>point</italic> at which the <italic>pointwise</italic> 95% CI does not contain 0 indicates that the coefficient is <italic>statistically significantly</italic> different from 0 at that point. Compared with <italic>pointwise</italic> CIs, <italic>joint</italic> CIs takes into account the autocorrelation of signal values across trial time-points (the functional domain). Therefore, instead of interpreting results at a specific time-point, <italic>joint</italic> CIs enable <italic>joint</italic> interpretations at multiple locations along the functional domain. This aligns with interpreting covariate effects on the photometry signals across time-intervals (e.g., a cue period) as opposed to at a single trial time-point. Previous methodological work has provided functional mixed model implementations for either <italic>joint</italic> 95% CIs for simple random-effects models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al., 2021</xref>), or <italic>pointwise</italic> 95% CIs for nested models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Scheipl et al., 2016</xref>), but to our knowledge, do not provide explicit formulas or software for computing <italic>joint</italic> 95% CIs in the presence of general random-effects specifications. We found nested random-effects specifications substantially improved model fits in the neuroscience experiments we reanalyzed, and helped model sophisticated behavioral de signs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3c">Appendix Section 3.3</xref> for more details). We therefore derived an extension of the estimator for the covariance of the random-effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al., 2021</xref>), based on a Method of Moments approach described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Greven et al. (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>Mixed effects modeling (and thus <italic>FLMM</italic>) requires one to specify the random-effects in the modeling process. In essence, this amounts to selecting which covariate effects (i.e., regression coefficients) might vary across, for example, animals or sessions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3c">Appendix Section 3.3</xref> for more details on specification and interpretation of random effects). While this may seem unfamiliar at first, in practice, most experimental designs (and the appropriate model formulations) fall under a few categories that can be modeled with extensions of familiar methods (e.g., FLMM analogues of repeated measures ANOVA, correlations etc.). Our method is fully implemented by our package and uses the same syntax as the common mixed effects package <monospace>lme4</monospace>, thereby allowing one to easily fit the models and plot the results. Thus the rich literature on linear mixed model selection and model syntax can be used for FLMM, as many of the same principles apply (e.g., see reviews of LMM and applications in neuroscience and psychology in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aarts et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yu et al. (2022)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Magezi (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barr et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barr (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baayen et al. (2008)</xref>). Users may improve their analyses by evaluating a few candidate models and selecting the one with the best model fit criteria. To that effect, AIC, BIC, and cAIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Säfken et al., 2018</xref>) are already provided automatically in our software implementation. We provide the code to fit models with our package below and we include all code used for this paper (e.g., data pre-processing, model-fitting) on the github page: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/gloewing/photometry_FLMM">https://github.com/gloewing/photometry_FLMM</ext-link>. Finally, since fiber photometry sums photon counts over many neurons (the activity of which may be modeled as only weakly dependent given model parameters), we appeal to the central limit theorem to motivate the adoption of a Gaussian-likelihood for the conditional distribution of <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>i,j</italic></sub> (<italic>s</italic>)| X<sub><italic>i,j</italic></sub>, <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>i,j</italic></sub> (<italic>s</italic>). However, when photon counts are low, our package can be used to fit functional generalized LMMs with a count distribution like a Poisson (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al. (2021)</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Reanalysis Methods</title>
<p>Our primary experimental results in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Section 2</xref> come from a reanalysis of the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref>. Here we provide a high level description of the methods used, with additional details in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Appendix Section 4</xref>. We describe the models we implemented and where possible, we explain the authors’ hypotheses, data pre-processing, and analysis procedures. We often center all covariates to be mean zero to allow an interpretation of the intercept as the mean signal for a trial when all covariates are at their average values. For each of the following analyses, we fit a collection of models and selected the final one based on which exhibited the best AIC and BIC. Finally, the R scripts used to replicate the analyses or derive information from data (e.g., extracting consummatory lick bouts) can be found on the github page: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/gloewing/photometry_FLMM">https://github.com/gloewing/photometry_FLMM</ext-link>.</p>

We use the general notation <bold>X</bold><sub><italic>i,j,l</italic></sub> as the <italic>p ×</italic> 1 vector of covariates for the fixed-effects and <bold>Z</bold><sub><italic>i,j,l</italic></sub> as the <italic>q ×</italic> 1 vector of covariates for the random-effects. The full form of the covariates that fully specify the columns of the associated design matrices can be quite complicated (e.g., when we include animal-specific random-effects for each session). On the right hand side of the mean model, we specify the covariates by name when possible (e.g., IRI<sub><italic>i,j,l</italic></sub> as the inter-reward interval for subject <italic>i</italic> on trial <italic>j</italic> on session <italic>l</italic>), with the understanding that the vectors <bold>X</bold><sub><italic>i,j,l</italic></sub> and <bold>Z</bold><sub><italic>i,j,l</italic></sub> contain these covariates where applicable (e.g., this covariate may be included in <bold>X</bold><sub><italic>i,j,l</italic></sub>, <bold>Z</bold><sub><italic>i,j,l</italic></sub>, or both). As mentioned in the main text, the entry in these vectors can change from trial-to-trial but, unlike the outcome, the entries do not change within-trial and, for that reason, we do <italic>not</italic> include the notation (<italic>s</italic>): <bold>X</bold><sub><italic>i,j,l</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>). Finally, in some models the covariates change from session-to-session but not across trials <italic>within</italic> a session. We indicate how the variables change (e.g., trial to-trial vs. session-to-session but not trial-to-trial) through outcome, covariate, and random-effect subscripts (e.g., <bold>Y</bold><sub><italic>i,l</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>), <monospace>Delay</monospace><sub><italic>i,l</italic></sub>, <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>i,l</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>)).

<title>Reanalysis Methods: Using <italic>FLMM</italic> to test associations between signal and covariates throughout the trial</title>
<p>We analyzed the same set of sessions that were analyzed by the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>) in the section “Tests 1 and 2 (unpredicted rewards).” As noted previously, the set of sessions analyzed by the authors differed across animals, and the number of trials per session differed between sessions. The sessions analyzed and characteristics of these data were presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. All analyses are on data collected with the photometry dopamine dLight1.3b sensor (AAVDJ-CAG-dLight1.3b virus). The virus was injected and the optical fiber was implanted in the nucleus accumbens core. The authors quantified dopamine (DA), measured with normalized AUC of Δ<italic>F/F</italic> during a window 0.5 sec before to 1 sec after the first lick that occurred after reward-delivery. In “Data Analysis: Experiment 1” of the Supplement (p.3), the authors describe that “The [Area Under the Curve (AUC)] during 1.5 sec time window before reward period was subtracted from AUC during reward period to normalize baseline activity. To test dynamics of dopamine response to reward, Pearson’s correlation was calculated between dopamine response and Reward Number, or dopamine response and inter reward interval (IRI) from the previous reward.” In all of our analyses in this section, we tested <italic>linear effects</italic> of all covariates of interest, given that the authors conducted Pearson correlations in their tests and we wanted to implement the most similar model in our framework (e.g., see Fig. S8 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>)). We followed the methods for excluding trials based on behavioral criteria, and for extracting consummatory lick bouts described in “Data Analysis: Experiment 1” of the Supplement (p.3-4) of the original manuscript. We describe this in more detail in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4b">Appendix Section 4.2</xref>.</p>

<title>Reanalysis Methods: Using <italic>FLMM</italic> to compare signal “temporal dynamics” across conditions</title>
<p>We analyzed the data described in section “Experiment 3: Tests 4-5” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>). The authors noted that “[W]hen a learned delay between cue onset and reward (3 seconds) is extended permanently to a new, longer delay (9 seconds), [Reward Predic tion Error] predicts that as animals learn the longer delay…there will be a concomitant reduction in the dopamine cue response due to temporal discounting (46). By contrast, [their model] predicts little to no change in the dopamine cue response as the structure of the task is largely unchanged…Experimentally, [they] observed that although animals learned the new delay rapidly, dopaminergic cue responses showed no significant change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>). Their analysis of DA cue-response was based on a baseline sub tracted AUC (AUC [0,2 sec] - [-1,0 sec] AUC relative to cue onset). They write in their supplement (p. 4) that “Experiments 2-5: [T]o analyze learning-dependent dynamics of dopamine response, AUC of ΔF/F during 2 s from CS+ onset was normalized by AUC during baseline period.”</p>
<p>Our final model included a random slope for the long-delay (9 sec) indicator (<monospace>Delay</monospace><sub><italic>i,l</italic></sub>), where <monospace>Delay</monospace><sub><italic>i,l</italic></sub> = 1 indicates long-delay trials:

We analyzed all trials on the last session of the short-delay (2 sec) and all trials on the first session of the long-delay (8 sec). Because the experimental design included the delay length switch <italic>between</italic> sessions, the covariate <monospace>Delay</monospace><sub><italic>i,l</italic></sub> does not include a trial index <italic>j</italic> (i.e., all trials on session <italic>l</italic> have the same delay length).

This induced some correlation between signals from different subjects when <italic>n</italic>&gt;7, which had a small but predictably deleterious effect on method performances.</p>
<p>For comparisons in the cue period window, we assessed the average performance of <italic>FLMM</italic> evaluated at time-points in that window, against the performance of standard methods that analyzed a summary measure of the window (cue period average-signal, which we denote as AUC) as the outcome variable. The LMM was applied to trial-level AUCs, the paired t-test was applied to subject- and condition-level AUCs. The performances of the <italic>Perm</italic> and <italic>FLMM</italic> were quantified according to the average pointwise performance during the cue period. We present the full consecutive threshold criteria of <italic>Perm</italic> in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and show performance of the 1<italic>/</italic>2 consecutive threshold criteria in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s13">Appendix section 5.2</xref> for completeness. We implemented the consecutive threshold criteria method, adapted to our simulated sampling rate of 15Hz.</p>

This study utilized the high-performance computational capabilities of the Biowulf Linux cluster at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biowulf.nih.gov">http://biowulf.nih.gov</ext-link>). First, we would like to thank the corresponding authors of “Mesolimbic dopamine re lease conveys causal associations,” Drs. Vijay Namboodiri and Huijeong Jeong, for sharing their data, helping us conduct analyses, and interpret the results. This work would not have been possible without their generosity, commitment to open science, and scientific rigor. We also thank Dr. Luke Coddington, the corresponding author of and “Mesolimbic dopamine adapts the rate of learning from action” for generously sharing his data, and being so willing to engage in detailed and open discussions of our analyses. We thank Al Xin for their contributions to the fastFMM package. We would also like to thank Drs. Kauê Costa, Filipe Rodrigues, Guohong Cui, Guillermo Esber, Matthew Gardner, Charles Zheng, Sofia Beas, Adrina Kocharian, Geoff Schoenbaum, Hugo Tejeda, Mario Penzo, Dave Lovinger’s Lab, Joe Cheer’s lab, and the NIMH Machine Learning Core for helpful feedback on our manuscript.</p>

<title>BH Correction</title>
<p>The goal of this appendix is to illustrate the advantages of <italic>FLMM</italic> compared to fitting LMMs to each trial time-point separately, and then applying a multiple-comparisons correction (as proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee et al. (2019)</xref>). We specifically show that, in contrast to the approach applied in that work, <italic>FLMM</italic> yields far less conservative and more stable inference across different sub-sampling rates. We analyzed the Delay Length experiment (shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) data sub-sampled at a range of sampling rates (data were sub-sampled at evenly spaced intervals). We fit either a collection of separate LMMs followed by a Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) correction, or <italic>FLMM</italic> with statistical significance determined from both Pointwise and Joint 95% CIs. To avoid introducing more notation, we show the <italic>FLMM</italic> model, with the understanding that the functional notation can be interpreted pointwise for the approach applied in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee et al. (2019)</xref>:
<disp-formula id="ueqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_ueqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
As shown in Appendix <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>-<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the proportion of time-points, <italic>s</italic>, at which <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline20.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is statistically significant with <italic>FLMM</italic> Joint CIs is fairly stable across sampling rates. In contrast, the percentage is highly inconsistent with the BH approach. For example, the BH approach identifies ∼ 30% of time-points as significant at a sampling rate of 20Hz, less than 1% at 25Hz, ∼ 30% at 30Hz and then drops again to ∼ 1% at 40Hz. As the sampling rate grows towards 125Hz (the sampling rate of the online dataset), the number of statistical comparisons grows, and the proportion of points that are significant drops to below 1%.</p>
<p>For the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline21.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, the BH approach identifies no time-points that achieve statistical significance, even for time-points when the animal is consuming the reward. In contrast, the Pointwise and Joint <italic>FLMM</italic> CIs identify a relatively stable proportion of time-points that are statistically significant. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline22.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is arguably a far more important point of comparison between these two statistical approaches, as the scientific question that motivated this analysis focuses on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline23.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, rather than on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline24.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Qualitatively speaking, the coefficient estimates, the widths of the 95% CIs, and the time intervals of statistical significance appear stable across the sampling rates, emphasizing how <italic>FLMM</italic> yields consistent inference and is not overly sensitive to the sub-sampling rate. We note that a multiple comparisons correction may yield more stable results if one first smooths regression coefficient point and variance estimates. To the best of our understanding, such smoothing was not conducted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee et al. (2019)</xref>. Moreover, such a strategy would essentially be a functional mixed model using a multiple comparisons correction, instead of a joint CI.</p>
<p><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>-<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>: Percentage of time-points in which the coefficient estimates (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline25.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>,or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline26.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>) are statistically significant. We compare the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) correction applied to pointwise LMM models, the <italic>FLMM</italic> pointwise 95% CIs (Pointwise), and the <italic>FLMM</italic> joint 95% CIs (Joint). [Left] The proportion of points that are significant with the BH approach jump around between 20-40Hz and then dramatically decrease as the sampling rate increases. In contrast, the <italic>FLMM</italic> Pointwise and Joint CIs are relatively table and show only slight reductions in the proportion of points that are significant as the sampling rate increases. [Right] The BH identifies no statistically significant effects at any timespoints, whereas the the <italic>FLMM</italic> Pointwise and Joint CIs identify significant effects at a relatively consistent proportion of time-points.</p>

<title>Functional Mixed Models Methods</title>
<p>For a thorough introduction to the Functional Mixed Model fitting framework presented in our manuscript, please refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al. (2021)</xref>. However, for completeness, we provide a short description of the estimation details and then provide a brief derivation of our proposed estimator. The majority of the details presented here can be found in greater depth in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3a">section <italic>3.1</italic></xref>. <italic>Analytic Inference for Gaussian Functional Data</italic> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al. (2021)</xref> but we believe we have included sufficient description of the statistical estimation scheme to explain the derivation of our proposed estimator (presented in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3b">Section 3.2</xref>). For clarity, we focus on functional <italic>linear</italic> mixed models. However, our package also provides the capability to fit the wider class of functional generalized linear mixed models for the distributions supported by the <monospace>R lme4</monospace> package.</p>

<title>Functional Linear Mixed Models</title>

<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline27.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the vector of observations of functional outcomes at time-point <italic>s</italic> for subject <italic>i, J</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the number of functional observations of subject <italic>i</italic>, and <italic>s</italic> ∈ {1, 2, …, <italic>S</italic>}, where <italic>S</italic> is the number of points on the grid of the functional domain (i.e., the number of trial time-points or trial photometry samples). We take <italic>n</italic> to be the number of subjects (e.g., animals) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline28.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. We denote <italic>β</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) ∈ℝ <sup><italic>p</italic></sup>to be the vector of functional fixed-effects at point <italic>s. γ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>) ∈ ℝ<sup><italic>q</italic></sup> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline29.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> are vectors of mutually independent random-effects and error terms for time-point <italic>s</italic>, with multivariate Gaussian distributions. We denote <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline30.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline31.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> as (design) matrices of subject <italic>i</italic> containing the covariates for the fixed- and random-effects terms, respectively. Denote <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline32.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to be a block diagonal matrix where the <italic>i</italic><sup><italic>th</italic></sup> block entry is ℤ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline33.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> refer to the design matrix from row concatenating the subject-specific matrices 𝕏<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. Estimates for the fixed-effects <italic>β</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) are correlated across trial time-points (i.e., the functional domain), which is incorporated into <italic>joint</italic> inference by assuming Cov (<italic>γ</italic>(<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>), <italic>γ</italic>(<italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>)) = 𝔾(<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>) ∈ ℝ<sup><italic>nq×nq</italic></sup> and Cov (<italic>ϵ</italic>(<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>), <italic>ϵ</italic>(<italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>)) = 0 for all <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> ≠ <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline34.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline35.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>We used a two-stage approach for fitting functional linear mixed models. In the first step, we fit pointwise linear mixed models at each time-point <italic>s</italic>, yielding fixed-effect estimates which we denote as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline36.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. The pointwise estimator admits the closed form expression, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline37.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline38.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, and H(<italic>s</italic>) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline39.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>are the covariance matrices of <italic>γ</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) and <italic>ϵ</italic>(<italic>s</italic>), respectively. The variance of the pointwise estimator is Var <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline40.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. The correlation across trial time-points can be seen more explicitly through the following expression
<disp-formula id="ueqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_ueqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where 𝕎 (<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>) = ℤ𝔾(<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>) ℤ<sup><italic>T</italic></sup>.While estimates of ℍ (<italic>s</italic>) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline41.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> are provided by standard mixed modeling software, 𝔾(<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>) must be estimated separately. We detail the estimation scheme below as it plays a critical role in <italic>joint</italic> inference and constitutes the main topic of our statistical contribution. Note that the estimates of 𝔾(<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>), ℍ (<italic>s</italic>), and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline42.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> can be smoothed using, for example, fast bivaraite P-splines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>) along the functional domain (that is, trial time-points) to reduce variability; and then any negative eigenvalues of the smoothed matrices can be trimmed at 0 to ensure the resulting covariance matrix estimates are positive semi-definite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Greven et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Our package provides the option to use an array of smoothing approaches for the regression coefficient estimates, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline43.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, but defaults to using penalized splines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ruppert et al., 2003</xref>). When using penalized splines to smooth the pointwise estimates, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline44.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, the covariance matrix for the final fixed-effects estimates admits a closed form expression, and allows for fast calculation of <italic>joint</italic> confidence band estimates. To see this, denote <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline45.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> as the final fixed-effect estimates after smoothing the raw pointwise estimates, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline46.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, directly provided by mixed model software. Then a smoothed estimator for the <italic>t</italic><sup><italic>th</italic></sup> fixed-effect is, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline47.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline48.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Thus, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline49.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline50.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is a <italic>K</italic>-dimensional spline basis matrix, <italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>is a smoothing parameter, and ℙ<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is a penalty matrix. Typically the number of knots <italic>K</italic> ≪ <italic>S</italic>, but as long as a sufficient number of knots are specified, the smoother and exact <italic>K</italic> selected appear to have little impact on the final coefficient estimates or 95% CIs in practice. To be conservative, we used a high number of knots (<italic>K</italic> = <italic>S/</italic>4). In practice, the specific number could be altered depending on the sampling rate of the photometry data analyzed and the specific sensor (since the kinetics of neurochemical signaling systems can vary widely). The results presented in the paper were calculated based upon implementation of our method using thin-plate splines since these performed well in practice.</p>
<p>Our package leverages the well-known <monospace>lme4</monospace> package in <monospace>R</monospace> for fitting the pointwise mixed effects models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bates, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bates et al., 2014</xref>). This precludes, however, the specification of structure on the covariance matrix of the errors, <italic>ϵ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>) across trials (for a fixed trial time-point <italic>s</italic>) in Gaussian models, functionality provided by, for example, the nlme in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pinheiro et al., 2023</xref>). Future work could explore functional linear mixed models that allow for this functionality. However, in our experimentation analyzing photometry data summary measures (e.g., AUCs) from a range of experiments that observed multiple trials and sessions per animal, we found that model fit criteria (e.g., AIC, BIC, cAIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Säfken et al., 2018</xref>)) were usually much better when accounting for correlation across trials within-animal through random-effect specifications as opposed to placing structure on the covariance of the errors within-subject across trials. Moreover, we found that models that specified the types of error covariance structures applicable to photometry experiments were often slow to fit which is a drawback in our approach to fitting functional mixed models given that it requires fitting many pointwise models. For those reasons, we set our package’s default to use the <monospace>lme4</monospace> package thereby providing both speed and modeling flexibility to users.</p>
<p>We now provide a brief description of our proposed estimator for 𝔾(<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>). The critical role that this plays in inference and in neuroscience applications arises from the nested designs common in the sophisticated behavioral experiments commonly used alongside fiber photometry. We briefly describe this in Appendix Section 3.3.</p>

<p>We begin with a high-level description of the estimator for the covariance matrix, 𝔾 (<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>), and include details below. Denote <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>i,j</italic></sub> (<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>) ∈ ℝ as the functional outcome at time-point <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, for subject <italic>i</italic> on trial <italic>j</italic>.

where <italic>t, v</italic> are random-effect covariate indices. This expression suggests an estimator that regresses the residual products <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline51.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> onto the random-effect covariate products {<italic>Z</italic><sub><italic>i,k,t</italic></sub><italic>Z</italic><sub><italic>i,j,v</italic></sub> : <italic>j, k</italic> = 1, 2, …<italic>J</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>}. Concatenating these covariate products into a design matrix, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline52.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, and concatenating the residual products into an “outcome vector”, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline53.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, allows us to express the estimator as a solution to the least squares problem for each pair (<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>)
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_eqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline54.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is a matrix of the covariate products, <italic>Z</italic><sub><italic>i,k,t</italic></sub><italic>Z</italic><sub><italic>i,j,v</italic></sub>, described above. After calculating <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline55.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is obtained by re-organizing the elements of the vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline56.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> into the entries of the matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline57.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. This estimator is flexible and in principle is agnostic to the random-effect specification, but in practice requires extension for general random-effects specifications, which we derive here.</p>
<p>Before discussing the extension to this estimator, we provide additional necessary notation. Since a single random-effect can require many columns of ℤ to encode the corresponding covariate (e.g., if there are many session-specific random intercepts), separate indices are needed to distinguish between a single random-effect distribution and the (potentially many) columns of the random-effect design matrix associated with draws from that random-effect distribution.</p>
<p>The<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline58.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, described above, is a block diagonal matrix where the <italic>i</italic><sup><italic>th</italic></sup> block entry is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline59.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. The number of columns, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline60.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, will vary depending on the random-effect specification. For example, if one specifies a model that includes session-specific random-intercepts, this would require one column in ℤ (and thus multiple columns in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline61.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>) for each animal and session to encode the corresponding animal- and session-specific covariates associated with these random-intercepts.</p>
<p>Let <italic>q</italic><sup><italic>*</italic></sup> be the number of unique random-effects distributions for a given model, where <italic>q</italic><sup><italic>*</italic></sup> ≤ <italic>q</italic>. Take as an example a model that includes: 1) a subject-specific random intercept, <italic>γ</italic><sub>0,<italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>), and 2) subject- and session-specific random intercepts, <italic>γ</italic><sub>1,<italic>i,l</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>) for participant <italic>i</italic> on session <italic>l</italic>. If we assume that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline62.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, then <italic>q</italic><sup><italic>*</italic></sup> = 2, but <italic>q</italic>&gt;2 (and thus <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline63.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>) since encoding the subject- and session-specific random intercepts, <italic>γ</italic><sub>1,<italic>i,l</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>) would require many indicator variables (entered as columns of ℤ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>). More generally, for random-effect covariate, <italic>r</italic>, denote ℐ<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> as the set of column indices of ℤ that encode random-effect covariate <italic>r</italic>. Although we describe <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>r,i,l</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>) as if it were drawn from a univariate Gaussian for explanatory purposes, neither the estimator nor the modeling software assume independence between random-effects from <italic>different</italic> covariates.</p>

Now recall that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline64.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for all <italic>w</italic> ∈ ℐ<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>. Thus, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline65.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for a covariance value, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline66.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, that is equal across all <italic>w</italic> ∈ ℐ<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> and <italic>b</italic> ∈ ℐ<sub><italic>m</italic></sub>. It then follows that we can simplify the above as,
<disp-formula id="ueqn9">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_ueqn9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
This expression suggests an estimation strategy that takes the product <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline67.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>as a “covariate” in the OLS-based estimator described in expression (5). Organizing these products into the columns of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline68.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> does not result, however, in a full rank matrix for all random-effect specifications. In such cases, the solution to problem (6) is not unique. We solve for the “ridgeless regression” solution to problem (6) because it yields the minimum 𝓁<sub>2</sub> norm estimator and exhibits desirable statistical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hastie et al., 2019</xref>). This can be expressed as the solution to the optimization problem,
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_eqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline69.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> are the residual products (i.e., with entries <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline70.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline71.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. We construct <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline72.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> through reorganizing the elements of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline73.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> into the matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline74.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. The <italic>α</italic>(<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>) can be estimated with the closed form expression,
<disp-formula id="ueqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_ueqn10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where (·)<sup>+</sup> denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse inverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hastie et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, while the estimator requires one to solve <italic>S</italic>(<italic>S</italic> + 1)<italic>/</italic>2 problems of the form above (i.e., one for each unique {<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>} pair), in practice we only need to calculate 𝕄 once for all {<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>} pairs. This allows for estimation of 𝔾 (i.e., for all unique {<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>} pairs) for datasets with many observations, complex random-effects specifications, and large <italic>S</italic> within a couple seconds in total. We found that this approach performed well in practice, and it is the default in our package. All results presented in the main text apply to this version.</p>
<p>The above estimator allows for a fast, flexible extension of the work in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al., 2021</xref>), thereby allowing for 95% CI calculation for general random-effects specifications. This statistical contribution is critical for neuroscience, since studies often exhibit nested experimental designs that require sophisticated random-effect models to properly capture the rich information contained in photometry signals.</p>

<title>Alternative Covariance Estimators</title>
<p>We also explored a collection of related strategies. These are motivated by the fact that one can regress the residual products onto {<italic>Z</italic><sub><italic>i,k,v</italic></sub><italic>Z</italic><sub><italic>i,j,t</italic></sub> : <italic>v, t</italic> = 1, …, <italic>q</italic>}, instead of onto the products of the sums (across indices <italic>t, v</italic>), as proposed above. Denote <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline75.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> as the coefficient estimate associated with the “covariate” <italic>Z</italic><sub><italic>i,j,v</italic></sub><italic>Z</italic><sub><italic>i,k,t</italic></sub> in this regression. We exploit the fact that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline76.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for a covariance value, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline77.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, common across all <italic>w</italic> ∈ ℐ<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> and <italic>b</italic> ∈ ℐ<sub><italic>m</italic></sub>. Solving for the desired quantity then yields the estimator
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_eqn8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
We found this approach (available in our package by setting the argument <monospace>MoM</monospace> = 2) was slower, more memory intensive, and yielded confidence interval coverage comparable to the approach proposed above. We also explored the performance of two estimators for 𝔾 based on mathematical programs that enforce non-negativity of variance components (before eigenvalue trimming). The first mathematical program is
<disp-formula id="eqn9">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_eqn9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where ℳ denotes the set of indices corresponding to variance elements. Expression (8) suggests that one could alternatively constrain the sum, as opposed to each element in the summation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline78.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Thus we also explored performance of the estimator based on the mathematical program,
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_eqn10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
We found that, in practice, the performance of the estimators based on the mathematical programs (7), (9), and (10), performed comparably in simulations. This may be because the eigenvalue trimming applied to the solutions to the above optimization problems yields similar final estimates. Our software automatically implements estimators based on all approaches described above, but defaults to the first estimator proposed above, which is based on the solution to mathematical program (7).</p>
<p>In simulations, we observed that the regression coefficient estimate 95% CIs calculated using our proposed 𝔾 estimator achieved nearly nominal <italic>joint</italic> coverage even with model specifications that yield reduced rank <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline79.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, the above estimator allows for a fast, flexible extension of the work in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cui et al., 2021</xref>), thereby allowing for 95% CI calculation for general random-effects specifications. This statistical contribution is important for neuroscience since studies often exhibit nested experimental designs that require sophisticated random-effect models to properly capture the rich information contained in photometry signals.</p>

<label>3.2.2</label>
<title>Reduced Rank Problem</title>
<p>We point out that the method of moments estimators applied here (proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Greven et al. (2010)</xref>) exhibit a non-identifiability property. While this did not substantially influence the resulting 95% confidence interval coverage in our simulations, we argue that future attention to this issue is warranted. Such settings arise anytime one includes, for example, nested random-effect structures. This is a drawback because these types of random-effect specifications are critical to properly model the sophisticated behavioral designs common in neuroscience which often exhibit multiple layers of nesting. For instance, suppose a collection of animals are trained on multiple sessions, and within each session are trained on multiple trials. Then trial is nested in session, which is nested in animal/subject. Inclusion of animal- and session-specific random intercepts, a common random-effect specification for such experimental designs, will exhibit the challenges above.</p>
<p>In order to make the issue concrete, we describe perhaps the simplest case where the above problem presents. Specifically, we show how the original estimator requires extension in a simple <italic>FLMM</italic> model that is analogous to the functional analogue of the paired samples t-test: a model that includes a single binary covariate such as a treatment indicator (i.e., <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i,j</italic></sub> ∈ {0, 1}), a random subject-specific intercept, and a random subject-specific slope. Suppose we observe a collection of trials indexed by <italic>j</italic>, on a collection of animals indexed by <italic>i</italic>. Then the above model can be expressed as
<disp-formula id="eqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_eqn11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
This model yields the vector of random-effect covariates <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline80.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, and the associated matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline81.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is
<disp-formula id="ueqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_ueqn11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
The above equality follows trivially because <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline82.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> since <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i,j</italic></sub> is binary. The columns therefore exhibit the linear dependence <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline83.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>and thus <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline84.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is not full rank. To our knowledge, no re-coding of the binary variable <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i,j</italic></sub> resolves the above linear dependence problem without changing the contrast (e.g., one could fit a model without a random intercept and include the covariates [<italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i,j</italic></sub> (1 − <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i,j</italic></sub>)].</p>
<p>More generally, the reduced rank problem presents whenever a subject-specific random intercept is included (because it is encoded by a column of ones,𝟙,in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline85.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>) alongside any binary covariate in ℤ. As shown in the example above, this is because the column of ones used for random intercepts, when multiplied by binary covariates to construct the matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline86.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>,will create linear dependence in the columns of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline87.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. This is problematic because binary covariates are needed to encode dichotomous and factor covariates (e.g., in the functional analogue of t-tests and ANOVAs), as well as, for example, session-specific random intercepts in nested designs. As such, resolving this issue is critical to properly model experiments that regularly arise in neuroscience.</p>

<title>Appendix: Random-Effects Structures and Interpretations for Neuroscience Experiments</title>
<p>Functional random intercepts that are unique to each trial and/or sessions can be used to account for animal-to-animal, session-to-session, and trial-to-trial heterogeneity in the signal and is one example where one might include a covariate in the random-effects (that is, included in ℤ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) but not in the main effects terms, 𝕏<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. Inclusion of these session- and trial-level random-effects is an example of one way to account for correlation within an animal across trials and sessions (“photometry signal on trial <italic>j</italic> for animal <italic>i</italic> is likely similar to the signal on trial <italic>j</italic> + 1). Indeed, many neuroscience studies involving behavioral paradigms that involve multiple sessions and trials (and potentially multiple groups) may require complicated random-effects structures to account for animal-to-animal, session-to-session and trial-to-trial heterogeneity in the photometry signal. For this reason, we explored the performance of many models to learn how to best model variability in the data.</p>
<p><italic>FLMM</italic> yields interpretable regression coefficient estimates. Conveniently, they can be interpreted conditional on the functional random-effects or marginally with respect to the random-effects since both interpretations are numerically equivalent in the linear setting. For an intuitive introduction to this equivalence for linear mixed models, we recommend sections 2.2 and 7.4 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fitzmaurice et al. (2008)</xref>. We present the marginal interpretation here because it is often more intuitive for photometry analyses. However, the conditional version has its own advantages.</p>

<title>Appendix: Section Lick Bout Correlation</title>
<p>We present further analyses that illustrate how <italic>FLMM</italic> reveals effects obscured by standard methods. The authors note that the <monospace>Reward Number</monospace>–DA association, reported in their analyses, could arise from <monospace>Lick Rate</monospace> increases that also correlate with <monospace>Reward Number</monospace>. They tested this alternative explanation by applying a Pearson correlation between <monospace>Lick Rate</monospace> and DA. While they reported no significant association, the plot for the <monospace>Lick Rate</monospace> covariate from <italic>FLMM</italic> (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>), shows <monospace>Lick Rate</monospace> exhibits 1) a significant positive association with DA before Lick-bout onset, and 2) a negative association after Lick-bout onset (reaching <italic>joint</italic> significance at ∼ 1<italic>sec</italic>). These results suggest that the correlation analysis of reward period AUC in the paper missed this effect because the AUC summarized a time-window that contained opposing effects. The underlying association was likely diluted by averaging over time-points when <monospace>Lick Rate</monospace> is both positively correlated with DA (the first 0.5 sec of the reward period, visible in positive <italic>FLMM</italic> coefficient estimates) and negatively correlated with DA (the final 1 sec of the 1.5 sec time-window, with negative <italic>FLMM</italic> coefficient estimates). Identifying this effect with a summary measure would have required selecting these time intervals perfectly a priori; this is not necessary with <italic>FLMM</italic>.</p>

We defined the window with reference to the first lick time, not reward delivery time, because the response latency to reward differs across trials.

<title>Photobleaching</title>
<p>In main text Section 2.3, we conducted analyses that showed DA decreased within-session during the post-lick interval of the reward period ([0, 1] sec from Lick-onset): <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> was negatively correlated with signal magnitude during the post-lick period. We include a portion of main <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> here to assist in the photobleaching discussion.</p>

</fig>
<p>We reasoned that if photobleaching caused the within-session decrease post-lick, indications of photobleaching would also be evident in other time-windows in the trial when the average signal was high (e.g., the pre-lick period). We assumed this would hold even if photobleaching depended on light intensity in a non-linear fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Serra and Terentjev, 2008</xref>), since we reasoned the relationship would still be monotonic. The signal–<monospace>Trial Number</monospace> association is, however, actually slightly positive pre-lick (albeit non-significant), indicating that the signal does not decrease on average within-session pre-lick. Moreover, if the degree of photobleaching scales with signal magnitude, then we would expect to see a negative signal–<monospace>Trial Number</monospace> association only during the [0,0.5] sec time-window when the mean signal is higher than it was during the pre-lick period (since the pre-lick period does not exhibit any negative signal–<monospace>Trial Number</monospace> correlation). Instead, the negative correlation is evident in a time-window when the mean signal has returned to close to zero [0, 2.5] sec. In Appendix <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>, we show the same analyses conducted on each session separately. <italic>FLMM</italic> estimates a large positive <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> effect pre-lick and post-lick on session 4, despite the fact that the average signal was higher than on sessions 1-3 when the <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> is negative. Since there are sessions on which it is possible to detect positive <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> effects, we reasoned that photobleaching would not have occluded any true DA increases within-session. Finally, we repeated the above analyses while adjusting for lick frequency and found that controlling for various behavioral engagement summaries did not impact the <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> effects.</p>
<p>In Appendix <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure 14</xref>, we conducted a similar analysis but aligned the signal to reward-delivery. If photobleaching were the main cause of the within-session reductions described above, one might expect the <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> coefficient to be most negative when the average signal is most positive. Instead, these analyses show that the within-session signal decrease (i.e., the negative <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> effect) and the average signal exhibit distinct temporal dynamics. For example, the peak average signal occurs around 0.75 sec post-reward, while the <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> coefficient is most negative around 1.25-1.5 sec. Moreover, while the average signal magnitude has returned to nearly 0 around 1.75 sec, the <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> coefficient remains significantly negative until at least 2.5 sec after reward-delivery.</p>

<title>Photobleaching: Delay Length Experiment</title>
<p>We next sought to determine whether within-session decreases occurred in a different reward learning task collected from the same mice. We analyzed cue responses on the data from the Delay Length experiments (presented in main text Section 2.4). We used data from the final short-delay session because the animals were well trained on the Pavlovian task at that stage. During personal communications, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> suggested these analyses because it provided an opportunity to analyze stabilized event-triggered DA responses in a different task from the same animals. <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figure 15</xref> shows the peak magnitude of the average signal at cue-onset (of the delay length data) is about 4.5 Δ<italic>F/F</italic> units (see the Intercept plot), which is about 15% <italic>higher</italic> than the peak magnitude of the average signal during the post-lick period of the experiment descried above (5 shows that the peak magnitude of the average signal was about 4 Δ<italic>F/F</italic> units). Because the signal is higher and photobleaching is thought to exert a greater effect on larger signals, one would expect photobleaching to have a <italic>larger</italic> effect in this experiment (i.e., a more negative <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> effect). However, <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figure 15</xref> shows that the within-session signal <italic>increases</italic> significantly over trials during the cue period (i.e., a positive <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> effect). <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figure 15</xref> also shows that the signal decreases within-session across trials at reward-delivery (3 sec after cue-onset) despite exhibiting a substantially lower average signal than during the Cue Period. This echos the within-session reductions observed around reward-consumption on the random <monospace>IRI</monospace> task above. We note additional analyses that adjusted for anticipatory licking and other indications of behavioral engagement did not noticeably impact the <monospace>Trial Number effects</monospace>. Analyses that pooled together multiple short-delay sessions yielded similar results. Taken together, these analyses of data from the same animals provide additional evidence against a photobleaching explanation as the main contributor for the within-session reduction described in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. One potential caveat is that there may be additional unmeasured factors (e.g., change in motivation) that increase across trials within a session, thereby occluding an effect of photobleaching. However, we reason that the parsimonious explanation in this case is that photobleaching is not a significant concern.</p>

<title>Photobleaching: Background Reward Experiment</title>
<p>Next we show results from analyses suggested during personal communications with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> to further rule out the possibility that the within-session decrease was a result of photobleaching. We specifically reanalyzed “Test 7” in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref> (original analysis results shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M-P</xref> of their manuscript). They described the experiment as follows:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>“To test whether the significant positive dopamine responses following extinction reflect a retrospective association between the cue and reward, we selectively reduced the retrospective association without reducing the prospective association. We maintained the fixed reward following the cue but added unpredictable rewards during the inter-trial interval. In this experiment, not all rewards are preceded by the cue (i.e., retrospective association is weak), but all cues are followed by reward (i.e., prospective association is high). ANCCR predicts a rapid drop in dopamine cue response whereas RPE predicts no change in cue response if TDRL only considers the cue-reward “trial period” (Test 7, fig. S10). The dopamine cue response remained significantly positive but decayed across trials faster than during extinction.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This experiment was like long-delay sessions in the Delay Length experiment (i.e., a CS+ followed by reward-delivery 9 sec later), but it also included rewards delivered randomly without any predictive stimuli during the inter-trial interval. These “background rewards” were similar to the reward-delivery schedule in the random <monospace>IRI</monospace> experiment presented in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and therefore provide a critical point of comparison. Similar to our random <monospace>IRI</monospace> experiment analyses, we analyzed the same “reward period” time window aligned to the first lick after reward-delivery. We removed background reward “trials” that were too close to each other to avoid signal bleed-over from adjacent trials (e.g., trials with inter-reward intervals that were too short), and trials for which no licks occurred between two successive reward-deliveries (background or reward-predicted) to avoid “double-counting” a trial.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16</xref> shows <italic>FLMM</italic> estimates a negative <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> effect. The magnitude of this negative coefficient is comparable to that seen in the random rewards experiments post-lick (i.e., after the first lick following reward-delivery). However, the within-session effect is most negative pre-lick, unlike what we observed in the random <monospace>IRI</monospace> task presented in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. It seems unlikely that this would be solely explained through satiation since the animals cannot be consuming the reward in the pre-lick period. Finally, we note additional analyses that adjust for lick frequency and other indications of behavioral engagement did not impact the <monospace>Trial Number</monospace> effects. Thus, while these results might be expected if photobleaching was causing the within-session signal reductions shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, we argue that the results suggest that it is unlikely that photobleaching is the sole contributor to these within-session reductions.</p>

<title>Using <italic>FLMM</italic> to test signal changes within- and across-trials</title>
<p>We show how <italic>FLMM</italic> enables hypothesis testing of signal changes within- and across-trials. In the experiment in Section “Tests 9 to 11” of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jeong et al. (2022)</xref>, the authors test whether, across several sessions of Pavlovian learning, DA activity “backpropagates” from reward delivery (3 sec after cue-onset) to the presentation of reward-predictive cues.</p>
<p>They analyzed a summary measure defined as the difference between the average signal during pre-reward-delivery (“Late”) and cue-onset (“Early”) time-windows. We tested the “backpropagation” question with a <italic>FLMM</italic> model with session binary indicators as covariates, similar to a functional repeated measures ANOVA. This yields estimates of mean signal changes, at each time-point, between pairs of sessions. We did not observe significant “Late” period changes, consistent with the authors’ findings (<xref rid="fig17" ref-type="fig">Figure 17</xref>; see Appendix <xref rid="fig18" ref-type="fig">Figure 18</xref> for individual-animal fits). This analysis likely cannot be used to definitively rule out the existence of the “backpropagation” phenomenon, but emphasizes how <italic>FLMM</italic> is well-suited to answer these types of questions. Nevertheless, we identified an additional effect that would be hard to find with summary measure analyses: the average (peak) size of cue-elicited DA, exhibited later in training, is similar to the degree that reward-delivery DA decreased. This is evident by comparing the symmetry between the magnitudes of peak increases during the “Early” period and peak decreases during the post–”Late” period on the last session (<xref rid="fig17" ref-type="fig">Figure 17D</xref>). This illustrates the capability in <italic>FLMM</italic> of directly testing effects visible in graphs, instead of having to perform hypothesis tests on a summary-of-summaries (e.g., a ratio or difference of AUCs).</p>

<p>“[in the] TDRL RPE account (…) dopamine responses drive value learning of the immediately preceding state. We tested three predictions of this central postulate that are each inconsistent with ANCCR. The first is that during the acquisition of trace conditioning, dopamine response systematically back-propagates from the moment immediately prior to reward to the cue onset (50) (Test 9, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Unlike TDRL RPE, ANCCR does not make such a prediction since delay periods are not broken into states in ANCCR (…) Our observations were not consistent with a backpropagating bump of activ ity and were instead consistent with an increase in cue response over trials of learning (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) “</p>

<title>Appendix: Additional Simulation Results</title>
<p>To explore how analyzing summary measures can drown-out effects, we compared method performances on the same analyses across different cue period lengths (2 sec, 2.5 sec, or 3 sec from cue onset), which we visualize in <xref rid="fig19" ref-type="fig">Figure 19A</xref>. These relatively small adjustments substantially influenced estimation performance (see <xref rid="fig19" ref-type="fig">Figure 19B</xref>), and statistical power (see <xref rid="fig19" ref-type="fig">Figures 19D</xref> and <xref rid="fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref>. The pointwise 95% CI coverage (see <xref rid="fig19" ref-type="fig">Figure 19C</xref>) of the summary measure approaches (t-test and LMM) is also very sensitive to the specified length of the cue period because they analyze a summary that averages over a time-window that contains heterogeneous effects. However, <italic>FLMM</italic> and <italic>Perm</italic> CI coverages (averaged over the cue period) remain stable to differing time-window lengths, because they evaluate each time-point. Notably, <italic>Perm</italic> exhibits low coverage at smaller sample sizes and the t-test yields poor coverage in all settings tested, likely because of the animal-to-animal variability in the signal magnitude and Delay Length change effect (the data were simulated from a LMM that specifies independence between observations conditional on random-effects. Since the t-test does not include random-effects, it may not achieve the nominal coverage because it relies on a different conditional independence assumption). Finally, Appendix <xref rid="fig21" ref-type="fig">Figure 21</xref> shows <italic>FLMM</italic> fits in around 10 seconds for datasets with about 800 trials (pooled across animals). Taken together, these data-driven simulations demonstrate that at low sample sizes, and in the presence of individual-differences, the <italic>FLMM</italic> consistently 1) achieves roughly nominal <italic>pointwise</italic> and <italic>joint</italic> coverage, 2) improves statistical power, and 3) can be fit quickly.</p>

<title>Functional methods allow for testing how signal “dynamics” early in training predict behavior later in training</title>
<p>We next analyze data from a second paper focused on the role of mesolimbic DA in reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coddington et al., 2023</xref>). We first examine how between-animal differences in behavior correlate with average nucleus accumbens dopamine neuron calcium changes (NAc–DA; DAT-Cre::ai32 transgenic mice were injected with a Cre-dependent jRCaMP1b virus across the ventral midbrain enabling the measurement of calcium dynamics in mesolimbic DA cells specifically). In this experiment, mice were exposed to a 0.5 sec stimulus, followed by reward 1 sec after cue-offset. The authors identified significant correlations between average Reward period NAc–DA (trial-averaged on <italic>early</italic> training sessions) with measures of average behavior (trial-averaged on <italic>late</italic> sessions).</p>
<p>We fit two analogous univariate models with the average behavioral measures as the covariate (cases without repeated observations on the same animal are equivalent to a <italic>functional</italic> linear regression (without mixed effects)).</p>

<p>Our results reveal details missed in the summary measure analyses. Consistent with the author’s findings, we found Reward period NAc–DA was associated with <monospace>Final Latency</monospace>. However, our analyses also revealed significant associations during the Cue period, an effect hard to see on average traces: while the average signal increases substantially during the Reward period, it exhibits comparatively little change during the Cue period. This demonstrates the difficulty of constructing summary measures: the time-windows when the signal is associated with covariates may not align with time-periods when the average signal exhibits noticeable changes. Remarkably, the association sign differs from the direction of average signal change: <monospace>Final Latency</monospace> is <italic>positively</italic> associated with NAc-DA during both Cue and Reward periods, yet the mean signal <italic>decreases</italic> during the Cue Period and <italic>increases</italic> during the Reward period.</p>

<title><italic>FLMM</italic> provides test of how signal differences <italic>between</italic> trial-types change <italic>across</italic> training</title>
<p>Our final example demonstrates how questions that might otherwise require analysis of summaries of summary measures (e.g., ratios of average AUCs), can be precisely specified in a functional model so as to provide greater detail. Specifically, the authors sought to investigate how the difference in NAc-DA signals between trials with (Lick+) and without (Lick-) preparatory licking changed with learning. They reported a significant correlation between reward collection latency (<monospace>Final Latency</monospace>) and a “ratio of NAc–DA reward signals [AUCs] on Lick-vs Lick+ trials.” We fit an <italic>FLMM</italic> model with an interaction between <monospace>Final Latency</monospace> and <monospace>Lick State</monospace> (a Lick-/Lick+ indicator). The interaction term provides a hypothesis test of their question at <italic>each trial time-point</italic>. The longest portion of joint significance occurs <italic>between</italic> Cue and Reward periods. Our analysis confirms the authors’ results and adds detail obscured by standard methods: the interaction does not reach joint statistical significance until a couple seconds after reward-delivery, well-beyond the time when the average signal has fallen from its peak (shown by the intercept). This example highlights the challenge with constructing an adequate summary measure for this analysis: the period of clearest effect of the <monospace>Lick State</monospace> is before the average signal is largest. This may explain why the authors did not construct a summary measure during the interval between the Cue and Reward periods, when the <monospace>Lick State</monospace> effect was strongest. In sum, this example demonstrates how summary-of-summary measure analyses can be translated into simple <italic>FLMM</italic> regressions that provide greater detail about the time-course and magnitude of the effects throughout the trial.</p>

<title>Methods for Appendix Section 6.1.1</title>
<p>This paper measured photometry signals in which DAT-Cre::ai32 transgenic mice were injected with a Cre-dependent jRCaMP1b virus across the ventral midbrain enabling the measurement of calcium dynamics in mesolimbic DA cells specifically. We sought to conduct an analysis based upon the following quote:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>“Unexpectedly, initial NAc–DA reward signals were negatively correlated with the amount of preparatory behaviour at the end of training (NAc–DA re ward trials 1-100 versus preparatory index trials 700-800, r=-0.85, P=0.004), as well as the speed of reward collection (NAc-DA reward trials 1-100 versus reward collection latency trials 700-800, r=0.81, P=0.008).”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Preparatory licking and latency-to-lick were used as indicators of learning. Since there is no way to meaningfully pair the neural activity of one trial with behavior on a separate trial, analyzing trial-level data is not appropriate and we therefore modeled the <italic>average</italic> photometry signal (averaged across trials 1-100) as a function of <italic>average</italic> behavior (averaged across trials 700-800). We removed trials with latencies over 1 second as they constituted behavioral outliers comprising less than 1% of trials. To conduct a functional regression most analogous to the Pearson correlations the authors conducted, we fit the univariate linear regression models for final latency, <monospace>FL</monospace><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>,
<disp-formula id="ueqn14">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_ueqn14.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

<disp-formula id="ueqn15">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_ueqn15.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

These models were fit with the <monospace>R</monospace> package <monospace>refund</monospace> with the <monospace>fosr</monospace> () function (where fosr abbreviates function-on-scalar regression used for a functional outcome and scalar covariate). Note that this package function only provides <italic>pointwise</italic> 95% CIs and thus the plots in the main text only have one shade of grey for the 95% CIs. Thus the interpretation for this analysis is confined to a <italic>pointwise</italic> interpretation.</p>

<title>Methods for Appendix Section 6.1.2</title>
<p>We sought to conduct an analysis based upon the following quote: “[the proposed] scheme also predicts that [mesolimbic DA] reward signals should reflect the evolution of reward collection policy across learning…Indeed,…mouse data exhibited differential reward responses on trials with (‘Lick+’) or without (‘Lick-’) preparatory licking as learning progressed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coddington et al., 2023</xref>). The authors reported (see the <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8d</xref> caption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coddington et al., 2023</xref>)) a significant Pearson correlation between the final reward collection latency (<monospace>Final Latency</monospace>) and a “ratio of NAc–DA reward signals on Lick-vs Lick+ trials.” They constructed this measure by first summarizing the reward-period NAc-DA (with AUC), averaged across Lick+ and Lick-trials separately, and then calculating a ratio for each animal. Similar to the analysis we presented in the previous section, the authors compared behavior on one set of trials to dopamine activity in a separate set of trials. Because there is no way to meaningfully pair the neural activity of one trial with behavior on a separate trial, we analyzed the <italic>average</italic> photometry signal (Lick+/Lick-separately averaged over the trials specified in the paper) as a function of <italic>average</italic> behavior. Specifically, we modeled the trial-averaged signal denoted as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline92.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for animal <italic>i</italic> and lick state <italic>v</italic>. The signal was trial-averaged separately across Lick+ and Lick-trials. We both indicate lick state with the subscript <italic>v</italic> on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565896v3_inline93.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and also as a covariate in the model where <monospace>LS</monospace><sub><italic>i,v</italic></sub> = 1 for Lick+ trials and <monospace>LS</monospace><sub><italic>i,v</italic></sub> = 0 for Lick-trials.</p>
<p>We denote the final latency below as <monospace>FL</monospace><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. We fit the random slope <italic>FLMM</italic> model,
<disp-formula id="ueqn16">
<graphic xlink:href="565896v3_ueqn16.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Given that the outcome was trial-averaged, the number of observations of the outcome was only twice the number of animals (i.e., one observation of the functional outcome for Lick+ and one for Lick-). We were thus limited in the number of random-effects we could include and still retain an identifiable model. For that reason, our model did not include a random intercept. As for all other analyses in our manuscript, we compared multiple candidate models that we specified based upon the authors analyses. We then selected the model with the best AIC/BIC model fit criteria.</p>
<p>We normalized the (average) <monospace>Final Latency</monospace> variable (across trials) to have mean 0 and unit variance. The intercept therefore shows that mean NAc–DA activity for a mouse with average <monospace>Final Latency</monospace> on Lick-trials is <italic>jointly</italic> significantly elevated during portions of the Reward period. The <monospace>Final Latency</monospace> functional coefficient is interpreted as the effect of <monospace>Final Latency</monospace> on Lick-trials and is only briefly pointwise significant in the middle of the Reward period. The <monospace>Lick State</monospace> main effect is interpreted as the difference in average NAc–DA between Lick+ and Lick-trials for an animal with an average <monospace>Final Latency</monospace> value. The interaction is interpreted as a difference in differences: during the Reward period, a 1 standard deviation increase in average <monospace>Final Latency</monospace> is associated with pointwise significantly higher NAc–DA signals on Lick+ than on Lick-trials (with a portion of joint significance) during most of the Reward period.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Fiber photometry has become a very popular tool in recording neuronal activity in freely behaving animals. Despite the number of papers published with the method, as the authors rightly note, there are currently no standardized ways to analyze the data produced. Moreover, most of the data analyses confine to simple measurements of averaged activity and by doing so, erase valuable information encoded in the data. The authors offer an approach based on functional linear mixed modeling, where beyond changes in overall activity various functions of the data can also be analyzed. More in depth analysis, more variables taken into account, better statistical power all lead to higher quality science.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The framework the authors present is solid and well explained. By reanalyzing formerly published data, the authors also further increase the significance of the proposed tool opening new avenues for reinterpreting already collected data. They also made a convincing case showing that the proposed algorithm works on data with different preprocessing backgrounds.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work describes a statistical framework that combines functional linear mixed modeling with joint 95% confidence intervals, which improves statistical power and provides less conservative and more robust statistical inferences than in previous studies. Pointwise linear regression analysis has been used extensively to analyze time series signals from a wide range of neuroscience recording techniques, with recent studies applying them to photometry data. The novelty of this study lies in 1) the introduction of joint 95% confidence intervals for statistical testing of functional mixed models with nested random-effects, and 2) providing an open-source R package implementing this framework. This study also highlights how summary statistics as opposed to trial-by-trial analysis can obscure or even change the direction of statistical results by reanalyzing two other studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The open-source package in R using a similar syntax as lme4 package for the implementation of this framework, the high fitting speed and the low memory footprint, even in complex models, enhance the accessibility and usage by other researchers.</p>
<p>The reanalysis of two studies using summary statistics on photometry data (Jeong et al., 2022; Coddington et al., 2023) highlights how trial-by-trial analysis at each time-point on the trial can reveal information obscured by averaging across trials. Furthermore, this work also exemplifies how session and subject variability can lead to different conclusions when not considered.</p>
<p>This study also showcases the statistical robustness of FLMM by comparing this method to fitting pointwise linear mixed models and performing t-test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction as performed by Lee et al. (2019).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Loewinger et al. extend a previously described framework (Cui et al., 2021) to provide new methods for statistical analysis of fiber photometry data. The methodology combines functional regression with linear mixed models, allowing inference on complex study designs that are common in photometry studies. To demonstrate its utility, they reanalyze datasets from two recent fiber photometry studies into mesolimbic dopamine. Then, through simulation, they demonstrate the superiority of their approach compared to other common methods.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The statistical framework described provides a powerful way to analyze photometry data and potentially other similar signals. The provided package makes this methodology easy to implement and the extensively worked examples of reanalysis provide a useful guide to others on how to correctly specify models.</p>
<p>Modeling the entire trial (function regression) removes the need to choose appropriate summary statistics, removing the opportunity to introduce bias, for example in searching for optimal windows in which to calculate the AUC. This is demonstrated in the re-analysis of Jeong et al., 2022, in which the AUC measures presented masked important details about how the photometry signal was changing. There is an appropriate level of discussion of the interpretation of the reanalyzed data that highlights the pitfalls of other methods and the usefulness of their methods.</p>
<p>The authors' use of linear mixed methods, allows for the estimation of random effects, which are an important consideration given the repeated-measures design of most photometry studies.</p>
<p>The authors provide a useful guide for how to practically use and implement their methods in an easy-to-use package. These methods should have wide applicability to those who use photometry or similar methods. The development of this excellent open-source software is a great service to the wider neuroscience community.</p>

<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This important work presents a new methodology for the statistical analysis of fiber photometry data, improving statistical power while avoiding the bias inherent in the choices that are necessarily made when summarizing photometry data. The reanalysis of two recent photometry data sets, the simulations, and the mathematical detail provide convincing evidence for the utility of the method and the main conclusions, however, the discussion of the re-analyzed data is incomplete and would be improved by a deeper consideration of the limitations of the original data. In addition, consideration of other data sets and photometry methodologies including non-linear analysis tools, as well as a discussion of the importance of the data normalization are needed.</p>

<p>Thank you for your favorable and detailed description of our work!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, this also leads to several questions. The normalization method employed for raw fiber photometry data is different from lab to lab. This imposes a significant challenge to applying a single tool of analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these important suggestions. We agree that many data pre-processing steps will influence the statistical inference from our method. Note, though, that this would also be the case with standard analysis approaches (e.g., t-tests, correlations) applied to summary measures like AUCs. For that reason, we do not believe that variability in pre-processing is an impediment to widespread adoption of a standard analysis procedure. Rather, we would argue that the sensitivity of analysis results to pre-processing choices should motivate the development of statistical techniques that reduce the need for pre-processing, and properly account for structure in the data arising from experimental designs. For example, even without many standard pre-processing steps, <italic>FLMM</italic> provides smooth estimation results across trial timepoints (i.e., the “functional domain”), has the ability to adjust for betweentrial and -animal heterogeneity, and provides a valid statistical inference framework that quantifies the resulting uncertainty. We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to emphasize and further elaborate on our method from this perspective. We have now included the following in the Discussion section:</p>
<p><italic>“FLMM</italic> can help model signal components unrelated to the scientific question of interest, and provides a systematic framework to quantify the additional uncertainty from those modeling choices. For example, analysts sometimes normalize data with trial-specific baselines because longitudinal experiments can induce correlation patterns across trials that standard techniques (e.g., repeated measures ANOVA) may not adequately account for. Even without many standard data pre-processing steps, <italic>FLMM</italic> provides smooth estimation results across trial time-points (the “functional domain”), has the ability to adjust for between-trial and -animal heterogeneity, and provides a valid statistical inference approach that quantifies the resulting uncertainty. For instance, session-to-session variability in signal magnitudes or dynamics (e.g., a decreasing baseline within-session from bleaching or satiation) could be accounted for, at least in part, through the inclusion of trial-level fixed or random effects. Similarly, signal heterogeneity due to subject characteristics (e.g., sex, CS+ cue identity) could be incorporated into a model through inclusion of animal-specific random effects. Inclusion of these effects would then influence the width of the confidence intervals. By expressing one’s “beliefs” in an <italic>FLMM</italic> model specification, one can compare models (e.g., with AIC). Even the level of smoothing in <italic>FLMM</italic> is largely selected as a function of the data, and is accounted for directly in the equations used to construct confidence intervals. This stands in contrast to “trying to clean up the data” with a pre-processing step that may have an unknown impact on the final statistical inferences.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Does the method that the authors propose work similarly efficiently whether the data are normalized in a running average dF/F as it is described in the cited papers? For example, trace smoothing using running averages (Jeong et al. 2022) in itself may lead to pattern dilution.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>By modeling trial signals as “functions”, the method accounts for and exploits correlation across trial timepoints and, as such, any pre-smoothing of the signals should not negatively affect the validity of the 95% CI coverage. It will, however, change inferential results and the interpretation of the data, but this is not unique to <italic>FLMM</italic>, or many other statistical procedures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The same question applies if the z-score is calculated based on various responses or even baselines. How reliable the method is if the data are non-stationery and the baselines undergo major changes between separate trials?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Adjustment for trial-to-trial variability in signal magnitudes or dynamics could be accounted for, at least in part, through the inclusion of trial-level random effects. This heterogeneity would then influence the width of the confidence intervals, directly conveying the effect of the variability on the conclusions being drawn from the data. This stands in contrast to “trying to clean up the data” with a pre-processing step that may have an unknown impact on the final statistical inferences. Indeed, non-stationarity (e.g., a decreasing baseline within-session) due to, for example, measurement artifacts (e.g., bleaching) or behavioral causes (e.g., satiation, learning) should, if possible, be accounted for in the model. As mentioned above, one can often achieve the same goals that motivate pre-processing steps by instead applying specific <italic>FLMM</italic> models (e.g., that include trial-specific intercepts to reflect changes in baseline) to the unprocessed data. One can then compare model criteria in an objective fashion (e.g., with AIC) and quantify the uncertainty associated with those modeling choices. Even the level of smoothing in <italic>FLMM</italic> is largely selected as a function of the data, and is accounted for directly in the equations used to construct confidence intervals. In sum, our method provides both a tool to account for challenges in the data, and a systematic framework to quantify the additional uncertainty that accompanies accounting for those data characteristics.</p>

<p>Finally, what is the rationale for not using non-linear analysis methods? Following the paper’s logic, non-linear analysis can capture more information that is diluted by linear methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good question that we imagine many readers will be curious about as well. We have added in notes to the Discussion and Methods Section 4.3 to address this (copied below). We thank the reviewer for raising this point, as your feedback also motivated us to discuss this point in Part 5 of our Analysis Guide.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p><italic>“FLMM</italic> models each trial’s signal as a function that varies smoothly across trial time-points (i.e., along the “functional domain”). It is thus a type of non-linear modeling technique over the functional domain, since we do not assume a linear model (straight line). <italic>FLMM</italic> and other functional data analysis methods model data as functions, when there is a natural ordering (e.g., time-series data are ordered by time, imaging data are ordered by x-y coordinates), and are assumed to vary smoothly along the functional domain (e.g., one assumes values of a photometry signal at close time-points in a trial have similar values). Functional data analysis approaches exploit this smoothness and natural ordering to capture more information during estimation and inference.”</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>“In this paper, we specified <italic>FLMM</italic> models with linear covariate–signal relationships <italic>at a fixed trial time-point</italic> across trials/sessions, to compare the <italic>FLMM</italic> analogue of the analyses conducted in (Jeong et al., 2022). However, our package allows modeling of covariate–signal relationships with non-linear functions of covariates, using splines or other basis functions. One must consider, however, the tradeoff between flexibility and interpretability when specifying potentially complex models, especially since <italic>FLMM</italic> is designed for statistical inference.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work describes a statistical framework that combines functional linear mixed modeling with joint 95% confidence intervals, which improves statistical power and provides less conservative statistical inferences than in previous studies. As recently reviewed by Simpson et al. (2023), linear regression analysis has been used extensively to analyze time series signals from a wide range of neuroscience recording techniques, with recent studies applying them to photometry data. The novelty of this study lies in 1) the introduction of joint 95% confidence intervals for statistical testing of functional mixed models with nested random-effects, and 2) providing an open-source R package implementing this framework. This study also highlights how summary statistics as opposed to trial-by-trial analysis can obscure or even change the direction of statistical results by reanalyzing two other studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The open-source package in R using a similar syntax as the lme4 package for the implementation of this framework on photometry data enhances the accessibility, and usage by other researchers. Moreover, the decreased fitting time of the model in comparison with a similar package on simulated data, has the potential to be more easily adopted.</p>
<p>The reanalysis of two studies using summary statistics on photometry data (Jeong et al., 2022; Coddington et al., 2023) highlights how trial-by-trial analysis at each time-point on the trial can reveal information obscured by averaging across trials. Furthermore, this work also exemplifies how session and subject variability can lead to opposite conclusions when not considered.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the in-depth description of our work and, in particular, the R package. This is an area where we put a lot of effort, since our group is very concerned with the practical experience of users.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although this work has reanalyzed previous work that used summary statistics, it does not compare with other studies that use trial-by-trial photometry data across time-points in a trial. As described by the authors, fitting pointwise linear mixed models and performing t-test and BenjaminiHochberg correction as performed in Lee et al. (2019) has some caveats. Using joint confidence intervals has the potential to improve statistical robustness, however, this is not directly shown with temporal data in this work. Furthermore, it is unclear how FLMM differs from the pointwise linear mixed modeling used in this work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for making this important point. We agree that this offers an opportunity to showcase the advantages of FLMM over non-functional data analysis methods, such as the approach applied in Lee et al. (2019). As mentioned in the text, fitting entirely separate models at each trial timepoint (without smoothing regression coefficient point and variance estimates across timepoints), and applying multiple comparisons corrections as a function of the number of time points has substantial conceptual drawbacks. To see why, consider that applying this strategy with two different sub-sampling rates requires adjustment for different numbers of comparisons, and could thus lead to very different proportions of timepoints achieving statistical significance. In light of your comments, we decided that it would be useful to provide a demonstration of this. To that effect, we have added Appendix Section 2 comparing FLMM with the method in Lee et al. (2019) on a real dataset, and show that FLMM yields far less conservative and more stable inference across different sub-sampling rates. We conducted this comparison on the delay-length experiment (shown in Figure 6) data, sub-sampled at evenly spaced intervals at a range of sampling rates. We fit either a collection of separate linear mixed models (LMM) followed by a Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) correction, or <italic>FLMM</italic> with statistical significance determined with both Pointwise and Joint 95% CIs. As shown in Appendix Tables 1-2, the proportion of timepoints at which effects are statistically significant with FLMM Joint CIs is fairly stable across sampling rates. In contrast, the percentage is highly inconsistent with the BH approach and is often highly conservative. This illustrates a core advantage of functional data analysis methods: borrowing strength across trial timepoints (i.e., the functional domain), can improve estimation efficiency and lower sensitivity to how the data is sub-sampled. A multiple comparisons correction may, however, yield stable results if one first smooths both regression coefficient point and variance estimates. Because this includes smoothing the coefficient point and variance estimates, this approach would essentially constitute a functional mixed model estimation strategy that uses multiple comparisons correction instead of a joint CI. We have now added in a description of this experiment in Section 2.4 (copied below).</p>
<p>“We further analyze this dataset in Appendix Section 2, to compare <italic>FLMM</italic> with the approach applied in Lee et al. (2019) of fitting <italic>pointwise</italic> LMMs (without any smoothing) and applying a Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) correction. Our hypothesis was that the Lee et al. (2019) approach would yield substantially different analysis results, depending on the sampling rate of the signal data (since the number of tests being corrected for is determined by the sampling rate). The proportion of timepoints at which effects are deemed statistically significant by <italic>FLMM</italic> joint 95% CIs is fairly stable across sampling rates. In contrast, that proportion is both inconsistent and often low (i.e., highly conservative) across sampling rates with the Lee et al. (2019) approach. These results illustrate the advantages of modeling a trial signal as a function, and conducting estimation and inference in a manner that uses information across the entire trial.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In this work, FLMM usages included only one or two covariates. However, in complex behavioral experiments, where variables are correlated, more than two may be needed (see Simpson et al. (2023), Engelhard et al. (2019); Blanco-Pozo et al. (2024)). It is not clear from this work, how feasible computationally would be to fit such complex models, which would also include more complex random effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing this up, as we endeavored to create code that is able to scale to complex models and large datasets. We agree that highlighting this capability in the paper will strengthen the work. We now state in the Discussion section that “[T]he package is fast and maintains a low memory footprint even for complex models (see Section 4.6 for an example) and relatively large datasets.” Methods Section 4.6 now includes the following:</p>
<p>Our fastFMM package scales to the dataset sizes and model specifications common in photometry. The majority of the analyses presented in the Results Section (Section 2) included fairly simple functional fixed and random effect model specifications because we were implementing the <italic>FLMM</italic> versions of the summary measure analyses presented in Jeong et al. (2022). However, we fit the following <italic>FLMM</italic> to demonstrate the scalability of our method with more complex model specifications:</p>
<disp-formula id="sa4equ1">
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-95802-sa4-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>We use the same notation as the Reward Number model in Section 4.5.2, with the additional variable TL_i,j,l_ denoting the Total Licks on trial <italic>j</italic> of session <italic>l</italic> for animal <italic>i</italic>. In a dataset with over 3,200 total trials (pooled across animals), this model took ∼1.2 min to fit on a MacBook Pro with an Apple M1 Max chip with 64GB of RAM. Model fitting had a low memory footprint. This can be fit with the code:</p>
<p>model_fit = fui(photometry ~ session + trial + iri + lick_time + licks + (session + trial + iri + lick_time + licks | id), parallel = TRUE, data = photometry_data)</p>
<p>This provides a simple illustration of the scalability of our method. The code (including timing) for this demonstration is now included on our Github repository.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Loewinger et al., extend a previously described framework (Cui et al., 2021) to provide new methods for statistical analysis of fiber photometry data. The methodology combines functional regression with linear mixed models, allowing inference on complex study designs that are common in photometry studies. To demonstrate its utility, they reanalyze datasets from two recent fiber photometry studies into mesolimbic dopamine. Then, through simulation, they demonstrate the superiority of their approach compared to other common methods.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The statistical framework described provides a powerful way to analyze photometry data and potentially other similar signals. The provided package makes this methodology easy to implement and the extensively worked examples of reanalysis provide a useful guide to others on how to correctly specify models.</p>
<p>Modeling the entire trial (function regression) removes the need to choose appropriate summary statistics, removing the opportunity to introduce bias, for example in searching for optimal windows in which to calculate the AUC. This is demonstrated in the re-analysis of Jeong et al., 2022, in which the AUC measures presented masked important details about how the photometry signal was changing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, using linear mixed methods allows for the estimation of random effects, which are an important consideration given the repeated-measures design of most photometry studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the deep reading and understanding of our paper and method, and the thoughtful feedback provided. We agree with this summary, and will respond in detail to all the concerns raised.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the availability of the software package (fastFMM), the provided code, and worked examples used in the paper are undoubtedly helpful to those wanting to use these methods, some concepts could be explained more thoroughly for a general neuroscience audience.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this point. While we went to great effort to explain things clearly, our efforts to be concise likely resulted in some lack of clarity. To address this, we have created a series of analysis guides for a more general neuroscience audience, reflecting our experience working with researchers at the NIH and the broader community. These guides walk users through the code, its deployment in typical scenarios, and the interpretation of results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While the methodology is sound and the discussion of its benefits is good, the interpretation and discussion of the re-analyzed results are poor:</p>
<p>In section 2.3, the authors use FLMM to identify an instance of Simpson’s Paradox in the analysis of Jeong et al. (2022). While this phenomenon is evident in the original authors’ metrics (replotted in Figure 5A), FLMM provides a convenient method to identify these effects while illustrating the deficiencies of the original authors’ approach of concatenating a different number of sessions for each animal and ignoring potential within-session effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our goal was to demonstrate that <italic>FLMM</italic> provides insight into why the opposing within- and between-session effects occur: the between-session and within-session changes appear to occur at different trial timepoints. Thus, while the AUC metrics applied in Jeong et al. (2022) are enough to show the <italic>presence of</italic> Simpson’s paradox, it is difficult to hypothesize <italic>why</italic> the opposing within-/between-session effects occur. An AUC analysis cannot determine at what trial timepoints (relative to licking) those opposing trends occur.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The discussion of this result is muddled. Having identified the paradox, there is some appropriate speculation as to what is causing these opposing effects, particularly the decrease in sessions. In the discussion and appendices, the authors identify (1) changes in satiation/habitation/motivation, (2) the predictability of the rewards (presumably by the click of a solenoid valve) and (3) photobleaching as potential explanations of the decrease within days. Having identified these effects, but without strong evidence to rule all three out, the discussion of whether RPE or ANCCR matches these results is probably moot. In particular, the hypotheses developed by Jeong et al., were for a random (unpredictable) rewards experiment, whereas the evidence points to the rewards being sometimes predictable. The learning of that predictability (e.g. over sessions) and variation in predictability (e.g. by attention level to sounds of each mouse) significantly complicate the analysis. The FLMM analysis reveals the complexity of analyzing what is apparently a straightforward task design.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we are disappointed to hear the reviewer felt our initial interpretations and discussion were poor, the reviewer brings up an excellent point re: potential reward predictability that we had not considered. They have convinced us that acknowledging this alternative perspective will strengthen the paper, and we have added it into the Discussion. We agree that the ANCCR/RPE model predictions were made for unpredictable rewards and, as the reviewer rightly points out, there is evidence that the animals may sense the reward delivery. After discussing extensively with the authors of Jeong et al. (2022), it is clear that they went to enormous trouble to prevent the inadvertent generation of a CS+, and it is likely changes in pressure from the solenoid (rather than a sound) that may have served as a cue. Regardless of the learning theory one adopts (RPE, ANCCR or others), we agree that this potential learned predictability could, at least partially, account for the increase in signal magnitude across sessions. As this paper is focused on analysis methods, we feel that we can contribute most thoughtfully to the dopamine–learning theory conversation by presenting this explanation in detail, for consideration in future experiments. We have substantially edited this discussion and, as per the reviewer’s suggestion, have qualified our interpretations to reflect the uncertainty in explaining the observed trends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If this paper is not trying to arbitrate between RPE and ANCCR, as stated in the text, the post hoc reasoning of the authors of Jeong et al 2022 provided in the discussion is not germane. Arbitrating between the models likely requires new experimental designs (removing the sound of the solenoid, satiety controls) or more complex models (e.g. with session effects, measures of predictability) that address the identified issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this point. We agree with you that, given the scope of the paper, we should avoid any extensive comparison between the models. To address your comment, we have now removed portions of the Discussion that compared RPE and ANCCR. Overall, we agree with the reviewer, and think that future experiments will be needed for conclusively testing the accuracy of the models’ predictions for random (unpredicted) rewards. While we understand that our description of several conversations with the Jeong et al., 2022 authors could have gone deeper, we hope the reviewer can appreciate that inclusion of these conversations was done with the best of intentions. We wish to emphasize that we also consulted with several other researchers in the field when crafting our discussion. We do commend the authors of Jeong et al., 2022 for their willingness to discuss all these details. They could easily have avoided acknowledging any potential incompleteness of their theory by claiming that our results do not invalidate their predictions for a random reward, because the reward could potentially have been predicted (due to an inadvertent CS+ generated from the solenoid pressure). Instead, they emphasized that they thought their experiment did test a random reward, to the extent they could determine, and that our results suggest components of their theory that should be updated. We think that engagement with re-analyses of one’s data, even when findings are at odds with an initial theoretical framing, is a good demonstration of open science practice. For that reason as well, we feel providing readers with a perspective on the entire discussion will contribute to the scientific discourse in this area.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to reiterate that this conversation is happening at least in part because of our method: by analyzing the signal at every trial timepoint, it provides a formal way to test for the presence of a neural signal indicative of reward delivery perception. Ultimately, this was what we set out to do: help researchers ask questions of their data that may have been harder to ask before. We believe that having a demonstration that we can indeed do this for a “live” scientific issue is the most appropriate way of demonstrating the usefulness of the method.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Of the three potential causes of within-session decreases, the photobleaching arguments advanced in the discussion and expanded greatly in the appendices are not convincing. The data being modeled is a processed signal (∆<italic>F/F</italic>) with smoothing and baseline correction and this does not seem to have been considered in the argument. Furthermore, the photometry readout is also a convolution of the actual concentration changes over time, influenced by the on-off kinetics of the sensor, which makes the interpretation of timing effects of photobleaching less obvious than presented here and more complex than the dyes considered in the cited reference used as a foundation for this line of reasoning.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the nuance of this point, and we have made considerable efforts in the Results and Discussion sections to caution that alternative hypotheses (e.g., photobleaching) cannot be definitively ruled out. In response to your criticism, we have consulted with more experts in the field regarding the potential for bleaching in this data, and it is not clear to us why photobleaching would be visible in one time-window of a trial, but not at another (less than a second away), despite high ∆<italic>F/F</italic> magnitudes in both time-windows. We do wish to point out that the Jeong et al. (2022) authors were also concerned about photobleaching as a possible explanation. At their request, we analyzed data from additional experiments, collected from the same animals. In most cases, we did not observe signal patterns that seemed to indicate photobleaching. Given the additional scrutiny, we do not think that photobleaching is more likely to invalidate results in this particular set of experiments than it would be in any other photometry experiment. While the role of photobleaching may be more complicated with this sensor than others in the references, that citation was included primarily as a way of acknowledging that it is possible that non-linearities in photobleaching could occur. Regardless, your point is well taken and we have qualified our description of these analyses to express that photobleaching cannot be ruled out.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Within this discussion of photobleaching, the characterization of the background reward experiments used in part to consider photobleaching (appendix 7.3.2) is incorrect. In this experiment (Jeong et al., 2022), background rewards were only delivered in the inter-trial-interval (i.e. not between the CS+ and predicted reward as stated in the text). Both in the authors’ description and in the data, there is a 6s before cue onset where rewards are not delivered and while not described in the text, the data suggests there is a period after a predicted reward when background rewards are not delivered. This complicates the comparison of this data to the random reward experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out! We removed the parenthetical on page 18 of the appendix that incorrectly stated that rewards can occur between the CS+ and the predicted reward.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The discussion of the lack of evidence for backpropagation, taken as evidence for ANCCR over RPE, is also weak.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our point was initially included to acknowledge that, although our method yields results that conflict with the conclusions described by Jeong et al., 2022 on data from some experiments, on other experiments our method supports their results. Again, we believe that a critical part of re-analyzing shared datasets is acknowledging both areas where new analyses support the original results, as well as those where they conflict with them. We agree with the reviewer that qualifying our results so as not to emphasize support for/against RPE/ANCCR will strengthen our paper, and we have made those changes. We have qualified the conclusions of our analysis to emphasize they are a demonstration of how <italic>FLMM</italic> can be used to answer a certain style of question with hypothesis testing (how signal dynamics change across sessions), as opposed to providing evidence for/against the backpropagation hypothesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A more useful exercise than comparing FLMM to the methods and data of Jeong et al., 2022, would be to compare against the approach of Amo et al., 2022, which identifies backpropagation (data publicly available: DOI: 10.5061/dryad.hhmgqnkjw). The replication of a positive result would be more convincing of the sensitivity of the methodology than the replication of a negative result, which could be a result of many factors in the experimental design. Given that the Amo et al. analysis relies on identifying systematic changes in the timing of a signal over time, this would be particularly useful in understanding if the smoothing steps in FLMM obscure such changes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. Your thoughtful review has convinced us that focusing on our statistical contribution will strengthen the paper, and we made changes to further emphasize that we are not seeking to adjudicate between RPE/ANCCR. Given the length of the manuscript as it stands, we could only include a subset of the analyses conducted on Jeong et al., 2022, and had to relegate the results from the Coddington et al., data to an appendix. Realistically, it would be hard for us to justify including analyses from a third dataset, only to have to relegate them to an appendix. We did include numerous examples in our manuscript where we already replicated positive results, in a way that we believe demonstrates the sensitivity of the methodology. We have also been working with many groups at NIH and elsewhere using our approach, in experiments targeting different scientific questions. In fact, one paper that extensively applies our method, and compares the results with those yielded by standard analysis of AUCs, is already published (Beas et al., 2024). Finally, in our analysis guide we describe additional analyses, not included in the manuscript, that replicate positive results. Hence there are numerous demonstrations of <italic>FLMM</italic>’s performance in less controversial settings. We take your point that our description of the data supporting one theory or the other should be qualified, and we have corrected that. Specifically for your suggestion of Amo et al. 2022, we have not had the opportunity to personally reanalyze their data, but we are already in contact with other groups who have conducted preliminary analyses of their data with <italic>FLMM</italic>. We are delighted to see this, in light of your comments and our decision to restrict the scope of our paper. We will help them and other groups working on this question to the extent we can.</p>

<p>This is a great point. Our updated manuscript Discussion includes the following:</p>
<p>“The <italic>FLMM</italic> framework may also be applicable to techniques like electrophysiology and calcium imaging. For example, our package can fit functional generalized LMMs with a count distribution (e.g., Poisson). Additionally, our method can be extended to model time-varying covariates. This would enable one to estimate how the level of association between signals, simultaneously recorded from different brain regions, fluctuates across trial time-points. This would also enable modeling of trials that differ in length due to, for example, variable behavioral response times (e.g., latency-topress).”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>The authors should define ’function’ in context, as well as provide greater detail of the alternate tests that FLMM is compared to in Figure 7.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We include a description of the alternate tests in Appendix Section 5.2. We have updated the Methods Section (Section 4) to introduce the reader to how ‘functions’ are conceptualized and modeled in the functional data analysis literature. Specifically, we added the following text:</p>
<p><italic>“FLMM</italic> models each trial’s signal as a function that varies smoothly across trial time-points (i.e., along the “functional domain”).

<p>Given the novelty of estimating joint CIs, the authors should be clearer about how this should be reported and how this differs from pointwise CIs (and how this has been done in the past).</p>
<p>We appreciate your pointing this out, as the distinction is nuanced. Our manuscript includes a description of how <italic>joint</italic> CIs enable one to interpret effects as statistically significant for time-intervals as opposed to individual timepoints. Unlike <italic>joint</italic> CIs, assessing significance with pointwise CIs suffers from multiple-comparisons problems. As a result of your suggestion, we have included a short discussion of this to our analysis guide (Part 1), entitled “Pointwise or Joint 95% Confidence Intervals.” The Methods section of our manuscript also includes the following:</p>
<p>“The construction of <italic>joint</italic> CIs in the context of functional data analysis is an important research question; see Cui et al. (2021) and references therein. Each <italic>point</italic> at which the <italic>pointwise</italic> 95% CI does not contain 0 indicates that the coefficient is <italic>statistically significantly</italic> different from 0 at that point. Compared with <italic>pointwise</italic> CIs, <italic>joint</italic> CIs takes into account the autocorrelation of signal values across trial time-points (the functional domain). Therefore, instead of interpreting results at a specific timepoint, <italic>joint</italic> CIs enable <italic>joint</italic> interpretations at multiple locations along the functional domain. This aligns with interpreting covariate effects on the photometry signals across time-intervals (e.g., a cue period) as opposed to at a single trial time-point. Previous methodological work has provided functional mixed model implementations for either <italic>joint</italic> 95% CIs for simple random-effects models (Cui et al., 2021), or <italic>pointwise</italic> 95% CIs for nested models (Scheipl et al., 2016), but to our knowledge, do not provide explicit formulas or software for computing <italic>joint</italic> 95% CIs in the presence of general random-effects specifications.”</p>

<p>The authors identify that many photometry studies are complex nested longitudinal designs, using the cohort of 8 animals used in five task designs of Jeong et al. 2022 as an example. The authors miss the opportunity to illustrate how FLMM might be useful in identifying the effects of subject characteristics (e.g. sex, CS+ cue identity).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a fantastic point and we have added the following into the Discussion:</p>
<p>“...[S]ignal heterogeneity due to subject characteristics (e.g., sex, CS+ cue identity) could be incorporated into a model through inclusion of animal-specific random effects.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In discussing the delay-length change experiment, it would be more accurate to say that proposed versions of RPE and ANCCR do not predict the specific change.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Good point. We have made this change.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor corrections:</p>
<p>Panels are mislabeled in Figure 5.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. We have corrected this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The Crowder (2009) reference is incorrect, being a review of the book with the book presumably being the correct citation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Good catch, thank you! Corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Section 5 (first appendix), the authors could include the alternate spelling ’fibre photometry’ to capture any citations that use British English spelling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a great suggestion, but we did not have time to recreate these figures before re-submission.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Section 7.4 is almost all quotation, though unevenly using the block quotation formatting. It is unclear why such a large quotation is included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have removed this Appendix section (formerly Section 7.4) as the relevant text was already included in the Methods section.</p>
