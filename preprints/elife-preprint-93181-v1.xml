<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing is revolutionizing bacterial outbreak investigation but its application to the clinic remains limited. In 2020, prospective and retrospective surveillance detected a <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> outbreak with 254 isolates collected from 82 patients in 27 wards of a hospital. Its origin was dated to the late 90s, just after the facility opened, and patient-to-patient and environment-to-patient cases of transmission were inferred. Over time, two epidemic subclones evolved in separate hosts and hospital areas, including newly opened wards, and hospital-wide sampling confirmed reservoirs persisted in the plumbing. Pathoadaptive mutations in genes associated with virulence, cell wall biogenesis, and antibiotic resistance were identified. While the latter correlated with the acquisition of phenotypic resistances to 1st (cephalosporin), 2nd (carbapenems) and 3rd (colistin) lines of treatment, maximum parsimony suggested that a truncation in a lipopolysaccharide component coincided with the emergence of a subclone prevalent in chronic infections. Since initial identification, extensive infection control efforts guided by routine, near real-time surveillance have proved successful at slowing transmission.</p>

<title>Significance statement</title>
<p>Every year, millions of hospital-associated infections are threatening patient lives. This, in a world in which rates of resistances to existing antibiotics are increasing. And this, at a time dubbed the post-antibiotic era when new drugs are scarce. But now is also the golden age of genomics. Here, applying this transformative technology to the clinic revealed an outbreak of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, resistant to last line antibiotics, that had escaped detection for decades. The mapping of transmission chains, through hospital floors, pointed to environmental reservoirs in intensive care units but also provided critical insights into the evolution and adaptation of this pathogen. Genomic data, shared in near real-time with the hospital, resulted in targeted interventions and the prevention of new cases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a versatile, opportunistic human pathogen causing a wide range of infections of both community and hospital origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In the clinic, patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), severe burns or neutropenia are of highest risk and cases are associated with high morbidity and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the management of these infections is increasingly difficult due to the global emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains, especially carbapenem-resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (CRPA), which now account for 16-30% of cases in the US<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. In response, global and national agencies have categorized CRPA as a âCriticalâ pathogen posing a serious threat on public health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While high-risk MDR lineages, exemplified by the most globally prevalent sequence type (ST) 235, are enriched in isolates carrying acquired carbapenemases and/or extended-spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, the hallmark of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lies in its remarkable propensity for developing resistances through chromosomal mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Within the hundreds of intrinsic genes comprising this mutational resistome, several harbor well-characterized modifications that are the most common cause of resistance for nearly all classes of drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. These include gain-of-function mutations in gyrase subunits GyrAB (fluoroquinolones), penicillin-binding protein PBP3 (cephalosporins), various Mex efflux systems (multiple antimicrobials) as well as inactivation of the porin OprD (carbapenems) or the sensor component of the PhoPQ system, the latter associated with resistance to last-line polymyxin antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Being capable of both acute and chronic infection, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> possesses a large arsenal of virulence factors such as a type 4 pili (T4P), O-antigens and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), extracellular enzymes, exotoxins (<italic>e.g.</italic> ExoS/U), a flagellum and five types of secretion systems (TSSs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. These are generally part of complex regulatory pathways in which two-component systems (TCSs) often play a major role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The ability of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to form biofilm is a key aspect of its persistence in patients with chronic infections as well as in environmental niches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In the hospital, biofilms are often found in water-related environments and eradication is particularly difficult due to increased disinfectant resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. This in turn poses a challenge for infection prevention and control (IPAC) as illustrated by the increasing reports of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> outbreaks and hospital-acquired infections (HAI) linked to contaminated sinks, drains or taps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, routine genome-based surveillance of MDR clinical isolates across the US Military Health System (MHS) identified an epidemic cluster of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in a single hospital in 2020. Retrospective analysis of isolates from the preceding ten years, together with Bayesian phylogenetics, revealed a protracted outbreak clone with cases from all hospital floors and an origin dated to the late 1990s. Dissection of this unique dataset sheds new light on the evolution, persistence, and routes of transmission of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the clinic.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ST-621 is endemic in a large US tertiary hospital</title>
<p>The Multidrug-Resistant Organism Repository and Surveillance Network (MRSN) performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 5,129 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates received between 2011 and 2020 from 71 facilities around the globe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. While a total of 547 STs were represented, high-risk epidemic lineages ST-235/<italic>exoU</italic>+ (10%) and ST-244/<italic>exoS+</italic> (5%) were the most prevalent and widespread with isolates recovered from &gt;28 facilities in each case (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref></bold>). By contrast, isolates from lineage ST-621/<italic>exoS+</italic> also represented 5% of the total STs, but originated from just 6 facilities, with 89% from a single US tertiary hospital (Facility A) and sharing high-level genetic relatedness by core genome MLST (cgMLST) (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref></bold>). Furthermore, of the 5 additional facilities from which ST-621 was detected, patient transfer from facility A was observed in three instances and isolates from the remaining two were genetically distinct strains (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Retrospective analysis revealed that a total of 254 ST-621 isolates were collected from facility A between May 2011 and December 2020. The majority were isolated from respiratory (42%) and urine (39%) samples, followed by wound (7%), surveillance (6%), tissue (3%), and blood cultures (2%) (<bold>Table S1</bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>A protracted outbreak with cases dispersed throughout floors and wards</title>
<p>Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that all ST-621 isolates from facility A belonged to the same outbreak clone with an average distance (all vs all) of just 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). A total of 82 patients were represented, with the majority (56%) contributing serial isolates. In particular, six patients (ID 10, 27, 34, 35, 49 and 63) showed prolonged carriage, best exemplified by patient 35 from whom 21 urine isolates were collected over 4.5 years (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Two outbreak subclones, designated SC1 and SC2, were identified from the tree topology and showed increased genetic relatedness within each (average distance of 24 and 31 SNPs, respectively) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). Overall ST-621 isolates were observed in 27 wards/units from all 7 floors of two buildings (Main and Tower Buildings) in facility A (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>), yet subclones SC1 and SC2 were spatially and temporally distinct. 78% of SC1 isolates were collected from patients in the Main Building and 60% were detected before 2014. In contrast, 52% of SC2 isolates originated from patients in the Tower Building and 77% were collected after 2014 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). Specifically, the early spread of SC1 was largely connected to patients in adjacent ICUs and step-down units on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors (wards 1-10) of the Main Building. The subsequent emergence of SC2 largely centered in patients receiving care in adjacent ICUs (wards 20-21) on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor within the Tower Building (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref></bold>). Throughout the outbreak, new cases due to either SC1 or SC2 were also detected from patients in the emergency room (ER). Unlike the isolates from other locations, these ER isolates were nearly all (32 vs 92%, p &lt;.0001) from urine cultures (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The epidemic curve revealed that between 2011 and 2016 an average of 11.5 new cases were detected every year. From 2017 to 2021, only 12 new patients were identified (3 cases a year) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>)</bold>. Although the rate of outbreak cases appeared to decrease, the overall number of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cases in facility A (irrespective of lineages) remained stable throughout the studied period. However, due to staffing issues, the number of isolates received/sequenced by the MRSN every year was not consistent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>An origin dated soon after the opening of facility A</title>
<p>Though the collection of clinical isolates at facility A only started in 2011, genetic diversity was already evident (16.3 SNPs on average), suggesting an earlier origin (<bold>Table S2</bold>). Molecular clock phylogenetic analyses of all studied isolates inferred the time of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) to be in 1999 (Â± 3 years), soon after the opening of the Main Building of facility A in 1996 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Furthermore, this analysis predicted that, despite the observed temporal succession in sequenced isolates, SC2 was not a descendant of SC1. Instead, the two subclones emerged concurrently with respective MRCAs dated in 2004 (Â± 2 years) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="550326v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Despite this predicted early origin, it is only after facility expansion and the opening of the Tower Building in 2012 that the first SC2 isolates were ever sampled (<bold>Table S1</bold>).</p>
<p>Specifically, the earliest SC2 isolate collected was from a wound infection in patient 27. Remarkably, the 15 serial isolates collected over 3 years (2012 to 2015) from this chronically infected patient were not monophyletic and their MRCA coincided with the emergence of this subclone (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Environmental reservoirs sustain nosocomial transmission</title>
<p>The presumed origin of an infection, either directly from patient-to-patient or from environment-to-patient, was designated based on SNP thresholds (starting from pairwise comparisons for all inter-patient isolates, <bold>Table S2</bold>) and known epidemiological links, or lack thereof. Indeed, while a unimodal distribution of SNPs (peak at 40.5) was observed for the whole cohort, a bimodal profile appeared when inter-patient isolates from the same month, the same ward, or both were selected (local maxima of the lower peak at 12.4, 15.3, and 11.6 SNPs respectively) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>). This pool of virtually identical isolates from patients with spatial and temporal overlap represented the most likely cases of direct, patient-to-patient transmission. Pairs of isolates from only 10 patients satisfied these conditions (<bold>Table S1</bold>): All carried subclone SC1, occurred in 2011 and 2012 (with two exceptions), and six were hospitalized in ICU #1 in the Main Building of facility A (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>In contrast, a presumed environmental origin was designated when a new patient was infected with a virtually identical strain from a preceding patient in the same ward, but no known temporal overlap was established for at least 1 year. Twelve cases met these criteria (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and Table S2</bold>). Among them, 3 patients (ID 57, 61, and 74) in ICU #20 on the Tower Building had primary isolates of subclone SC2 that were distinct by only 0-4 SNPs despite being collected years apart (in 2015, 2016, and 2018, respectively) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>). Furthermore, an origin from contaminated surfaces was also predicted for 7 of the 9 most recent patients (2018-2020). This included 5 cases caused by the apparent resurgence of SC1 in ICUs #1-2 of the Main Building (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>Genomic inferences were supported by contemporary environmental sampling, conducted in 2021 and 2022, which confirmed the existence of reservoirs (<italic>i.e</italic>. sink drains located in patient rooms) of both SC1 and SC2 isolates (n = 17) in 7 distinct patient rooms in wards #1, 2, 6 and 20 throughout the Main and Tower Buildings of facility A (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, Table S3</bold>). In that timeframe, an additional 56 clinical isolates (25 SC1 and 31 SC2) from 13 patients (including 11 new cases) were collected, indicating transmission events were still occurring (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Genotypically, outbreak isolates contained no plasmids (based on the finished genomes of a diverse subset of isolates, <bold>Table S1</bold>) and, besides an intrinsic AmpC-type Î²-lactamase, only carried two acquired resistance genes, known to confer resistance to ciprofloxacin (<italic>crpP</italic>) and tobramycin (<italic>aac(6â)-Ib4</italic>) (<bold>Table S1</bold>). To explain other phenotypic resistances, and in the absence of an acquired ESBL or carbapenemase, a genome-wide analysis of non-synonymous (NSY) and loss of function (LOF) mutations was performed for all outbreak isolates (<bold>Table S5</bold>). From a list of 164 genes (<bold>Table S6</bold>) for which known chromosomal mutations have been linked to antibiotic resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, 68 distinct mutations (including 20 predicted LOF) in 37/164 genes were identified in at least one outbreak isolate (<bold>Table S7</bold>). Of particular interest, 8 genes (or functional clusters) were each mutated independently three or more times (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The most frequently mutated gene was <italic>oprD</italic>, encoding a porin that facilitates the diffusion of amino acids, small peptides, and carbapenem antibiotics into the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Five of the six independent mutations identified in OprD were predicted LOF, including an R6* stop codon and a R318fs frameshift observed in 115 SC2 and 92 SC1 isolates, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, Table S7</bold>). Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (PAUP) predicted that both the R318fs and R6* mutations occurred early (between 2006-2008) within the evolution of their respective subclones (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Despite this early origin, highly carbapenem resistant SC2-OprD-R6* isolates were first sampled from patients in mid-2012 and only became predominant from 2014 onward (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Within all other mutations in antibiotic resistance associated genes (<bold>Table S7</bold>), only two more variants were found in &gt; 50 outbreak isolates: a W97* stop codon in Î²-lactamase expression regulator AmpD and a R504C substitution in penicillin-binding protein PBP3 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). The LOF in AmpD, predicted to have emerged in 2012, was observed in a subset of 51 monophyletic SC2-OprD-R6* background isolates that were not consistently resistant to cefepime (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). In contrast, the R504C substitution in PBP3 was acquired independently twice (within SC1-OprD-R318fs in 2007 and within SC2-OprD-R6* in 2014) and was strongly associated with a resistance to 4<sup>th</sup>-generation cephalosporins (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Overall, <italic>ampD</italic> and <italic>pbp3</italic> were among the genes with the most independently acquired NSY or LOF mutations, with six and four distinct sites, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). Accumulation of mutations, albeit in small numbers of isolates, was also observed in other genes involved in Î²-lactam resistance (<italic>e.g.</italic> catabolite repression control <italic>crc</italic>, and <italic>mpl</italic> UDP-muramic acid/peptide ligase) as well as antibiotic efflux systems (<italic>mexXY</italic> and <italic>mexCD</italic>-<italic>oprJ</italic>) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>WGS technology is revolutionizing IPAC. Here, routine surveillance of MDR pathogens across the MHS was critical in uncovering a decades-long <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> epidemic cluster. With traditional approaches alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, comparable outbreaks may avoid detection due to the sporadic nature of patient infections, scattering of cases throughout the hospital, and changing antibiotic susceptibility profiles. Furthermore, because of budget constraints, surveillance programs focusing on âhigh-riskâ isolates carrying select resistance genes (<italic>e.g.</italic> ESBLs, carbapenemases)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, would also fail to detect this ST-621 outbreak clone. Indeed, while the ST-621 lineage was the focus of several studies in the late 2000âs, these examined a <italic>bla</italic><sub>IMP-13</sub> carrying epidemic clone which spread throughout Europe and has since been sporadically detected in South America and Southeast Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. To our knowledge this IMP-carrying strain has not been reported in the USA to date, and the outbreak in Facility A is the result of a distinct MDR clone lacking the carbapenemase.</p>
<p>Similar to the MHS, healthcare networks worldwide that already benefit from prospective WGS surveillance programs are reporting large numbers of unrecognized outbreaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, two resources rarely available in other settings were key to this investigation: a genome repository of isolates from the preceding decade and the ability to conduct prospective environmental sampling. The former was integral to date the presumed origin of the outbreak to the late 90s, soon after the hospital opened, and to trace the evolution and separate spread of two subclones throughout floors and wards. The latter revealed that, more than 20 years later, reservoirs of both subclones persist in sink drains from patient rooms throughout the facility. This supports previous evidence implicating these sites as major reservoirs for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the clinic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Decontamination of drains can be extremely challenging due to the limited penetration of disinfectants, the lack of access (<italic>e.g.</italic> to perform scrubbing), recolonization (<italic>e.g.</italic> disposal of contaminated patient specimens) or retrograde growth from p-traps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, sinks with shallow basins and gooseneck faucets directing water straight into the drain, similar to those in Facility A (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>), have been linked to increased back splash onto nearby surfaces and medical equipment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Besides environmental contamination, reservoirs within patients likely contributed to the spread and longevity of the outbreak. In particular, chronic infections, documented for a significant fraction of patients, provided a recurring source of the epidemic clone. It is noteworthy that 5 of the 6 patients with chronic (&gt; 1 year) infections (and 9 out of 11 if reduced to 6 months) were carriers of subclone SC2. Compared to SC1, all but one SC2 isolates carried a truncated WbpX glycosyltransferase, an essential component of the common polysaccharide antigen (CPA) biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. While this mutation could result in increased immune evasion, the rough LPS phenotype recurrently observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (in particular in CF patients) usually results from a functional CPA but the lack of O-specific antigen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In further evidence for a progression toward a host-adapted lifestyle, a convergence of mutations in genes involved in alginate production, quorum-sensing deficiency, loss of motility, and decreased protease secretion, all phenotypes associated with chronic infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, was observed throughout the 10 years of sampling.</p>
<p>Considering its role in chronic infections and the distinctive association with patients and sinks in the Tower Building of Facility A, the origin and emergence of subclone SC2 is of particular importance. Supported by BEAST2 inferences, a plausible scenario would be that a patient with an initial infection acquired during a stay in the Main Building before the SC1-2 split (ca. 2005) proceeded to shed the epidemic strain in the newly opened (2012) Tower Building during successive visits. Importantly, the Main and Tower Buildings of facility A have distinct plumbing systems, providing the necessary ecological separation (minus inter-hospital patient transfers) for the further spread and divergence of the two sub-clones. Patient 27 is just such an example, but the lack of early sampling (2000-2010) and incomplete collection thereafter precludes a definitive answer. Indeed, other scenarios cannot be discounted, with a recent study showing sinks in a newly built ICU were already contaminated with an outbreak clone of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> before the arrival of the first patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>One of the most notable features of this outbreak was the evolution of antibiotic resistance over time, with the emergence of resistance to 1<sup>st</sup> (cephalosporin), 2<sup>nd</sup> (carbapenems) and 3<sup>rd</sup> (colistin) line treatments. The potent R504C substitution in PBP3 was selected in each subclone, and in addition to facilitating cephalosporin resistance, has also been linked to ceftazidime/avibactam resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. While no patient prescription data is available from Facility A, it can be speculated that the high prevalence of cephalosporin resistance in early outbreak isolates led to increased carbapenem use, which in turn selected for the many independently evolved OprD mutants, one of the most common mechanisms for carbapenem resistance in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Finally, albeit a sporadic event, the emergence of colistin resistance, through a well characterized mechanism, is a reminder that the threat of extensively drug resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is only a prescription and a few mutations away<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The data generated during this study has resulted in various ongoing interventions (<italic>e.g.</italic> closing sinks, replacing tubing, using foaming detergents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>) at Facility A. Sampling and sequencing, in near real-time, of all <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> clinical isolates (and not just MDR) also commenced in 2021. Notably, as of this writing, no new ST-621 patient cases have been reported in over 9 months, and the unbiased contemporary data using all <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> from patients at this facility confirms the spread has slowed, with just 3 cases identified in 2022. Similar to Facility A, the roll-out of routine WGS surveillance in the clinic has the potential to improve patient care and prevent some of the estimated 136 million hospital-associated drug-resistant infections per year globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>SNP distances were obtained from the alignment by using snp-dist (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/treemann/snp-dists">https://github.com/treemann/snp-dists</ext-link>). To create violin plots, the complete all-vs-all dataset was limited, based on 4 sets of criteria, to pairs of isolates that (1) originated from different patients; (2) originated from different patients, and were collected in the same month; (3) originated from different patients and were collected in the same ward; and (4) originated from different patients, were collected in the same month, and the same ward. Primary isolates were designated as Patient-to-Patient if they were part of a pair from different patients, were collected in the same ward, were separated by â¤ 10 SNPs, and were â¤ 31 days apart. Primary isolates were designated as environmental if they were part of a pair from different patients, were collected in the same ward, were collected &gt; 365 days apart, and were separated by a number of SNPs â¤ 3x the number of years they were separated (rounding down). All other primary isolates were designated as Undetermined.</p>

<title>Bayesian evolutionary phylogenetic analysis</title>
<p>To evaluate the strength of the temporal signal, TempEst v1.5.3 was utilized to visualize the relationship between root-to-tip genetic distances for samples with known collection dates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. To date internal nodes of interest on the phylogeny, bayesian phylogenetic inference was performed using BEAST2 v2.6.5 on a recombination free alignment, removing samples with uncertain collection dates, and accounting for constant sites with beast2_constsites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/andersgs/beast2_constsites">https://github.com/andersgs/beast2_constsites</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. The HKY substitution model was selected based on evaluation of all possible substitution models in bModelTest v1.2.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The random clock model was selected based on support by the marginal likelihood value using the Nested Sampling package v1.1.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. BEAST2 was run under a coalescent constant population model with a Markov chain Monte Carlo length of 1 x 10<sup>8</sup> sampling every 5 x 10<sup>3</sup> steps. Analyses were repeated five times to confirm consistency between the obtained posterior distributions. Parameter estimates were computed using Tracer v1.7.1. Posterior trees were combined with LogCombiner and summarized in TreeAnnotator after a 50% burn-in. The final MCC target tree was visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rambaut/figtree">https://github.com/rambaut/figtree</ext-link>) and annotated using iTOL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://itol.embl.de/">https://itol.embl.de/</ext-link>).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work presents an example of how genomic data can be used to improve understanding of an ongoing, long-term bacterial outbreak in a hospital with an application to multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and will be of interest to researchers concerned with the spread of drug-resistant bacteria in hospital settings. The <bold>convincing</bold> genomic analyses highlight the value of routine surveillance of patients and environmental sampling and show how such data can help in dating the origin of the outbreak and in characterising the epidemic lineages. These findings highlight the importance of understanding environmental factors contributing to the transmission of P. aeruginosa for guiding and tailoring infection control efforts; however, epidemiological information was limited and the sampling methodology was inconsistent, complicating interpretation of inferences about exact transmission routes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This is a manuscript describing outbreaks of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST 621 in a facility in the US using genomic data. The authors identified and analysed 254 P. aeruginosa ST 621 isolates collected from a facility from 2011 to 2020. The authors described the relatedness of the isolates across different locations, specimen types (sources), and sampling years. Two concurrently emerged subclones were identified from the 254 isolates. The authors predicted that the most recent common ancestor for the isolates can be dated back to approximately 1999 after the opening of the main building of the facility in 1996. Then the authors grouped the 254 isolates into two categories: 1) patient-to-patient; or 2) environment-to-patient using SNP thresholds and known epidemiological links. Finally, the authors described the changes in resistance gene profiles, virulence genes, cell wall biogenesis, and signaling pathway genes of the isolates over the sampling years.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The major strength of this study is the utilisation of genomic data to comprehensively describe the characteristics of a long-term Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST 621 outbreak in a facility. This fills the data gap of a clone that could be clinically important but easily missed from microbiology data alone.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The work would further benefit from a more detailed discussion on the limitations due to the lack of data on patient clinical information, ward movement, and swabs collected from healthcare workers to verify the transmission of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST 621, including potential healthcare worker to patient transmission, patient-to-patient transmission, patient-to-environment transmission, and environment-to-patient transmission. For instance, the definition given in the manuscript for patient-to-patient transmission could not rule out the possibility of the existence of a shared contaminated environment. Equally, as patients were not routinely swabbed, unobserved carriers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST 621 could not be identified and the possibility of misclassifying the environment-to-patient transmissions could not be ruled out. Moreover, reporting of changes in rates of resistance to imipenem and cefepime could be improved by showing the exact p-values (perhaps with three decimal places) rather than dichotomising the value at 0.05. By doing so, readers could interpret the strength of the evidence of changes.</p>
<p>Impact of the work:</p>
<p>
First, the work adds to the growing evidence implicating sinks as long-term reservoirs for important MDR pathogens, with direct infection control implications. Moreover, the work could potentially motivate investments in generating and integrating genomic data into routine surveillance. The comprehensive descriptions of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST 621 clones outbreak is a great example to demonstrate how genomic data can provide additional information about long-term outbreaks that otherwise could not be detected using microbiology data alone. Moreover, identifying the changes in resistance genes and virulence genes over time would not be possible without genomic data. Finally, this work provided additional evidence for the existence of long-term persistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST 621 clones, which likely occur in other similar settings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors present a report of a large Pseudomonas aeruginosa hospital outbreak affecting more than 80 patients with first sampling dates in 2011 that stretched over more than 10 years and was only identified through genomic surveillance in 2020. The outbreak strain was assigned to the sequence type 621, an ST that has been associated with carpabapenem resistance across the globe. Ongoing transmission coincided with both increasing resistance without acquisition of carbapenemase genes as well as the convergence of mutations towards a host-adapted lifestyle.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The convincing genomic analyses indicate spread throughout the hospital since the beginning of the century and provide important benchmark findings for future comparison.</p>
<p>The sampling was based on all organisms sent to the Multidrug-resistant Organism Repository and Surveillance Network across the U.S. Military Health System.</p>
<p>Using sequencing data from patient and environmental samples for phylogenetic and transmission analyses as well as determining recurring mutations in outbreak isolates allows for insights into the evolution of potentially harmful pathogens with the ultimate aim of reducing their spread in hospitals.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The epidemiological information was limited and the sampling methodology was inconsistent, thus complicating the inference of exact transmission routes. Epidemiological data relevant to this analysis include information on the reason for sampling, patient admission and discharge data, and underlying frequency of sampling and sampling results in relation to patient turnover.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This paper by Stribling and colleagues sheds light on a decade-long P. aeruginosa outbreak of the high-risk lineage ST-621 in a US Military hospital. The origins of the outbreak date back to the late 90s and it was mainly caused by two distinct subclones SC1 and SC2. The data of this outbreak showed the emergence of antibiotic resistance to cephalosporin, carbapenems, and colistin over time highlighting the emerging risk of extensively resistant infections due to P. aeruginosa and the need for ongoing surveillance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study overall is well constructed and clearly written. Since detailed information on floor plans of the building and transfers between facilities was available, the authors were able to show that these two subclones emerged in two separate buildings of the hospital. The authors support their conclusions with prospective environmental sampling in 2021 and 2022 and link the role of persistent environmental contamination to sustaining nosocomial transmission. Information on resistance genes in repeat isolates for the same patients allowed the authors to detect the emergence of resistance within patients. The conclusions have broader implications for infection control at other facilities. In particular, the paper highlights the value of real-time surveillance and environmental sampling in slowing nosocomial transmission of P. aeruginosa.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
My major concern is that the authors used fixed thresholds and definitions to classify the origin of an infection. As such, they were not able to give uncertainty measures around transmission routes nor quantify the relative contribution of persistent environmental contamination vs patient-to-patient transmission. The latter would allow the authors to quantify the impact of certain interventions. In addition, these results represent a specific US military facility and the transmission patterns might be specific to that facility. The study also lacked any data on antibiotic use that could have been used to relate to and discuss the temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance.</p>
