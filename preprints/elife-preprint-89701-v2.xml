<title>Abstract</title><p>Changes in chondrocyte gene expression can contribute to the development of osteoarthritis (OA), and so recognition of the regulative processes during chondrogenesis can lead to a better understanding of OA. microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression in chondrocytes/OA and we have used a combined experimental, bioinformatic, and systems biology approach to explore the multiple miRNA-mRNA interactions that regulate chondrogenesis. A longitudinal chondrogenesis bioinformatic analysis identified paralogues miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p as pro-chondrogenic regulators. Experimental work demonstrated alteration of miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p expression led to significant inverse modulation of key chondrogenic genes and extracellular matrix production. miR-199a/b-5p targets <italic>FZD6, ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic> were identified by inhibition experiments and verified as direct targets by luciferase assay. The experimental work was used to generate and parameterize a multi-miRNA 14-day chondrogenesis kinetic model to be used as a repository for the experimental work and as a resource for further investigation of this system. This is the first multi-miRNA model of a chondrogenesis-based system, and highlights the complex relationships between regulatory miRNAs, and their target mRNAs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chondrocytes occurs by the process of chondrogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. This is an important process during development, as it is a pre-requisite for skeletogenesis. Chondrocytes perform the vital role of generating cartilage during embryogenesis, but also maintain cartilage throughout life, including at the ends of long bones in articulating joints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The master transcription factor responsible for chondrogenesis is SOX9 and during this process chondrocytes secrete anabolic proteins such as type II collagen and aggrecan, encoded by <italic>COL2A1</italic> and <italic>ACAN</italic>, which constitute a significant functional portion of the cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. With increasing age and influenced by a mixture of factors such as (epi)genetics, obesity and mechanical injury/stress, chondrocytes will increasingly express catabolic proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases which degrade the cartilage ECM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Ultimately the chronic loss of cartilage contributes to the extremely debilitating condition osteoarthritis (OA), which remains incurable with treatment options limited to pain relief medication and end-stage joint replacement surgery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs - roughly 19-22nt long, that negatively regulate target mRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Mammalian miRNA-mRNA interactions occur via complementary sequence specificity between a 7-8nt stretch of the miRNA known as the seed sequence, and positions along the 3’UTR of the target mRNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. miRNA-mRNA interactions are complex because a single mRNA can be targeted by many miRNAs, and a single miRNA can target many mRNAs. Our previous work identified significantly altered miRNAs during chondrogenesis and demonstrated the role of miR-140 in regulating chondrocyte gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. miR-140 has emerged as a vital regulator of chondrogenesis, cartilage and OA, and have been hypothesised as effective drug targets due to their pro-chondrogenic regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Additional miRNAs, such as miR-455, have also been shown to be important regulators in maintaining healthy cartilage and protecting against OA development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To identify further important miRNAs from this dataset, and to overcome the complexity of miRNA-mRNA interactions, we performed a combined bioinformatic, experimental and systems biology approach to better understand the relationship between miRNAs which may be important to chondrogenesis, and their predicted targets. We identified miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p as pro-chondrogenic miRNAs. Just as with miR-140-5p and miR-455, we anticipated miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p (miR-199a/b-5p) to target multiple mRNAs during chondrogenesis. To this end we used experimental, informatic and literary data to build kinetic models to explain how miR-199a/b-5p regulated chondrogenesis. The models included three targets identified through RNAseq analysis (<italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic>), and were used to make predictions to fill experimental gaps and predict novel interactions between miR-199a/b-5p and the chondrogenesis machinery..</p>

<title>Analysis with <italic>TimiRGeN</italic> identified miR-199b-5p to be upregulated during chondrogenesis</title>
<p>Our previously generated 14-day chondrogenesis time series dataset was analysed with the <italic>TimiRGeN R/ Bioconductor</italic> package - a novel tool we developed to analyse longitudinal miRNA-mRNA expression datasets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Prior to using <italic>TimiRGeN</italic>, the transcriptomic data underwent timepoint based differential expression analysis, using the day 0 time-point (MSCs) as the control group for chondrogenesis samples measured at days: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, and thus created differential expression data over five time-points. <italic>TimiRGeN</italic> identified signalling pathways of interest over the 14-day time series data (Supplementary Table 1). Eight signalling pathways were found enriched in at least three of the five time points (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The <italic>TimiRGeN</italic> pipeline was then used to predict miRNA-mRNA interactions that may regulate each of the eight pathways. miRNA-mRNA interactions were kept if the miRNA and mRNA involved in the interaction has a Pearson correlation &lt;-0.75 across the time-series and if the interaction was predicted in at least two of the following three databases: TargetScan, miRDB or miRTarBase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. To identify which miRNAs involved in the miRNA-mRNA interactions were positively changing in each of the eight signalling pathways we scaled the Log2FC values from <italic>limma</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. By using scaled Log2FC values, we could highlight magnitude of change, rather than total change.</p>

<p>miR-140-5p was the most positively changing miRNA in the following seven pathways: Adipogenesis, Clear cell renal cell carcinoma pathways (CCRCCP), Epidermal growth factor/Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF/EGFR), Endochondral ossification, Endochondral ossification with Skeletal Dysplasia (EOSD), Gastrin signalling pathway and Vascular endothelial growth factor-A/Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 signalling pathway (VEGFA-VEGFR2). miR-199b-5p was the second most positively changing microRNA in the following six pathways: CCRCCP, EGF/EGFR, Endochondral ossification, EOSD, Gastrin signalling pathway and VEGFA-VEGFR2. Other miRNA/genes such as hsa-miR-455-5p and <italic>BMP2</italic> were also of interest, but we focused on hsa-miR-199b-5p and its paralogue miR-199a-5p since these are comparatively under-researched miRNAs within the context of chondrogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>

<title><italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic> are the most significantly upregulated miR-199a/b-5p targets during MSC chondrogenesis</title>
<p>Multiple mRNA targets of miR-199a/b-5p are likely regulated during chondrogenesis. To elucidate which genes are most affected by miR-199 inhibition we performed an RNAseq experiment to identify candidate targets during the early phase of MSC chondrogenesis comparing MSC samples which were undifferentiated (day 0) and MSC samples which were in the early stages of chondrogenesis (day 1). Chondrogenic markers were downregulated by miR-199 inhibition in the early stages of chondrogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), so we reasoned that identifying mRNAs which are positively enriched during the first few days of chondrogenesis may identify the most important mRNA targets of miR-199a/b-5p. We chose to inhibit miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p since supraphysiological overexpression of miRNA mimics can lead to spurious findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Initial comparison between day 1 differentiated and day 0 undifferentiated control samples identified 4391 upregulated and 4168 downregulated significantly differentially expressed genes (DEG) (&lt; 0.05 adjusted p value). Positively changing genes included <italic>COL2A1</italic> (log2fc =11.6), <italic>ACAN</italic> (log2fc = 9.18) and <italic>SOX9</italic> (log2fc = 3.37). Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis on the upregulated genes confirmed that the cells were differentiating towards chondrocytes with terms such as skeletal system development, extracellular matrix organization and regulation of cartilage development significantly (adjusted P values &lt; 0.05) enriched. To identify miR-199-regulated genes, undifferentiated control MSC samples were contrasted against undifferentiated MSCs with either miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p inhibition, which respectively resulted in 87 and 46 significantly DEGs (adjusted P values &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Similar comparisons at day 1 of chondrogenesis revealed inhibition of miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p respectively resulted in 674 and 817 DEGs. 25 and 341 genes intersected between day 0 and day 1 chondrogenesis inhibition experiments, indicating that both microRNAs may share functional repertoire of targets (Chi-squared observed vs expected day 0 = 0.003477, day 1 = 0.000624). <italic>COL2A1</italic>, <italic>ACAN</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic> were significantly lower in expression in day 1 samples after miR-199 inhibition, validating the negative impact on chondrogenesis. GO term analysis was conducted to identify biological processes linked to miR-199a/b-5p inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly several terms associated with chondrogenesis were suppressed/less activated during day 1 analyses, including: extracellular matrix constituents, skeletal system morphogenesis, extracellular matrix and collagen containing extracellular matrix.</p>

<p>The significantly differentially expressed genes were also analysed using the miRNAtap R package to predict miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p targets (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). 21 potential mRNA targets were predicted to be targeted by both miRNAs, and in alphabetical order they were: ABHD17C, ATP13A2, CAV1, CTSL, DDR1, FZD6, GIT1, HIF1A, HK2, HSPA5, ITGA3, M6PR, MYH9, NECTIN2, NINL, PDE4D, PLXND1, PXN, SLC35A3, SLC35D1, VPS26A. FZD6, ITGA3 and CAV1, MYH9, NECTIN2.The expression patterns of these 21 miR-199 target genes were also explored in our microarray study (Supplementary Table 3) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. SkeletalVis was used to contrast the behavior of the 21 genes in other MSC derived chondrogenesis studies (Supplementary Table 4) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.

We decided to further explore if <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic> were true targets of miR-199a/b-5p because in terms of adjusted p values, these three showed the most significant change (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>)</p>

<title>miR-199a/b-5p targets were upregulated by miR-199a/b-5p inhibition</title>
<p>To confirm the effects miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p had on the targets identified through RNAseq, we performed a series of inhibition experiments. Since the miRNAs shared the same seed site sequence (nucleotides 2-8; 5’-CCAGUGUU-3’), we tested if inhibition of one miRNA would lead to similar or different effects to inhibition of both miRNAs. For this, we picked to supress expression of miR-199a-5p as it was the more highly expressed of the two paralogues and contrasted it to inhibition of miR-199a/b-5p. We tested the effects of the inhibition by measuring the expression of the three most significantly enriched predicted miR-199a/b-5p targets from our bioinformatic analysis – <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A1</xref>). We saw significant upregulation of <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic> after miR-199a-5p inhibition and miR-199a/b-5p inhibition. There was no consistent improvement of the combination of miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p over miR-199a-5p alone. We also tested the third most significant predicted target of miR-199a/b-5p - CAV1, and how its’ expression changed after miR-199b-5p inhibition over the same time course, and we saw CAV1 levels were significantly increased post miR-199b-5p inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A2</xref>).</p>

<p>Unlike <italic>FZD6</italic> and <italic>ITGA3</italic>, <italic>CAV1</italic> has previously been established to be a direct target of miR-199a-5p <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.

Introduction of an excess of miR-199a-5p into the cells further repressed expression suggesting both FZD6 and ITGA3 3’UTRs are direct miR199a-5p targets. This was confirmed by mutation of the predicted miR-199-5p seed sequence within the 3’-UTR of each gene which reduced the extent of inhibition of luciferase levels caused by the miRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B2</xref>).</p>

<title>Kinetic modelling creates an <italic>in silico</italic> demonstration of how miR-199a-5p/miR-199b-5p regulates chondrogenesis</title>
<p>We attempted to capture the complexity of how miR-199a/b-5p regulated chondrogensis using an <italic>in silico</italic> model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Only using the experimental data presented in this manuscript, and our previous microarray work, we developed a model to demonstrate the relationships between chondrogenic biomarkers and the targets of <italic>miR-199a/b-5p</italic> we identified through RNAseq and subsequent inhibition experiments. Finally, we used events to simulate inhibition of miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The experiments shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figures 2A, 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref> were used to parameterise the model, and since the experiments were performed in a staggered manner, we can use the model to make predictions to fill experimental gaps.

Most objects within the model were based on experimental data, and the differences between the experimental data and simulated data are calculated by Mean Squared Error (MSE).

<p>To enhance our initial model, we added further detail to increase biological relevance. This included the addition of Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFB) as a trigger for chondrogenesis initiation – just as we had during our chondrogenesis MSC experiments. We found strong mechanistic links between TGFB signalling and <italic>CAV1</italic> expression via SRC kinase. Based on our previous work we also included miR-140-5p as it has been proven as a vital regulator of chondrogenesis, and with our kinetic model we predicted how miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p inhibition indirectly affected miR-140-5p. Further to this, we identified several flaws in our initial model, which we attempted to rectify using the enhanced chondrogenesis model. Firstly, by simulating the miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p inhibition to last until day 7, we saw that <italic>SOX9</italic> mRNA, <italic>COL2A1</italic> mRNA and <italic>ACAN</italic> mRNA dynamics between days 1 and 7 of miR-199b-5p inhibition were flat. Furthermore, our CAV1 dynamics were also flat during miR-199b-5p inhibition. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> shows, from miR-199b-5p inhibition, the chondrogenesis biomarkers had a sharp decrease followed by a steady rise until day 7, and to match the effect of the miR-199b-5p inhibition experiments, we simulated the inhibition to last until day 4.5 instead of day 7. Doing so increased the similarities between our experimental data and simulations. Secondly, we wanted to include other miR-199a/b-5p targets which were alluded to in our RNAseq experiment, but not further explored, such as <italic>MYH9</italic> and <italic>PDE4D</italic>. We added a blackbox named ‘OtherTargets’ to represent other targets which miR-199a/b-5p regulate during chondrogenesis. Also, to delay the decrease in <italic>ACAN</italic>, <italic>COL2A1</italic> and GAG levels after miR-199a/b-5p inhibition, we slowed down the interactions between the miR-199a/b-5p targets and <italic>SOX9</italic> by including SOX9 protein and SOX9 phospho-protein as objects in the model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). In the enhanced model, 14/18 (77.7%) of the objects with experimental data had an MSE of over three, indicating the model – even with additional data from the literature, still captured much of the experimental data. Also, the average MSE was 12.08, indicating an improvement over the initial model.</p>
<p>From the enhanced model we saw improved dynamics for several model objects e.g., GAG, <italic>CAV1</italic>, <italic>SOX9</italic>, <italic>ACAN</italic>, <italic>COL2A1</italic>. Our MSE values which were used to quantify how similar our models’ simulations were in contrast to our experimental data. Generally, our MSE values were better in our enhanced model for the chondrogenesis biomarkers and GAG levels, though our MSE values were better in our initial model for the miR-199a/b-5p targets. Overall, we saw the dynamics improved in the enhanced model, and in addition, we could make predictions on how miR-140-5p levels would indirectly be influenced from knock-down of miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p and such a multi-miRNA model has not yet been created before. Further pathways such as the Wnt signalling pathway may also play an important role in this system but could not be explored via modelling with our current level of data. We developed a hypothesis rich GRN to display further pathways which were not in the scope of this project (Supplementary Figure 3).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our initial work in this area used a combined experimental and bioinformatics approach to identify and study the roles of miR-140 and miR-455 which were highly important to chondrogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This current work extends this, to identify other miRNAs of regulatory importance during chondrogenesis utilising a recently developed tool (<italic>TimiRGeN</italic> R/Bioconductor package)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Here, we combined experimental, bioinformatic and systems biology approaches to identify and study the role of miR-199a/b-5p during chondrogenesis. The <italic>MIR199</italic> family were identified as pro-chondrogenic in mouse mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells, reportedly by targeting <italic>SMAD1</italic> (miR-199a-3p) and <italic>JAG1 (</italic>miR-199a/b-5p), respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Having previously shown the substantial upregulation of miR-199a/b-5p during chondrogenesis, we now show through both loss- and gain of function experiments that <italic>miR-199a/b-5p</italic> also promotes <italic>SOX9, COL2A1</italic> and <italic>ACAN</italic> expression in human MSC chondrogenesis thus enhancing cartilage formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. RNAseq analysis identified key targets of <italic>miR-199a</italic>/<italic>b-5p</italic> including <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic>, which were experimentally validated and subsequently incorporated into an <italic>in silico</italic> kinetic model.</p>
<p>miR-199a and miR-199b are vertebrate-specific miRNAs which exhibit an expression pattern associated with mesenchymal tissues and the skeleton <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Antisense transcript <italic>Dmn3os</italic> encodes miR199a and miR214 and its deletion in mice causes skeletal defects including short stature and cranial deformity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Similar phenotypic consequences caused by the loss of <italic>DNM3OS</italic> and therefore <italic>MIR199A</italic> and <italic>MIR214</italic> have also been reported in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. <italic>miR-214</italic> has since been reported to negatively impact on chondrocyte differentiation, through targeting <italic>ATF4</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Thus, our demonstration of the pro-chondrogenic nature of miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p in human MSCs, in addition to the previous demonstration in mouse C3H10T1/2 cells, further supports the role of these miRNAs in chondrogenesis and formation of the skeleton.</p>
<p>We show for the first-time functional evidence for the miR-199b-5p<italic>-CAV1</italic> interaction to occur in human MSCs. Several mechanisms reported in the literature may also support how miR-199a/b-5p<italic>-CAV1</italic> could regulate chondrogenesis, such as TGFB triggering phosphorylation of CAV1 via SRC-kinase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In contrast to <italic>CAV1</italic>, <italic>FZD6</italic> and <italic>ITGA3</italic> have been less well studied as miR-199a/b-5p targets though, miR-199a-5p<italic>-FZD6</italic> has been predicted previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Our luciferase assays validate for the first time that <italic>FZD6</italic> is a target of miR-199a-5p. Previous work by our group has validated <italic>FZD6</italic> as a target of miR-140-5p, so it is likely a highly important gene in chondrogenesis. <italic>ITGA3</italic> meanwhile has been found to be a target of miR-199a-5p in neck and head cancer cells, and our results confirm this interaction in humans MSCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The presented model topology (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, 5C) was based on our experimental work. Our initial model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) was re-worked to better match the experimental patterns seen and to include additional genes which we can make prediction from. The enhanced chondrogenesis model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) was initiated with TGFB3, which was used to initiate chondrogenesis in our experiments and was therefore used as the proxy for chondrogenic initiation. As such, TGFB3 promoted miR-199a/b-5p levels to match our microarray data, though based on our previous data TGFB may not directly regulate miR-199a/b-5p levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. TGFB3 also induced CAV1 via SRC kinase and induced <italic>SOX9</italic> via the SMAD2-SMAD3 pathway, which then stimulated SOX9 protein production (SMAD2/3 were not included in the models) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. However, our microarray data showed <italic>CAV1</italic> gene expression decreased during early chondrogenesis, but then increased again – perhaps indicating CAV1 has a smaller negative regulative effect on chondrogenesis, or only effects early chondrogenesis. Gene expression of <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3, CAV1</italic> and the OtherTargets blackbox all had inverse relationships with miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p, and <italic>FZD6</italic> was also negatively regulated by miR-140-5p. <italic>SOX9</italic> mRNA, SOX9 and P-SOX9 were all treated as separate objects in this model. P-SOX9 promoted <italic>COL2A1</italic>, <italic>ACAN</italic> and miR-140-5p expression<italic>. ACAN</italic> contributed directly, and to the greatest extent, to GAG levels (since most cartilage GAGs are post-translationally added to Aggrecan, the protein product of <italic>ACAN</italic>) which was used as the phenotypic level output for the model and a proxy for chondrogenesis progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Precise mechanisms of how FZD6 and ITGA3 regulated chondrogenesis are unclear, with potentially implicated pathways included in the larger GRN (Supplementary Figure 1). FZD6 is a transmembrane protein which functions as a receptor for WNT signalling proteins to, most commonly, activate the non-canonical planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. However, elements of the Wnt signalling pathway have been implicated to act antagonistically to chondrogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. ITGA3 is a cell surface integrin which forms a heterodimer with ITGB1 to form α3β1 heterodimers through which chondrocyte-fibronectin ECM connections can be created <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Conditional deletion of <italic>Itgb1</italic> in cartilage impacts profoundly on skeletogenesis in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. α3 integrins have been found to increase in OA cartilage, though a direct mechanism between ITGA3 regulating SOX9 is not clear. Regulation of SOX9 via CAV1 has been more studied, which has shown that the relationship between SOX9 and CAV1 is complex and requires further testing. CAV1 may be affecting SOX9 levels, via its activation of RHOA/ROCK1 signalling, which leads to phosphorylation of SOX9. RHOA/ROCK1 inhibition has been shown to both increase levels of SOX9 and chondrogenesis biomarkers in mouse ATDC5 cells, but also decrease levels of <italic>SOX9</italic> and chondrogenesis biomarkers in 3D-chondrocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. It is likely that other mRNA targets of miR-199a/b-5p also contributed toward chondrogenesis regulation, such as the other genes identified as miR-199a/b-5p targets from the RNAseq analysis e.g. <italic>MYH9, NECTIN2</italic>. Based on this limitation, a “blackbox” called OtherTargets was added to the kinetic model to represent all other anti-chondrogenic miR-199a/b-5p targets during chondrogenesis which were not explored in this study. A major limitation of the kinetic models is that we were not able to provide any multi-omic data – as no protein level, or phosphor-protein data were available. We generated a broader GRN (Supplementary Figure 3), which showcases how the models we created could be enhanced with such data.</p>
<p>While the <italic>in silico</italic> model can serve as a resource for researchers interested in this system, there were certain genes such as <italic>CAV1</italic> and <italic>FZD6</italic> which proved difficult to model. At the time of building the models we assumed, miR-199a-5p inhibition would lead to a greater effect than miR-199b-5p inhibition, due to miR-199a-5p being more abundant. However, we clearly see now this was a misconception and miR-199b-5p inhibition leads to a greater decrease in GAG levels and a greater increase in <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic> levels. This could be because miR-199b-5p increases by a greater magnitude than miR-199a-5p (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), therefore the inhibition of miR-199b-5p has a bigger effect on chondrogenesis. Such timeseries analysis would have been unavailable by only using differential expression analysis, and the use of the <italic>TimiRGeN</italic> R package was highly useful in finding this microRNA during our re-analysis.</p>
<p>Our results validate miR-199a/b-5p interacting with <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic> and for miR-199a/b-5p to provide vital pro-chondrogenic regulatory effects, as observed previously for miR-140 and miR-455. Deletion of miR-140 in both humans and mice affects skeletal development (PMID: 30804514, PMID: 20466812). Further, from in vivo mouse models miR-140 and miR-455 were additionally shown to be pivotal in protecting from OA. Recently, intra-articular injection of a miR-199a-5p mimic has been shown to reduce cartilage damage in a rat post-traumatic OA model (PMID: 36835852). Mouse genetic studies examining the loss of both -199a/b-5p, specifically in cartilage, are required to better understand the function of these miRNAs in skeletogenesis and chondrocyte development.. Our results demonstrate early interest and provide a detailed kinetic model to aid researchers interested in this important topic.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our combined bioinformatic, laboratory, and systems biology approach was a multi-faceted approach to explore miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p as pro-chondrogenic regulators. Based on our bioinformatic analysis, the three most significantly positively changing miR-199a/b-5p were predicted targets <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV</italic>. Laboratory experiments validated these as direct miR-199a/b-5p targets and confirmed that miR-199a/b-5p positively regulate chondrogenesis. However, the complex nature of miRNA function means there are likely multiple mRNA targets of miR-199a/b-5p which may work synergistically to modulate chondrogenesis. The GRN and kinetic models were created to capture the behaviours of the system which act as a useful resource for further experimental design.</p>

<title>GRN development</title>
<p>The initial system schematic was made in BioRender (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). For the enhanced model, we used <italic>CellDesigner</italic>, SMBL style GRNs are created to represent the biological processed of interest <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. A literature search provided information of GRN topology. Once the whole GRN was created (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), a more advanced GRN was created to hypothesise further pathways and important players in the system which could not be modelled as we lacked the experimental data to do so (Supplementary Figure 3).</p>

<title>Kinetic modelling</title>
<p>Base data (microarray experiments), and the validation data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, 4) from qPCR data was converted to numbers compatible to the calibration data from the microarrays using the following formula <italic>KD</italic>/<italic>C</italic> ∗ <italic>M, KD</italic> being the mean miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p value, <italic>C</italic> being the mean control value and M being the mean microarray value. The initial conditions (zero time point) for the calibration and validation datasets were assumed to be the same so the model can have a single initial condition for each validated species. Thus, <italic>KD/C =1</italic> was fixed for each zero-time point, for each species where validation data was available. For GAG levels, the control level at day 7 was treated as 100%, and the change in GAG expression during miR-199b-5p inhibition was measured in contrast to the control to calculate the percentage change.</p>
<p>Species selected from the modelled GRN were modelled using <italic>COPASI</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Calibration was performed using parameter estimation via the Particle swarm algorithm. Inhibition of miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p were simulated using events, where the miRNA in question was reduced by 90-95%, until day 7 in the initial model and day 4.5 in the enhanced model. Parameters were altered using sliders to make the model perform miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p inhibition behaviour. Mean squared error (MSE) was calculated between actual and simulated data where possible, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="535081v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.

<p>This study provides <bold>valuable</bold> insight into the role of miR-199a/b-5p in cartilage formation. The evidence supporting the significance of the identified miRNA and its target mRNA transcripts is <bold>convincing</bold>. This paper will likely primarily benefit scientists focused on diseases related to this biological process, such as osteoarthritis. Furthermore, researchers interested in miRNAs as a broader subject may find the computational model development methodology helpful.</p>

<p>The comments below are from my review of the first submission of this article. I would now like to thank the authors for their hard work in responding to my comments. I am happy with the changes they have made, in particular the inclusion of further experimental evidence in Figures 2 and 4. I have no further comments to make.</p>
<p>In 'Systems analysis of miR-199a/b-5p and multiple miR-199a/b-5p targets during chondrogenesis', Patel et al. present a variety of analyses using different methodologies to investigate the importance of two miRNAs in regulating gene expression in a cellular model of cartilage development. They first re-analysed existing data to identify these miRNAs as one of the most dynamic across a chondrogenesis development timecourse. Next, they manipulated the expression of these miRNAs and showed that this affected the expression of various marker genes as expected. An RNA-seq experiment on these manipulations identified putative mRNA targets of the miRNAs which were also supported by bioinformatics predictions. These top hits were validated experimentally and, finally, a kinetic model was developed to demonstrate the relationship between the miRNAs and mRNAs studied throughout the paper.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the novel relationships reported here between miR-199a/b-5p and target genes FZD6, ITGA3 and CAV1 are likely to be genuine. It is important for researchers working on this system and related diseases to know all the miRNA/mRNA relationships but, as the authors have already published work studying the most dynamic miRNA (miR-140-5p) in this biological system I was not convinced that this study of the second miRNA in their list provided a conceptual advance on their previous work.</p>
<p>I was also concerned with the lack of reporting of details of the manipulation experiments. The authors state that they have over-expressed miR-199a-5p (Figure 2A) and knocked down miR-199b-5p (Figure 2B) but they should have reported their proof that these experiments had worked as predicted, e.g. showing the qRT-PCR change in miRNA expression. Similarly, I was concerned that one miRNA was over-expressed while the other was knocked down - why did the authors not attempt to manipulate both miRNAs in both directions? Were they unable to achieve a significant change in miRNA expression or did these experiments not confirm the results reported in the manuscript?</p>
<p>I had a number of issues with the way in which some of the data is presented. Table 1 only reported whether a specific pathway was significant or not for a given differential expression analysis but this concealed the extent of this enrichment or the level of statistical significance reported. Could it be redrawn to more similarly match the format of Figure 3A? The various shades of grey in Figure 2 and Figure 4 made it impossible to discriminate between treatments and therefore identify whether these data supported the conclusions made in the text. It also appeared that the same results were reported in Figure 3B and 3C and, indeed, Figure 3B was not referred to in the main text. Perhaps this figure could be made more concise by removing one of these two sets of panels?</p>
<p>Overall, while I think that this is an interesting and valuable paper, I think its findings are relatively limited to those interested in the role of miRNAs in this specific biomedical context.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In 'Systems analysis of miR-199a/b-5p and multiple miR-199a/b-5p targets during chondrogenesis', Patel et al. present a variety of analyses using different methodologies to investigate the importance of two miRNAs in regulating gene expression in a cellular model of cartilage development. They first re-analysed existing data to identify these miRNAs as one of the most dynamic across a chondrogenesis development time course. Next, they manipulated the expression of these miRNAs and showed that this affected the expression of various marker genes as expected. An RNA-seq experiment on these manipulations identified putative mRNA targets of the miRNAs which were also supported by bioinformatics predictions. These top hits were validated experimentally and, finally, a kinetic model was developed to demonstrate the relationship between the miRNAs and mRNAs studied throughout the paper.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the novel relationships reported here between miR-199a/b-5p and target genes FZD6, ITGA3, and CAV1 are likely to be genuine. It is important for researchers working on this system and related diseases to know all the miRNA/mRNA relationships but, as the authors have already published work studying the most dynamic miRNA (miR-140-5p) in this biological system I was not convinced that this study of the second miRNA in their list provided a conceptual advance on their previous work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe this study is an enhancement on our previous work for two reasons, which have been alluded to in new text within the introduction. Firstly, our previous work used experimental and bioinformatic analysis to identify microRNAs with significant regulatory roles during chondrogenesis. This new manuscript additionally uses  a systems biology approaches to identify novel miRNA-mRNA interactions and capture these within an in silico model. Secondly, this work was initiated by the analysis of our previously generated data – using a novel tool we developed for this type of data <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TimiRGeN.html">(Bioconductor - TimiRGeN)</ext-link>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I was also concerned with the lack of reporting of details of the manipulation experiments. The authors state that they have over-expressed miR-199a-5p (Figure 2A) and knocked down miR-199b-5p (Figure 2B) but they should have reported their proof that these experiments had worked as predicted, e.g. showing the qRT-PCR change in miRNA expression. Similarly, I was concerned that one miRNA was over-expressed while the other was knocked down - why did the authors not attempt to manipulate both miRNAs in both directions? Were they unable to achieve a significant change in miRNA expression or did these experiments not confirm the results reported in the manuscript?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that some additional data were needed to demonstrate the effective regulation of miR-199-5p.  Hence, Supplementary Figure 1 is now included which provides validation of the effects of miR-199a-5p overexpression (Supplementary Figure 1A) and inhibition of miR-199a/b-5p (Supplementary Figure 1B). Within the main manuscript, Figure 2B has been amended to include the consequences of inhibition of miR-199a-5p, with 2C showing the consequences of miR-199b-5p inhibition. Further, we include new data with regards to miR-199a/b-5p inhibition on CAV1 (Figure 4A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I had a number of issues with the way in which some of the data was presented. Table 1 only reported whether a specific pathway was significant or not for a given differential expression analysis but this concealed the extent of this enrichment or the level of statistical significance reported. Could it be redrawn to more similarly match the format of Figure 3A? The various shades of grey in Figure 2 and Figure 4 made it impossible to discriminate between treatments and therefore identify whether these data supported the conclusions made in the text. It also appeared that the same results were reported in Figure 3B and 3C and, indeed, Figure 3B was not referred to in the main text. Perhaps this figure could be made more concise by removing one of these two sets of panels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with all points made here and have amended these within the manuscript. Figure 1A is now pathway enrichment plots from the TimiRGeN R Bioconductor package, and the table which previously showed the pathways enriched at each time point is now in the supplementary materials (supp. Table 1). Figure 2 and 4 now have color instead of shades of grey. Figure 3C has now been moved to supplementary materials (Supplementary Figure 2) and is referenced in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, while I think that this is an interesting and valuable paper, I think its findings are relatively limited to those interested in the role of miRNAs in this specific biomedical context.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study represents an ambitious endeavor to comprehensively analyze the role of miR199a/b-5p and its networks in cartilage formation. By conducting experiments that go beyond in vitro MSC differentiation models, more robust conclusions can be achieved.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This research investigates the role of miR-199a/b-5p during chondrogenesis using bioinformatics and in vitro experimental systems. The significance of miRNAs in chondrogenesis and OA is crucial, warranting further research, and this study contributes novel insights.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While miR-140 and miR-455 are used as controls, these miRNAs have been demonstrated to be more relevant to Cartilage Homeostasis than chondrogenesis itself. Their deficiency has been genetically proven to induce Osteoarthritis in mice. Therefore, the results of this study should be considered in comparison with these existing findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewers comments. miR-455-null mice develop normally but miR-140-null (or mutated) mice and humans do have skeletal abnormalities (e.g. Nat Med. 2019 Apr;25(4):583-590. doi: 10.1038/s41591-019-0353-2), indicating a role in chondrogenesis.  We have made an addition in the description to point towards the need to assess the roles miR-199a/b-5p may play during skeletogenesis and OA. We anticipate miR-199a/b-5p to be relevant in OA and have ongoing additional work for this – but this beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations to Authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations to authors):</bold></p>
<p>Beyond the issues raised in the public review, I had a few minor recommendations that are largely designed to help improve the understanding of the manuscript as it is currently written.</p>
<p>(1) Please provide the statistical tests used to obtain p-values in the Figure 2 and 4 legends.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added statistical test information to the figure legends of figures 2 and 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It is stated on p. 9 that both miRNAs may share a functional repertoire because 25 and 341 genes are interested between their inhibition experiments. Please provide statistical support that this overlap is an enrichment over the null background in this experiment. Total DE genes – chi squared. Expected / Observed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A chi-squared test is now presented in the manuscript which shows that the number of significant genes which were found in common between miR-199a-5p knockdown and miR-199b-5p knockdown were significantly more than expected for day 0 or day 1 of the experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The final sentence on p. 12 (beginning 'Size of the points reflect...') seemed out of place - is it part of a legend?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this mistake - it was part of figure 3C and now is in the supplementary materials.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) A sentence on p. 14 reads that 'FZD6 and ITGA3 levels increased significantly' but this should read decreased, rather than increased. Quite an important typo!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this error out. It has been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Theoretical transcripts are mentioned in the legend of Figure 5A but these were not present in the figure. Please include these or remove them from the legend.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This error has been removed form Figure 5A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) On p 20, the references 22 and 27 should I think be moved to earlier in the sentence (after 'miR-199a-5p-FZD6 has been predicted previously'). Currently, it reads as if these references support your luciferase assays which you claim are the first evidence for this target relationship.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this change and have corrected the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The reference to Figure 5D on p. 20 should be a reference to Figure 5C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this error out – this has been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations to authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The paper is based on the importance of miR-140 and miR-455 as miRNAs in chondrogenesis, citing only Barter, M. J. et al. Stem Cells 33, (2015). Considering the scope and results of this study, this citation is insufficient.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this reviewers comments. For many year miR-140 and miR-455 have been experimented on and their importance in OA research has become apparent. We included additional references within the introduction to address this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Analyzing chondrogenesis solely through differentiation experiments from MSCs is inadequate. It is essential to perform experiments involving the network within normal cartilage tissue and/or the generation of knockout mice to understand the precise role of miR199a/b-5p in chondrogenesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added an additional paragraph in the discussion to state this, and do believe it is highly important that miR-199a/b-5p be tested in OA samples – however this would be beyond the intended scope of this article.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In light of the above points, it is imperative to investigate the role of miR-199a/b-5p beyond the in vitro differentiation model from MSCs, encompassing mouse OA models or human disease samples.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In tangent with the previous address, we agree with the pretense and believe additional experiments should be performed to gain more insight to the mechanism of how miR-199a/b-5p regulate OA. But development of a new mouse line to investigate this is not in the scope of this manuscript.</p>
