<title>Abstract</title><p>S100A8/A9 is an endogenous alarmin secreted by myeloid cells during many acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. Despite increasing evidence of the proinflammatory effects of extracellular S100A8/A9, little is known about its intracellular function. Here, we show that cytosolic S100A8/A9 is indispensable for neutrophil post-arrest modifications during outside-in signaling under flow conditions in vitro and neutrophil recruitment in vivo, independent of its extracellular functions. Mechanistically, genetic deletion of S100A9 in mice (<italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, functional <italic>S100A8/A9<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) caused dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures in activated neutrophils resulting in reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability at the formed LFA-1/F-actin clusters with defective β<sub>2</sub> integrin outside-in signaling during post-arrest modifications. Consequently, we observed impaired cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell polarization and spreading, as well as cell protrusion formation in <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> compared to WT neutrophils, making <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells more susceptible to detach under flow, thereby preventing efficient neutrophil recruitment and extravasation into inflamed tissue.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating leukocyte subpopulation in humans and are rapidly mobilized from the bone marrow to the circulation upon sterile inflammation and/or bacterial/viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The interplay between activated endothelial cells and circulating neutrophils leads to a tightly regulated series of events described as leukocyte recruitment cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Tissue-derived proinflammatory signals provoke expression of selectins on the inflamed endothelium that capture free floating neutrophils from the bloodstream by triggering tethering and rolling through interaction with selectin ligands on the neutrophil surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Selectin mediated rolling allows neutrophils to engage with immobilized chemokines and other proinflammatory mediators such as leucotriene B4 (LTB4), N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF) and various agonists for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) like TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5, all expressed on the endothelial surface and resulting in the activation of β<sub>2</sub> integrins on neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. High affinity β<sub>2</sub> integrin interaction with their corresponding receptors on the endothelium induces downstream outside-in signaling leading to post-arrest modifications such as cell spreading, adhesion strengthening and neutrophil crawling, critical requirements for successful recruitment of neutrophils into inflamed tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Accordingly, impairment in those steps favors neutrophil detachment under shear flow and re-entry of neutrophils into the blood stream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Local regulation of intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) levels is critical to synchronize rolling, arrest and polarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. During rolling, neutrophils show only minor Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, but a rapid increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is registered during transition from slow rolling to firm adhesion and subsequent polarization of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Neutrophil transition from rolling into firm arrest involves conformational changes of the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) into a high affinity status allowing bond formation with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expressed on inflamed endothelium. Tension on focal clusters of LFA-1/ICAM-1 bonds mediated by shear stress promotes the assembly of cytoskeletal adaptor proteins to integrin tails and mediates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release activated (CRAC) channel ORAI-1 recruitment to focal adhesion clusters ensuring high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations at the “inflammatory synapse” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Finally, shear stress mediated local bursts of Ca<sup>2+</sup> promote assembly of the F-actin cytoskeleton allowing pseudopod formation and transendothelial migration (TEM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>S100A8/A9, also known as MRP8/14 or calprotectin, is a member of the EF-hand family of proteins and the most abundant cytosolic protein complex in neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Secretion of S100A8/A9 can occur via passive release of the cytosolic protein due to cellular necrosis or neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Active release of S100A8/A9 without cell death can be induced by the interaction of L-selectin/PSGL-1 with E-selectin during neutrophil rolling on inflamed endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. We have recently shown that E-selectin induced S100A8/A9 release occurs through a NLRP3 inflammasome dependent pathway involving GSDMD pore formation. Pore formation is a time-limited and transient process, which is reversed by the activation of the ESCRT-III machinery membrane repair mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Once released, the protein acts as an alarmin, exerting its proinflammatory effects on different cell types like endothelial cells, lymphocytes and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we focused on the cytosolic function of S100A8/A9 in neutrophils. We demonstrate its unique role in supplying Ca<sup>2+</sup> at LFA-1 adhesion clusters during neutrophil recruitment thereby orchestrating Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent post-arrest modifications, which are critical steps for subsequent transmigration and extravasation of these cells into inflamed tissues.</p>

<title>Cytosolic S100A8/A9 promotes leukocyte recruitment in vivo regardless of extracellular S100A8/A9 functions</title>
<p>As demonstrated previously by our group, rolling of neutrophils on inflamed endothelium leads to E-selectin mediated, NLRP3 inflammasome dependent, secretion of S100A8/A9 via transient GSDMD pores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Released S100A8/A9 heterodimer in turn binds to TLR4 on neutrophils in an autocrine manner, leading to β<sub>2</sub> integrin activation, slow leukocyte rolling and firm neutrophil adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Interestingly, E-selectin triggers S100 release does not substantially affect the cytosolic S100A8/A9 content. Analysis of S100A8/A9 levels in the supernatants of E-selectin versus Triton X-100 treated neutrophils demonstrated that only about 1-2% of the cytosolic S100A8/A9 content was secreted to the extracellular compartment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis of the inflamed cremaster muscle tissue confirmed no major difference in the amount of cytosolic S100A8/A9 between intravascular and extravasated neutrophils (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref>). Given the abundance of cytosolic S100A8/A9 even after its active release during neutrophil rolling, we wanted to investigate a putative role of intracellular S100A8/A9 in leukocyte recruitment independently of its extracellular function.</p>

</fig>
<p>To investigate this, we made use of WT and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice, which are functional double knockout mice for MRP8 and MRP14 (S100A8 and S100A9) at the protein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], and studied neutrophil recruitment in mouse cremaster muscle venules upon TNF-α treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), a well-established model to assess neutrophil recruitment into inflamed tissue in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Two hours after onset of inflammation, we exteriorized the cremaster muscle and investigated the number of rolling and adherent cells by intravital microscopy. While rolling was not affected by the absence of S100A8/A9 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), we detected a reduced number of adherent neutrophils in postcapillary cremaster muscle venules of <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic>compared to WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). We found a significant negative correlation between increasing shear rates and the number of adherent leukocytes in <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic>animals while this correlation could not be detected in WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). These findings indicate that lack of cytosolic S100A8/A9 impairs shear stress resistance of adherent neutrophils in vivo. To exclude differences in surface expression of rolling and adhesion relevant molecules on neutrophils, we performed FACS analysis and could not detect differences in the baseline expression of CD11a, CD11b, CD18, CD62L, PSGL1, CXCR2 and CD44 in WT and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neutrophils (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C - S1J</xref>). In order to test whether the observed phenotype of decreased neutrophil adhesion in <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice was simply a consequence of the lack of extracellular S100A8/A9 induced β<sub>2</sub> integrin activation, we again performed intravital microscopy in the exteriorized but otherwise unstimulated mouse cremaster muscles. In this scenario, only a mild inflammation is induced which leads to the mobilization of pre-stored P-selectin from Weibel-Pallade bodies, but no upregulation of E-selectin and therefore no E-selectin induced S100A8/A9 release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. After exteriorization and trauma-induced induction of inflammation in the cremaster muscle tissue, we systemically injected soluble S100A8/A9 via a carotid artery catheter to induce TLR4 mediated integrin activation and firm leukocyte adhesion in exteriorized cremaster muscle venules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. To prevent S100A8/A9 tetramerization in plasma, which would abolish binding of S100A8/A9 to TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], we took advantage of a mutant S100A8/A9 protein (S100A8/A9<sup>mut</sup>, aa exchange N70A and E79A) which is unable to tetramerize upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding thereby inducing substantial TLR4 downstream signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Injection of S100A8/A9<sup>mut</sup> induced a significant increase in leukocyte adhesion in WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), whereas induction of adhesion was completely absent in <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), suggesting that loss of S100A8/A9 causes an intrinsic adhesion defect, which cannot be rescued by application of extracellular S100A8/A9 and subsequent TLR4 mediated β<sub>2</sub> integrin activation. In addition, similar results were obtained in the TNF-α stimulated cremaster muscles model (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1K</xref>) where S100A8/A9<sup>mut</sup> increased leukocyte adhesion in WT mice, but again could not induce an increase in leukocyte adhesion in <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1L</xref>). In addition, microvascular parameters were quantified in order to compare different vessels in every in vivo experiment and no difference was detected (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, we wanted to investigate whether reduced adhesion results in impaired leukocyte extravasation in <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and stained TNF-α stimulated cremaster muscles of WT and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice with Giemsa and analyzed number of perivascular neutrophils. Indeed, we observed a reduced number of transmigrated neutrophils in <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic>compared to WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that cytosolic S100A8/A9 regulates key processes during neutrophil recruitment into inflamed tissue in vivo.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Loss of cytosolic S100A8/A9 impairs neutrophil adhesion under flow conditions without affecting β<sub>2</sub> integrin activation</title>
<p>Next, we focused on the adhesion defect of S100A8/A9 deficient neutrophils. For this purpose, we used an autoperfused microflow chamber system as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Flow chambers were coated with E-selectin, ICAM-1 and CXCL1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This combination of recombinant proteins mimics the inflamed endothelium and allows studying leukocyte adhesion under flow conditions. In line with our in vivo findings, lack of S100A8/A9 did not affect leukocyte rolling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), but resulted in a lower number of adherent <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> leukocytes compared to WT leukocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), without affecting white blood cell count (WBC) (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Reduced neutrophil adhesion could be a consequence of defective β<sub>2</sub> integrin activation induced by chemokines or other inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. In order to study the effect of S100A8/A9 deficiency on rapid β<sub>2</sub> integrin activation via G<sub>αi</sub> coupled signaling (inside-out signaling), we investigated the capacity of WT and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neutrophils to bind soluble ICAM- 1 upon CXCL1 stimulation using flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). CXCL1 induced a significant and similar increase in soluble ICAM-1 binding in both, WT and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neutrophils (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), suggesting that G<sub>αi</sub> coupled integrin activation is independent of cytosolic S100A8/A9. To corroborate this finding, we performed a static adhesion assay where we plated WT and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neutrophils on ICAM-1 coated plates, stimulated them with PBS or CXCL1 and quantified the number of adherent cells. As expected, CXCL1 stimulated WT cells displayed increased adhesion to ICAM-1 coated plates compared to PBS treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). In line with the findings from the soluble ICAM-1 binding assay, this increase was also detected in <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells indicating that chemokine-induced β<sub>2</sub> integrin activation is not dependent on cytosolic S100A8/A9.</p>

<title>Cytosolic S100A8/A9 is crucial for neutrophil spreading, crawling and post-arrest modifications under flow</title>
<p>Activated and ligand bound β<sub>2</sub> integrins start to assemble focal clusters thereby transmitting signals into the inner cell compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. This process named outside-in signaling is required to strengthen adhesion and to induce cell shape changes, fundamental for neutrophil spreading, crawling and finally transmigration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Since <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neutrophils displayed a defect in leukocyte adhesion in vivo and ex vivo, although their inside-out signaling is fully functional, we started to study a putative role of cytosolic S100A8/A9 in β<sub>2</sub> integrin dependent outside-in signaling. Therefore, isolated WT and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> bone marrow neutrophils were introduced into E-selectin, ICAM-1 and CXCL1 coated microflow chambers and changes in cell shape were monitored over 10min (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). WT neutrophils displayed normal spreading properties as depicted by the gradual increase in area and perimeter over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). In line with these findings, circularity and solidity, parameters reflecting the polarization capability of the cells and the amount of protrusions the cell developed, respectively, decreased over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). In contrast, increment of area and perimeter was significantly less pronounced in <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Circularity and solidity did only marginally decrease over time in <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, suggesting that neutrophils are unable to polarize properly and to extend protrusions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). These results imply a substantial role of cytosolic S100A8/A9 in β<sub>2</sub> integrin outside-in signaling.</p>

<p>Next, we wanted to examine consequences of impaired neutrophil spreading in absence of S100A8/A9 by analyzing neutrophil crawling under flow. Therefore, we introduced isolated neutrophils into E-selectin, ICAM-1 and CXCL1 coated microflow chambers and allowed them to adhere for 3min to the substrates. Thereafter, we applied physiological shear stress (2dyne cm<sup>-2</sup>) and analyzed crawling behavior. WT neutrophils resisted shear forces and slowly crawled in the direction of the flow, whereas <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neutrophils crawled in an intermittent and jerky manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and Movie S1). In line, <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neutrophils covered significantly longer distances (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), with an increased directionality toward flow direction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>) and displayed an increased crawling velocity compared to WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm impaired crawling and defective outside-in signaling dependent adhesion strengthening in neutrophils lacking cytosolic S100A8/A9, we conducted a neutrophil detachment assay using E-selectin, ICAM-1 and CXCL1 coated microflow chambers and applied increasing shear stress. We found lower numbers of adherent <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neutrophils compared to WT neutrophils with increasing shear stress (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). This is in line with our in vivo findings where we detected a negative correlation between the number of adherent cells and increasing shear stress in <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic>animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Together, these findings suggest a critical role of intracellular S100A8/A9 in adherent neutrophils to resist high shear stress conditions.</p>
<p>Following engagement of the ligand ICAM-1 to activated β<sub>2</sub> integrins in neutrophils, the proline-rich tyrosine kinase Pyk2 and the focal adhesion adaptor protein paxillin are, among other proteins, rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated thereby being critical events for cell adhesion, migration and podosome formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. To test the role of cytosolic S100A8/A9 in mediating outside-in signaling events on the mechanistic level, we seeded WT and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neutrophils on ICAM-1 coated plates, stimulated the cells with CXCL1 and determined Pyk2 and paxillin phosphorylation by western blot analysis. We found increased abundance of Pyk2 and paxillin phosphorylation in CXCL1 stimulated WT cells, while no increase was detectable in <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic>neutrophils (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that cytosolic S100A8/A9 is essential during ICAM-1 induced integrin outside-in signaling events and therefore indispensable for post arrest modifications including cell polarization and the formation of cell protrusions.</p>

<title>Cytosolic S100A8/A9 drives neutrophil cytoskeletal rearrangement by regulating LFA-1 nanocluster formation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability within the clusters</title>
<p>Integrin outside-in signaling strongly depends on focal cluster formation of high-affinity LFA-1 and high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations within these clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Since S100A8/A9 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, we studied LFA-1 clustering and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures during neutrophil adhesion under flow conditions. For this approach, we isolated neutrophils from Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter mice (WT <italic><sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic>) and S100A8/A9 deficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter mice (<italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup> <sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic>) and fluorescently labelled the cells with an LFA-1 antibody (Fig.4a). Neutrophils were then introduced into E-selectin, ICAM-1 and CXCL1 coated flow chambers, allowed to settle for 3min before shear was applied (2dyne cm<sup>-2</sup>). Time-lapse movies of fluorescence LFA-1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were recorded for 10min by confocal microscopy. First, LFA-1 signals from single cell analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) were segmented through automatic thresholding in order to generate a binary image of the LFA-1 signals (LFA-1 mask) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Then, LFA-1 nanoclusters were considered as such if they spanned a minimum area of 0.15µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), according to literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. We found that <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup> <sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> neutrophils formed significantly less LFA-1 nanoclusters compared to WT <italic><sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> neutrophils suggesting an involvement of cytosolic S100A8/A9 in LFA-1 nanocluster formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and Movie S2). Next, we investigated Ca<sup>2+</sup> intensities within LFA-1 nanoclusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>) to determine Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at the LFA-1 focal adhesion spots (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). We found a significant reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in LFA-1 nanocluster areas of <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup> <sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> neutrophils compared to WT <italic><sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> neutrophils (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref> and Movie S3) suggesting an impaired availability of free intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> at LFA-1 nanocluster sites in absence of cytosolic S100A8/A9. Strikingly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the cytoplasm (outside of LFA-1 nanoclusters, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4I</xref>) did not differ between WT <italic><sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup> <sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> neutrophils (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>), indicating that cytosolic S100A8/A9 plays an important role especially in Ca<sup>2+</sup> supply at LFA-1 adhesion spots. In line, overall Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels under basal conditions (poly-L-lysine coating, static conditions) were similar between WT <italic><sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup> <sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> neutrophils (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>).

<p>LFA-1 is known to be rapidly recycled and to spatially redistribute to form a ring like structure that co-clusters with endothelial ICAM-1 during neutrophil migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. To study spatial distribution of LFA-1 nanoclusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>), we used Ripley’s K function in WT <italic><sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup> <sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> neutrophils (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>). Ripley’s K is a spatial statistic that compares a given point distribution with a random distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. WT <italic><sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic>neutrophils showed significantly more aggregated LFA-1 nanoclusters within 10μm<sup>2</sup> area, suitable for LFA-1 enriched pseudopods, compared to <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup> <sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> neutrophils (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>), independent from the total LFA-1 nanocluster number. These results show that in the absence of cytosolic S100A8/A9, LFA-1 nanoclusters are more randomly distributed compared to control and indicate that subcellular redistribution of LFA-1 during migration requires cytosolic S100A8/A9.</p>
<p>Recent work has shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling promotes F-actin polymerization at the uropod of polarized neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Actin waves in turn are known to be important for membrane protrusion formation, neutrophil polarization and firm arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Therefore, we examined F-actin dynamics in the presence or absence of cytosolic S100A8/A9. For this, we used the same experimental setting as for the LFA-1 cluster analysis but this time we fluorescently labelled WT <italic><sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup> <sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> neutrophils for F-actin. We generated a mask using the myeloid cell marker <italic>Lyz2</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>) and applied the mask to the F-actin channel (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref>). In line with our previous results on reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within LFA-1 adhesion clusters in the absence of S100A8/A9, we found a strongly reduced F-actin signal in <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup> <sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> neutrophils compared to WT <italic><sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> neutrophils (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O</xref> and Movie S4). Total actin levels as determined by western blot analysis did not differ between WT <italic><sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup> <sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic>neutrophils (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we analyzed the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flickers in WT <italic><sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup> <sup>Lyz2xGCaMP5</sup></italic> neutrophils induced by E-selectin, ICAM-1 and CXCL1 stimulation using high throughput computational analysis. We found an increased number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flickers/min in the absence of S100A8/A9 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3E</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3F</xref>), going along with a shorter duration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> event compared to control cells (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3G</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3H</xref>). This finding suggests that cytosolic S100A8/A9 is not only important for local Ca<sup>2+</sup> supply at focal LFA-1 nanocluster sites, but in addition “stabilizes” Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, preventing fast and uncontrolled Ca<sup>2+</sup> flickering.</p>
<p>Taken together, these data show that cytosolic S100A8/A9 is indispensable for LFA-1 nanocluster formation and actin-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements by providing and/or promoting Ca<sup>2+</sup> supply at the LFA-1 nanocluster sites.</p>

<title>Cytosolic S100A8/A9 is dispensable for chemokine induced ER store Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and for the initial phase of SOCE</title>
<p>Our data suggest that intracellular S100A8/A9 is a fundamental regulator of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability within neutrophils during the recruitment process thereby affecting subcellular LFA-1 and actin dynamics and distribution. Finally, we wanted to study any potential impact of cytosolic S100A8/A9 on Ca<sup>2+</sup> store release and on Store-Operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> Entry (SOCE) during neutrophil activation by investigating GPCR induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling using flow cytometry.

We could not detect any differences in CXCL1 induced ER store Ca<sup>2+</sup> release between WT and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, indicating that GPCR induced downstream signaling leading to ER store depletion is not affected by the absence of cytosolic S100A8/A9 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).

<p>Next, we wanted to investigate whether the absence of cytosolic S100A8/A9 might modify chemokine induced SOCE.

<p>S100A8/A9 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, mainly located within the cytosolic compartment of myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Once secreted, S100A8/A9 heterodimers exhibit pro-inflammatory effects by engagement with its respective receptors including TLR4 and RAGE on a broad spectrum of effector cells, among them phagocytes, lymphocytes and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. In addition, extracellular S100A8/A9 is a well established biomarker for many acute and chronic inflammatory disorders, including cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases and infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. The tetrameric form of S100A8/A9 was recently shown to have an anti-inflammatory effects during an inflammatory process potentially protecting the organism from overwhelming immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Despite increasing evidence of the pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of secreted S100A8/A9, little is known about its intracellular role in myeloid cells. Here, we show that S100A8/A9 is still abundantly present in the cytosolic compartment of neutrophils even after its active release during inflammation. In addition, we demonstrate that cytosolic S100A8/A9 has a functional impact on neutrophil recruitment during β<sub>2</sub> integrin outside-in signaling events by ensuring high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at LFA-1 cluster sites independent of its extracellular functions. Neutrophil β<sub>2</sub> integrin outside-in signaling is known to mediate post-arrest modifications including cytoskeletal rearrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic>cells, which also lack MRP8 in mature cells of the myeloid lineage (functional S100A8/A9 deficient cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], were unable to properly spread, polarize and crawl. This resulted in a marked impairment of adherent neutrophils to withstand physiological shear forces exerted by the circulating blood. Defective outside-in signaling in absence of S100A8/A9 was accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of paxillin and Pyk2, two critical factors involved in the regulation of β<sub>2</sub> integrin mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Of note, <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> myeloid cells have been shown to comprise alterations of cytoskeletal function before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. In the original publication describing the phenotype of <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, an abnormally polarized cell shape of MRP14 deficient cells was described and therefore a potential role of S100A8/A9 in cytoskeletal reorganization was already hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. In 2014, Vogl et al. demonstrated that cytosolic S100A8/A9 had an impact on the stabilization of microtubules (MTs) via direct interaction of S100A8/A9 with tubulin in resting phagocytes. Upon p38 MAPK and concomitant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, S100A8/A9 was shown to dissociate from MTs, leading to de-polymerization of MTs thereby allowing neutrophils to transmigrate into inflamed tissue. This might also explain decreased migration of <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> granulocytes in a mouse wound healing model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Additional studies described cytosolic S100A8/A9 to translocate to the membrane and colocalize with vimentin in monocytes upon activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], to interact with keratin in epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] and to associate with F-actin localized to lamellipodia in fMLF stimulated neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Those findings led us to investigate a potential role of cytosolic S100A8/A9 in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent interplay of plasma membrane located adhesion sites and the cytoskeleton during neutrophil recruitment.</p>
<p>Neutrophil activation during leukocyte recruitment goes along with Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux initiated e.g. by the engagement of chemokines with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Subsequently, phospholipase C beta (PLC-β) is activated and leads to the production of Inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which in turn elicits the IP3-receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in a rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from ER stores into the cytoplasm. The decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the ER in turn activates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor stromal interaction molecules (STIM1 and STIM2) triggering the entry of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> through SOCE mainly via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release activated (CRAC) channel ORAI-1 and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. ORAI-1 is recruited to adhesion cluster sites ensuring high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at the “inflammatory synapse” and rapid rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which mediates the assembly of cytoskeletal adaptor proteins to integrin tails and allows the onset of pseudopod formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. The importance of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability in subcellular domains has also been shown in T-cells during the engagement with antigen presenting cells within the immunological synapse. In T-cells, mitochondria play a central role as Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers and as Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductors that collect cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the entry site, (i.e. through open CRAC channels located at the immunological synapse) and distribute it throughout the cytosol. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Here we show that in neutrophils cytosolic S100A8/A9 increases and stabilizes Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability at the LFA-1 nanocluster sites during intravascular adhesion, mediating spatial clustering of LFA-1 and sustained polymerization of F-actin, both essential steps for efficient neutrophil adhesion strengthening. In addition, presence of cytosolic S100A8/A9 stabilizes duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals within the cells, as WT cells displayed longer frequencies of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events with less flickers min<sup>-</sup> <sup>1</sup>, which might in addition be important for the stability of the inflammatory synapse.</p>
<p>As reported earlier, chemokine induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through SOCE at the plasma membrane is indispensable for the activation of high affinity β<sub>2</sub> integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. This early step during leukocyte recruitment (inside-out signaling) was not affected in absence of cytosolic S100A8/A9. In line, <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells displayed similar CXCL1 induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes compared to WT cells. Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores and initial phases of SOCE were fully functional, as shown by flow cytometry of Indo-1 dye loaded neutrophils. These findings are in accordance with a study by Hobbs et al., which also described normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in S100A8/A9 deficient neutrophils induced by the chemokine MIP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. However, we found an impact of cytosolic S100A8/A9 in sustaining high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, as Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes decreased faster in the absence of S100A8/A9. Whether this faster decrease is mediated through a direct effect of cytosolic S100A8/A9 on SOCE or through a potential buffer capacity of cytosolic S100A8/A9 needs to be further investigated. Hobbs et al. proposed no impact of S100A9 deletion in the recruitment of neutrophils by using a thioglycolate induced peritonitis model. However, peritoneal neutrophil emigration was shown to be rather independent of LFA-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], whereas extravasation into cremaster muscle tissue strongly relies on the β<sub>2</sub> integrin LFA-1 and integrin clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>].</p>
<p>Taken together, we identified a critical role of cytosolic S100A8/A9 in neutrophil recruitment. We show that its absence leads to reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and impaired sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> supply at LFA-1 nanocluster sites. Attenuated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures in turn affect β<sub>2</sub> integrin dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements and substantially compromises neutrophil recruitment during the inflammatory response. These findings uncover cytosolic S100A8/A9 as a potentially interesting therapeutic target to reduce neutrophil recruitment during inflammatory disorders with unwanted overwhelming neutrophil influx.</p>

<p>In vitro release of S100A8/A9 was performed as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Briefly, bone marrow neutrophils were isolated from WT mice. 24 well-plates were coated with recombinant murine (rm) E-selectin (rmCD62E-Fc chimera, 10µg mL<sup>-1</sup>, R&amp;D Systems) or PBS/0.1% BSA at 4°C overnight, blocked with PBS/5% casein (Sigma-Aldrich) and washed twice with PBS. 5×10<sup>5</sup> neutrophils were reconstituted in complete HBSS buffer and incubated under shaking conditions on the coated slides for 10min at 37°C and 5% CO2. To assess the total intracellular S100A8/A9 levels, cells were lysed in 2% Triton X-100 (Applichem). Finally, cellular supernatants were analyzed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to determine the concentrations of S100A8/A9.</p>

<title>Murine cremaster muscle models</title>
<p>Leukocyte recruitment was investigated by intravital microscopy in inflamed cremaster muscle venules as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Shortly, intrascrotal (i.s.) injection of rmTNF-α (500ng, R&amp;D Systems) was applied to WT and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in order to induce an acute inflammation in the cremaster muscle. Two hours after injection, the carotid artery of anaesthetized mice was catheterized for later blood sampling (ProCyte Dx; IDEXX Laboratories) or intra-arterial (i.a.) injection. Thereafter, the cremaster muscle was exteriorized and intravital microscopy was conducted on an OlympusBX51 WI microscope, equipped with a 40x objective (Olympus, 0.8NA, water immersion objective) and a CCD camera (KAPPA CF 8 HS). Post-capillary venules were recorded using VirtualDub software for later analysis. Rolling flux fraction, number of adherent cells mm<sup>−2</sup>, vessel diameter and vessel length were analyzed using FIJI software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. During the entire experiment, the cremaster muscle was superfused with thermo-controlled bicarbonate buffer as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Centerline blood flow velocity in each venule was measured with a dual photodiode (Circusoft Instrumentation). Subsequently, cremaster muscles were removed, fixed in 4% PFA solution O.N. at 4°C and the next day stained with Giemsa (Merck) to assess the number of perivascular neutrophils. The tissues were mounted in Eukytt mounting medium and covered with a 170μm coverslip. Neutrophils were discriminated from other leukocyte subpopulations based on nuclear shape and granularity of the cytosol. The analysis of transmigrated leukocytes was carried out at the Core Facility Bioimaging of the Biomedical Center with a Leica DM2500 transmission bright field microscope, equipped with a 100x, 1.4 NA, oil immersion objective and a Leica DMC2900 CMOS camera. Resulting images had 2048×1536 pixels and a pixel size of 58nm.</p>
<p>For rescue experiments, we adopted either the TNF-α-induced inflammation model as described above or the trauma-induced inflammation model of the mouse cremaster muscle. Therefore, sterile inflammation was induced by opening and exteriorizing the cremaster muscle without application of any stimulus. Intravital microscopy was conducted as described above. After finding an appropriate spot, the same vessel was recorded before and after injection of mutant murine S100A8/S100A9N70AE79A (S100A8/A9<sup>mut</sup>, aa exchange N70A and E79A, 50µg mouse<sup>-1</sup> in 100µL, provided by Thomas Vogl, University of Muenster, Germany) and the number of adherent cells mm<sup>-2</sup> were counted pre and post injection in WT and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p>

For the subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> analysis at the LFA-1 cluster sites, the LFA-1 segmented channel was applied to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in the selected ROIs were determined, normalized to the LFA-1 areas, and averaged over each minute of analysis. For the Ca<sup>2+</sup> analysis in the negative LFA-1 area, we again adopted semi-automated single cell analysis and subtracted the LFA-1 mask from the <italic>Lyz2</italic> mask in order to obtain “LFA-1 cluster negative masks”. Later, the “LFA-1 cluster negative masks” were applied to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and Ca<sup>2+</sup> intensities were measured, normalized to the “LFA-1 cluster negative masks” and averaged over each minute of analysis. For the F-actin analysis, the <italic>Lyz2</italic> channel was automatically segmented to obtain a cell mask and applied to the F-actin channel. F-actin intensities were measured and averaged over each minute of analysis as described above.</p>

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> store release and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx measurement – flow cytometry</title>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> store release and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was analyzed by flow cytometry through an adapted protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. WT and <italic>Mrp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> bone marrow neutrophils (2.5×10<sup>6</sup> mL<sup>-1</sup>) were resuspended in PBS and loaded with 3 µM Indo-1 AM (Invitrogen™) for 45min at 37°C. Cells were washed, resuspended in complete HBSS buffer (2.5×10<sup>6</sup> mL<sup>-1</sup>) and stained with an anti Ly6G-APC antibody (1μg mL<sup>-</sup> <sup>1</sup>, 1A8, BioLegend) and with the Fixable Viability Dye eFluor™ 780 (1:1000; eBioscience™). Cells (2×10<sup>5</sup>) were incubated for 2min at 37°C and 10nM CXCL1 was placed on the side of the FACS tube in a 2μL droplet form. The cells were analyzed at the flow cytometry core facility of the biomedical center with a BD LSRFortessa<sup>TM</sup> flow cytometer. Samples were recorded for 45 seconds to establish a baseline. Afterwards, CXCL1 stimulation was initiated by tapping the tube with subsequent fall of the drop into the cell suspension while continuously recording Indo-1 AM signals from neutrophils over time. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software. Calcium levels are expressed as relative ratios of fluorescence emission at 375nm/525nm (calcium bound/calcium unbound) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures quantified as AUC of kinetic averages. To measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> store release only, Ca<sup>2+</sup> free medium was used.</p>

<title>Spatial distribution analysis of LFA-1 nanoclusters</title>
<p>To evaluate the spatial distribution of LFA-1 nanoclusters in neutrophils, Ripley’s K statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] was calculated for every time point in every experiment with radii between 0.5μm and 5.5μm. For every radius r, we calculated the K(r) value as follows:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="589738v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Where <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> are two different LFA-1 nanocluster locations, <italic>I</italic> is the indicator function which is 1 if the content within the parentheses is “True” and 0 if the content is “False”, and N is a normalization constant. For ‘dist’, the Euclidian distance was chosen and calculated via the “pairwise_distances” from sklearn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. The sampling part of Ripley’s K statistic was done by drawing random locations as LFA-1 nanocluster events from the cell surface. To make Ripley’s K results comparable between different experiments, we normalized K(r) values such that the random sampling upper bound, calculated for every experiment, was set to 1, and the random sampling lower bound was set to -1. Thus, every normalized value between -1 and 1 is within random borders, i.e. not distinguishable from a random spatial distribution. Values above 1 indicate aggregated LFA-1 nanoclusters and values below -1 indicate dispersed LFA-1 nanoclusters. At least 10 LFA-1 nanoclusters were considered for the spatial aggregation analysis. The number of identified aggregated LFA-1 nanoclusters (values above 1) was counted and averaged for every condition, resulting in an aggregation index.</p>

<title>Frequency and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations</title>
<p>After the recording, Ca<sup>2+</sup> mean intensities of the cells were calculated over time, counting each cell as an individual ROI. Data was imported into a previously described custom analysis pipeline for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Briefly, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> mean intensities were sequentially filtered according to the standard values of the pipeline, considering only events with a z-score of at least 3 (p&lt;0.01). From those events, a graph was constructed to detect superimposed events. Properties of the events, AUC or half-width, were used in the calculations afterwards. The code of the analysis pipeline can be accessed in the corresponding repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/szarma/Physio_Ca">https://github.com/szarma/Physio_Ca</ext-link>.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study investigates the contribution of cytosolic S100A/8 to neutrophil migration to inflamed tissues. The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for how the loss of cytosolic S100A/8 specifically affects the ability of neutrophils to crawl and subsequently adhere under shear stress. This study will be of interest in fields where inflammation is implicated, such as autoimmunity or sepsis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript by Napoli et al, the authors study the intracellular function of Cytosolic S100A8/A9 a myeloid cell soluble protein that operates extracellularly as an alarmin, whose intracellular function is not well characterized. Here, the authors utilize state-of-the-art intravital microscopy to demonstrate that adhesion defects observed in cells lacking S100A8/A9 (Mrp14-/-) are not rescued by exogenous S100A8/A9, thus highlighting an intrinsic defect. Based on this result subsequent efforts were employed to characterize the nature of those adhesion defects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors convincingly show that Mrp14-/- neutrophils have normal rolling but defective adhesion caused by impaired CD11b activation (deficient ICAM1 binding). Analysis of cellular spreading (defective in Mrp14-/- cells) is also sound. The manuscript then focuses on selective signaling pathways and calcium measurements. Overall, this is a straightforward study of biologically important proteins and mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some suggestions are included below to improve this manuscript.</p>

<p>Napoli et al. provide a compelling study showing the importance of cytosolic S100A8/9 in maintaining calcium levels at LFA-1 nanoclusters at the cell membrane, thus allowing the successful crawling and adherence of neutrophils under shear stress. The authors show that cytosolic S100A8/9 is responsible for retaining stable and high concentrations of calcium specifically at LFA-1 nanoclusters upon binding to ICAM-1, and imply that this process aids in facilitating actin polymerisation involved in cell shape and adherence. The authors show early on that S100A8/9 deficient neutrophils fail to extravasate successfully into the tissue, thus suggesting that targeting cytosolic S100A8/9 could be useful in settings of autoimmunity/acute inflammation where neutrophil-induced collateral damage is unwanted.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Using multiple complementary methods from imaging to western blotting and flow cytometry, including extracellular supplementation of S100A8/9 in vivo, the authors conclusively prove a defect in intracellular S100A8/9, rather than extracellular S100A8/9 was responsible for the loss in neutrophil adherence, and pinpointed that S100A8/9 aided in calcium stabilisation and retention at the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Extravasation is shown to be a major defect of Mrp14-/- neutrophils, but the Giemsa staining in Figure 1H seems to be quite unspecific to me, as neutrophils were determined by nuclear shape and granularity. It would have perhaps been more clear to use immunofluorescence staining for neutrophils instead as seen in Supplementary Figure 1A (staining for Ly6G or other markers instead of S100A9).</p>
<p>(2) The representative image for Mrp14-/- neutrophils used in Figure 4K to demonstrate Ripley's K function seems to be very different from that shown above in Figures 4C and 4F.</p>
<p>(3) Although the authors have done well to draw a path linking cytosolic S100A8/9 to actin polymerisation and subsequently the arrest and adherence of neutrophils in vitro, the authors can be more explicit with the analysis - for example, is the F-actin co-localized with the LFA-1 nanoclusters? Does S100A8/9 localise to the membrane with LFA-1 upon stimulation? Lastly, I think it would have been very useful to close the loop on the extravasation observation with some in vitro evidence to show that neutrophils fail to extravasate under shear stress.</p>
