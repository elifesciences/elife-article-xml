<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Retrotransposons (RTEs) have been postulated to reactivate with age and contribute to aging through activated innate immune response and inflammation. Here, we analyzed the relationship between RTE expression and aging using published transcriptomic and methylomic datasets of human blood. Despite no observed correlation between RTE activity and chronological age, the expression of most RTE classes and families except short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) correlated with biological age-associated gene signature scores. Strikingly, we found that the expression of SINEs was linked to upregulated DNA repair pathways in multiple cohorts. We also observed DNA hypomethylation with aging and significant increase in RTE expression level in hypomethylated RTEs except for SINEs. Additionally, our single-cell transcriptomic analysis suggested a role for plasma cells in aging mediated by RTEs. Altogether, our multi-omics analysis of large human cohorts highlights the role of RTEs in biological aging and suggests possible mechanisms and cell populations for future investigations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transposable elements (TEs) are genetic elements that can move within the genome and are categorized into DNA transposons and retrotransposons (RTEs), which depend on cDNA intermediates to function. RTEs include three classes: endogenous retrovirus long terminal repeats (LTRs), and long and short interspersed nuclear elements, known as LINEs and SINEs, respectively. LINEs and SINEs employ target-primed reverse transcription for genome integration, with SINEs depending on the proteins encoded by LINEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Although most of the RTE sequences are dormant in the host genome, they continue to play vital roles in human evolution and physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>RTEs are silenced through heterochromatinization and DNA methylation in the early developmental stages as part of the host defense mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. However, increased RTE activity that occurs with aging can lead to genome instability and activation of DNA damage pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Additionally, accumulation of cytoplasmic RTE cDNAs detected in aging organisms and senescent cells can activate type I interferon (IFN-I) response and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, that contributes to inflammaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, chromatin remodeling and cellular senescence also contribute partially to the RTE reactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Cellular senescence is a non-proliferative state elicited by stress factors such as DNA damage and is closely intertwined with inflammation and aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Through the expression of senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), senescent cells promote inflammation and senescence in other cells, including immune cells, leading to a compromised immune system and a vicious cycle of inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Understanding the relationship between RTE expression and SASP, cellular senescence, and inflammaging could offer important insights into strategies against aging and age-related diseases (ARDs).</p>
<p>Recent studies have documented the relationship between RTE activation and biological age-related (BAR) events, but comprehensive and large-scale studies are lacking, mainly due to the paucity of RNA-seq data for large non-cancerous human cohorts. Most of the existing transcriptomics datasets are microarray-based, where the computational methods to analyze repetitive elements have not been sufficiently developed. By overlapping Illumina microarray expression and methylation probe locations to RTE locations in RepeatMasker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, we were able to identify sufficient number of probes to calculate the expression and methylation levels of RTE classes and families. Building on this methodology, we explored how RTE expression contributes to biological aging using publicly available transcriptomics microarray data derived from human blood samples. More specifically, we first investigated if RTE expression was correlated with chronological age, and then we analyzed the relationship between RTE and BAR events including cellular senescence, inflammation, and IFN-I response with published gene signatures. Using microarray methylomic data, we also investigated the DNA methylation level of RTEs in blood samples of multiple non-cancerous human cohorts and examined the relation between DNA methylation and RTE expression and aging. Furthermore, with annotated single-cell transcriptomic data of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 21 healthy human samples from a recent study of aging immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, we identified cells that could be implicated in the process of RTE reactivation and aging. We also validated our microarray result with a publicly available bulk RNA-seq PBMC data from healthy individuals that was recently published in a new study of aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Lastly, the single-cell transcriptomic data of supercentenarians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> was analyzed to examine the interplay between RTE expression and aging as a factor of aging and longevity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Conceptual framework and the study design.</title>
<p>We collected published datasets of human blood samples for gene expression, DNA methylation, and single-cell transcriptomic data. The analysis aimed to study the relation between the expression and DNA methylation of RTEs versus chronological and biological aging in large human cohorts. The single-cell transcriptomic datasets were employed for cell type-specific analysis of RTEs in PBMC to identify the relation between RTE expression and aging events for annotated cell types within old versus young PBMC samples.</p></caption>

<title>Analyzing DNA methylation and expression levels of RTEs using microarray data</title>
<p>We collected three published microarray datasets from large-scale human studies, including the peripheral monocyte samples from Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> (MESA, aged 44 to 83, n=1202), the whole blood (WB) samples from Grady Trauma Project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> (GTP, aged 15 to 77, n=359), and PBMC samples from Genetics, Osteoarthritis and Progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (GARP, aged 43 to 79, n=139), which are all non-cancerous human samples (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Information). The studies were conducted using either Illumina HumanHT-12 V3 or Illumina HumanHT-12 V4 expression microarray kits. After comparing the probes of the two microarray versions, we adopted the more comprehensive probe list of V4, which contains the full intersection of the two lists. To quantify RTE expression, we mapped the microarray probe locations to RTE locations in RepeatMasker to extract the list of noncoding (intergenic or intronic) probes that cover the RTE regions. We included three main RTE classes: (1) the LINE class, which encompasses the L1 and L2 families; (2) the SINE class, with Alu and MIR as the two main families; and (3) the LTR class which comprises the ERV1, ERVL, ERVL-MaLR, and ERVK families. Most of the RTE-covering probes available on Illumina HumanHT-12 V4 are present in MESA and GARP, while fewer are available in GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>, Supplementary Tables 2-4).</p>
<p>Four methylation datasets were analysed, including MESA, Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> (SATSA, aged 48 to 98, n=1072), Brisbane Systems Genetics Study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (BSGS, aged 10 to 75, n=862), and Genome-wide Methylation Profiles Reveal Quantitative Views of Human Aging Rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (GMPWAR, aged 19 to 101, n=656). SATSA, BSGS, and GMPWAR include genome-wide DNA methylation of WB samples produced by Illumina Infinium 450k array (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Information). The DNA methylation probes from the Illumina Infinium 450k array kit were aligned to the locations in RepeatMasker to identify the probes overlapping the RTE regions (Supplementary Table 5). More than 90% of the RTE-covering probes are present in MESA and GMPWAR, while fewer, but more than half, are available in SATA and BSGS datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>

<title>The chronological age is not linked with RTE expression</title>
<p>Firstly, we examined the relationship between RTE expression and chronological age in the MESA, GARP, and GTP cohorts. The ages of the individuals enrolled in these studies range from 15 to 83 years, with the mean being 70.2 (MESA), 60.1 (GAPR), and 42.5 (GTP) (<bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>). Strikingly, no significant relationship (<italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05) is found between chronological age and expressions of the three RTE classes across the datasets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Similarly, apart from a weak correlation observed between a few RTE families and chronological age, we could not identify any strong relation between chronological age and expression of RTE families across the three cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>A similar correlation analysis was carried out in a scRNA-seq data of the PBMCs of 21 non-obese healthy men annotated into 25 cell types by Mogilenko et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table 6 and online methods). When comparing the RTE expression of the young (aged 25 to 29, n=11) group with the old (aged 62 to 70, n=10) group, we could not find any significant difference or trend in any cell types between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figs. 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether our observation is consistent in whole transcriptomic data, we conducted correlation analysis on a set of RNA-seq data on healthy human PBMC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> (aged 20 to 74, n=159). We did not observe any statistically significant correlation between chronological age and expression of RTE classes or families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Overall, RTE expression did not correlate with chronological aging across the microarray, scRNA-seq, and RNA-seq datasets.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>RTE expression positively correlates with BAR gene signature scores except for SINEs</title>
<p>In mammals, aging is characterized by an intricate network of inflammation, IFN-I signaling, and cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. To measure the level of biological aging from the transcriptomic data, we focused on six gene sets retrieved from widely cited studies: IFN-I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, inflammatory chemokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, inflammaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, SASP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table 7). The scores of these six age-associated gene sets were calculated for each individual in the MESA, GTP, and GARP cohorts by applying the <italic>singscore</italic> package in Bioconductor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> (online methods). Except for GTP, in which 12 genes were missing from the gene sets in total (Supplementary Table 8), MESA and GARP microarray datasets had the expression of all the genes in the gene sets.</p>
<p>We analyzed the relation between RTE expression and the six BAR gene signature scores. Positive correlations were observed between the expressions of LINEs and LTRs and BAR gene signature scores across three datasets, while inverse correlation was present between the expression of SINEs and these scores in the PBMC samples from the GARP cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">b</xref>). The discrepant pattern of LTRs and LINEs versus SINEs in PBMC is more pronounced in the correlation analysis between the expression of RTE families and the BAR gene sets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">d</xref>). Interestingly, the expressive patterns of RTE families are divided into two groups that also reflect their positive or inverse correlations with BAR signature scores in the GARP cohort. In the GARP cohort, the strongest positive correlation with BAR scores was observed in L1, ERVK, and ERVL. By contrast, the expressions of Alu and MIR of SINE, L2, and ERV1 were inversely correlated with BAR signature scores in the GARP cohort (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">d</xref>). This pattern was also observed in the MESA peripheral monocyte samples for L1, ERVL, and ERVK, but not other RTE families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig.2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">c</xref>). The WB GTP cohort showed divergent result to the other two cohorts perhaps because of the absence of certain genes in the six BAR gene sets or lower number of TE probes in GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2a-b</xref> and Supplementary Table 8).</p>
<p>To study the association between RTE expression and BAR gene signatures, we also split the samples in each cohort based on quartiles of RTE expression into high, low, and medium (top 25%, bottom 25%, and middle 50%) groups and compared the BAR gene signature scores across these three groups. Across the datasets, there is an overall trend of increased scores of BAR gene signatures in high versus low LINE and LTR expression groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). In fact, amongst all gene sets, we found the most significant increase for SASP and senescence and to a lesser extent for inflammaging signatures. We observed higher SASP, inflammatory cytokine, senescence, and inflammaging in the peripheral monocytes (MESA) in high SINE- and Alu-expressing groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). However, in the PBMC samples of the GARP cohorts, groups of high SINE and Alu expressions demonstrate lower expressions of SASP, inflammatory chemokine, senescence, and inflammaging, that reflects the inverse correlation we observed before (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Interestingly, when we examined RNA-seq PBMC data, we found that there is a significant correlation between IFN-I signature score and expression of LINE and LTR classes and most of their families (P-val &lt; 0.01), but such a significant correlation did not exist between IFN-I score and SINE class and Alu family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). There are also no specific trends for SINE expression in the WB samples from the GTP cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Taken together, SINEs display different pattern than LINEs and LTRs in terms of the association between their expressions and BAR gene signatures. This prompted us to conduct a gene set variation analysis (GSVA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> to identify the pathways that are regulated in the high versus low RTE expression groups in the three cohorts (online methods).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Elevated SINE expression is linked with the upregulation of the DNA repair pathways, while elevated LINE and LTR expressions are associated with the inflammatory response</title>
<p>We conducted GSVA for high versus low expression groups of RTE classes and families to identify the pathways that might be affected by RTE expression. We specifically focused on the pathways (gene sets) related to the inflammatory and DNA repair responses retrieved from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> with “inflammatory” and “dna_repair” as search keywords.</p>
<p>We found that a significant fraction of gene sets related to DNA repair were downregulated in the group of monocyte samples (MESA cohort) highly expressing LINE and LTR classes but upregulated in the monocyte and PBMC samples (MESA and GARP cohorts, respectively) highly expressing SINEs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). At the family level, there is a unique increase in DNA repair activity in the monocytes of the cohort with high Alu expression. In the PBMC samples of the GARP dataset, DNA repair pathways are upregulated in groups highly expressing L2, ERV1, Alu, and MIR, while most of the other RTE classes demonstrate decreased DNA repair activity. In contrast, the inflammatory response is upregulated in the monocyte and PBMC samples of groups expressing LINE and LTR classes and families at high levels, and such upregulation is less common in SINE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). These observations provide insight into the perpetuating contrast between SINE versus LINE and LTR observed in our analysis, as SINE might contribute to aging via genome instability instead of inflammation that is associated with LINE and LTR activities. Overall, our observations are consistent across MESA and GARP cohorts but less so in the GTP cohort (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), which might be attributed to less RTE-covering probes and the missing genes from the BAR gene signatures.

<p>To elucidate the relationship between the expression and methylation level of RTEs, we divided the MESA samples, with matched RTE DNA methylation and expression, into three groups based on the level of expression of RTEs in different classes and families: low (1<sup>st</sup> quartile), medium (2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> quartile), and high (4<sup>th</sup> quartile) expression groups of monocyte samples from the MESA cohort. The DNA methylation levels of LINEs and LTRs significantly decreased in groups of high LINE and LTR expressions, respectively, but SINEs and the satellite repeats (as negative control) did not display the same pattern (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). LINE families, MIR, and LTR families except ERVK displayed lower levels of methylation in higher expression groups, while such pattern was absent in Alu, CR1, and ERVl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Although the DNA methylation level of SINEs positively correlated with the methylation levels of LINEs and LTRs, the expression of SINEs was not significantly correlated with the expression levels of other RTE classes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Overall, we found a distinct pattern for SINEs versus LTRs and LINEs by exploring a relationship between DNA methylation and expression levels of RTEs in monocytes, consistent with our other findings showing different patterns for SINEs versus LTRs and LINEs in PBMCs (see above). This result also suggests a dispensable role of DNA methylation for SINE silencing in monocytes, which is in line with previous studies showing SINEs are not derepressed by deletion of DNA methyltransferases or treatment with DNA demethylating agents and are primarily regulated by histone modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Elevated level of RTEs in plasma cells of healthy PBMC samples is associated with the high SASP and inflammaging gene signature scores</title>
<p>As described above, we did not identify any association between RTE expression and chronological aging for any human cohorts we analyzed. However, the positive correlation between LINE and LTR expressions with BAR gene signature scores in the PBMC samples of the GARP cohort prompted us to investigate PBMC samples in more detail using PBMC scRNAseq data of 21 samples annotated into 25 cell types by Mogilenko et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>(online methods and Supplementary Table 6). The scRNA-seq samples were divided based on low and high BAR gene signature scores to compare against the expression of RTE classes for each cell type (online methods).

<title>Downregulation of RTE expression in supercentenarians versus normal aged cases despite high BAR signature scores in NK and T cells of supercentenarians</title>
<p>Supercentenarians who have reached 110 years of age are an excellent resource for investigating healthy aging. We hypothesized that supercentenarians should express RTEs less than normal-aged people because RTE expression, particularly LINE and LTR expressions, can activate the inflammatory pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), which would be generally harmful to healthy aging. To understand whether there is any RTE expression change in supercentenarians versus normal-aged people and identify the relationship to BAR gene signatures, we compared the scRNA-seq data of the PBMCs of seven supercentenarians (over 110 years) to five non-centenarian (50 to 80 years) controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. We collected the annotated cells of these twelve cases as a Seurat object for which the cells were annotated into ten different cell types. Compared with the control group, the supercentenarians demonstrated decreased RTE expression in the natural killer (NK) cells, B-cells, T-cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs15">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). Both T cell types showed decreased LINE expression, while the noncytotoxic cluster, TC1, showed slightly decreased LTR expression, and the expanding cytotoxic T cells, TC2, showed decreased SINE expression. On the other hand, the cytotoxic T cells also demonstrated an increased level of inflammatory cytokines and inflammaging gene signature scores. In addition, the NK cells displayed higher senescence and SASP scores in the supercentenarians while demonstrating decreased LINE and SINE expressions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs16">Supplementary Figs. 16</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs17">17</xref>). Overall, this result reveals inflammatory activity in cytotoxic T cells and increased senescence in the NK cells that is not associated with the activation of RTEs in supercentenarians. By contrast, the expression of RTEs is significantly reduced in most of the immune cell types in supercentenarians.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The role of RTEs in aging has been studied extensively but not in a systematic manner with large, non-cancerous human cohorts across RTE categories before this study. Current understanding of the relationship between RTEs and aging are largely conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> or in model organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> that might not apply to human due to intraspecies differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Moreover, the link of RTEs to aging in non-cancerous human cohorts has not been studied systematically in large cohorts.</p>
<p>We combined bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data to examine the relationship between RTE expression versus chronological and biological aging, demonstrating that chronological aging is not significantly linked with RTE reactivation. In this process, we discovered that LTR and LINE expressions are positively correlated with the BAR gene signature scores. However, in contrast, the SINE expression demonstrates an inverse correlation with BAR scores in the PBMC samples and no significant relationship in the WB. We suspect the absence of a positive correlation between BAR scores and SINE expression might be linked to the same discrepancy observed in the GSVA analysis, in which DNA repair pathways are upregulated in the groups of cases with high SINE and Alu expressions. This result suggests that reactivation of SINE, particularly Alu, might lead to DNA damage, a hallmark of aging. Although SINEs compose up to 13% of the human genome, and Alu elements make up the largest family of human mobile elements, Alu is not studied as extensively as L1 from the LINE class<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Therefore, this novel discovery requires further study to confirm the connection and elucidate the mechanism by which DNA repair might be linked to the derepression of SINE and Alu expressions. In contrast, the groups of cases with high LINE and LTR expressions have upregulation of the pathways related to the inflammatory response, which is in line with the previous findings from human and model organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases (ARDs) converge on inflammaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown RTE’s pathogenetic role in ARDs including neurodegenerative diseases through elevation of DNA damage and genome instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. SINE expression inversely correlated with the BAR signature scores in the PBMCs of osteoarthritis patients, while a positive correlation is observed in monocytes. Moreover, a discrepant upregulation of DNA repair pathways is seen in the osteoarthritis cohorts expressing higher level L2, ERV1, Alu, and MIR. With osteoarthritis being a typical ARD, our analysis provides insight into the relationship between aging and RTEs in an ARD state in comparison with that of non-ARD individuals.</p>
<p>The relationship between DNA methylation and expression of RTEs with age was also investigated in our study. The methylation levels of all three RTE classes decrease with chronological age in our analysis, and the RTE expression is in inverse correlation with the methylation level in LINE and LTR but not in SINE. RTE sequences are repressed via DNA methylation and heterochromatinization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. In the aging process, surveillance of transcriptional regulators such as SIRT6 wanes, leading to hypomethylation and heterochromatin reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. L1 has been identified to be repressed through DNA methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. However, SINE has been suggested to be predominantly regulated by histone modification, and loss of DNA methylation has little effect on the transcription of SINEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, as reflected in our analysis.</p>
<p>Expression microarray has been successfully employed to study the expression of RTEs43-45. However, the probe design of microarrays does not accommodate specifically to the repeIIve and interspersed nature of RTEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. To circumvent this issue, our analysis was conducted on the class and family levels but not subfamily levels of RTEs to retain enough probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) providing sufficient power for calculating the expression scores. We also supported our findings with scRNA-seq, particularly when investigating the association between RTE expression and chronological age, to circumvent the potential constraints posed by using microarray data. However, we are aware of the limitations imposed by using microarray in this study, particularly the low number of RTE probes in the expression microarray data. Although we included one recently published RNA-seq dataset to validate our microarray result, our study can be enriched with the advent of large RNA-seq cohorts for aging studies in the future.</p>
<p>Our exploration of multiple cell types based on a published PBMC scRNA-seq cohort unveiled plasma cell as the only cell type for which the expression of RTEs correlates with BAR signature scores. This matches a recent finding showing a late senescent-like phenotype marked by accumulation of TEs in plasma cells during pre-malignant stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Lastly, we explored a supercentenarian PBMC scRNA-seq cohort as a model for healthy aging and identified that RTE expression is generally decreased in supercentenarians. However, the BAR signature scores, particularly senescence and SASP scores, increased in the NK cells of supercentenarians compared to the normal-aged group, suggesting that immunosenescence is an important factor in aging.</p>

<title>Illumina HT12-v4 probes</title>
<p>The probe lists of Illumina Human HT-12 V3 (29431 probes) and V4 (33963) share 29311 probes in common, which is 99.6% of the list of V3. Therefore, we proceeded with HT-12 V4 probes throughout the analysis to cover all studies that used either V3 or V4. To identify the Illumina probes covering RTE regions, we first selected the Illumina Human HT-12 v4 probes covering intergenic or intronic regions, obtaining a list of 924 unique probes. We then overlapped these probe locations with RepeatMasker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> regions to acquire the probes covering RTE regions. In total, we could find 232 unique probes covering RTE regions.</p>

<p>For each of the curated gene sets, instead of looking at individual gene expressions, we used <italic>singscore</italic> (version 1.20.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, a method that scores gene signatures in single samples using rank-based statistics on their gene expression profiles, to calculate the gene set enrichment scores. We first compiled the microarray expression matrix for average expression values from RPM values using <italic>limma</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> package in R, then we used the <italic>rankGenes</italic> function from the <italic>singscore</italic> package to rank each gene sample-wise. Eventually, the <italic>multiScore</italic> function was used to calculate signature scores for all six gene sets at once.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed in R (version 4.3.0). Pearson correlation test was used to determine the r and <italic>P</italic> values in correlation analyses. For differential expression analysis, the Wilcoxon test is used to determine the significance. The threshold to determine significance is set at <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05.</p>

<title>Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA)</title>
<p>GSVA was performed using the <italic>GSVA</italic> package (version 1.48.3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> in R to compare the groups of low and high RTE expression groups. The gene lists were retrieved from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> by searching for “inflammatory” and “dna_repair” as keywords. We further removed pathways that ended with “_DN” (as for downregulated) or “_UP” (as for upregulated) to reduce repeat and confusion. Three repetitive gene sets were removed from our analysis (GOBP_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_ACUTE_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE, GOBP_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_CYTOKINE_PRODUCTION_INVOLVED_IN_INFLA MMATORY_RESPONSE, GOBP_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_ACUTE_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE_TO_ANTIGENIC_STIMULUS). The filtering process generated 50 gene sets for inflammatory response and 21 gene sets for DNA repair. To detect any alterations in gene expression, the log fold change threshold was kept low at |logFC| &gt; 0.1, and a significance threshold of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was set.</p>

<title>ScRNA-seq analysis workflow for RTEs</title>
<p>Two single-cell transcriptomic datasets of healthy human cohorts were adopted in this study (Supplementary Table 6). To obtain the RTE expression in single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, the scRNA-seq bam files were processed through scTE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> pipeline. More specifically, for each cell in each sample, the read counts for different classes and families of RTEs were generated using the scTE method. Subsequently, in each sample, we calculated the cumulative read counts for each RTE class per annotated cell type by adding the number of reads belonging to all the cells of each cell type. This resulted in pseudo-bulk read counts of RTE classes for different cell types in each sample.</p>
<p>In parallel, we also calculated the pseudo-bulk read counts for all genes per cell type in each sample using the genic read counts embedded in Seurat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> objects collected for the two scRNA-seq datasets that we employed in our study (Supplementary Table 6). Concatenating pseudo-bulk RTE and gene read counts, we performed Reads Per Million (RPM) normalization per cell type per sample. For each cell type, the denominator for RPM normalization was the cumulative counts of genes and RTE classes for that cell type.</p>
<p>To calculate the age-associated gene signature scores, we converted the scRNA-seq read counts to bulk RNA-seq read counts by summing up the number of reads of all cells of the same type for each gene. This resulted in a bulk RNA-seq gene count matrix from which we calculated each sample’s RPM values per gene. Next, the RPM matrix was provided to <italic>singscore</italic> to calculate gene signature scores. Lastly, we divided the samples into high vs low gene signature scores by using the median as the cut-off.</p>

<p>The research concentrated on African American individuals of low socioeconomic backgrounds who had undergone trauma, primarily recruited from Atlanta’s Grady Memorial Hospital between 2005 and 2007 (Charles F. Gillespie et al., 2009). Exclusion criteria comprised mental retardation, active psychosis, or inability to provide informed consent. With over 7,000 participants, mostly urban African Americans with low socioeconomic status, the GTP specifically targeted a demographic with a history of significant trauma. The study involved WB collection between 8 to 9 a.m. following overnight fasting. Whole genome expression profiles were generated for 398 subjects at the Max-Planck Institute using Illumina HT-12 v3.0 or v4.0 arrays, focusing on 359 subjects of self-reported African American ancestry aged between 16-78 years. The expression data is available under GSE58137 at the GEO public repository. The Institutional Review Boards of Emory University School of Medicine and Grady Memorial Hospital granted approval for all procedures in this study. Funding primarily came from the National Institutes of Mental Health (MH071537).</p>

<title>Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)</title>
<p>MESA is a study of subclinical cardiovascular disease and the factors that forecast its progression to clinically evident forms initiated in 2000. This comprehensive investigation involves 6,814 asymptomatic individuals aged 45-84, presenting a diverse demographic: 38% Caucasian, 28% African American, 22 percent Hispanic, and 12 percent Asian (primarily of Chinese descent). Enrolling 6,500 individuals evenly distributed across genders, the study targets those without clinical cardiovascular disease at the outset, representing four racial/ethnic groups from six US communities (Forsyth County, North Carolina; St. Paul, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Baltimore, Maryland; Los Angeles County, California). The study protocol has been approved by the institutional review boards of the six field centers: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and University of California - Los Angeles. Detailed information about the design of MESA can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://internal.mesa-nhlbi.org">https://internal.mesa-nhlbi.org</ext-link>, and the data is accessible under GSE56045 at GEO.</p>
<p>Blood samples were gathered to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells, from which monocytes were separated using anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody-coated magnetic beads. Flow cytometry analysis consistently demonstrated monocyte samples of over 90% purity across 18 specimens. The DNA and RNA were extracted simultaneously. RNA with integrity scores above 9.0 was chosen for global expression microarrays. Genome-wide expression analysis employed the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip and Illumina Bead Array Reader, following the Illumina expression protocol. Additionally, the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and HiScan reader were utilized for epigenome-wide methylation analysis, assigning individual samples to the BeadChips and chip positions using the same sampling scheme as for the expression BeadChips. Details for sample preparation, data processing and quality control were processed as demonstrated in the design paper (Diane Bild et al., 2002).

<title>Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA)</title>
<p>SATSA is a comprehensive exploration of aging variations using twins raised in different environments influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The study draws its data from the Swedish Twin Registry, a population-based national register encompassing twins born from 1886 to 2000. Additionally, the comprehensive assessment across biological, psychological, and social domains allows for the examination of patterns, predicting the onset of age-related health issues. Started in 1984, the study employed rigorous questionnaires every three years until 2010, engaging over 2,000 twins. In parallel, a subset of 861 individuals participated in eight in-person testing (IPT) sessions, encompassing health, cognition, and memory assessments. Notably, IPT9 and IPT10 introduced daily tracking of memory, emotions, and social interactions, providing valuable insights into short-term fluctuations and early indicators of declining health.</p>
<p>A total of 1,122 blood samples were collected at five time points spanning from 1992 to 2012. Across these five longitudinal waves, participant counts with 1 to 5 measurements were 99, 86, 90, 80, and 30, respectively. Phenotype data, encompassing chronological age, sex, and zygosity, were gathered through comprehensive questionnaires and physical testing at each sampling wave. Following the manufacturer’s protocol optimized for Illumina’s Infinium 450K assay, 200 ng of DNA was prepared for each sample. The bisulfite-converted DNA samples were then hybridized to the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips using Illumina’s Infinium HD protocol. This process allowed the measurement of DNA methylation levels for 485,512 CpGs in each sample. Following the quality control procedures described by Peters et al., 1,011 samples from 385 twins were retained after processing and quality control on the methylation data (Marjolein Peters et al., 2015).

<p>Blood samples (∼100 ml) were obtained via venous puncture in the morning (7–10 a.m.) after an overnight fast. Single-cell suspensions were isolated and underwent droplet-based massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing using the Chromium Single Cell 5 Reagent Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics). Processing involved sample demultiplexing, barcode handling, and cell counting using the Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics). Subsequent analysis utilized the Seurat R package (Butler et al., 2018), which identified 25 clusters representing primary immune cell populations. Notably, one sample (D18) was excluded from analysis due to its outlier status, identified by distinct clustering in the single-cell RNA sequencing analysis.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Yi-Ting Tsai and colleagues conducted a systematic analysis of the correlation between the expression of retrotransposable elements (RTEs) and aging, using publicly available transcriptional and methylome microarray datasets of blood cells from large human cohorts, as well as single-cell transcriptomics. Although DNA hypomethylation was associated with chronological age across all RTE biotypes, the authors did not find a correlation between the levels of RTE expression and chronological age. However, expression levels of LINEs and LTRs positively correlated with DNA demethylation, and inflammatory and senescence gene signatures, indicative of &quot;biological age&quot;. Gene set variation analysis showed that the inflammatory response is enriched in the samples expressing high levels of LINEs and LTRs. In summary, the study demonstrates that RTE expression correlates with &quot;biological&quot; rather than &quot;chronological&quot; aging.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The question the authors address is both relevant and important to the fields of aging and transposon biology.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>The authors introduced the analysis of RNA-seq data, addressing the key concerns raised by Reviewer #1 and myself. They also adopted more explicit terminology in their latest version, reducing ambiguity. The RNA-seq analysis demonstrating that the expression of different transposon groups is not associated with chronological aging is convincing, though, in my opinion, it still lacks granularity.</p>
<p>I have two minor points:</p>
<p>(1) Previously, I have mentioned the following:</p>
<p>&quot;The authors pool signals from RTEs by class or family, despite the fact that these groups include subfamilies and members with very different properties and harmful potentials. For example, while older subfamilies might be expressed through readthrough transcription, certain members of younger groups could be autonomously reactivated and cause inflammation... The aggregation of signals from different RTE biotypes may obscure potential reactivation of smaller groups or specific subfamilies.&quot;</p>
<p>The authors responded that they would lose statistical power by studying RTE subfamilies with limited microarray probes, which is a fair point. However, the suggested analysis could have been conducted using the RNA-seq data they explored in the second round of revision. Choosing not to leverage RNA-seq to increase the granularity of their analysis is a matter of choice. In my opinion, however, the authors could have acknowledged in the discussion that some smaller yet potentially influential RTE species may be masked by their global approach.</p>
<p>(2) Previously, I mentioned that 10x scRNA-seq is not ideal for analysing RTEs and requested a classical UMAP plot to visualize RTE expression across cell populations. The authors argued that they could only achieve sufficient statistical power by quantifying RTE classes through cumulative read counts for each cell type, which I accept. However, they divided cells into &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; BAR gene signature groups. I am surprised that the comparison of BAR signature expression between these groups was not presented using standard visualization methods commonly applied in scRNA-seq data analysis.</p>

<p>We will add one sentence addressing this in the Version of Record.</p>

<p>We thank Reviewer #1 for their constructive comments.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Tsai and Seymen et al. investigate associations between RTE expression and methylation and age and inflammation, using multiple public datasets. Compared to the previous round of review, the text of the manuscript has been polished and the phrasing of several findings has been made clearer and more precise. The authors also provided ample discussion to the prior reviewer comments in their rebuttal, including new analyses. All these changes are in the correct direction, however, I believe that part of the content of the rebuttal should be incorporated in the main text, for reasons that I will outline below.</p>
<p>Both reviewers found the reliance on microarray expression data to detract from the study. The authors argued that their choices are supported by existing publications which performed a similar quantification of TE expression using microarray data. It could still be argued that (as far as I can tell) Reichmann et al. used a substantially larger number of probes than this study, as a consequence of starting from different arrays, however, this is a minor point which the authors do not need to address. It is still undeniable that including the validation with RNA-seq data performed in the rebuttal would strengthen the manuscript. I especially believe that many readers would want to see this analysis be prominent in the manuscript, considering that both reviewers independently converged on the issue with microarray expression data. Personally, I would have included an RNA-seq dataset next to the microarray data in the main figures, however, I understand that this would require considerable restructuring and that placing RNAseq data besides array data might be misleading. Instead, I would ask that the authors include their rebuttal figures R1 and R2 as supplementary figures.</p>
<p>I would suggest introducing a new paragraph, between the section dedicated to expression data and the one dedicated to DNA methylation, mentioning the issues with microarray data (Some of which were mentioned by the reviewers and other which were mentioned by the authors in the discussion and introduction) to then introduce the validation with RNA-seq data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s understanding and detailed feedback. As suggested, Author response images 1 and 2 were added as supplementary figures to the manuscript, and one paragraph was added to the section investigating the correlation between RTE expression and chronological age. We have also added new descriptions to the introduction, discussion, and BAR analysis sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Author response image 3 is also a good addition and should be expanded to include the GTP and MESA study and possibly mentioned in the paragraph titled &quot;RTE expression positively correlates with BAR gene signature scores except for SINEs.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated Author response image 3 (now Author response image 1) to include GTP and MESA cohorts in the analysis. As shown in Author response image 1, except IFN-I and senescence scores on the MESA cohort that positively correlate with chronological ageing, the rest of the gene signatures display no positive correlation with chronological ageing.</p>
<p>Author response image 1 was originally created to separate the effect of chronological age and RTE expression on BAR gene signature scores. As it was meant to discriminate between BAR and chronological age, it doesn't provide additional information regarding the positive correlation between RTE expression and BAR gene signature that was not already present in the manuscript. Therefore, we did not add it to the manuscript.</p>

<title>Generalized linear models (GLM) analysis (BAR gene signature scores ~ RTE expression +chronological age).</title>
<p>For each RTE family, we separately performed GLM. Age (RTE family) indicates the chronological age when used in the design formula for that specific RTE family.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;In this study, we did not compare MESA with GTP etc. We have analysed each dataset separately based on the available data for that dataset. Therefore, sacrificing one analysis because of the lack of information from the other does not make sense. We would do that if we were after comparing different datasets. Moreover, the datasets are not comparable because they were collected from different types of blood samples.&quot;</p>
<p>Indeed, the datasets are not compared directly, but the associations between age, BER and TE expression for each dataset are plotted and discussed right next to each other. It is therefore natural to wonder if the differences between datasets are due to differences in the type of blood sample or if they are a consequence of the different probe sets. Using a common set of probes would help answer that question.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand that the reviewer is proposing a method to eliminate the possible causes of differences across datasets. However, incorporating such change would compromise the statistic power of MESA and GARP cohorts and also change our analysis structurally and digress from our main focus. Hence, we disagree to use the identical set of probes for all three cohorts.</p>
