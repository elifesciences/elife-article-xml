<title>Abstract</title><p>Asthenoteratozoospermia, a prevalent cause of male infertility, lacks a well-defined etiology. DNAH12 is a special dynein featured by the absence of a microtubule-binding domain, however, its functions in spermatogenesis remain largely unknown. Through comprehensive genetic analyses involving whole-exome sequencing and subsequent Sanger sequencing on infertile patients and fertile controls from six distinct families, we unveiled six biallelic mutations in <italic>DNAH12</italic> that co-segregate recessively with male infertility in the studied families. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed pronounced axonemal abnormalities, including inner dynein arms (IDAs) impairment and central pair (CP) loss in sperm flagella of the patients. Mouse models (<italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Dnah12<sup>mut/mut</sup></italic>) were generated and recapitulated the reproductive defects in the patients. Noteworthy, DNAH12 deficiency did not show effects on cilium organization and function. Mechanistically, DNAH12 was confirmed to interact with two other IDA components DNALI1 and DNAH1, while disruption of DNAH12 leads to failed recruitment of DNALI1 and DNAH1 to IDAs and compromised sperm development. Furthermore, DNAH12 also interacts with radial spoke head proteins RSPH1, RSPH9, and DNAJB13 to regulate CP stability. Moreover, the infertility of <italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice could be overcome by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. Collectively, DNAH12 plays a crucial role in the proper organization of axoneme in sperm flagella, but not cilia, by recruiting DNAH1 and DNALI1 in both humans and mice. These findings expand our comprehension of dynein component assembly in flagella and cilia and provide a valuable marker for genetic counseling and diagnosis of asthenoteratozoospermia in clinical practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infertility has emerged as a global health concern, impacting around 8-12% of couples during their reproductive years, approximately 50% of infertility cases are attributed to male factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Among these, asthenoteratozoospermia, characterized by poor sperm motility and notable morphological abnormalities, stands out as a prevalent contributor to male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Recent investigations have unveiled a multitude of gene mutations associated with asthenoteratozoospermia and male infertility, including Dynein Axonemal Heavy Chain (DNAH) inner dynein arm (IDA) genes like <italic>DNAH1, DNAH2, DNAH6, DNAH7,</italic> and <italic>DNAH10</italic>, as well as outer dynein arm (ODA) genes such as <italic>DNAH8</italic> and <italic>DNAH17</italic>, all implicated in primary male infertility with asthenoteratozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Additionally, genes encoding cilia and flagella-associated proteins (CFAP), including <italic>CFAP43</italic>, <italic>CFAP44</italic>, <italic>CFAP57</italic>, and <italic>CFAP61</italic>, have been identified as linked to asthenoteratozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Despite these advances, the intricate and heterogeneous features of asthenoteratozoospermia leave a significant number of cases unexplained. It is anticipated that additional genetic factors play a role in sperm anomalies and dysfunction.</p>
<p>The axoneme, a fundamental structure of cilia and flagella, exhibits a well-organized pattern with nine peripheral doublet microtubules (DMTs) and a central pair of microtubules (CP), constituting the classical “9+2” microtubular arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). In motile cilia or flagella, the radial spoke (RS) head contacts the CP accessory structures, transmitting mechanical and chemical signals from the central microtubules to the axonemal dynein arms, thus coordinating the flagellar or ciliary movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Within mammalian species, the DNAH family plays a crucial role in the axonemal structure, encompassing eight IDA members (DNAH1-3, DNAH6, DNAH7, DNAH10, DNAH12, DNAH14) and five ODA members (DNAH5, DNAH8, DNAH9, DNAH11, DNAH17). Despite the collaborative effort of IDAs and ODAs in generating the force necessary for flagellar and ciliary motion, they serve distinct functions. Chlamydomonas ODAs, composed of α, β, and γ chains, primarily regulate beat frequency, while IDAs, with seven major subspecies (a-g), contribute to bending formation and beating form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Mutations in genes encoding ODA or IDA components have been linked to asthenoteratozoospermia, with or without symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by chronic airway infections or situs inversus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Notably, deficiency in certain IDAs and ODAs coding genes, such as <italic>DNAH7</italic> or <italic>DNAH11</italic>, may lead to PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Patients carrying mutations in <italic>DNAH1</italic> and <italic>DNAH2</italic> typically lack PCD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), although a study suggested the potential contribution of the DNAH1 p.Lys1154Gln mutation to PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The extensive genetic heterogeneity and clinical variabilities underscore the intricacy and uniqueness of dynein arms in flagella and cilia. However, the susceptibility of uncharacterized dynein factors that related to asthenoteratozoospermia and/or PCD remains unclear, given the absence of human genetic evidence or corresponding animal models.</p>
<p>Dynein axonemal heavy chain 12, DNAH12 (MIM: 603340, GenBank: NM_001366028.2), also known as DHC3, is a unique dynein arm component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Notably, it is the shortest member and lacks a typical microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) in the DNAH family. Mutations of <italic>DNAH12</italic> have been predicted to be associated with male patients’ infertility, however, limited pathogenic evidence was provided, and the underlying pathogenesis remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Besides, although DNAH12 has been identified as a possible axonemal dynein and its mRNA is predominantly detected in two tissues containing axonemal structures: trachea and testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), its physiological functions remain largely elusive.</p>
<p>In this study, we enrolled 796 infertile patients from unrelated Pakistani and Chinese families diagnosed with asthenozoospermia. Utilizing whole-exome sequencing (WES) followed by Sanger sequencing, we identified six novel bi-allelic mutations in <italic>DNAH12</italic> in infertile males from six unrelated families. All these mutations resulted in the loss of DNAH12 protein in the sperm of patients. Two mouse models, <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic>and <italic>Dnah12<sup>mut/mut</sup></italic>, were generated and exhibited asthenoteratozoospermia and male infertility, mimicking our patients’ phenotypes. Deficiency in DNAH12 led to axoneme defects characterized by impaired IDAs and CP loss in sperm flagella, while no such defects were observed in cilia. DNAH12 interacts with other IDA components like DNALI1 and DNAH1 in mouse testes, and disruption of DNAH12 impaired the recruitment of dynein components into sperm flagella. Our findings unveil, for the first time, that DNAH12 plays a pivotal role in facilitating the recruitment of IDA components specifically in flagella, but not in cilia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bi-allelic mutations in <italic>DNAH12</italic> are identified as causative factors for asthenoteratozoospermia and male infertility in both humans and mice. These results enhance our understanding of the development of axonemal structures in flagella versus cilia and provide valuable clues for genetic counseling and future individualized treatment for infertile males carrying <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutations in clinical practice.</p>

<title>Human subjects</title>
<p>Informed consent and peripheral blood were obtained from the participants and the patients’ information was registered in the Human Reproductive Disease Resource Bank database. Sperm analyses were performed according to the WHO guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). During their medical consultation, all patients answered a questionnaire regarding clinical presentations. This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) with the approval number 2019-KY-168.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Whole exome sequencing (WES) and bioinformatics analyses</title>
<p>Whole-exome capture and sequencing were performed by capturing exons from genomic DNAs of peripheral blood cells, using the SureSelect XT 50 Mb Exon Capture Kit (Agilent, California, USA), and then high-throughput sequencing was conducted on the HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following instructions. Variants were called using the Genome Analysis Toolkit HaplotypeCaller and annotated through ANNOVAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Variants within exons or exon-intron boundaries were retained and filtered through the criteria we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Bcftools was applied to detect runs of homozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Runs of homozygosity over 1.5 Mb were used to calculate the inbreeding coefficients. The genotypes were validated using Sanger sequencing validation. Additional primers are listed in Supplemental Table 1. For phylogenetic analysis, different DNAH12 protein sequences were extracted from the UniProt database, and the sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction were generated using MEGA11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Newick format tree files were extracted and processed in the Evolview v2 tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). For gene family and conserved domain analyses, the batch sequence search tool in Pfam was used to analyze features of proteins and further visualized with the assistance of Evolview v2 tool and TBtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). For protein structure analysis, the structure models were predicted and constructed with the Phyre2 tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), interactions were analyzed by the HDOCK (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hdock.phys.hust.edu.cn/">http://hdock.phys.hust.edu.cn/</ext-link>) and Alphafold3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://golgi.sandbox.google.com/">https://golgi.sandbox.google.com/</ext-link>). The predicted protein structures and possible interactions were further explored and visualized by UCSF Chimera (Version: 1.15, California, USA) according to the manual instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).</p>

<title>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)</title>
<p>Fresh semen samples were obtained and centrifuged at 900 g for 3 min. Spermatozoa were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) three times. Then the sediment was fixed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 8% glutaraldehyde, and 0.2% picric acid at 4°C for at least 8 hours. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were then conducted as we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Generation and verification of the polyclonal anti-DNAH12 antibody</title>
<p>The characteristics of the DNAH12 were analyzed and the 1-200 amino acids sequence of mouse DNAH12 protein (UniProt accession no. Q69Z23) was regarded as the ideal antigen for immunization. Subsequently, the DNAH12 polyclonal antibody was generated in rabbits and rats using the mentioned peptide by Dia-An Biotech, Inc., in Wuhan, China. The specificity of antibodies was further validated using <italic>Dnah12<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Protein lysate was prepared as we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Tissues or cells were lysed using lysis buffer (50 mM tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% NP-40). For human sperm cells, proteins were extracted using the TRIzol reagent. The protein sediment was washed with 95% ethanol containing 0.3M guanidine hydrochloride, dissolved in 1% SDS. Then the protein lysate was boiled for 10 minutes, and diluted in SDS-sample buffer (120 mM Tris/HCl, 10% SDS, 20% glycerol, 20% 2-mercaptoethanol, and bromophenol blue (pH 6.8). Whereafter the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose blotting membranes with a pore size of 0.45 μm (GE Healthcare, 10600002). The membranes were blocked with TBS-Tween buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Tween-20, pH 7.4) containing 5% skim milk for 30 minutes to reduce unspecific binding and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBST buffer containing 5% skim milk at 4°C overnight. Incubation with secondary antibodies for 1.5 hours was followed by chemiluminescence development system (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, USA). Antibodies details are listed in Supplemental Table 2-3.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Immunofluorescence (IF) staining</title>
<p>Human semen smear slides were prepared following the guidelines of WHO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Mouse sperm smear slide preparation and immunofluorescence staining were conducted as we described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). For tissue IF staining, tissues were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), the 5μm tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 70%, and 50% ethanol) and sterile water, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30min. Antigen retrieval was then conducted by boiling slides in a microwave for 30 minutes in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0). The other steps are consistent with sperm IF staining. Images of spermatozoa were captured using a Nikon ECLIPSE 80i microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Information of antibodies is available in Supplemental Table 2-3.</p>

<title>Animal models and fertility test</title>
<p>Two mouse models (<italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Dnah12<sup>mut/mut</sup></italic>) were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 Technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Briefly, to generate the <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse model, guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting exon 5 of <italic>Dnah12</italic>, a key exon shared by all its transcripts, were transcribed in vitro (Thermo Fisher, CA, USA). Then, the gRNAs and the Cas9 protein were electroporated into C57BL/6 mouse zygotes. The zygotes were introduced into ICR female mice, and the genotypes of the pups were checked using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with designed primers. Similar conductions were performed targeting exon 18 of <italic>Dnah12</italic> to generate the <italic>Dnah12<sup>mut/mut</sup></italic> mice. The genotyping primers are listed in Supplemental Table 1. For male fertility test, each 8-10 weeks male mouse was caged with wild-type female mice; for female fertility test, each 8-10 weeks female mouse was caged with one 8-10 weeks <italic>Dnah12<sup>+/-</sup></italic> male mouse, the number of offspring was recorded.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>Reverse-transcription PCR and real-time quantitative PCR</title>
<p>For reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), total RNA was extracted from mouse tissues using TRIzol reagent (TAKARA, Japan). Whereafter 1μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TAKARA, Japan). The cDNA was diluted to a comparable concentration and then used for RT–PCR. All amplified DNA fragments were visualized by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis containing GelRed (APExBIO, Houston, TX, USA). For real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), the experiments were performed by using Hieff UNICON® Universal Blue qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix reagent (Yeasen Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) on CFX96® Real-Time System (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Details of the primers were listed in Supplemental Table 1.</p>

<title>Histological analysis</title>
<p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), after sacrificing mice, the testes, epididymides, tracheas, and oviducts were harvested and fixed in Bouin’s fixative solution (Sigma–Aldrich, Missouri, USA) for hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining or 4% PFA fixative solution for immunofluorescence or TUNEL assay. The pictures were captured using a microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), H&amp;E staining or Papanicolaou staining kit (Solabio, Beijing, China) was used for the evaluation of sperm morphology of patients. For mouse sperm parameters analysis, 8-10-week-old mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the sperm number per epididymis was then assessed by cutting the epididymis into pieces in PBS and incubating them for 30 minutes at 37°C to release the sperm, then counting with a hemocytometer. Sperm motility were assessed by computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) as we described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Sperm morphology was assessed on sperms collected from epididymal cauda after H&amp;E staining.</p>

<title>Testicular cell smear slides and seminiferous tubule squash slides preparation</title>
<p>To prepare testicular cell smears, mice were sacrificed and testes were then detached with one time of PBS washing. Then testes were peeled off the testicular capsule, torn into small pieces, and then cut into tiny pieces in PBS. Finally, the cell suspension was filtered through a 200-mesh cell strainer, the filtered cell suspensions were added 10% FBS before spread onto glass slides. For testicular seminiferous tubule squash slide preparation, the testes were dissected and carefully isolated into single testicular seminiferous tubules in PBS dishes. After 10 mins of prefixation in fix/lysis solution (2% PFA, 50% PBS), we then applied 100μL fix/lysis solution onto poly-L-lysine coated glass slides and carefully teased apart approximately 20 seminiferous tubules with the assistance of 2 sterile forceps on the slides. After that, coverslips were applied using slide forceps and pressed with the heel of the palm for 10 seconds, then the glass slides were frozen in a small container with liquid N<sub>2</sub> immediately till the liquid ceases to bubble. The slides were saved in the −80°C fridge keeping the coverslip on the slides or removing coverslips for immunofluorescence staining.</p>

<title>Identification of biallelic <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants in men with asthenoteratozoospermia</title>
<p>To identify the genetic factors contributing to male infertility, we recruited patients with primary infertility and their family members from Pakistan and China. WES was performed on these individuals, followed by comprehensive analyses of the WES data (Supplemental Figure 1, A-D). Seven mutations in <italic>DNAH12</italic> were identified as potential pathogenic factors for male infertility in patients P1-3 of family 1, P4-5 of family 2, P8 of family 3, and P9, P10, and P11, all of whom suffered from asthenoteratozoospermia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Initially, a homozygous frameshift mutation c.944_945 del (p. Phe315*) in family 1, and two homozygous missense mutations, c. A164G (p. Gln55Arg) in family 2 and c. A2560G (p. Ile854Val) in family 3, were identified in <italic>DNAH12</italic> as potential causes of infertility. Subsequently, four other mutations in <italic>DNAH12</italic> were discovered in three sporadic Chinese patients with asthenoteratozoospermia: a homozygous stop-gain mutation c.2680 C&gt;T (p. Gln2077*) in subject P9, a homozygous missense mutation c.2813T&gt;C (p. Val938Ala) in P10, and compound heterozygous mutations c.2680C&gt;T (p. Arg894Cys) and c.5964-3A&gt;G in P11 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>).</p>

<p>All seven variants were rare in public human genome databases, including the 1000 Genome Project and gnomAD (v3). Additionally, these variants were predicted to be deleterious by in-silico software tools such as SIFT, Polyphen2, fathmm-MKL, and CADD2 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Sanger Sequencing further validated these variants and revealed the recessive pathogenic pattern of these mutations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Collectively, these results suggested that the identified bi-allelic <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants could potentially be the cause of asthenoteratozoospermia in our patients.</p>

<title>DNAH12 protein is conserved in mammals and highly expressed in the testes</title>
<p><italic>DNAH12</italic> encodes a functionally uncharacterized protein and is predicted to be abundantly expressed in testes of humans and mice based on our bioinformatics tool FertilityOnline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Experimentally, our RT-PCR, qPCR, and immunoblotting detection of DNAH12 expression in different tissues indicated that both DNAH12 mRNA and protein showed high expression in testes and relatively lower expression in lungs and tracheas of male mice and oviducts of female mice (Supplemental Figure 2, A-C). It’s worth noting that in epididymides, DNAH12 protein, but not mRNA, was detected, indicating the DNAH12 protein detected in epididymides is from testes, most probably from sperm. Furthermore, DNAH12 protein was initially detected in testes around 21 days postpartum (dpp) and thereafter maintained a high level (Supplemental Figure 2D). The expression pattern of DNAH12 in testes suggests that it is possibly involved in spermiogenesis, and its abnormal expression could lead to asthenozoospermia or asthenoteratozoospermia, further indicating that the identified <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutations are candidate pathogenic mutations for patients.</p>
<p>Further phylogenetic analysis revealed the conservative nature of DNAH12 from Chlamydomonas to humans (Supplemental Figure 3). All the amino acids affected by mutations were conserved in mammals and were located in functional regions, including the ATPase domains or the Stem domain of DNAH12 <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>), indicating that these mutations are highly likely to hinder the structure, function, or stability of the DNAH12 protein. Altogether, our results suggested that the identified mutations in <italic>DNAH12</italic> are probable pathogenic factors contributing to asthenoteratozoospermia in our patients.</p>

<title>Impaired sperm motility and morphology in patients with bi-allelic <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants</title>
<p>To assess the pathological effects of the identified bi-allelic <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants, semen analyses were conducted following WHO guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). All affected individuals exhibited significantly reduced sperm motility and progressive motility (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Detailed sperm morphology analyses were performed on patients P3 from family 1, P5 from family 2, P8 from family 3, and three Chinese sporadic patients (P9, P10, and P11). Spermatozoa from fertile controls displayed normal heads and tails, while spermatozoa from the patients exhibited a range of abnormal morphologies, including short, coiled, absent, bent, or irregular caliber flagella, accompanied by aberrant heads (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, Supplemental Figure 4, A and B). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were further carried out on a fertile control and P10, confirming the presence of abnormal morphologies of the sperm head and flagellum in the patients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Thus, patients with the bi-allelic <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants demonstrated significantly decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal sperm morphology.</p>

<title>The bi-allelic <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants result in absence of DNAH12 protein in patients’ sperm</title>
<p>To investigate the effects of the identified bi-allelic <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants on the DNAH12 protein, we obtained sperm samples from three affected Chinese patients, and the expression of DNAH12 was detected using a custom-made DNAH12 rabbit antibody that recognized the N-terminal 1-200 amino acids of the DNAH12 protein. This validated antibody (Supplemental Figure 6B) could theoretically detect the truncated protein if it were present in P9 with a homozygous stop-gain mutation M4 (p. Gln2077*). The predicted DNAH12 protein size was detected in the sperm lysate from a fertile control but not in P9 with the homozygous stop-gain mutation M4, P10 with a homozygous missense mutation M5, and P11 with compound heterozygous mutations M6 and M7, indicating these mutations possibly lead to the disruption of the DNAH12 protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>To further explore the effects of the identified <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants on the DNAH12 protein, we performed immunofluorescence assays on sperm from patients. The results showed that DNAH12 signals were localized along the flagella of the fertile control, however, no DNAH12 signals were observed in sperm flagella of patients P3 (family 1), P5 (family 2), P8 (family 3), P9, P10, and P11 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicated that all the detected <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants cause the absence of DNAH12 protein in the sperm of our patients, reinforcing that these <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutations are pathogenic mutations of asthenoteratozoospermia in the patients.</p>

<title>Patients with bi-allelic <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants exhibit flagellar axoneme defects</title>
<p>Since patients with the bi-allelic <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants exhibited compromised sperm motility and abnormal sperm morphology, we then investigated whether sperm flagellar ultrastructure was also affected in these patients. TEM examination was performed on sperm flagella from both patients and normal fertile controls. The flagella of fertile controls displayed the typical “9+2” microtubule structure with well-organized DMTs and CP. In contrast, various defects were found in our patients, including loss of CP (54.5%), disorganization of microtubules (26%), and absence of DMTs (16.5%) in the examined cross-sections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, 3C</xref> and Supplemental Figure 5A). To examine the IDAs impairment in axonemes, the sections with intact ODAs were analyzed. Compared with axonemes in controls that almost all the sections presented intact IDAs, approximately 70% of sections examined showed impaired IDA structures in the analyzed three patients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, 3D</xref> and Supplemental Figure 5A).</p>

<p>We then performed immunofluorescence assays on sperm smears to assess the expression and localization of specific proteins of the axonemes. These included SPAG6 (a CP component), DNAH1 and DNALI1 (IDA components), DNAH17 (an ODA component), and ODF2 (an outer dense fiber, ODF component). The sperm flagella of patients showed remarkably reduced SPAG6 signals when compared with those from controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Similarly, DNAH1 and DNALI1 signals were both obviously decreased in the patients’ sperm flagella, indicating impaired IDAs in the patients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Besides, DNAH17 and ODF2 signals in patients’ flagella were comparable to those in a normal control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref> and Supplemental Figure 5B). In summary, these findings indicated that the bi-allelic <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants cause pronounced flagellar axoneme defects, including impaired IDAs and loss of CP, but do not affect ODAs and ODFs.</p>

Additionally, TUNEL assays of testis sections showed dramatically increased proportions of seminiferous tubules containing TUNEL-positive cells in <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, compared with those in <italic>Dnah12<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice, suggesting the aberrant spermatids may undergo apoptosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K-M</xref>). Altogether, these results indicated that deletion of <italic>Dnah12</italic> impairs spermiogenesis, results in decreased sperm counts, and increased sperm morphological abnormalities in mice.</p>

Immunoblotting was performed to assess the expression levels of DNAH1, DNALI1, and SPAG6 in sperm lysates, <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic>sperm showed a significant reduction in the abundance of DNAH1 and DNALI1, while the amount of DNAI2 (a component of ODAs) remained comparable to <italic>Dnah12<sup>+/+</sup></italic>and <italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>+/<italic>-</italic></sup> sperm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Additionally, immunofluorescence assays revealed the near absence of signals for SPAG6, SPEF2 (a component of CP complex), DNAH1, and DNALI1 in <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic> sperm flagella, whereas DNAH17 and DNAI2 (components of ODAs) remained unaffected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-H</xref>). These results indicate that DNAH12 deficiency specifically impairs CP and IDAs, but not ODAs, in sperm flagella. Furthermore, immunoblotting of SPAG6 and DNALI1 in testis lysate exhibited a sharp decrease in <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (Supplemental Figure 9A). Additionally, TEM examination of testicular sperm axonemes showed defects like loss of CP and disarranged axonemes in <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (Supplemental Figure 9B). These results indicate that impaired IDAs and loss of CP possibly occur during testicular sperm flagellar development.</p>

<p>Another <italic>Dnah12</italic> mutant mouse model (<italic>Dnah12<sup>mut/mut</sup></italic>) targeting exon18 was also generated (Supplemental Figure 10A), which may produce a truncated DNAH12 protein (p.Cys793Glu, fs*10). The mutation effect was checked but no truncated DNAH12 protein was detected, indicating that DNAH12 expression was disrupted in <italic>Dnah12<sup>mut/mut</sup></italic> mice (Supplemental Figure 10B). Moreover, <italic>Dnah12<sup>mut/mut</sup></italic> mice developed normally, while decreased testicular size was observed (Supplemental Figure 10, C and D).

<p>Given the detection of DNAH12 protein in the trachea and lung (Supplemental Figure 2, A-C), we also examined whether the deficiency of DNAH12 would cause PCD symptoms in males.

<title>DNAH12 interacts with IDA components DNAH1 and DNALI1</title>
<p>Through phylogenetic and domain analyses of DNAH family members, we found that DNAH12 is a distinctive IDA lacking the microtubule-binding domain (MTBD), which is crucial for ATP-sensitive microtubule binding and motor direction control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6A</xref>, Supplemental Figure 12). Therefore, DNAH12 likely collaborates with other members to carry out its functions. To delve into the molecular mechanism of DNAH12, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) followed by mass spectrometry analysis using a DNAH12 rabbit antibody in testicular lysate from adult <italic>Dnah12<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Gene ontology analysis showed that the potential interactors were mainly enriched in motor protein, actin binding, myosin and RNA binding proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The motor proteins were predominantly categorized into three groups: dynein, kinesin, and myosin protein members, interestingly, among these, dynein proteins such as DNAH1, DNALI1, DNAH1, DNAH3, and DNAH2 were annotated to be involved in IDA assembly, which is closely related to the defects found in <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). This piqued our interest to explore these proteins in detail. Besides the predominant enrichment of DNAH12 (top1), potential IDA interactors such as DNALI1 (top2), DNAH1 (top3), DNAH3 (top4), and DNAH2 (top5) were co-enriched in the candidate interacting dynein protein list (Supplemental Table 5).

<p>Given the potential role of DNALI1 as an IDA assembly factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), we delved into the interaction details between DNAH12 and DNALI1. Employing Phyre2, we constructed the structural models of both proteins and further elucidated their interaction dynamics via DNAH12-DNALI1 docking using the HDOCK server. The results showed that the N-terminal Stem domain of DNAH12 possibly interacts with DNALI1 in the top three best-fit conformations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Considering DNAH12 is encoded by 3092 amino acids and their full-length protein interactions have been proved in vivo, we constructed the Stem domain (1-1212 amino acids) of DNAH12 and full-length DNALI1 plasmid, further in vitro Co-IP assays validated that the Stem domain of DNAH12 indeed mediates interactions with DNALI1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>-J). Together, these findings proved the specific interactions among DNAH12, DNALI1, and DNAH1. Given the significantly decreased protein levels of DNALI1 and DNAH1 observed in the sperm of <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5B</xref>), we proposed that the interactions involving DNAH12 (possibly restricted to the Stem domain of DNAH12), DNALI1, and DNAH1 are crucial for flagella development. As dynein proteins typically share similar domains, our findings also suggested that the Stem domain of DNAH family members may facilitate the interaction with DNALI1.</p>

<title>Deletion of DNAH12 impairs the recruitment of IDA components during flagella development</title>
<p>To evaluate the effect of DNAH12 deletion on DNALI1 and DNAH1 during spermiogenesis, we examined the abundance of the DNAH12 interaction partners, DNALI1 and DNAH1, in <italic>Dnah12<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse testis lysate. The protein levels of DNALI1 and DNAH1 were decreased in <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic>testes, while the level of ODA member DNAI1 was comparable (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>).

Although the signals of DNALI1 or DNAH1 in round spermatids of <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were comparable to those of <italic>Dnah12<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>), the recruitment of DNALI1 and DNAH1 to sperm flagella was severely impaired in elongated spermatids of <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7D</xref> and 7E). Considering that the deficiency of DNAH12 also caused scarcely visible immunofluorescence signals of DNALI1 and DNAH1 in sperm flagella of humans and mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>, and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>), we proposed that the interaction among DNAH12, DNALI1, and DNAH1 is conserved in mammals, and is required for flagellar development during spermiogenesis. Since the deficiency of DNAH12 does not cause PCD symptoms in humans and mice, we hypothesized that flagella and cilia may exhibit distinct features in the process of dynein assembly. We thus checked the abundance of DNALI1 and DNAH1 in the oviduct and trachea, the results showed that DNALI1 and DNAH1 were comparable in the <italic>Dnah12<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic> groups (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7G</xref>). Furthermore, no discernible disparities were observed in the intensity and localization of DNALI1 and DNAH1 signals within the oviduct and trachea (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H-K</xref>). In summary, these results underscore the specific involvement of DNAH12 in flagellar development, rather than in cilial development. Moreover, we supposed that the assembly of IDA components differs between flagella and cilia.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified six novel bi-allelic mutations in <italic>DNAH12</italic> that cause the loss of DNAH12 proteins in asthenoteratozoospermia patients. Spermatozoa from these patients exhibited abnormal morphology and compromised axonemal defects, including a high percentage of impaired IDAs and loss of CP. Two mouse models (<italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup> and Dnah12<sup>mut/mut</sup></italic>) were generated, recapitulating the abnormal flagellum morphology and structure observed in patients, thereby confirming the pathogenic role of <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutations in asthenoteratozoospermia. Through testicular Co-IP and mass spectrometry proteomics, we screened and validated that DNAH12 interacts with IDA components like DNALI1 and DNAH1 and is indispensable for recruiting DNALI1 and DNAH1 to sperm flagella, highlighting the crucial role of DNAH12 in sperm flagellar development. Notably, deficiency of DNAH12 does not manifest PCD symptoms in humans and mice, underscoring the unique role of DNAH12 in flagellar development. Collectively, our study not only unveils the functional significance of the previously unexplored gene <italic>DNAH12</italic> but also elucidates the pathogenic link between <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutations and asthenoteratozoospermia.</p>
<p>DNAH12 and other dynein arm proteins share the N-terminal Stem domain, which is crucial for structure and accessory subunit binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), and the motor domain which encompasses ∼6 AAA+ ATPase modules forming the ring-shaped oligomeric complexes responsible for force production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Five of the identified <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutations, primarily in the Stem domain (critical for DNALI1 interaction), result in loss-of-function effects, indicating a weak tolerance property of the Stem domain. Similar weak tolerance features were observed in mutations of other dynein arm components like <italic>DNAH1</italic> and <italic>DNAH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). The profound impact of these variants, particularly missense mutations, underscores delicate features of the Stem domain and DNAH family members. Notably, DNAH12 stands out as the shortest in sequence length and the only one lacking the essential MTBD domain within the DNAH family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). MTBD, a 15-nanometer coiled-coil stalk structure, crucially supports ATP-sensitive microtubule binding properties and determines dynein motility direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Our investigation revealed that DNAH12 interacts with other IDA components, specifically DNALI1 and DNAH1. Despite the mutual dependence between DNAH1 and DNALI1 for their flagellar localization, DNAH12 is prerequisite for the proper assembly of DNALI1 and DNAH1 onto sperm flagella in both humans and mice. Notably, <italic>Dnah12<sup>−/−</sup></italic>mice exhibit more severe phenotypes than <italic>Dnali1</italic> and <italic>Dnah1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>), including a more severe reduced sperm count (∼ 2% of normal values), this observation further supports our perspective.</p>
<p>Deficiency in DNAH12 presented sperm ultrastructural defects like CP loss and impaired IDAs indicating essential roles of DNAH12 in the maintenance of axonemal integrity and arrangement. These results indicate essential roles of DNAH12 in the maintenance of axonemal integrity and arrangement. Noteworthy, deficiency of DNAH12 potential partner DNAH1, a well-known asthenoteratozoospermia-related gene, presents quite similar defects with DNAH12, indicating DNAH12 and DNAH1 possibly exhibit synergic functions in axonemal proper arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). In addition to DNAH12 and DNAH1, deficiency in DNAH2 or DNAH6 also leads to high proportions of CP loss and disorganized axonemal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). However, DNALI1, DNAH7, or DNAH10 deficiency results in no obvious CP loss but impaired IDA integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). These studies indicate that specific IDA components, like DNAH12 and DNAH1, are required for the maintenance of CP integrity. Moreover, discrepancies observed in the phenotypes resulting from deficiencies in specific IDAs suggest that multiple dynein proteins are produced to support the intricate organization of sperm flagella. Additionally, these proteins may exhibit distinct characteristics and perform unique functions to some extent. Noteworthy, deficiency in RS head proteins RSPH1, RSPH9, or DNAJB13 were related to axonemal CP loss phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>), indicating that DNAH12, and other IDAs, possibly regulate the stability of CP through the cooperation with RS head proteins.</p>
<p>The localization of DNAH12 presents dynamic changes during spermiogenesis. DNAH12 is initially expressed in the cytoplasm of the round spermatid, while it’s enriched in the manchette structure of the elongating spermatid and the tail of the elongated spermatid. The manchette and the sperm tail axoneme are two microtubular platforms that transport proteins to the developing head and tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Manchette is a transient skirt-like structure and functions as a scaffold for morphological remodeling, contributing to the formation of the sperm head, neck, and tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Here, we found that DNAH12 deficiency results in abnormal manchette structure and compromised sperm head and tail morphology. Additionally, in sperm of <italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>−/−</sup> males, several CP complex proteins like SPAG6, and SPEF2 are not properly assembled and the axoneme structure of the tail was severely disorganized, indicating dynein components are responsible for proper axonemal components organization. Noteworthy, DNALI1, a potential DNAH12 interacting partner showed similar localization patterns to DNAH12, a study presented that DNALI1 recruits and stabilizes manchette component PACRG, and DNALI1 deficiency causes impaired sperm flagellar assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). These data hint that dynein proteins like DNAH12 and DNALI, possibly work together in the manchette organization as well as sperm flagellar components assembly during sperm development.</p>
<p>DNAH12 was also detected in the lungs, tracheas, and female oviducts while no cilia morphology defects in these tissues or PCD symptoms were observed in both two mice models. Besides, none of the patients carrying bi-allelic <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutations claimed symptoms of PCD via visits except for the reproductive problems. <italic>Dnah12<sup>-/</sup></italic><sup>-</sup> female mice showed normal development and fertility and the mother (III:2) of patients from family 2, carrying homozygous <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutation M2 had 6 offspring. Intriguingly, we found that the localization and abundance of DNALI1 and DNAH1 in oviductal or tracheal cilia were not affected after <italic>Dnah12</italic> deletion, indicating that DNAH12 works differently in flagella and cilia. Deficiency of specific DNAH members like DNAH6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>), or DNAH7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), but not DNAH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), results in PCD symptoms. Hence, DNAH family members possibly present disparate processing of axonemal biogenesis and organization through evolution in flagella and cilia, further explorations could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the differences between flagella and cilia, and personalized clinical diagnosis of related diseases like male/female infertility and/or PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>).</p>
<p>Previously, two genetic screening studies mentioned unverified compound heterozygous mutations and a homozygous missense mutation in <italic>DNAH12</italic>, predicting their association with patients’ infertility. However, limited genetic evidence was provided, and the pathogenesis remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Through investigations involving patients with <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants and mutant mouse models, we provide direct genetic and molecular evidence that variants in <italic>DNAH12</italic> are genetic causes of asthenoteratozoospermia, and DNAH12 along with DNAH1, DNALI1 is indispensable for sperm flagellar biogenesis. These data strongly support DNAH12 as a valuable marker in genetic counseling and diagnosis of male infertility.</p>
<p>ICSI is a widely used assisted reproductive technology in treating infertile men with asthenoteratozoospermia. Deficiency in most dynein proteins leads to asthenoteratozoospermia with severely compromised sperm motility and morphology. Previous studies have shown that patients carrying mutations in <italic>DNAH17</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) have poor ICSI outcomes while patients with <italic>DNAH1</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), <italic>DNAH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), <italic>DNAH3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>), <italic>DNAH7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), or <italic>DNAH8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>) mutations have achieved favorable clinical pregnancy. Thus, the comparative study of asthenoteratozoospermia-related genes on their ICSI outcomes will be beneficial to developing individualized treatment recommendations in clinical practice. In our study, the successful ICSI outcomes of <italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice suggest that ICSI could be used as a potential treatment for infertile men carrying <italic>Dnah12</italic> mutations. It’s meaningful to evaluate the prognosis for ICSI treatments in patients carrying <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants in a large population.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study functionally and mechanistically sheds light on a special and poorly characterized protein DNAH12, during the intricate process of sperm flagellar biogenesis. These results pave the way for an enhanced understanding of the roles of dynein proteins in sperm flagellar development and their functional difference in flagella and cilia, offering a diagnostic target for genetic counseling and future individualized treatment of male infertility in clinical practice.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study further validates DNAH12 as a causative gene for asthenoteratozoospermia and male infertility in humans and mice. The data supporting the notion that DNAH12 is required for proper axonemal development are generally <bold>convincing</bold>, although more experiments would solidify the conclusions. This work will interest reproductive biologists working on spermatogenesis and sperm biology, as well as andrologists working on male fertility.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Even though this is not the first report that the mutation in the DNAH12 gene causes asthenoteratozoospermia, the current study explores the sperm phenotype in-depth. The authors show experimentally that the said mutation disrupts the proper axonemal arrangement and recruitment of DNALI1 and DNAH1 - proteins of inner dynein arms. Based on these results, the authors propose a functional model of DNAH12 in proper axonemal development. Lastly, the authors demonstrate that the male infertility caused by the studies mutation can be rescued by ICSI treatment at least in the mouse. This study furthers our understanding of male infertility caused by a mutation of axonemal protein DNAH12, and how this type of infertility can be overcome using assisted reproductive therapy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is an in-depth functional study, employing multiple, complementary methodologies to support the proposed working model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study strength could be increased by including more controls such as peptide blocking of the inhouse raised mouse and rat DNAH12 antibodies, and mass spectrometry of control IP with beads/IgG only to exclude non-specific binding. Objective quantifications of immunofluorescence images and WB seem to be missing. At least three technical replicates of western blotting of sperm and testis extracts could have been performed to demonstrate that the decrease of the signal intensity between WT and mutant was not caused by a methodological artifact.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors first conducted whole exome sequencing for infertile male patients and families where they co-segregated the biallelic mutations in the Dynein Axonemal Heavy Chain 12 (DNAH12) gene.</p>
<p>
Sperm from patients with biallelic DNAH12 mutations exhibited a wide range of morphological abnormalities in both tails and heads, reminiscing a prevalent cause of male infertility, asthenoteratozoospermia. To deepen the mechanistic understanding of DNAH12 in axonemal assembly, the authors generated two distinct DNAH12 knockout mouse lines via CRISPR/Cas9, both of which showed more severe phenotypes than observed in patients. Ultrastructural observations and biochemical studies revealed the requirement of DNAH12 in recruiting other axonemal proteins and that the lack of DNAH12 leads to the aberrant stretching in the manchette structure as early as stage XI-XII. At last, the authors proposed intracytoplasmic sperm injection as a potential measure to rescue patients with DNAH12 mutations, where the knockout sperm culminated in the blastocyst formation with a comparable ratio to that in WT.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors convincingly showed the importance of DNAH12 in assembling cilia and flagella in both human and mouse sperm. This study is not a mere enumeration of the phenotypes, but a strong substantiation of DNAH12's essentiality in spermiogenesis, especially in axonemal assembly.</p>
<p>The analyses conducted include basic sperm characterizations (concentration, motility), detailed morphological observations in both testes and sperm (electron microscopy, immunostaining, histology), and biochemical studies (co-immunoprecipitation, mass-spec, computational prediction). Molecular characterizations employing knockout animals and recombinant proteins beautifully proved the interactions with other axonemal proteins.</p>
<p>Many proteins participate in properly organizing flagella, but the exact understanding of the coordination is still far from conclusive. The present study gives the starting point to untangle the direct relationships and order of manifestation of those players underpinning spermatogenesis. Furthermore, comparing flagella and trachea provides a unique perspective that attracts evolutional perspectives.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Seemingly minor, but the discrepancies found in patients and genetically modified animals were not fully explained. For example, both knockout mice vastly reduced the count of sperm in the epididymis and the motility, while phenotypes in patients were rather milder. Addressing the differences in the roles that the orthologs play in spermatogenesis would deepen the comprehensive understanding of axonemal assembly.</p>
