<abstract><p>One of the central questions in neural development is how individual neurons assemble functional networks. To address this, it is essential to elucidate how coordinated activity emerges during development. However, tracking the functional maturation of neuronal populations over time remains challenging, as it requires long-term, non-invasive monitoring of membrane potential dynamics. Here, we developed a voltage imaging approach for zebrafish embryos using genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs), enabling fast, direct and cell-type-specific measurements of membrane potentials from defined neuronal populations in a non-invasive manner. Using this approach, we detected coordinated voltage changes in spinal motor neurons with high spatiotemporal resolution. Depolarization and hyperpolarization events were observed at the population, single-cell, and subcellular levels. Notably, long-term voltage imaging revealed the early emergence and progressive maturation of membrane potential dynamics, characterized by increased firing rate, coupling strength and axonal outgrowth. This optical approach constitutes a significant advancement in the study of neural development, providing a powerful tool for investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal populations in vivo.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The nervous system is composed of a vast number of neurons that perform diverse functions. How are these neurons generated and how do they communicate with each other to form functional networks? To better understand the function and development of the nervous system, it is crucial to examine the dynamic behavior of neuronal populations and how these dynamics evolve over time. However, such investigations are often hampered by the huge number of neurons involved and the invasiveness of conventional electrophysiological recording techniques.</p>
<p>Optical methods provide a powerful alternative, as light facilitates non-invasive access to large populations of neurons, which is difficult with electrophysiological recordings that insert electrodes into target tissues as single-point detectors. Voltage imaging enables fast, direct, and simultaneous detection of membrane potentials across multiple cells, providing an excellent system for understanding the dynamic behavior of neuronal populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Its high speed and directness allow the detection of action potentials, hyperpolarization, and subthreshold responses, which are difficult to examine using calcium imaging, partly because of the slow kinetics of the indicators and the dynamics of calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Various voltage-sensitive dyes have been developed to improve brightness, signal-to-noise ratio, and spectral range, thereby advancing our understanding of network dynamics in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. More recently, genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) have been developed, allowing for cell-type-specific voltage imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. These GEVIs include the ones based on voltage-sensitive phosphatase domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], as well as microbial rhodopsin-based sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Although GEVIs have been successfully applied to investigate brain and cardiac function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], their application to developmental studies of the nervous system remains limited. This is largely due to the technical challenges of achieving long-term, non-invasive voltage imaging in developing tissues.</p>
<p>One of the earliest neural structures to develop is the spinal cord, which serve as the core of rhythmic motor behaviors through central pattern generators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Neurons in the spinal cord, including motor neurons, exhibit prominent population activity even at early in development. This activity drives fetal movement and is suggested to play a critical role for circuit formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. While electrophysiological studies have characterized the firing properties of these neurons, the spatiotemporal organization and developmental emergence of their coordinated voltage dynamics, the core of the remain to be understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal populations and their emergence during development, we applied GEVI ArcLight to zebrafish embryos, taking advantage of their optical transparency, genetic tools, and rapid development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Although recent studies have employed GEVIs in zebrafish larvae primarily to explore circuit function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], long-term developmental imaging has not yet been achieved. Here, we establish a long-term voltage imaging approach that enables the observation of voltage dynamics in neuronal populations over the course of development. This approach allowed us to reveal how coordinated voltage activity emerge during early neural development.</p>

<p>Zebrafish embryos were paralyzed in 0.02% tricaine and mounted on 2% low melting-point agarose (Sigma-Aldrich).

<title>Voltage imaging</title>
<p>Embryos from 16 to 23 hpf were paralyzed with tubocurarine (0.5 mM, Sigma-Aldrich), with their tail tips cut for better penetration of tubocurarine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Then, embryos were mounted on 1.8% low melting-point agarose containing 0.1-0.2 mM tubocurarine. After embedding the embryos onto 1% agarose, an extracellular solution (134 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 2.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, and 10 mM glucose, adjusted to pH 7.8 with NaOH) containing 150 mM tubocurarine was added. The agarose around the tail was removed using a surgical blade to allow efficient transfer of the drug solution. For high-speed voltage imaging, a fluorescence microscope (FN-1, Nikon) equipped with a CMOS camera (ORCA-Flash4.0, Hamamatsu Photonics) was used with a 40×/0.8 NA water-immersion lens. For most recordings, a 0.7× relay lens (NIKON) was also used. Fluorescence images were acquired using NIS-Elements (Nikon) software at approximately 16-200 Hz. High-speed confocal scanning was performed using a confocal microscope (Nikon A1R) with a 25×/1.0 NA water-immersion lens. For drug treatment, tetrodotoxin (1 μM, TOCRIS) was added to the extracellular solution using a peristaltic pump (World Precision Instruments). A thermo plate was used to keep the recording chamber at 28°C (Tokai hit).</p>

<title>Image analysis</title>
<p>Images were analyzed using the NIS-Elements (Nikon), Fiji, and OriginPro (Lightstone) programs as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. To extract changes in fluorescence intensity, regions of interest (ROIs) were manually set using NIS-element software (Nikon). Normalized changes in fluorescence intensity in the target regions (ROIs) were quantitatively analyzed by calculating dF/F in the ROIs (dF/F<sub>0</sub>=[F<sub>(t)</sub>–F<sub>0</sub>]/F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>(t)</sub> and F<sub>0</sub> are the fluorescence intensities at a certain time point and initial time points, respectively). If the larvae/embryos moved during the voltage imaging, the images were aligned using a Fiji program (TurboReg plugin). Denoising and bleach corrections were also applied to some data using OriginPro (Lightstone). Cross-correlation and hierarchical clustering analyses were performed using OriginPro (Lightstone). The coupling rate was calculated as the ratio of the frequency of target cell activity to that of mature cells. Among depolarizing signals with small voltage changes, those characterized by a longer time to peak and a shorter decay time were defined as &quot;immature firing&quot; and were distinguished from other small depolarizations.</p>

<title>Establishment of voltage imaging using ArcLight zebrafish embryos</title>
<p>To investigate voltage dynamics of neuronal populations in neuronal populations during development, we established a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses ArcLight specifically in neurons. We first established the transgenic line Tg(<italic>UAS:ArcLight</italic>) using the GAL4-UAS and Tol2 transposon systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). To confirm ArcLight localization to cellular membranes in Tg(<italic>UAS:ArcLight</italic>) fish, we examined Tg(<italic>elavl3:GAL4-VP16;UAS:ArcLight;UAS:lyn-RFP</italic>) embryos, in which GAL4 is expressed in neurons and cellular membranes are labeled with Lyn-RFP.</p>

<p>At 1 dpf, ArcLight was widely observed in the neural tube and co-localized with Lyn-RFP, indicating proper membrane localization of ArcLight in neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b, c</xref>).</p>
<p>Spinal cord neurons exhibit spontaneous firing early in development, with coordinated activity of the neuronal populations beginning around 17 hpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Consistent with this, Tg(<italic>elavl3:GAL4-VP16;UAS:ArcLight</italic>) embryos displayed oscillatory changes in ArcLight fluorescence in the ventral spinal cord (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d–g</xref>, 0.14±0.10 Hz, 6 fish). Fluorescence fluctuations alternated between the left and right sides of the spinal cord, consistent with previous reports of periodic depolarization (PD) in spinal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. This activity was largely abolished following treatment with the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e-g</xref>). These results demonstrate that ArcLight can reliably detect spontaneous activity in developing spinal neurons.</p>
<p>We next examined whether ArcLight can resolve spinal voltage dynamics at both single-cell and population levels. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, oscillatory activity was clearly detected in individual neurons, with distinct amplitudes and temporal patterns among neighboring neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-c</xref>). Depolarizations typically propagated sequentially along the rostrocaudal axis. In addition to large depolarizations that closely resemble PD, small membrane potential fluctuations were also observed between the PDs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d arrowheads</xref>). Based on their size and timing, these may be synaptic bursts or subthreshold events, which are generally only captured by electrophysiological recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Cross-correlation analysis revealed strong positive correlations among ipsilateral neurons and negative correlations between contralateral pairs, indicating high synchrony within each side of the spinal cord (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Hierarchical clustering analysis also supported this synchrony with partially disordered activity along rostrocaudal axis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). The depolarization was confirmed by electrophysiological recordings (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig S1</xref>). To evaluate the strength of ArcLight voltage imaging, we performed spinal calcium imaging using Tg(<italic>elavl3:GCaMP6f</italic>) and compared its temporal resolution with ArcLight. Calcium imaging exhibited substantially lower temporal resolution and reduced variability in activity patterns (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig S1</xref>), highlighting the superior precision of the GEVI ArcLight in capturing neural population dynamics.</p>

<title>Single-cell voltage imaging reveals simultaneous voltage and morphological dynamics</title>
<p>Spinal circuits comprise diverse neuronal types with distinct distributions, morphologies, and physiological properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. To understand how these circuits develop, it is important to simultaneously monitor voltage dynamics and morphological changes. To achieve this, we used mosaic expression of ArcLight. By injecting <italic>UAS-ArcLight</italic> pDNA into Tg(<italic>elavl3:GAL4-VP16</italic>) fish, we sparsely labeled neurons, enabling high-resolution tracking of membrane potential changes and cellular morphology (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a–c</xref>, 20 hpf, PMNs). We also captured voltage dynamics from interneurons that are otherwise difficult to identify (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d, e</xref>). In addition to PD and synaptic burst (SB)-like activity, some neurons showed hyperpolarizing responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Over the course of one hour, we observed notable morphological changes in these neurons, suggesting active developmental remodeling (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Developmental changes in voltage dynamics of neuronal populations</title>
<p>Finally, we investigated the emergence and maturation of voltage dynamics during development. Periodic firing in the spinal cord drives coiling behavior, analogous to fetal movement in humans, which are thought to contribute to spinal circuit formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. This characteristic activity appears around 17 hpf and rapidly increases in frequency and amplitude until 20 hpf, followed by a gradual decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. However, how population-level coordinated activity arises during this process remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>To address this, we performed long-term voltage imaging of the spinal cord along the course of development (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). At 18 hpf, primary motor neurons (PMNs) possesses an axonal protrusion but seldom exhibited firing, instead showing small voltage fluctuations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, arrowheads, cell 1, located at somite 8). These fluctuations were observed in both soma and axons (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>) and displayed slower kinetics than mature firing (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). Over the next 30 minutes, PMNs gradually extended axons and increased firing frequency. By 19.5 hpf, the firing frequency reached ∼0.3 Hz (0.29±0.05 Hz). In addition to cell 1, PMN cell 2, located more caudally, showed slower axonal extension and began firing after 18.5 hpf, ultimately synchronizing with other neurons by 19.5 hpf (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Similar temporal maturation patterns were also observed in other PMNs with some variability (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). Quantitative analyses revealed that firing frequency and coordination increased in tandem with axonal extension (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a, b</xref>). In deede, the emergence of small depolarization and matured firing strongly correlated with morphological maturation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c, d</xref>). Moreover, coordination among PMNs also increased alongside the maturation of their individual voltage dynamics (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e, f</xref>). These data suggest a sequence in the emergence of coordinated activity in spinal neurons: (1) absence of depolarization, (2) small depolarizations, (3) irregularly coordinated activity, and (4) fully synchronized firing.</p>

<p>To further assess how spontaneous activity evolves later in development, we extended voltage imaging to 23 hpf. By this stage, the previously regular and rapid firing observed at 20 hpf had decreased (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>). Depolarization patterns also changed—bursts became longer and left–right alternation diminished (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). Cross-correlation analysis revealed that at 20 hpf, neurons on both sides of the spinal cord were highly synchronized and exhibited strong periodicity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). By 23 hpf, this coordination was largely diminished, although synchrony among ipsilateral neurons persisted. Notably, left–right alternating activity, which was prominent at 20–21 hpf, was markedly reduced at 23–24 hpf (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). These results suggest that while coordinated PMN activity declines during later stages of development, intra-hemispheric synchrony is maintained.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Understanding how neuronal populations generate coordinated activity during development is a central challenge in neuroscience. Electrophysiological recordings have historically provided valuable insights into the membrane dynamics of spinal neurons. However, these techniques are invasive and largely limited to short-duration and single-cell level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Calcium imaging has been used to examine developing circuits but lacks the temporal resolution and direct voltage sensitivity required to resolve fine membrane potential dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. In this context, genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) offer a promising alternative, providing direct, fast, and non-invasive readouts of membrane potential. While GEVIs have been applied in mature brain tissues and cardiac tissues, their application to vertebrate embryonic development has remained rare due to technical limitations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to achieve long-term voltage imaging of genetically defined neuronal populations in the spinal cord during development in a vertebrate model.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>High-resolution imaging of voltage and morphological dynamics</title>
<p>Subcellular compartments—such as dendrites axons, and filopodia—play essential roles in neuronal function, shaping synaptic integration and signal propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. In this study, ArcLight enabled voltage imaging not only at the soma, but also at proximal and distal axonal regions of primary motor neurons (PMNs). Notably, voltage fluctuations were also observed in filopodia, suggesting that even fine structures can exhibit membrane potential dynamics. Such fine-scale resolution opens opportunities to investigate the bioelectrical properties of neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and structural remodeling. Combining voltage imaging with ratiometric or dual-color imaging approaches may allow simultaneous measurement of voltage and morphological parameters at high spatiotemporal precision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>].</p>

<title>Long-term population-level voltage dynamics in the developing spinal cord</title>
<p>The zebrafish spinal cord possesses one of the earliest neuronal circuits to form during development, and its transparency makes it an ideal model for in vivo imaging. Using a newly generated ArcLight transgenic line, we visualized voltage dynamics in spinal neuron populations from early developmental stages. At 20 hpf, we detected left-right alternating depolarizations, consistent with periodic depolarizations (PDs) previously observed via electrophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Compared to calcium imaging or earlier voltage sensors like ASAP1, ArcLight offered superior temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. This enabled detection of not only suprathreshold PDs, but also subthreshold events and hyperpolarizations, capturing a wider dynamic range of neuronal activity. Importantly, ArcLight could resolve activity patterns at both the single-cell and population levels, providing a comprehensive picture of how spinal circuits operate and evolve during development.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Emergence of voltage dynamics in the spinal neuron populations</title>
<p>One of the significant findings of this study is the stepwise emergence of coordinated voltage dynamics in motor neurons, closely tied to their morphological maturation. By performing long-term voltage imaging from, we found that PMNs followed a developmental sequence: (1) absence of depolarization, (2) emergence of small voltage fluctuations, (3) irregular and weakly coordinated activity, and (4) synchronized, robust left-right firing. This progression was strongly correlated with axonal extension, suggesting a tight coupling between structure and function.</p>
<p>It has been implicated that spinal cord neurons do not fire before axonal outgrowth, but detailed observation was missing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Interestingly, here early voltage fluctuations preceded axon outgrowth, possibly driven by intrinsic dynamics of ion channels or electrical coupling via gap junctions, which predominate at these early stages. These small fluctuations may represent primitive forms of population synchrony, preceding the establishment of mature synaptic connections. This idea is consistent with other model systems where early electrical coupling plays an instructive role in circuit patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>].</p>
<p>Our approach provides a first-in-class demonstration of long-term, non-invasive voltage imaging in a developing vertebrate nervous system. Beyond the spinal cord, this approach can be extended to other regions, enabling a detailed dissection of diverse population dynamics during development. Furthermore, applying this imaging system to genetic models of neurodevelopmental disorders— such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD), epilepsy, or motor neuron disease—may allow the identification of early disruptions in coordinated neuronal activity. Detecting such early electrophysiological phenotypes could contribute to a better understanding of disease mechanisms.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have established GEVI-based long-term voltage imaging platform for long-term, high-resolution monitoring of developing neuronal populations in vivo. This system revealed the temporal emergence and maturation of population-level voltage dynamics in the spinal cord, offering new insights into how coordinated neural activity is built during development. The combination of spatial, temporal, and functional resolution achieved here represents a critical advance for the field of developmental neuroscience. By integrating this approach with optogenetics, cell-type-specific reporters, or functional perturbation, future studies can address how intrinsic and extrinsic factors shape circuit assembly. Moreover, our findings highlight the value of voltage imaging as a general tool for probing bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, circuit development, and disease [52, 53].</p>

<p>This paper presents an <bold>important</bold> advance in genetically encoded voltage imaging of the developing zebrafish spinal cord in vivo, capturing voltage dynamics in neuronal populations, single cells, and subcellular compartments inaccessible to patch clamp, and diverse spike waveforms and subthreshold voltage dynamics inaccessible to calcium imaging. The work identifies a developmental progression from irregular voltage fluctuations to coordinated contralateral and ipsilateral activity, providing insight into how electrical dynamics and cellular morphology evolve during circuit formation. The strength of evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, with imaging data supporting the main conclusions, although the manuscript would be strengthened by more complete methodological documentation and clearer context relative to earlier calcium imaging studies. Overall, this study provides a resource that is of importance for researchers investigating neural development and circuit assembly, illustrating the value of voltage imaging as a general tool for probing bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis and circuit development.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper demonstrates the first application of voltage imaging using a genetically encoded voltage indicator, ArcLight, for recording the spontaneous activity of the developing spinal cord in zebrafish. This technology enabled better temporal resolution compared to what has been demonstrated with calcium imaging in past studies (Muto et al., 2011; Warp et al., 2012; Wan et al., 2019 ), which led to the discovery of the maturation process of &quot;firing&quot; shapes in spinal neurons. This maturation process occurs simultaneously with axonal elongation and network integration. Thus, voltage imaging revealed new biological details of the development of the spinal circuits.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of voltage imaging instead of calcium imaging revealed biological details of the functional maturation of spinal cord neurons in developing zebrafish.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This manuscript lacks many basic components and explanations necessary for understanding the methodologies used in this study.</p>

<p>The authors present highly impressive in vivo voltage‐imaging data, demonstrating neuronal activity at subcellular, cellular, and population levels in a developing organism. The approach provides excellent spatial and temporal resolution, with sufficient signal-to-noise to detect hyperpolarizations and subthreshold events. The visualization of contralateral synchrony and its developmental loss over time is particularly compelling. The observation that ipsilateral synchrony persists despite contralateral desynchronization is a striking demonstration of the power of GEVIs in vivo. While I outline several points that should be addressed, I consider this among the strongest demonstrations of in vivo GEVI imaging to date.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) Clarification of GEVI performance characteristics</p>
<p>There is a widespread misconception in the GEVI field that response speed is the dominant or primary determinant of sensor performance. Although fast kinetics are certainly desirable, they are not the only (or even necessarily the limiting) factor for effective imaging. Kinetic speed specifies the time to reach ~63% of the maximal ΔF/F for a given voltage step (typically 100 mV, approximating the amplitude of a neuronal action potential), but in practical imaging, a slower sensor with a large ΔF/F can outperform a faster sensor with a small ΔF/F. In this context, the authors' use of ArcLight is actually instructive. ArcLight is one of the slower GEVIs in common use, yet Figures S1a-b clearly show that it still reports voltage transients in vivo very well. I therefore strongly recommend moving these panels into the main text to emphasize that robust in vivo imaging can be achieved even with a relatively slow GEVI, provided the signal amplitude and SNR are adequate. This will help counteract the common misunderstanding in the field.</p>
<p>(2) ArcLight's voltage-response range</p>
<p>ArcLight is shifted toward more negative potentials (V₁/₂ ≈ −30 mV). This improves subthreshold detection but makes distinguishing action potentials from subthreshold transients more challenging. The comparison with GCaMP is helpful because the Ca²⁺ signal largely reflects action potentials. Panels S1c-f show similar onset kinetics but a longer decay for GCaMP. Surprisingly, the ΔF/F amplitudes are comparable; typically, GCaMP changes are larger. To support lines 193-194, the authors should include a table summarizing the onset/offset kinetics and ΔF/F ranges for neurons expressing ArcLight versus GCaMP.</p>
<p>Additionally, the expected action-potential amplitude in zebrafish neurons should be stated. In Figure S1b, a 40 mV change appears to produce ~0.5% ΔF/F, but this should be quantified and noted. Could this comparison to GCaMP help resolve action potentials from subthreshold bursts?</p>
<p>(3) Axonal versus somatic amplitudes (Line 203)</p>
<p>The manuscript states that voltage amplitudes are &quot;slightly smaller&quot; in axons than in somata; this requires quantitative values and statistical testing. More importantly, differences in optical amplitude reflect factors such as expression levels, background fluorescence, and optical geometry, not necessarily true differences in voltage amplitude. The axonal signals are clearly present, but their relative magnitude should not be interpreted without correction.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 4C: need for an off-ROI control</p>
<p>Figure 4C should include a control ROI located away from ROI3 to demonstrate that the axonal signal is not due to background fluctuations, similar to the control shown in Figure S3. Although the ΔF image suggests localization, showing the trace explicitly would strengthen the point. The fluorescence-change image in Figure 4c should also be fully explained in the legend.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 5: hyperpolarization signals</p>
<p>Figure 5 is particularly impressive. It appears that Cell 2 at 18.5 hpf and Cell 1 at 18 hpf exhibit hyperpolarizing events. The authors should confirm that these are true hyperpolarizations by giving some indication of how often they were observed.</p>
<p>(6) SNR comparison (Lines 300-302)</p>
<p>The claim that ArcLight and GCaMP exhibit comparable SNR requires statistical support across multiple cells.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to establish a long-term voltage imaging platform to investigate how coordinated neuronal activity emerges during spinal cord development in zebrafish embryos. Using the genetically encoded voltage indicator ArcLight, they tracked membrane potential dynamics in motor neurons at population, single-cell, and subcellular levels from 18 to 23 hours post-fertilization (hpf), revealing relationships between firing maturation, waveform characteristics, and axonal outgrowth.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Technical advancement in developmental voltage imaging:</p>
<p>This study demonstrates voltage imaging of motor neurons in the developing vertebrate spinal cord. The approach successfully captures voltage dynamics at multiple spatial scales-neuronal population, single-cell, and subcellular compartments.</p>
<p>(2) Insights into the relationship between morphological and functional maturation:</p>
<p>The work reveals important relationships between voltage dynamics maturation and morphological changes.</p>
<p>(3) Kinetics analysis of membrane potential waveform enabled by voltage imaging:</p>
<p>The characterization of &quot;immature&quot; versus &quot;mature&quot; firing based on quantitative waveform parameters provides insights into functional maturation that are inaccessible by calcium imaging. This analysis reveals a maturation process in the biophysical properties of developing neurons.</p>
<p>(4) Matching of voltage indicator kinetics to biological signal:</p>
<p>The authors' choice of ArcLight, despite its slow kinetics compared to newer GEVIs, proved well-suited to the low-frequency activity patterns in developing spinal neurons (frequency ~0.3 Hz).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Insufficient comparison with prior calcium imaging studies:</p>
<p>While the authors state that voltage imaging provides superior temporal resolution compared to calcium imaging (lines 192-196, 301), and this is generally true, the current manuscript does not adequately cite or discuss previous calcium imaging studies. Since neural activity occurs at low frequency in the developing spinal cord, calcium imaging is adequate for characterizing the emergence of coordinated activity patterns in the developing zebrafish spinal cord. Notably, Wan et al. (2019, Cell) performed a comprehensive single-cell reconstruction of emerging population activity in the entire developing zebrafish spinal cord using calcium imaging. This work should be properly acknowledged and compared. The specific advantages of voltage imaging over these prior studies need to be more clearly articulated, e.g. detection of subthreshold events and membrane potential waveform kinetics.</p>
<p>(2) Considerations for generalizability of the ArcLight-based voltage imaging approach:</p>
<p>While this study successfully demonstrates voltage imaging using ArcLight in the developing spinal cord, the generalizability of this approach to later developmental stages and other neural systems warrants discussion. ArcLight exhibits relatively slow kinetics (rise time ~100-200 ms, decay τ ~200-300 ms). In the current study, these kinetics are well-suited to the developmental activity patterns observed (firing frequency ~0.3 Hz), representing appropriate matching of indicator properties to biological timescales. However, the same approach may be less suitable for later developmental stages when neural activity occurs at higher frequencies.</p>
<p>(3) Incomplete methodological descriptions:</p>
<p>As a paper establishing a new imaging approach, several critical details are missing or unclear.</p>
<p>(a) Imaging system specifications: The imaging setup description lacks essential information, including light source specifications, excitation wavelength/filter sets, and light power at the sample. The authors should also clarify whether wide-field optics was used rather than confocal or selective plane imaging.</p>
<p>(b) Long-term imaging protocol: Whether neurons were imaged continuously or with breaks between imaging sessions is not explicitly stated. The current phrasing could be interpreted as a continuous 4.5-hour recording, which would be technically impressive but may not be what was actually done.</p>
<p>(c) Image processing procedures: Denoising and bleach correction procedures are mentioned but not described, which is critical for a methods-focused paper.</p>
<p>(d) The waveform classification (Supplementary Figure S6) shows overlapping kinetics between &quot;immature&quot; and &quot;mature&quot; firing, yet the classification method is not adequately justified.</p>
<p>(e) Given that photostability and toxicity are critical considerations for long-term voltage imaging, these aspects warrant further clarification. While the figures suggest stable ArcLight fluorescence during the experiments, the manuscript lacks quantification of photobleaching, a discussion of potential toxicity concerns associated with the indicator, and information regarding the maximum duration over which the ArcLight signal can faithfully report physiological voltage dynamics.</p>
<p>(4) Incomplete data representation and quantification:</p>
<p>(a) The claim of &quot;reduced variability&quot; in calcium imaging (line 194) is not clearly demonstrated in Supplementary Figure S1.</p>
<p>(b) Amplitude distributions for cell/subcellular compartments are not systematically quantified. Figure S3 shows ~5% changes in some axons versus ~2% in others, but it remains unclear whether these variabilities reflect differences between axonal compartments within the same cell, between individual cells, or between individual fish.</p>
