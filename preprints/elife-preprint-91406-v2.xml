<title>Abstract</title><p>The diversity of neural stem cells is a hallmark of the cerebral cortex development in gyrencephalic mammals, such as Primates and Carnivora. Among them, ferrets are a good model for mechanistic studies. However, information on their neural progenitor cells (NPC), termed radial glia (RG), is limited. Here, we surveyed the temporal series of single-cell transcriptomes of progenitors regarding ferret corticogenesis and, found a conserved diversity and temporal trajectory between human and ferret NPC, despite the large timescale difference. We found truncated RG (tRG) in ferret cortical development, a progenitor subtype previously described in humans. The combination of <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses identified that tRG differentiate into both ependymal and astrogenic cells. Via transcriptomic comparison, we predict that this is also the case in humans. Our findings suggest that tRG plays a role in the formation of adult ventricles, thereby providing the architectural bases for brain expansion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A vast diversity of neurons and glia form functional neural circuits during the development of the cerebral cortex in mammals. These cells are progressively generated from multipotent neural stem cells, termed radial glia (RG), following genetic processes common across species, from initially neurons of the deep layers (DL), then neurons of the upper layers (UL), and finally glial cells, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes (<bold>Fig. S1A, S1B</bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rowitch and Kriegstein, 2010</xref>). These processes are also spatially organized with RG divisions in the ventricular zone (VZ), IPC-neuron differentiation in the sub-VZ (SVZ), and neuron migration to the cortical plate in an inside-out manner. In many mammalian phylogenic states, cerebral cortex evolved to gain an additional germinal layer (outer SVZ, OSVZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Smart et al, 2002</xref>), where extensive neurogenesis and gliogenesis of outer RG (oRG) occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hansen <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fietz <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Reillo <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gertz &amp; Kriegstein, 2015</xref>) resulting in the amplification of neuronal and glial populations in the cortex (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref></bold>; Rash et al, 2019). On the other hand, a new subtype of NPC in the VZ has recently been reported in humans and rhesus macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">deAzevedo et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nowakowski et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sidman and Rakic, 1973</xref>), lacking the basal attachment and is therefore termed truncated RG (tRG). However, how widely tRG appears in gyrencephalic (or even lissencephalic) mammal development, what mechanisms underlie their formation, and what they produce remain unknown. As distinct NPC subtypes may possess different capacities to generate differentiated progenies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Huang et al, 2020</xref>; Rash et al, 2019), it would be critical to find answers to those questions to understand commonality and diversity in the mammalian brain evolution.</p>
<p>Genetic manipulation of individual cell types <italic>in vivo</italic> and single-cell transcriptome analysis are two major and successful approaches in revealing the properties of cells, such as their proliferation and differentiation. Thus, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the human brain during development has been extensively performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Herring <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bhaduri et al, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Huang et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Johnson et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Polioudakis et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pollen et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhong et al, 2018</xref>). However, the <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior in humans and other primates and the underlying mechanisms remain less explored owing to the limited experimental access to the developing primate cortices. Particularly, resources available for the late human embryonic brain are extremely rare due to ethical challenges. Also, studies using brain organoids face issues in recapitulating the specification and maturation of cell types during human brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bhaduri et al, 2020</xref>). In this context, the ferret (<italic>Mustela putorius furo</italic>) is highlighted as a suitable animal model, which compensates for the difficulties in studying human cortical development. Ferrets are carnivores that develop common gyrencephalic features, such as the OSVZ and a folded brain, and are frequently used in mammalian models of brain development and circuit formation because neurogenesis continues in their early neonatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chapman &amp; Stryker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">McConnell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Noctor <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jackson <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>). Since this species is experimentally manipulable, recent studies have developed <italic>in vivo</italic> gene manipulation and editing technology using <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation (IUE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Matsui et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kawasaki et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tsunekawa et al, 2016</xref>; timelapse imaging; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McConnell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chenn &amp; McConnell, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, ferrets showed severe microcephalic phenotypes via <italic>ASPM</italic> (<italic>Abnormal Spindle-like Microcephaly-associated</italic> gene) knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnson et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kou et al, 2015</xref>), which greatly differs from a minor phenotype in mouse <italic>ASPM</italic> knockout mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Capecchi and Pozner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fujimori et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jayaraman et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pulvers et al, 2010</xref>). This remarkable finding suggests the presence of mechanisms underlying brain enlargement and circuit complexity shared by gyrencephalic species to some extent. Results from transcriptome profiling of ferret cortical cells has revealed regional differences in germinal layers and cell-type composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnson et al, 2018</xref>; de Juan Romero et al, 2015). However, because of the incomplete genomic information, especially due to the lack of genetic models, the databases with ferret data have been less reliable than those with human or mice data. This has posed a limit for the accurate comparison of single cell transcriptomes between ferrets and humans. Hence, the temporal pattern of molecular signatures of ferret NPC remains largely unexplored at single-cell resolution. Comparison of progenitor subtypes and sequential events at the single-cell transcriptome level regarding development between ferrets and humans will greatly help to recognize common and species-specific mechanisms underlying the construction of a complex brain.</p>
<p>In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the developmental dynamics of progenitor populations during ferret corticogenesis to clarify shared or species-specific mechanisms of corticogenesis in gyrencephalic mammals and found that ferrets generate tRG at late neurogenic and early gliogenic stages like humans and other primates. Analysis of the pseudotime trajectory and temporal histochemical pattern suggested that tRG generate ependymal and astrogenic cell fates. Then, we compared temporal series of ferret and human single cell transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bhaduri et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nowakowski et al, 2017</xref>). Remarkably, we found homologous temporal progenitor trajectories irrespective of the large differential corticogenesis timescale. This study combining rich ferret and human transcriptome data with <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis using ferrets emphasizes the value of single-cell ferret transcriptome datasets.</p>

<title>Temporal patterns of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the cerebral cortex of ferrets</title>
<p>First, we confirmed histochemically the spatial and temporal pattern of RG, oRG, and IPC and the appearance of diverse cortical neurons to determine the period in which samples were to be taken for scRNA-seq (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). While neurogenesis mostly terminated by P5 in the dorsal cortex (<bold>Fig. S1A, S1B</bold>), oligodendrocyte progenitors of dorsal origin (OLIG2<sup>+</sup>) and RG with gliogenic potential (GFAP<sup>+</sup>) became detectable approximately at E40 and increased in number postnatally (<bold>Fig. S1C, S1D</bold>). To recapitulate neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the ferret cortex at a high resolution, we decided to determine the temporal trajectories of cell types in the course of ferret brain development (schematically represented in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>) by performing single cell transcriptomes of neural progenitors, neurons and glial cells. Based on the above histochemical observations (<bold>Fig. S1A, S1B</bold>), we examined single cell transcriptomes at the six developmental time points: embryonic days E25, E34, and E40 and postnatal days P5 and P10. We carried out single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of ferret dorsal cortex at these six developmental time points (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). We prepared two series of cell populations isolated in different ways to enrich the progenitor subtypes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>): (1) FACS-based sorting of the neural stem cell fraction labeled with an AzamiGreen (AG)-driven <italic>HES5</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ohtsuka et al, 2006</xref>) and (2) collecting cells forming the VZ, SVZ, and intermediate zones (IZ) of cerebral cortices after discarding the cortical plate (CP, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, S2A</bold>).</p>

<title>Improvement of the gene model for scRNA-seq of ferrets</title>
<p>High quality information about gene models over the entire genome is prerequisite to obtain a high resolution of single cell transcriptomes from scRNA-seq. Despite several previous transcriptome studies on the ferret cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnson et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">de Juan Romero et al, 2015</xref>), public information on the ferret genome is incomplete; identification of the gene corresponding to a cDNA requires its accurate 3â-untranslated region (3â-UTR) and its correct connection to the coding sequence, because single cell-cDNA library were made by Oligo (dT)-priming method (10x Genomics Chromium, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>)</bold>. However, information regarding the 3â²-UTR of genes had been poor for ferret genomic datasets, which has impeded high resolution single-cell transcriptome analyses that can offer an accurate comparison with human datasets, Thus, we first improved the annotations of ferret genomic DNA sequences using Chromium droplet sequencing, which tagged all contigs from a long genomic DNA in a droplet, and constructed new gene models based on the improved genomic annotations and newly obtained RNA-seq reads of various tissue types (<bold>Table S7 and see Materials and Methods</bold>). Comparing with NCBI references, mapping scRNA-seq reads from E34 to our own references not only improved the mapping rate (number of reads mapped to the transcriptome) from â¼30% to â¼56%, but also increased the median number of genes detected from â¼1000 to â¼2000. (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). We found similar mapping rate and median number of genes detected across all sampling stages (<bold>Table S1</bold>).</p>

<p>We also examined whether cells with high mitochondrial contents affect clustering of ferret single cells, because we have decided to include all cells that had less than 30% of mitochondrial genes in our analysis based on the percentage of reads mapped on the mitochondrial genome; we found that the majority of cells in each cell type had a value less than 5% while some cells contained them in the range between 0% and 10%, up to a maximum of 28% (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig, 1E</xref></bold>). We confirmed that single cells after filtering cells with the threshold of 10% mitochondrial content (28,686 cells in our dataset) and those with the threshold of 30% (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>), provided similar clustering patterns with each other, both of which 26 clusters <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2C</xref>)</bold> indicating that the current selection of cells with the mitochondrial contents is appropriate.</p>
<p>Cell clusters were annotated according to their specific gene expression patterns (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C, S3A</xref>, Table S1</bold>) and assigned into ten cell types: RG (early, mid, and late), IPC, OPC, ependymal cells, excitatory cortical neurons (DL and UL), inhibitory neurons (ITN), microglia, endothelial cells, mural cells, and unknown cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). RG, IPC, and neuronal clusters were aligned according to the neuronal differentiation process in the UMAP plot (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). RG cells were classified into three clusters (early, mid, and late) according to their collection stages and also the expression of temporally altered RG markers reported previously (hereafter named temporal markers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Okamoto et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Telley <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). The âearly RGâ clusters comprised E25 cells while the âmid RGâ clusters, mostly E34 cells (<bold>Fig. S3B</bold>). Early and late RG, and IPC were subdivided into three subclusters that expressed different cell cycle markers (<bold>Fig. S3C</bold>).</p>
<p>Remarkably, we identified a small cluster (409 cells) of <italic>PAX6</italic>-expressing RG subtype, 69% of which expressed <italic>CRYAB</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>). <italic>CRYAB</italic>, encoding a molecular chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yamamoto et al, 2014</xref>) is a unique marker for human tRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nowakowski et al, 2016</xref>); therefore, we designated them as tRG-like cells in ferrets. In contrast, oRG cells failed to be distinguished from ventricular RG cells (vRG) in ferrets by unbiased clustering alone (see below). HOPX, a typical marker for oRG in human tissues (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, S3D</bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pollen et al, 2015</xref>), has been indeed detected in both oRG and vRG at late stages <italic>in vivo</italic> in ferrets (<bold>Fig. S3D</bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnson et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kawaue et al, 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>tRG emerge around birth during the development of somatosensory cortex in ferrets</title>
<p>The presence of a tRG-like cluster in ferret transcriptomes led us to investigate the properties of the cells in this cluster. To examine their cell morphology, we sparsely labeled NPC by electroporating P0 embryos with an expression vector for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and found a cell population showing major characteristics of human tRG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nowakowski et al, 2016</xref>): expression of CRYAB and PAX6 with an apical endfoot and truncated basal fiber in the VZ during late neurogenesis (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A,B</xref>, Supplementary movie1, 2</bold>).

These CRYAB<sup>+</sup> cells were mostly post-mitotic (KI67<sup>-</sup>) and neither IPC (TBR2<sup>+</sup>) nor OPC (OLIG2<sup>+</sup>) at P10, while a small fraction of those cells expressed these markers at P5 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>â<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref></bold>). These histochemical observations were consistent with our single-cell transcriptome data (<bold>Fig. S4AâF</bold>). Altogether, we concluded that tRG-like cells in ferrets are equivalent to human tRG cells (as also confirmed by transcriptomic comparison between humans and ferrets, shown later). A difference in the late neurogenic cortex between humans and ferrets is that the VZ and OSVZ are connected by conventional RG cells in ferrets (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, S4G</bold>), but separated in humans due to the disappearance of conventional RG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nowakowski et al, 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Temporal fates of RG cells are predicted by pseudo-time trajectory analysis</title>
<p>To understand the relationship between various cortical progenitors in the developing ferret brain, particularly in the origin and fate of ferret tRG, pseudo-time trajectory analysis was performed. Single cells that had been subjected to single-cell transcriptome analyses (from E25 to P10) were unbiasedly ordered along a trajectory based on their transcriptome profiles (<bold>Fig. S5A, S5B</bold>). To simplify our analysis, we first excluded interneurons, microglia, endothelial cells, and excitatory neuronal clusters. Subsequently, 6,000 single cells were randomly selected from the remaining cell population for further analysis. The pseudo-time analysis predicted a reasonable trajectory consisting of three branching points that generated seven states (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, S5B</bold>). We assigned major cell types for each state based on the cell clusters defined by UMAP analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, Table S2</bold>). The trajectory successfully predicted cortical development, along which <italic>HES1</italic><sup>+</sup> stem cells shift their features from the earlier to the later stages, generating branches of differentiated cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5D</xref></bold>). Major <italic>HES1</italic><sup>+</sup>stem cell states (state 1, 3, 5 and 7) contained cells at different stages; thus, termed NPC1, 2, 3 and astrogenic, respectively (<bold>Fig. S5C</bold>). NPC1 (mostly from E25) bifurcated into the neuronally differentiated lineage and NPC2 state (<bold>Fig. S5B</bold>), which produced the OPC lineage and NPC3 state at the second branching point. When neurogenesis gradually declined after birth, the NPC3 state, mainly consisting of late RG cells and tRG (<bold>Fig. S5C</bold>), adopted two states, state 6 with an presumptive ependymal fate (<italic>FOXJ1</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>SPARCL1</italic><sup>+</sup>) and state 7 with presumptive astrogenic fate (<italic>FOXJ1</italic><sup>-</sup><italic>, SPARCL1</italic><sup>+</sup>), as judged by the combination of late fate markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Saadoun and Papadopoulos, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yu et al, 2008</xref>, <bold>Fig. S3A, 3D</bold>).</p>

Different territories were assigned into these three states in the UMAP even when we examined the entire tRG population (409 cells) before making a random selection of 6,000 cells for pseudotime trajectory analysis, supporting the reliability of this presumptive categorization of tRG (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>tRG cells is likely to possess ependymal and gliogenic potential during cortical development in ferrets</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that tRG generate both ependymal cells and astroglia populations, we first examined the expression of an ependymal marker, FOXJ1, a master regulator of ciliogenesis, according to CRYAB expression in the VZ. We observed that CRYAB<sup>+</sup> tRG cells gradually co-expressed FOXJ1, reaching up to 90% co-expression by P10 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, 5B</bold>). Similarly, our transcriptome data showed that the fraction of <italic>CRYAB-FOXJ1</italic> double-positive cells increased in the tRG cluster from P1 to P10, whereas other RG clusters maintained low <italic>CRYAB</italic> expression (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, 5D</bold>). From P5 onwards, differentiating ependymal cells (<italic>CRYAB-FOXJ1</italic> double-positive) accumulated within the VZ (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>). These cells often align their nuclei in parallel to the ventricular surface, near which nuclear lined aggregates are observed more frequently (between two arrowheads in P5 and P10 in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>), and their cell body finally settled on the apical surface with short basal fibers by P14 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref></bold>). These data suggest that a majority of tRG cells progressively upregulates <italic>FOXJ1</italic> expression to adopt an ependymal cell fate during postnatal development. Concomitantly, adenine cyclase III expression in both primary and multiciliated cells indicated that ciliogenesis progressed postnatally, forming multi-ciliated ependymal cells on the ventricular surface of the ferret cortex by P35 (<bold>Fig. S6A</bold>). Altogether, it is most likely that FOXJ1<sup>+</sup>tRG are fated to be ependymal cells that constitute the ventricular surface. To prove this, it is necessary to chase tRG by knocking in a fluorescent marker gene via <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation, or to follow the change in cell shape from tRG to a characteristic ependymal morphology in slice cultures by labeling with a fluorescent gene via <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation. However, the latter would not be realistic, because the process of the transformation from tRG to ependymal cells is slow to take a long time in an order of 10 days. It is an important future issue to develop the strategy to genetically follow the fate of tRG.</p>

<p>Moreover, a fraction of tRG belongs to the state 7 (astrogenic state) in the pseudo-time trajectory (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, 4F</bold>).

<title>Ferrets and humans show a homologous developmental transcriptomic profile of progenitor subtypes</title>
<p>Both ferrets and humans are positioned in distinct phylogenetic branches; both represent complex brain features of gyrencephalic mammals.

<p>Next, we compared the similarities among individual RG subtypes across species. To quantify the features of an RG subtype, we introduced the parameter âgenescoreâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bhaduri et al, 2020</xref>), a parameter that reflects the enrichment and specificity of a marker gene for a given cluster; the genescore for a particular marker gene is defined by multiplying the average enrichment of expression quantity in cells of the cluster (fold change) and the ratio of the number of marker-expressing cells in the cluster to the cell number in all other clusters (see <bold>Materials and Methods</bold>). Comparison of genescores of two arbitrary RG subtypes between two species revealed a high correlation in the early and late RG clusters (vRG, and oRG for the human dataset) across species (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, 6D, Table S5</bold>).</p>
<p>tRG cells also showed a remarkable similarity between the two species (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, 6D</bold>), as represented by a high level of expression for the combination of <italic>CRYAB</italic>, <italic>EGR1,</italic> and <italic>CYR61</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref></bold>). To better examine this similarity, we defined the âcluster scoreâ for individual cells as a linear combination of the expression level of marker genes in a cell, which is weighted by its genescore in the human cluster of interest. Calculation of the cluster score for ferret tRG using genescores of the human tRG cluster resulted in a higher score than any other cluster in both datasets (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref></bold>).

After excluding neurons and other cell types from the analysis, we identified respective human clusters for tRG and oRG cells based on their marker gene expression (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, Table S6).</bold> Then, we merged this human dataset and ferret NPCs (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, 7C</bold>) by the MNN after CCA as described before when we merged the entire series of progenitor samples of ferrets and humans (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>)</bold>. This procedure revealed that human tRG and oRG share similar transcriptomes with ferret tRG and late RG that must include oRG, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. S8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">S8B</xref></bold>). It is worth noting that early RG in ferrets showed the highest similarity with âOLIG1â in human data, and no cell type in human data corresponded to ferret âmidRG,â likely because only GW25 cells were used for comparison (<bold>Fig. S8A, S8B</bold>).</p>

<p>The integration of ferret and human datasets showed that tRG from both species were mainly distributed into three different clusters in the UMAP space: 7, 21, and 28 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>, S8C</bold>). Cluster 7 cells highly expressed late onset RG genes (such as <italic>APOE</italic>, <italic>FABP7</italic>, <italic>NOTCH2</italic>, and <italic>DBI</italic>; <bold>Fig. S8D</bold>), suggesting that tRG cells in cluster 7 were presumably at a late RG-like state, being not yet committed to neither astrogenic nor ependymal fates (mostly in the NPC 3 state in the ferret pseudo-time trajectory; <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, 3E</bold>). In contrast, cells in clusters 21 and 28 highly expressed marker genes for the astrocyte (<italic>GFAP</italic> and <italic>AQP4</italic>), and the ependymal (<italic>FOXJ</italic>1) clusters, respectively (<bold>Fig. S8D, Table S6</bold>). Then, we confirmed that the three states of ferret tRG cells, committed to the astroglia, ependymal fates and uncommitted states, were largely assigned to clusters 21, 28 and 7, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref></bold>), guaranteeing the reliability of this method. Thus, our results raise the possibility that tRG cells in humans possess the potential to generate astrocytes and ependymal cells as suggested for ferret tRG. This analysis also reveals that the proportion of the 3 tRG subtypes was very different between human and ferret datasets (<bold>Fig. S7DâF</bold>); the two presumptively committed tRG are very minor populations in humans, possibly due to the differences in developmental stages where tRG of these subtypes are enriched (see Discussion).</p>

<title>Human cortical organoids lack tRG population</title>
<p>Human cortical organoids are a powerful model for understanding cortical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Eiraku <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). It is, therefore, important to know how developing ferret cortices resemble human cortical organoids especially regarding to features shared by human tissues and ferrets. We then decided to analyze two different datasets of cortical organoids to see whether tRG is present in those organoids (<bold>Fig. S9A-D</bold> for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bhaduri et al., 2020</xref>; <bold>Fig. S9E-F</bold> for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Herring et al., 2022</xref>), by focusing on CRYAB-expressing cells (<bold>Fig. S9</bold>). We assigned cells according to the original annotations, which included the information of organoid lines, age, and state (<bold>Fig. S9A</bold>). Our clustering resulted in 32 clusters where CRYAB-expressing cells were detected in two out of four cell lines (<bold>Fig. S9B</bold>). We noted that a tRG cluster was absent in the original annotation. To further confirm the absence of a tRG cluster in organoids, we integrated organoid dataset with the dataset derived from human primary tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bhaduri et al., 2020</xref>). After the integration, we failed to find organoid-derived CRYAB-expressing cells that overlapped with tRG cells from the human primary tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bhaduri et al., 2020</xref>; <bold>Fig. S9C-D</bold>), nor CRYAB-expressing cell itself in the other dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Herring et al., 2022</xref>; <bold>Fig. S9E</bold>). Our analyses thus indicate that tRG-like populations seem to be lacking in organoid datasets that are currently available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bhaduri et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Herring et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Prediction of ferret oRG-like cells via the identification of cells homologous to human oRG cells</title>
<p>As mentioned before, oRG could not be identified as a separate cluster in the ferret dataset (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). We attempted to assign oRG-like cells in the ferret dataset using human oRG cells as anchors via the integration of two datasets by the MNN after CCA (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref></bold>). We could assign oRG-like cells, which were located near the human oRG cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref></bold>). To assess the degree of similarity to human oRG, we calculated the oRG score for each ferret oRG-like cell as we did for tRG (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref></bold>). The assigned oRG-like cells had significantly higher oRG cluster scores than all other NPCs (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we searched genes that were highly expressed in oRG-like cells by comparing oRG-like cells and other NPCs in the ferret dataset (<bold>Table S6</bold>). Consistent with the human dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bhaduri <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), the expression of <italic>HOPX, CLU,</italic> and <italic>CRYM</italic> was higher in oRG-like cells than in other ferret NPCs (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7J</xref>, S8E</bold>). However, human oRG markers such as <italic>HOPX</italic> and <italic>CLU</italic> were also expressed by vRG and tRG in ferrets (<bold>Fig. S3D, S8F</bold>). Therefore, oRG at the transcriptome level can only be distinguished by the similarity with the whole transcriptome or a combination of several markers, but not by a few marker genes, whereas oRG can be unambiguously identified by its location in the tissue (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we provide a ferret dataset of single-cell transcriptomes of neural progenitors covering the entire cortical neurogenenesis and early gliogenic phase, revealing their diversity and temporal patterns during cortical development. Comparison of these features between ferrets and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nowakowski <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bhaduri <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) indicated at a high resolution that these two gyrencephalic mammals shared a large proportion of progenitor variations and their temporal sequences despite their extremely different neurogenesis timescales. It is remarkable that tRG is conserved between these two phylogenetically distant species. A ferret model allows us to identify the mode of tRG generation, to predict its descendant fates and to analyze cell dynamics in tissues. These findings have not been realized by previous studies, re-evaluating ferrets as a valuable model species to study the neural development of gyrencephalic animals. This comparison between humans and ferrets could not be performed unless genomic information, especially genome-wide gene models, was greatly improved; there had been sufficient genomic information accumulated for ferrets, but mainly for coding regions for genes, which had not been well connected to their 3â-UTR. However, to carry out a large scale of single cell RNA seq quantitatively with minimizing the loss of transcript species, accurate 3â- UTR sequences and their link to the coding part are indispensable, because typical scRNA-seq platforms are based on oligo-(dT)-primed cDNA synthesis. We made tremendous efforts to get improved gene models that include 3â-UTR sequences, making it possible for us to compare single cell transcriptome of ferret cortical progenitors with a huge volume of single cell transcriptome datasets with high qualities, including those for humans and mice.</p>

<title>The fate of tRG progenies</title>
<p>Our pseudotime trajectory analyses and immunohistochemistry analyses suggested that ferret tRG cells differentiate into ependymal cells and astrogenic cells. Although the number tRG cells used in the trajectory analysis was limited (167 cells; <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>), three tRG subtypes, which are presumably âprecommittedâ, âependymalâ and âastrogenicâ tRG also formed three distinct territories within the original tRG cluster that consisted of 409 cells on UMAP, indicating a consistent heterogeneity within tRG cluster. This mode of the presumptive ependymal cell formation is likely parallel to that of the bifurcation of ependymal cells and adult neural stem cells from the same progenitor population in the striatum on the ventral side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ortiz-Ãlvarez <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparison of human with ferrets in corticogenesis</title>
<p>Our cross-species comparative analysis predicts that tRG in humans also differentiate into ependymal and astroglial cells although there is no <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence yet (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the rare presence of two presumptively committed tRG subgroups in humans makes this prediction tentative at present. If this prediction is the case, the uncommitted tRG fraction is dominant in GW25 human brains unlike in ferret brains, suggesting that human tRG at GW25 progresses along the differentiation axis less than ferret tRG at P5âP10, most of which are already committed to either ependymal or astrogenic states.</p>
<p>While GW25 has been almost at the latest stages experimentally available from human embryonic brain tissues due to ethical reasons, Herring et al. recently reported a large dataset that spans late embryonic to postnatal development in human prefrontal cortex, in which we were not able to detect a tRG population nor other progenitor subtypes, as well as an ependymal cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Herring <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), possibly due to regional differences in the collected samples from our ferret dataset. Thus, this postnatal dataset does not seem to be appropriate to compare with our ferret dataset or even human prenatal dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bhaduri et al. 2020</xref>) to follow tRG progenies (<bold>Fig. S9</bold>). More enrichment of datasets in the human lateral cortices at the developmental stages after GW25 onward are necessary to test whether our results obtained from ferrets regarding tRG progeny fates can be generalized.</p>

<title>Commonalities and differences among characteristics of neural progenitors between human ferrets</title>
<p>In this study, our transcriptomic data supported the notion that ferrets are a good model system to investigate mechanisms commonly (at least in both primates and carnivores) underlying the cortical development in gyrencephalic mammals. At the same time, we acknowledge the differences in corticogenesis between ferrets and humans. Most prominently, the time scale of corticogenesis progression is greatly different between the two species, while the variety of NPCs and their temporal patterns of appearances and differentiation exhibit similarities. In addition, the organization of cortical scaffold seems differ from each other; in human corticogenesis, two major germinal layers, the VZ and OSVZ, become segregated during the expansion phase of RG in the neurogenic stage, due to the loss of vRG, which extend from the ventricular surface to the laminar surface, passing through the OSVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nowakowski <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). In contrast, ferrets maintain vRG with a long radial fiber in the VZ alongside with tRG cells, even beyond the expansion phase of tRG (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, S4G</bold>).</p>

<title>Models as human cortical development</title>
<p>Our preliminary analysis of two datasets from human cortical organoids suggests the lack of tRG-like cells and potentially their progeny cell types (<bold>Fig. S9</bold>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bhaduri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Herring et al., 2022</xref>). This situation might be improved by optimizing culture protocols. If tRG and ependymal cells, one of the presumptive tRG progeny, are generated in human organoids, as we found in ferrets, it would represent a significant advancement in the human organoid model because ependyma are a fundamental structure for ventricular formation. Further studies using human cortical organoids are expected to be able to generate tRG, and to examine its progeny fates.</p>
<p>In ferrets, genetic manipulations can be achieved through <italic>in utero</italic> or postnatal electroporation, as well as via virus-mediated transfer of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Borrell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kawasaki <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Matsui <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tsunekawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Thus, it is theoretically possible to disrupt the <italic>CRYAB</italic> gene <italic>in vivo</italic> in ferrets to investigate its role in tRG and their progeny, including ependymal cells, and to track the tRG lineage. If the <italic>CRYAB</italic> gene is essential to form ependymal layers, we will be able to explore how the ventricle contributes to cortical folding and expansion. Despite our extensive efforts over a year, we have thus far been unsuccessful in knocking in and/or knocking out the <italic>CRYAB</italic> gene. Nevertheless, we anticipate that technical advances will surpass our expectations, both in ferret and human organoids. Taken together, these functional studies in ferrets as well as in human organoids hold promising insights into the understanding of the tRG lineage and its contribution to cortical development in the near future.</p>

Second, the information of RNA-seq alignment was directly incorporated into the gene models to improve the coverage of the 3â UTR region of each gene which is not reliably predicted in ab initio gene prediction. This computation was performed with HISAT2 ver. 2.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) and StringTie ver. 1.3.4d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kovaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), whose output GTF file was merged with the gene models produced by BRAKER using the merge function of StringTie. Finally, the existing transcript sequences of MusPutFur1.0 available at NCBI RefSeq (GCF_000215625.1) was incorporated into the gene models by mapping their sequences to the repeat-masked genome sequences using GMAP ver. 2017-11-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wu &amp; Watanabe, 2005</xref>) with the ânot report chimeric alignmentsâ option. The gene name of each locus was adopted from the annotation in RefSeq, and the gene name of a newly predicted locus was assigned according to the results of a BLASTX search against the UniProtKB Swiss-Prot database release 2020_01. The assignment was performed only for genes with a bit score (in the abovementioned BLASTX search) of greater than 60. When a locus has multiple transcripts, the one with the highest score was adopted for gene naming. If a transcript estimated by ab initio prediction bridged multiple genes, they were incorporated into the gene models as separate genes.</p>

Somatosensory area was dissected from embryonic or postnatal cortices using an ophthalmic knife (15Â°) under a dissection microscope. Sliced tissues were dissociated via enzymatic digestion with papain at 37â for 30 - 45 min in ice-cold Hankâs Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (-) with EDTA (0.1 M). Dissociated cells were centrifuged at 1000xg for 5 min to remove papain by washing with PBS and were resuspended in 0.375% BSA/HBSS (-), or in the sorting buffer (DMEM F12 + GlutamaX (Thermo Fisher); 0.1 % of Penicillin/Streptomycin (Millipore); 20 ng/ml human basic FGF, Peprotech; 1xB27 RA-, Gibco) for cell sorting (see below). Homogenous cell suspension filtered through 35 Âµm strainer (Falcon).</p>
<p>To concentrate neural progenitor cell (NPC) populations at the expense of mature neurons, two methods were used for each sample, except for E25, from which cells were collected using whole somatosensory area:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>âTâ samples: the cortical plate (CP) of cortical sections were dissected out and a part of the intermediate zone (IZ) was likely to be included in the discarded region.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>âAGâ samples: brains collected at indicated stages were electroporated in utero by azamiGreen (AG)-expression vector under the control of Hes5 promoter. The latter method allows the expression of AG in only NPC by the presence of a degradation signal âd2â in the vector to degrade AG protein in HES5-negative differentiating progeny. Only âAGâ samples were processed with cell sorting and dissociated cell obtained as described above were placed in a SH800 cell sorter (SONY) to sort azamigreen-positive cells in 0.375%BSA/HBSS(-) solution. Cell survival and cell number were quantified by Countess or Countess II (Invitrogen), prior to an application of single cell isolation using 10x v2 Chromium kit.</p></list-item>

<title>Immunohistology and confocal imaging</title>
<p>Ferret brains were removed from embryos or pups and fixed for 1 or 2 overnights, respectively, in 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) prepared in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4) at 4â. P35 ferrets were transcardially perfused with cold PBS, followed by 4% PFA, under deep anesthesia with isoflurane, then collected brains were post-fixed with 1% PFA. After the fixation of brains or cortical tissue slices after a live imaging, they were equilibrated in 25% sucrose overnight before embedding in O.C.T. compound (TissueTek, Sakura) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were stored at -80â prior to a coronal sectioning using a cryostat (CM3050S Leica Microsystems, 12Âµm sections). After equilibration at room temperature, sections were washed in PBS with 0.1% Tween (PBST), followed by a treatment with an antigen retrieval solution of HistoVT one (Nacalai Tesque) diluted 10 times in milliQ water, at 70â for 20 min. Sections were then blocked 1 hr at the room temperature (RT) in PBS with 2% Triton-X100 and 2% normal donkey serum (Sigma), followed by an incubation overnight at 4â with primary antibody diluted in the blocking solution. After washing in PBST three times, sections were treated with appropriate fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500) along with 4â,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:1,000) for 1 hr at room temperature. Sections were washed again prior to mounting with PermaFluor solution (Therma Fisher Scientific).</p>
<p>Immunostaining of thick ferret brain sections (200 Âµm) were performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tsunekawa et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, ferret brains were fixed in 1%PFA, washed in PB overnight at 4â, and embedded in 4% low-melting agarose (UltraPure LMP agarose, Thermo Fischer Scientific). Embedded brains were sliced coronally at 200 Âµm thickness by a vibratome (LinerSlicer, DOSAKA EM) on ice. Floating sections were washed three times with PBST, treated with the blocking solution for 1 hour at RT and incubated with primary antibodies for 5 or 6 overnights at 4â under shaking. Sections were then washed in PBST and treated with secondary antibodies for 5 or 6 overnights at 4â under shaking. After washing, we mounted brain slices with CUBIC solution 2 to allow the transparency.</p>
<p>Fluorescent images were acquired using an FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan). Somatosensory cortices were captured with 20X or 100X objective lenses. When 100x objective lens was used, z-stacks of confocal images were taken with an optical slice thickness 1.0 Âµm or 1.5 Âµm and MAX-projection images obtained by FiJi are shown.</p>
<p>All the antibodies used in this study are listed in Key Resources Table, and are used at following concentrations: chicken anti-EGFP, 1:500; mouse anti-Alpha B Crystallin, 1:500; Rabbit anti-FoxJ1, 1:500; goat anti-Olig2, 1:500; rat anti-Eomes, 1:500; rabbit anti-Pax6, 1:500; mouse anti-Pax6, 1:500; mouse anti Gfap, 1:500; rabbit anti-HopX, 1:500; rat anti-RFP, 1:500; goat anti-adenine cyclase III, 1:250; rat anti-Ctip2, 1:500; mouse anti-Satb2, 1:500, rat anti-Ki67, 1:500.</p>

<title>Alignment and raw processing of data</title>
<p>Fastq files were obtained from individual samples and were processed using Cell Ranger pipeline v2. Alignment was done using âCell Ranger countâ function with default parameters accordingly to manufacturerâs instructions to map reads to the ferret reference (MPF_Kobe 2.0.27). The raw data for each set of cells within a sample was obtained by cellranger count function and was read using Seurat âRead10Xâ function (Seurat v3.1.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stuart <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), creating a matrix for unique molecular identified (UMI) counts of each gene within each cell.</p>

<title>Filtering and normalization</title>
<p>Filtering and normalization were performed using Seurat (v3.1.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stuart <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Briefly, each sample was filtered by removing low-quality cells with unique feature counts less than 200, and genes expressed in less than 3 cells (Seurat function âCreateSeuratObjectâ). Different samples were then merged using the Seurat âmergeâ function. Merged data was further subset by keeping cells with features (genes) over 200 and less than 5000. Raw UMI counts were then normalized using âLogNormalizeâ as normalization method, which divided reads by the total number of UMIs per cell, then multiplied by 10,000 (Seurat âNormalizeDataâ function). This resulted in a total of 30,234 cells and 19,492 genes: E25 (3486 cells), E34AG (3223 cells), E34T (2260 cells), E40AG (1102), E40T (1581 cells), P1AG (2681), P1T (3641), P5AG (2429), P5T (2926), P10AG (3010) and P10T (3895).</p>

<title>Single-cell clustering and visualization</title>
<p>Cell clustering was employed to the entire cell population after removing low-quality cells, using Seurat (v3.1.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stuart <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). 2,000 highly variable genes were identified and used for the downstream analysis using Seurat âFindVariableFeaturesâ function (selection.method = âvstâ), which allowed the calculation of average expression and dispersion for each gene. Normalized data was then processed for scaling using Seurat function âScale Dataâ with default settings, which also allowed the regression of the batch. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed with 2,000 variable genes to reduce dimensionality of the scaled dataset and 50 PCs were retained (Seurat âRunPCAâ function). Clustering was then performed using graph-based clustering approach (âFind Neighborsâ function) using top 20 PCs, which were selected based on the standard deviation of PCs on the elbowplot created by Seurat function âElbowPlotâ and based on statistical significance calculated by JackStraw application. Briefly, cells are embedded in a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in a PCA space. Then, this knn graph is used to group cells on a shared nearest neighbor graph based on calculations of overlap between cells with similar gene expression patterns (Jaccard similarity). Cells were then clustered by Louvain algorithm implemented in Seurat âClusterCellsâ function (resolution = 0.8, dims = 1:20). Next, we used Seurat âRunUMAPâ function, which resulted in cell clusters being separated in embedding space while preserving the balance between local and global structure.</p>

<title>Cluster annotations</title>
<p>Cluster markers were obtained using âFindAllMarkersâ Seurat function. We tested genes that showed at least a 0.25-fold difference between the cells in the cluster and all remaining cells, and that were detected in more than 25% of the cells in the cluster. Clusters, which we called subtypes, were then annotated by comparing cluster markers to previously identified cell type markers in the literature for mouse and human datasets. The full list of markers is given under Table S1. The heatmap in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold> shows the expression data for the top 10 highly expressed marker genes for each cluster using a downsampling of maximum 500 cells from each cluster. Plotting cells onto the UMAP plot by their batch indicated that batches did not influence clustering (<bold>Fig. S2A</bold>) in accordance with the differential expression of cluster markers (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, S3A)</bold>. When a cluster was enriched based on the developmental stage, the information was included in the annotation. For example, âearly RGâ cluster was enriched in E25 samples, and expressed both common radial glial cell markers shared with other RG clusters in our dataset, but also expressed early onset-genes reported in mouse studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Okamoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Telley <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), such as <italic>HMGA2</italic>, <italic>FLRT3</italic>, <italic>LRRN1</italic> (Table S1). Therefore, we named this cluster as âearly RGâ based on its age-dependent properties.</p>
<p>To achieve more precise clustering, cycling cells were identified with known markers implemented in Seurat package (S genes and G2M genes). Clusters enriched in S genes or G2M genes were identified, including early_RG2 (S), early_RG3 (G2M), late_RG2 (G2M), late_RG3 (S), IPC2 (S) and IPC3 (G2M) (<bold>Fig. S3C</bold>). Subtypes of RG and IPC clusters were further combined to facilitate the data representation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Monocle 2 was used to construct developmental trajectories based on pseudotime ordering of single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Qiu <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Trapnell <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). We generated a subset of clusters using âSubsetDataâ Seurat function using the raw counts. Combined progenitor clusters (F_earlyRG, F_midRG, F_lateRG, F_tRG, F_IPC, F_OPC) were selected. All clusters known to be generated from a non-cortical origin including microglia, endothelial and mural cells, were removed prior the pseudotime analysis. The expression matrix and a metadata file that contained above cluster information defined by Seurat were used as input for monocle package (<bold>Table S2</bold>).</p>
<p>The âdifferentialGeneTestâ function was used to select genes for dimensionality reduction (fullModelFormulaStr = ââ¼Subtype.combinedâ). Top 1,000 genes were then applied for cell ordering. The visualization of the minimum spanning tree on cells was obtained by Monocle2 âplot_complex_cell_trajectoryâ function.

All cells included in the analysis and cluster assignments from the provided matrix were mapped to the cell type assignments provided in the metadata of Nowakowski et al. dataset and the cell type labels were used as provided by the authors without modification. For Bhaduri et al. dataset, GW25 sample was used for clustering by Seurat package as described above. For both, we removed low quality cells and clusters annotated based on anatomical regions other than somatosensory cortex, and removed cells with less than 200 features. For Bhaduri et al. dataset, we filtered to cells with at least 200 features, less than 6,500 features and less than 5% mitochondrial genes.

First, a Seurat object was created for all datasets as described previously. Briefly, each object was individually processed with a normalization and variable features were identified. For human datasets, we excluded cells or samples obtained from anatomical regions other than somatosensory cortex. Then, the integration anchors between human and ferret Seurat objects were identified using âFindIntegrationAnchorsâ Seurat function with default settings.

Briefly, lists of cluster marker genes obtained by âFindAllMarkersâ Seurat function on individual datasets were extracted prior to an integration (Table S5A), except for Nowakowski et al dataset, for which the marker gene list was provided. A score based on the specificity and the enrichment of cluster marker genes was generated (defined as âGenescoreâ). A genescore value was obtained by the multiplication of the average fold change that represents the gene enrichment, with the percentage of the cells expressing the marker in the cluster (pct.1) divided the percentage of the cells from other clusters expressing the marker (pct.2: specificity). This function was employed on the marker genes for a human subtype of interest in the space of marker genes for ferret NPC (RG, IPC, OPC and EP) clusters. Genescores for both ferret and human were then obtained for all markers shared between human subtype of interest (i.e. oRG) and ferret NPC subtypes. We then applied cor.test function using Pearson method to estimate a correlation and the significance of the correlation for the obtained genescores between ferret and human samples.

<title>Quantification of RNAscope in situ hybridization and immunostaining image</title>
<p>Images of RNAscope in situ hybridization and FOXJ1 immunostaining were captured by using an IX83 inverted microscope (Olympus) equipped with Dragonfly 200 confocal unit (Andor), Zyla Z4.2 sCMOS camera (Andor), and UPLXAPO 60XO objective lens (Olympus). Imaging was performed to satisfy Nyquist sampling (xy = 48 nm/pixel by using 2x zoom optic and z = 136 nm interval) and 3D deconvolution was performed by ClearView-GPUâ¢ option of Fusion software (Andor). Default deconvolution parameter is used except for number of irritation (n = 24) and mounting media reflection index (RI = 1.46). For quantification of images, CellProfiler version 4.2.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Stirling <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) was used. To detect mRNA dots of RNAscope in situ hybridization images, a single Z section of deconvolved images were processed by EnhancingSpeckles module (10 pixels size) and then mRNA dots were detected by IdentifyPrimaryObjects module, adaptive Otsu two class method, using default parameter except for size of adaptive window (size = 10). Dotâs diameter less than 4 pixels were removed as a background noise. Cytoplasmic ROIs were generated from smoothed RNAscope in situ hybridization images by MedianFilter module (window size = 10) and manually drawn seed ROIs of DAPI staining images by using IdentifySecondaryObjects module (propagation adaptive Otsu two class method, using default parameter). FoxJ1 immunostaining raw images were measured by MeasureImageIntensity module. Quantified data were visualized and clustered by using RStudio (version 2022.07.1+554) with R (version 4.0.3). Each of mRNA count data and protein staining intensity data was log transformed and normalized, and hierarchical clustering was done by using a Euclidian distance and complete clustering method and cut tree to 4 clusters.

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study that improves gene models for the ferret genome and identifies neural progenitors that are comparable to those found in developing human brains. The data are <bold>convincing</bold> and clearly presented. Of particular interest to the field, the work identifies enriched expression of FOXJ1 in late truncated radial glia, strongly indicating that towards the end of neurogenesis, these cells likely give rise to ependymal cells. The work is of interest to anyone studying the development of the nervous system, especially colleagues studying the evolution of development.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Bilgic et al aim to identify the progenitor types (and their specific progeny) that underlie the expanded nature of gyrencephalic brains. To do this, they take a comparative scRNAseq (single cell transcriptomics) approach between neurodevelopment of the gyrencephalic ferret, and previously published primary human brain and organoid data.</p>
<p>They first improve gene annotations of the ferret genome and then collect a time series of scRNAseq data of 6 stages of the developing ferret brain spanning both embryonic and post-natal development. Among the various cell types they identify are a small proportion of truncated radial glial cells (tRGs), a population known to be enriched in humans and macaques that emerges late in neurogenesis as the RGC scaffold splits into an oRGC that contact the pial surface and a tRG that contacts the ventricular surface. They find that the tRGs consist of three distinct subpopulations two of which are committed to ependymal and astroglial fates.</p>
<p>By integrating these data with publicly available data of developing human brains and human brain organoids they make some important observations. Human and ferret tRGs have very similar transcriptional states, suggesting that the human tRGs too give rise to ependymal and astroglial fates. They also find that the current culture conditions of human brain organoids seem to lack tRGs, something that will need to be addressed if they are to be used to study tRGs. While the primary human data set did contain tRGs, the stage or the region sampled were likely not appropriate, and therefore, the number of cells they could retrieve was low.</p>
<p>The authors have spent considerable efforts in improving gene modeling of the ferret genome, which will be important for the field. They've generated valuable time series data for the developing ferret brain, and have proposed the lineal progeny for the tRGs in the human brain. Whether tRGs actually do give rise to the ependymal and astrogial fates needs to be validated in future studies.</p>

<p>Bilgic et al first explored cellular diversity in the developing cerebral cortex of ferret, honing in on progenitor cell diversity by employing FACS sorting of HES5-positive cells. They have generated a novel single cell transcriptomic dataset capturing the diversity of cells in the developing ferret cerebral cortex, including diverse radial glial and excitatory neuron populations. Unexpectedly, this analysis revealed the presence of CRYAB-positive truncated radial glia previously described only in humans. Using bioinformatic analyses, the investigators proposed that truncated radial glia produce ependymal cells, astrocytes, and to a lesser degree, neurons. Of particular interest to the field, they identify enriched expression of FOXJ1 in late truncated radial glia strongly indicating that towards the end of neurogenesis, these cells likely give rise to ependymal cells. This study represents a major advancement in the field of cortical development and a valuable dataset for future studies of ferret cortical development.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The improvement of the gene annotations of the ferret genome was an important part of this study, and so I would recommend that the authors have a results section and figure dedicated to documenting this.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you so much for appreciating our efforts on improving gene models, which was indeed a critical part in this study. According to the reviewerâs suggestion, we added a new section to the main text, âImprovement of the gene model for scRNA-seq of ferretsâ with a figure (Fig.1 C, D, E).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Are the references to figure S8A, B alright (line 306)? In fact, that entire figure was not well described or out of place. In general, unlike the rest of the manuscript, the section dealing with the human-ferret comparison was a little bit confusing, and the figure legends were not extremely helpful.
Could the authors please revisit the main text and figure legends of this section for clarity?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewerâs recommendation. We removed references to Figure S8A, B. In place of that, we explained the reason more carefully; âWe chose a recently published human dataset (Bhaduri et al, 2021) for comparison, because this study containing GW25 dataset which included more tRG cells than previous studies that did not contain GW25 data. Furthermore, we used only data at GW25â</p>
<p>We also revised several parts in this section to understand more easily by additional explanations as well as in the legends of Fig. 7 and Fig. S8.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have a few very minor comments on the manuscript.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>I would caution the authors against claiming that they have demonstrated bona fide generation of ependymal cells from tRG cells. While the expression of FOXJ1 is a very good indication, they have not demonstrated the morphological transformation of a tRG cell into an ependymal cell.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree the reviewerâs opinion. We have never thought that we proved that tRG differentiates ependymal cells, but we consider that this is highly likely the case (We use the term âsuggestâ in the abstract). To prove this genetically, we extensively tried to knock the EGFP gene into the CRYAB gene by the CRISPR/Cas9 method, to be able to show the lineage relationship between tRG and ependymal cells. However, we have so far failed to do this for a year trial. We also tried to just label tRG with EGFP and follow it in the slice culture.</p>
<p>However, we failed to keep the slice in the culture until we observed the transition from tRG shape to the ependymal shape. It seems to be a slow process. What we could do was to observe the transition from single cilia to multi-cilia, which is part of the morphological transition from epithelial neural stem cells such as Radial Glia to an ependymal-like sheet form. To prove this transition from tRG to ependymal cells (and also astrocytes) is one of the most important issue which needs some new idea, technique or strategy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>There are several typos throughout the manuscript that I would recommend fixing for example, page
5 line 123 says &quot;OLIGO2&quot; instead of &quot;OLIG2&quot;</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you so much. We carefully read and corrected typos. We wish we corrected all of them.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Besides these two points, the manuscript is already prepared to a high standard.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I really appreciate reviewersÊ¼ efforts to finish reviews in a short time, responding to our request related to the first authorÊ¼s thesis application.</p>
