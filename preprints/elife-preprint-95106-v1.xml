<title>Abstract</title><p>Telomeres are crucial for cancer progression. Immune signalling in the tumour microenvironment has been shown to be very important in cancer prognosis. However, the mechanisms by which telomeres might affect tumour immune response remain poorly understood. Here, we observed that interleukin-1 signalling is telomere-length dependent in cancer cells. Mechanistically, non-telomeric TRF2 (Telomeric Repeat binding Factor 2) binding at the IL-1-receptor type-1 (IL1R1) promoter was found to be affected by telomere length. Enhanced TRF2 binding at the <italic>IL1R1</italic> promoter in cells with short telomeres directly recruited the histone-acetyl-transferase (HAT) p300, and consequent H3K27 acetylation activated IL1R1. This altered NF-kappa B signalling and affected downstream cytokines like <italic>IL6, IL8</italic> and <italic>TNF</italic>. Further, <italic>IL1R1</italic> expression was telomere-sensitive in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) clinical samples. Infiltration of tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) was also sensitive to the length of tumour cell telomeres and highly correlated with <italic>IL1R1</italic> expression. The use of both IL1 Receptor antagonist (IL1RA) and <italic>IL1R1</italic> targeting ligands could abrogate M2 macrophage infiltration in TNBC tumour organoids. In summary, using TNBC cancer tissue (&gt;90 patients), tumour-derived organoids, cancer cells and xenograft tumours with either long or short telomeres, we uncovered a heretofore undeciphered function of telomeres in modulating IL1 signalling and tumour immunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Telomeres are composed of DNA repeats (TTAGGG) and associated âshelterinâ proteins present at the end of each eukaryotic chromosome. Gradual shortening of telomeres and change in the telomeric structure with cell division leads to cellular senescence/death, which is crucial for tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Jacobs, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Karlseder, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Shay and Wright, 2000</xref>). During oncogenic transformation, the telomere shortening mediated cellular senescence is bypassed-resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer progression; underlining the impact of telomeres in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Blackburn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Maciejowski and Lange, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Paeschke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Shay, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Shortening of telomeres with ageing contributes to compromised immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Goronzy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hodes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pawelec et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Sansoni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Weng, 2012</xref>). However, despite its relevance in cancer prognosis and intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Artandi and DePinho, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aviv et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chew et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">F Balkwill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Greider, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), how telomeres influence tumour immune response is poorly understood.</p>
<p>Major advances show how immune cells including tumour-infiltrating-lymphocytes (TIL), tumour-associated-macrophages (TAM), natural-killer and dendritic cells impact cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Binnewies et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jochems and Schlom, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Salgado and Gevaert, 2021</xref>). TAMs -typically M2 macrophage-like â predominantly promote immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME) through secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Burkholder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cassetta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">DeNardo and Ruffell, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Pittet et al., 2022</xref>; SD et al., 2020), implicating the role of TAMs in aggressive tumour growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Pittet et al., 2022</xref>). Poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) has been frequently associated with TAMs. Multiple reports show M2-like TAMs to be the most abundant monocytic immune cells in TNBC and implicate their role in invasiveness and aggressive tumour growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Burkholder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Jeong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mantovani and Locati, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Medrek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Oner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Shun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>How the telomere length (TL) of cancer cells affects macrophage infiltration has not been studied. Seimiya. H and colleagues noted that telomere elongation led to differential expression of genes associated with innate immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hirashima et al., 2013</xref>). A published work on colorectal cancer showed the association of telomere length of cancer cells to immunity-related genes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lopez-Doriga et al., 2018</xref>). Another recent article showed that telomere maintenance by Telomerase (the key enzyme responsible for telomere maintenance) and ATL (alternative telomere lengthening) related mechanisms led to alteration of markers of TAM like CD163 in glioblastomas(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hung et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, these suggest the possibility of molecular links between TAM infiltration and telomeres.</p>
<p>TRF2 (Telomeric Repeat binding Factor 2) is a canonical member of the telomere capping complex called âshelterinâ with reported extra-telomeric functions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">MartÃ­nez and Blasco, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Vinayagamurthy et al., 2020</xref>). We found that non-telomeric TRF2 transcriptionally activated Interleukin-1-receptor type-1 (IL1R1) in a telomere-dependent fashion: resulting NF-kappaB (p65)-phosphorylation led to the upregulation of downstream cytokines. Telomere-sensitive IL1 signalling in TNBC was found to be correlated with enhanced TAM infiltration within the TME in tumours with relatively short telomeres. Together, these implicate telomere-sensitive immune-microenvironment in tumours.</p>

<title>Non-telomeric TRF2 binding at the IL1 receptor type 1 (<italic>IL1R1</italic>) promoter is telomere length dependent</title>
<p>We have reported earlier that the telomeric protein TRF2 alters gene expression in a telomere length-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mukherjee et al., 2018</xref>). TRF2, although primarily a telomere-binding protein, was found to associate with gene promoters throughout the genome independent of its telomere-specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mukherjee et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Simonet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, in cells with relatively long telomeres, TRF2 was sequestered at the telomeres and away from gene promoters, and vice-versa in the case of cells with longer telomeres. This led to TRF2-mediated transcriptional regulation that was dependent on telomere length (a schematic of the reported findings has been provided as <bold><xref rid="figS1a" ref-type="fig">Additional Supplementary Figure 1</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mukherjee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Vinayagamurthy et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">2020</xref>).</p>
<p>We performed an RNA-seq experiment using our previously reported fibrosarcoma model of telomere elongation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mukherjee et al., 2018</xref>). The transcriptomic profile of HT1080 cells (short telomeres) was compared with HT1080-LT (long telomere cells). The difference in telomere length between the cells was confirmed using flow cytometry (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref></bold>). The HT1080-LT cells had constitutively higher expression of <italic>TERT</italic> and <italic>TERC</italic> as previously described (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref></bold>). The telomere length of the cells was further confirmed using <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization of telomeric probes (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Upon analyzing the RNA-seq data, we observed that several cytokine-related genes like <italic>IL1B</italic>, <italic>IL1R1</italic>, <italic>TNF</italic>, <italic>IL15</italic> and <italic>IL37</italic> had higher expression in HT1080 (short telomere) cells (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref></bold>). We looked at the enriched pathways (KEGG) in genes that were upregulated (2 fold or higher expression) and down-regulated (0.5 fold or lower expression) in HT1080 cells (short telomere) compared to HT1080-LT (long telomere) cells (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1E-F</xref>; Supplementary File 1</bold>). It was observed that âCytokine-cytokine receptor interactionâ was one of the top 5 most enriched pathways for the upregulated genes (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref></bold>). While telomere elongation affected multiple pathways, we were most interested in cytokine-related genes that were differentially expressed due to the now well-established focus on the telomere-immunity axis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barthel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Goronzy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hirashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Weng, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Ye et al., 2014</xref>). We revisited our published ChIP-seq data in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mukherjee et al., 2019a</xref>) and found multiple cytokine-related gene promoters where TRF2 had peaks within 1000 bp from the transcriptional start site (TSS) (<bold>Supplementary File 2</bold>). We validated these sites by ChIP-qPCR in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and found that the <italic>IL1R1</italic> promoter had the most prominent TRF2 enrichment among the sites (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1G</xref></bold>). We further performed ChIP-qPCR spanning +200 to â1000 bp of the <italic>IL1R1</italic> TSS to confirm promoter TRF2 binding across multiple cell lines-HT1080 fibrosarcoma, MDAMB231 breast cancer, HEK293T immortalized kidney and MRC5 fibroblast cells (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1H</xref></bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Telomere-dependent IL1R1 regulation in ex-vivo fibrosarcoma cells</title>
<p>Next, we tested the telomere dependence of TRF2 binding based on TL-sensitive non-telomeric TRF2 binding observed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mukherjee et al., 2018</xref>). TRF2-ChIP in ex-vivo cultured HT1080-LT/HT1080 cells showed that TRF2 occupancy at the <italic>IL1R1</italic> promoter was significantly reduced in cells with long telomeres relative to short telomere cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). <italic>IL1R1</italic> mRNA expression was significantly lower in HT1080-LT relative to HT1080 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>) conforming to the RNA-seq data described earlier (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref></bold>). We found that the IL1R1 protein was also lower in HT1080-LT cells (flow cytometry; <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>; Western Blot in <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1I</xref></bold>). Consistent with this, expression of IL1R1 at the cell surface was significantly lower in HT1080-LT compared to HT1080 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>A recent work showed that TRF2 can physically interact with p300 and p300 acetylates TRF2 at specific lysine residues(YR and IK, 2013). We found that TRF2 directly interacted with p300, evident from co-immunoprecipitation using lysate from HT1080 cells (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref></bold>). To ascertain direct TRF2-p300 interaction and consequent H3K27 acetylation, we did histone-acetyl-transfer assays using purified p300, histone H3, and acetyl-CoA (substrate for the acetyl group) with or without recombinant TRF2. Transfer of the acetyl group to histone H3 was significantly enhanced in the presence of both TRF2 and p300, relative to p300 only; and TRF2 co-incubated with p300 without H3 gave marginal HAT activity (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4D</xref></bold>). These together demonstrate a direct function of TRF2 in recruitment and HAT activity of p300 in H3K27 acetylation at the <italic>IL1R1</italic> promoter.</p>

<title>Acetylation of TRF2 at Lysine residue 293 is necessary for p300 recruitment on the <italic>IL1R1</italic> promoter</title>
<p>We sought to understand if the acetylation of TRF2 was important for p300-TRF2 complex recruitment to the <italic>IL1R1</italic> promoter. We found that several residues on TRF2 have been reported to be acetylated /deacetylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rizzo et al., 2017</xref>; YR and IK, 2013) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). To test the direct function of TRF2 acetylation in p300 recruitment, Flag-TRF2 mutants (K176R, K179R, K190R and K293R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rizzo et al., 2017</xref>; YR and IK, 2013)) were screened (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>) for effect on <italic>IL1R1</italic> expression. TRF2-K293R gave notably compromised activation of <italic>IL1R1</italic> at mRNA and protein levels (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-D</xref></bold>). The binding of flag-TRF2-293R at the <italic>IL1R1</italic> promoter was similar to TRF2-WT (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>) suggesting that the loss in <italic>IL1R1</italic> activation was not due to lower promoter binding by TRF2-293R. However, TRF2-293R significantly reduced p300 and ac-p300/CBP recruitment on the <italic>IL1R1</italic> promoter relative to TRF2-wildtype (WT) induction (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>). TRF2 293R also showed lower physical interaction with p300 in an immunoprecipitation experiment in comparison to TRF2 WT (<bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref></bold>). The TRF2 mutant K293R, devoid of H3K27 acetylation activity, gave a loss of function (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-D</xref></bold>). Therefore, TRF2-K293R was fused to dead-Cas9 (dCas9-TRF2-K293R), and dCas9-TRF2 was used as control. On using sgRNA against the <italic>IL1R1</italic> promoter, we found significant activation or downregulation of <italic>IL1R1</italic> in the case of dCas9-TRF2 or dCas9-TRF2-K293R, respectively, in HT1080 and MDAMB231 cells. In contrast, other TRF2-target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mukherjee et al., 2018</xref>) remained unaffected indicating single-gene specificity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref></bold>). We further checked the role of the TRF2 mutant K293R on other targets of TRF2 that we had previously validated(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mukherjee et al., 2019a</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref></bold>). While the TRF2 mutant K293R did not show much effect on genes wherein TRF2 acted as a transcriptional repressor, the effect on the candidate âactivationâ targets of TRF2 was not uniform as well. The Lysine 293 in TRF2 seems to be important for activation but not repression. However, while the mutant K293R diminished TRF2-mediated activation of <italic>IL1R1</italic> and <italic>PDGFR-B</italic>, it did not affect <italic>WRNIP1</italic>. This suggests that the TRF2 PTMs might have context-dependence at specific loci in the genome.</p>

<title>Cancer cells with higher TRF2 are sensitive to IL1-mediated NF-kappaB (p65) activation</title>
<p>Primarily ligands IL1A/B via receptors IL1R1/R2 activate IL1 signaling through NF-KappaB (p65/RELA)-Ser536 phosphorylation (A et al., 2010). This induces <italic>IL1B</italic> and other inflammatory genes including <italic>IL6, IL8</italic> and <italic>TNF.</italic> Here we checked NF-kappaB-Ser536 phosphorylation following stimulation with IL1B in the presence/absence of TRF2 in HT1080 and MDAMB-231 cells. TRF2-induction gave relatively enhanced NF-kappaB-Ser536 phosphorylation that sustained for a longer duration compared to uninduced controls in both cell types; total NF-kappaB levels remained unaltered (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref></bold>). Accordingly, on stimulation with either IL1A or IL1B in a TRF2-silenced condition, expression of the NF-kappaB targets <italic>IL6, IL8</italic> and <italic>TNF</italic> were reduced (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>). Further, the ligand TNFÎ± was reported to induce NF-kappaB in an IL1-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) suggesting this pathway would be unaffected by the presence/absence of TRF2. Indeed, the expression of NF-kappaB targets (<italic>IL6, IL8</italic> and <italic>TNF</italic>) remained unaffected upon stimulation by TNFÎ± in the absence of TRF2, supporting the role of TRF2 in IL1 signalling specifically (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>). Additionally, TRF2 induction enhanced the expression of <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>IL8</italic> and <italic>TNF</italic>, which was rescued in the presence of the receptor antagonist IL1RA, further confirming the specific role of TRF2-IL1R1 in NF-kappaB activation (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold>). When tested in NOD SCID mouse xenograft tumour samples, we observed that the ratio of phosphor-NF-kappaB to total NF-kappaB B was significantly higher in TRF2-induced tumours (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref></bold> (mRNA expression of <italic>IL1R1</italic>), dCas9-TRF2-K293R diminished IL1R1 levels (<bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref></bold>).This resulted in reduced NF-kappaB-Ser536 phosphorylation indicating attenuated NF-kappaB activation in HT1080 and MDAMB 231 cells; dCas9-TRF2 as expected showed activation of IL1R1 and NF-kappaB (<bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To directly test the function of IL1R1 in TRF2-mediated NF-kappaB activation, <italic>IL1R1</italic>-knockout (KO; CRISPR-mediated) was made in HT1080 cells having doxycline-inducible-TRF2: NF-kappaB activation (Ser536-phosphorylation), including upregulation of the NF-kappaB-target genes <italic>IL2, IL6</italic> and <italic>TNF</italic>, was significantly reduced following TRF2 induction in the KO cells compared to HT1080 cells (<bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref></bold>).

<p>We measured TL (telomere length) in tissues from 94 breast cancer [triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)] patients: Median TL was â¼3.6 kb (quantitative-telomeric-RTPCR (OâCallaghan et al.) (Telo-qPCR-see methods); <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, Supplementary file 3</bold>). Tumours with TL &lt;50% of median were designated TNBC-short-telomeres (TNBC-ST) and &gt;50% of median length TNBC-long-telomeres (TNBC-LT) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). TLs were confirmed by flow cytometry and in-situ hybridization (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Further, reads from the whole genome sequence of the TNBC samples were analyzed for estimation of TL using the reported pipline-TelSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ding et al., 2014</xref>): TL difference between TNBC-ST and LT was clear, and cancer tissue had lower TL than adjacent normal tissue consistent with earlier reports(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aviv et al., 2017</xref>). We found that, while there were inter-tumour telomere length variations, about â¼ 70% or more (45 out of 66 TNBC samples and 11 out of 14 in tel-seq analysis) samples for which data was available for adjacent normal tissue â showed lower telomere length in tumour samples (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>EpCAM<sup>+ve</sup> (tumour-cell marker) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Went et al., 2004</xref>) cells within the TME had significant heterogeneity in TL (lower in TNBC-ST vis-a-vis LT), whereas the difference in TL of EpCAM<sup>-ve</sup> cells was insignificant indicating TL variation in TME was primarily from cancer cells (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7A</xref></bold>). Details for the Tel-seq data have been tabulated with details of TL estimation for individual samples (<bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref></bold>). We surprisingly found that telomerase activity negatively correlated with telomere length in TNBC (<bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7C</xref></bold>), and while <italic>TERT</italic> was not found to be significantly higher, <italic>TERC</italic> was found to be significantly enhances in TNBC-LT samples (<bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7D</xref></bold>). This indicates that <italic>TERC</italic> is possibly a more important determinant for telomere length in TNBC.</p>
<p>Next, along with <italic>IL1R1</italic>, a curated set of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines commonly studied concerning tumour immunity (B Homey, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Briukhovetska et al., 2021</xref>) was screened in TNBC tissue (12 patients-6 long telomere, 6-short telomere). We found that <italic>IL1R1, IL1B, TNF and IL3</italic> were lower in long telomere samples (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref></bold>). Patient-derived organoids (TNBC-organoids from short (TNBO-ST) or long (TNBO-LT) telomeres) (<bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7E</xref></bold>) were made and tested for telomere length. We found that the expected difference in telomere length was observable between the TNBO-ST and TNBO-LT samples (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref></bold>). When the same set of genes as in <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref></bold> was tested in the TNBO samples, the same trend was observed for <italic>IL1R1</italic>, <italic>IL1B</italic> and <italic>TNF</italic>. In this case, <italic>IL10</italic> was also lower in TNBO-LT samples (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref></bold>). Secreted IL1B into the organoid media was also found to be lower in TNBO-LT samples (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref></bold>). For comparison, the same genes were looked at in HT1080 tumour xenograft and ex-vivo cells with long/short telomeres (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref></bold>).</p>
<p><italic>IL1B</italic> and <italic>IL1R1</italic> expression was significantly low in the case of tumours/cells with relatively long telomeres and notably consistent across clinical tissue, organoids, xenografts and cells, in contrast to the other cytokines which showed model-specific variation (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref></bold>). Additionally, mRNA expression correlation from 34 TNBC samples further confirmed the inverse (negative) correlation of <italic>IL1R1</italic> with RTL (relative telomere length) and the consistent positive correlation between <italic>IL1R1</italic> and <italic>IL1B</italic> (<bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7F</xref></bold>); showed key IL1 signalling genes largely upregulated in the short-telomere cells. Interestingly, <italic>TRF2</italic> showed a strong positive correlation with <italic>IL1R1</italic> and <italic>IL8</italic> but not with other pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>

<title>Telomere length sensitive IL1R1 expression modulates Tumour-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration in TNBC</title>
<p>Previous studies have implicated many telomere-sensitive genes to be related to immune regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barthel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hirashima et al., 2013</xref>). A recent study analyzed transcriptomic data across 31 cancer types to identify genes that are altered with telomere length(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barthel et al., 2017</xref>). The authors found that while sub-telomeric genes (up to 10 MB from the nearest telomeres) were altered with changes in telomere length as previously ascribed to the Telomere position effect (TPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baur et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pedram et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Robin et al., 2015</xref>), many âtelomere-sensitiveâ genes were distributed far from telomeres throughout the genome. This is consistent with a previous report that telomeres can affect transcription in regions far beyond sub-telomeres independent of TPE(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mukherjee et al., 2018</xref>). An intriguing observation made by this study was that when the top 500 genes to be altered with telomere elongation were functionally segregated, the highest number of genes fell under the category of âImmune responseâ. When a Gene Ontology analysis was done by us using these genes, âmacrophage inhibitory factor signallingâ was the top biological process (<bold><xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8A</xref></bold>). Recent studies have implicated IL1R1-related signalling in M2 tumour-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration in tumours(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). In our data, we had observed consistent change in <italic>IL1R1</italic> and <italic>IL1B</italic> in long versus short telomere tumours and also noted that IL1 signalling has been widely implicated with TAM infiltration in multiple cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Carmi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chittezhath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lappano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mantovani et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>When breast cancer transcriptomic data from TCGA was segregated into high and low IL1R1 groups, several reported TAM markers and TAM chemo-attractants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Unver, 2019</xref>) were found to be significantly higher in high IL1R1 samples (<bold>Supplementary file 4</bold>).</p>
<p>With these in mind, we checked TAM infiltration in TNBC-ST vis-Ã -vis TNBC-LT.

<p>We used the available data for <italic>TERT/TERC</italic> expression for a subset of the samples and plotted the telomerase activity for these TNBC samples (<bold><xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8B</xref></bold>). Upon checking we found that while <italic>TERT</italic> did not significantly correlate with either telomere length or telomerase activity, the correlation with <italic>TERC</italic> was significant with telomere length. <italic>TERC</italic> was earlier shown to vary significantly between short and long-telomere TNBC samples (<bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7D</xref></bold>). Therefore, in TNBC, <italic>TERC</italic> seems to be critical for telomere length. Individually, neither <italic>TERT</italic> nor <italic>TERC</italic> correlated significantly with % TAM in TNBC tissue. As expected from our other results, % TAM correlated significantly with RTL. This indicates that in TNBC tissue, telomere length is possibly a more important determinant for TAM infiltration than either <italic>TERT</italic>, <italic>TERC</italic> or telomerase activity.</p>
<p>TAM infiltration was further tested using patient tumour-derived organoids from five long and five short telomere cases. M2-type macrophage derived from THP1 cells (<bold><xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8C</xref></bold>) were labelled (red-tracker dye) before co-incubating with each of the five TNBO-ST or five TNBO-LT: Following 12 hr incubation TNBO-ST had on average 8.56% infiltration of M2-type macrophages (range: 6.54-10.9%) compared to 3.14% (range: 0.99-4.88%) for TNBO-LT (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Further, we used the IL1R1-receptor antagonist IL1RA to directly test IL1R1 dependence. The minimum dosage of IL1RA where expression of inflammatory markers was found to be altered in TNBO was used in the assays (<bold><xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8D</xref></bold>).

<p>Finally, we screened several G4 binding ligands in MDAMB231 cells and found that a few ligands (JD83, 12459 and NMM) could reduce <italic>IL1R1</italic> expression (<bold><xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8E</xref></bold>). These ligands were tested in TNBO and we found JD83 to be effective in reducing <italic>IL1R1</italic> expression at 5 ÂµM concentration (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref></bold>). We found that JD83 is also effective in reducing M2 migration in TNBO, showing promise for future therapeutic interventions.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recently we described the TL-sensitive expression of genes distant from telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mukherjee et al., 2018</xref>). Cells with relatively long telomeres sequestered more TRF2 at the telomeres affecting non-telomeric binding, and vice-versa. Proposed as the telomere-sequestration-partition (TSP) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Vinayagamurthy et al., 2020</xref>), this is independent of telomere-positioning-effect (TPE) on expression of sub-telomeric genes (up to 10 Mb from telomeres) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Robin et al., 2014</xref>). TL-dependent <italic>IL1R1</italic> activation by non-telomeric TRF2 is in tune with the TSP model. It needs to be noted that the <italic>IL1R1</italic> gene is located above 100 MB away from the nearest telomere in humans, and hence far out of the proposed 10MB range of the TPE model. Altered transcription when telomere maintenance is affected in varied contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hirashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mukherjee et al., 2018</xref>), particularly across 31 cancer types(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barthel et al., 2017</xref>), appears consistent with TSP and support our observations related to TL-dependent IL1 signalling.</p>
<p>Besides TRF2, the non-telomeric function of the shelterin protein RAP1 has been reported as part of complex with NF-kappaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Teo et al., 2010</xref>). Although TRF2 has been implicated in influencing Natural Killer (NK) cells and infiltration of Myeloid Derived immuno-Suppressive Cells (MDSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Biroccio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cherfils-Vicini et al., 2019</xref>) underlying mechanisms were unclear. However, the function of non-telomeric TRF2 in either IL1 signaling or in a telomere-sensitive role in immune signalling, has not been previously studied.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, we found that DNA secondary structure G4s present on the <italic>IL1R1</italic> promoter are necessary for TRF2 binding. Perturbation of the G4s genetically by destabilizing base substitutions, or upon using small molecules that bind to G4 inside cells resulted in reduced promoter TRF2 binding and <italic>IL1R1</italic> expression. This is in line with our earlier results showing G4-dependent non-telomeric TRF2 binding throughout the genome, and how TRF2 recruitment to specific promoters leads to epigenetic histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mukherjee et al., 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">2019b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">2018</xref>; Shalu Sharma et al., 2021). We recently noted the transcription repression of telomerase (<italic>hTERT</italic>) to be TRF2-mediated in a PRC2-repressor-dependent fashion(Shalu Sharma et al., 2021).This, interestingly, suggests the emerging role of TRF2 as a transcriptional modulator with repressor/activator (as shown here) functions depends on cofactor engagement that is possibly contextual.</p>
<p>The histone-modifying enzyme complex-p300/CBP have been keenly studied in cancer epigenetics specifically breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Iyer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Ramadan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ring et al., 2020</xref>). Recent findings also show acetylated H3K27 enrichment at the telomeres through p300-dependent HAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Cubiles et al., 2018</xref>); however role of TRF2 in p300 engagement or H3K27 acetylation at the telomeres was not investigated. Here, notably, we found TRF2-dependent p300 recruitment, and HAT activity resulting in H3K27 acetylation at the <italic>IL1R1</italic> promoter. Together, these support the role of non-telomeric TRF2 as an activating transcription factor through p300 implicating a broader role of TRF2-p300-dependent histone modifications in cancer. Further, these suggest the possibility of similar functions of telomeric TRF2 in H3K27 acetylation at the telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Cubiles et al., 2018</xref>). The lysine residue K293 acetylation on TRF2 seems to be crucial for p300-TRF2 interaction.</p>
<p>It has been noted previously that TERT can have effects on NF-kappa B signalling independent of telomere length alterations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ghosh et al., 2012</xref>). We observed that in long telomere HT1080-LT cells, while NF-kappa B signalling was retarded-a late surge of NFKappa-B activation occurred. We are inclined to think this could be a potential effect of TERT over-expression. Understanding the extent to which TERT influences the inflammatory signalling in TNBC independent of telomere length would require further work.</p>
<p>IL1 signalling in relation to inflammation in cancer has been extensively studied and consequently, IL1B blockers and the receptor antagonist IL1RA are of clinical interest (B Homey, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chittezhath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">F Balkwill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kaplanov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lappano et al., 2020</xref>). Further, the effect of altered IL1 signalling on M2-type TAM infiltration was reported in multiple cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chanmee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). TAM infiltration has been consistently linked to tumour aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Oner et al., 2020</xref>) and recent work on targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; TL and I, 2011) and modifying TAMs from M2-like states to a more anti-tumourigenic M1-like states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Jaynes et al., 2020</xref>) have shown promise as strategies for intervention in cancer. The clinical significance of blocking IL1 signalling in cancers has been widely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Briukhovetska et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kaplanov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mantovani et al., 2018</xref>). Based on our findings, we attempted TRF2- mediated single-gene-targeted epigenetic silencing of <italic>IL1R1</italic> in cell lines and ligand-based approaches in TNBC organoids. A combination of single gene editing and small molecule/ ligand-based intervention might be useful in therapy.</p>
<p>For the functional significance of TL in TME, we focused on IL1-signalling and TAM. Results from TNBC organoids here show that blocking IL1R1 using IL1RA was sufficient for restricting M2 infiltration (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref></bold>) suggesting that the IL1 signaling within the tumour cell is important. However, particularly because macrophages are known to be a rich source of IL1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Carmi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Duque and Descoteaux, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mantovani et al., 2018</xref>), and given the model-specific changes in inflammatory cytokines noted by us, further experiments will be required to understand how telomeres influence paracrine/ juxtracrine IL1 signalling between cancer cells and TAM.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that TL affects tumour-immune signalling through other immune cell types as well (implied by altered immune-response genes in TL-dependent gene-expression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barthel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hirashima et al., 2013</xref>)) and/or influences the nature of TAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hung et al., 2016</xref>), which is known to vary contextually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mantovani and Locati, 2013</xref>). These possibilities, together with the well-established effect of IL1-targeting in improving cancer prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Briukhovetska et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cristofari and Lingner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mantovani et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">2018</xref>) underline the need for further work to attain a deeper understanding of telomere-sensitive IL1 signalling in the TME.</p>
<p>Although we observed a range of telomere lengths across cancers in TNBC patients (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-C</xref></bold>), as also noted by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">LondoÃ±o-Vallejo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Pellatt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Shen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Wentzensen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Willeit et al., 2010</xref>), tumours largely have been reported to maintain shorter telomeres than normal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aviv et al., 2017</xref>). Here we found that tumour cells with shorter TL-activated IL1 signalling increase M2-type TAM infiltration, which is known to aid immunosuppression (Allavena et al., 2008). Based on our results, and other reports suggesting immunomodulation in cancers with relatively short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barthel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hirashima et al., 2013</xref>), it is therefore tempting to speculate that short-telomere cancer cells might be âselectivelyâ better equipped to evade host immune cells. To sum up- our work reveals new molecular connections between telomeres and tumour immunosuppression, presenting a conceptual framework for a better understanding of patient-specific responses to cancer immunotherapy.</p>

<title>Processing of tumour/xenograft tissue</title>
<p>Tissues collected for this study were stored in RNA later (Sigma-Aldrich) at â80 Â°C. Approximately 10 milligrams of tumour tissue were weighed and washed thrice with ice-cold 1X PBS-1 ml (filtered). About 300 microlitres of PBS was left to submerge the tissue after the final wash. Using a sanitized razor blade, the tumour was cut into small pieces (the efficiency of the digestion is dependent on how well the tumour is minced; large pieces will not digest properly and may need extra digestion time). The tumour soup was transferred into a 15 ml tube using a P1000 pipette (cut the top of the tip to be able to take all the tissue) and the volume was adjusted to 4 ml of 1X pre-chilled PBS. 80 Âµl of Liberase TL stock solution (Roche) was mixed using a vortex and incubated for 45 min at 37 Â°C under continuous rotation. The sample was checked visually; the cell suspension should look smooth (if the cell suspension still contains tissue fragments digest for an additional 15 min). To end the enzymatic digestion,10 ml PBS with 1 % w/v BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. The cells were filtered using a 100 Âµm cell strainer in a 50 ml tube and the volume adjusted to 20 ml with 1X PBS (pre-chilled). Cells were centrifuged for 7 min at 500 g and 4 Â°C. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were re-suspended in 1 ml Serum-free media. Subsequently, cells were counted and volume was made up to get a cell density of 1 million cells/ ml.

<title>TelSeq-estimation of telomere length using sequencing data</title>
<p>We used TelSeq(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ding et al., 2014</xref>) to estimate the average telomere length (TL) for each tumour and normal sample in our dataset. TelSeq was run with default parameters using WGS(whole genome Sequencing) samples with coverage â¥ 30X, except the read length parameter (âr) which was set to 150 to match with our data. Briefly, the TL was calculated as the total number of reads containing seven or more telomeric repeats (âTTAGGGâ) divided by the total number of reads with GC content 48-52%. Further, the resultant value was multiplied with a constant value to account for genome size and the number of telomeric ends. This was done separately for each read group within a sample, and then the weighted average was calculated for each sample by taking into account the number of reads per group (as weights).</p>
<p>The estimated average TL [represented in Kilobase-pair (Kb) units] for tumour and normal samples has been provided in <bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref></bold>. Overall, we found that the tumour samples have lower TL scores (Median: 3.20 Kb) as compared to the matched normal samples (Median: 4.67 Kb). Also, the TL estimates from our tumour samples (Median: 3.20 Kb, range:2.3 to 21.10 Kb) were comparable to the TCGA breast cancer cohort (WGS) (Median: 3.5 Kb, range: 1.4 to 29.7 Kb) analyzed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barthel et al, 2017</xref>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barthel et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

The plates were then covered with an adhesive strip and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Post incubation, the wells were washed as above for plate preparation. Following the washes we added 100ul of freshly prepared Detection Antibody diluted 100 times in PBS. The plate was covered and incubated for 2hrs at room temperature. Post incubation the wells were washed thrice as in the previous step. Finally for generating detectable signal we added 100 Î¼L of Streptavidin-HRP to each well, covered the plate and incubated it in dark at room temperature for 20mins. Next the wells were washed thrice as in steps above. After aspirating the wells clean of any buffer we added 100ul of Substrate Solution to each well and incubated the plates again in dark at room temperature for 20minutes. Finally, 50ul of stop solution was added to each well and mixed well by gentle tapping. The signal was measured using a microplate reader set to 450 nm, 570 and 540nm. Perform wavelength correction by subtracting readings at 540 nm or 570 nm from the readings at 450 nm.</p>

<title>RNA-seq analysis</title>
<p>RNA was extracted using TRIzol TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 was used from preparation of libraries for sequencing. Raw Illumina sequencing reads were checked for quality using FastQC (version 0.11.9) followed by adapter clipping and trimming using Trimmomatic (version 0.39) with default parameters. Trimmed reads were then aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38, GENCODE v36) using STAR aligner (version 2.7.8a). FeatureCounts (subread package version 2.0.1) was used to quantify gene expression. Quality checks were performed at each step using the MultiQC tool (version 1.10.1). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the DESseq2 package (version 1.30.0) in R (version 4.0.3). The analysis was performed by removing the effects of confounding variables such as batch and replicate using the appropriate design formula. Gene expression was normalized using variant stabilizing transformation (vst) for visualization purposes. Genes with BH-adjusted p value &lt; 0.05 and absolute Log2 fold change greater than 1 (at least 100% fold change in either direction) were taken as significantly differentially expressed.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>Adherent cells were seeded on coverslips and allowed to reach a confluency of â¼ 70%. Cells were fixed using freshly prepared 4% Paraformaldehyde by incubating for 10 min at RT. Cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Tritonâ¢ X-100 (10 min at RT) and treated with blocking solution (5% BSA in PBS) for 2 hrs at RT. All the above stated were followed by three washes with ice cold PBS for 5 mins each. Post-blocking, cells treated with relevant antibodies (1:500 for TRF2, 1:500 for IL1R1 and 1:1000 for CD44/p300) and incubated overnight at 4â°C in a humid chamber. Post-incubation, cells were washed alternately with PBS and PBST three times and probed with secondary Ab (rabbit Alexa Fluor 488(1:1000) / mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1000)) for 2 hrs at RT. Cells were washed again alternately with PBS and PBST three times and mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI. Images were taken on Leica TCS-SP8 confocal microscope/ Cytiva Deltavision microscope. Lasers of emission wavelength 405nm, 488nm and 532 nm were used imaging for DAPI, Alexa Fluor 488 secondary Ab and Alexa Fluor 594 Ab respectively. Laser intensity was kept 20% for DAPI and 40-60% for Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies. ImageJ (FIJI) software was used to calculate signal intensity (a.u.).</p>

<title>Circular Dichroism</title>
<p>Circular Dichroism profiles (220 nm to 300 nm) were obtained for representative G4 motifs identified within IL1R1 promoter and an overlap with TRF2 high confidence ChIP seqpeak. Circular Dichroism showed the formation of G4-motif with the unaltered sequence while mutated G4 sequence gave partial/complete disruption of the G4-motif under similar conditions (buffer used for G-quadruplex formation â10mM Na cacodylate and 100 mM KCl). The circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco-89spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. Experiments were carried out using a 1mm path-length cuvette over a wavelength range of 200-320 nm. Oligonucleotides were synthesized commercially from Sigma-Aldrich. 2.5uMoligonucleotides were diluted in sodium cacodylate buffer (10 mM sodium cacodylate and 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4) and denatured by heating to 95Â°C for 5 min and slowly cooled to 15Â°C for several hours. The CD spectra reported here are representations of three averaged scans taken at 20Â°C and are baseline corrected for signal contributions due to the buffer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript from Mukherjee et al examines potential connections between telomere length and tumor immune responses. This examination is based on the premise that telomeres and tumor immunity have each been shown to play separate, but important, roles in cancer progression and prognosis as well as prior correlative findings between telomere length and immunity. In keeping with a potential connection between telomere length and tumor immunity, the authors find that long telomere length is associated with reduced expression of the cytokine receptor IL1R1. Long telomere length is also associated with reduced TRF2 occupancy at the putative IL1R1 promoter. These observations lead the authors towards a model in which reduced telomere occupancy of TRF2 - due to telomere shortening - promotes IL1R1 transcription via recruitment of the p300 histone acetyltransferase. This model is based on earlier studies from this group (i.e. Mukherjee et al., 2019) which first proposed that telomere length can influence gene expression by enabling TRF2 binding and gene transactivation at telomere-distal sites. Further mechanistic work suggests that G-quadruplexes are important for TRF2 binding to IL1R1 promoter and that TRF2 acetylation is necessary for p300 recruitment. Complementary studies in human triple-negative breast cancer cells add potential clinical relevance but do not possess a direct connection to the proposed model. Overall, the article presents several interesting observations, but disconnection across central elements of the model and the marginal degree of the data leave open significant uncertainty regarding the conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Many of the key results are examined across multiple cell models.</p>
<p>The authors propose a highly innovative model to explain their results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Although the authors attempt to replicate most key results across multiple models, the results are often marginal or appear to lack statistical significance. For example, the reduction in IL1R1 protein levels observed in HT1080 cells that possess long telomeres relative to HT1080 short telomere cells appears to be modest (Supplementary Figure 1I). Associated changes in IL1R1 mRNA levels are similarly modest.</p>
<p>Related to the point above, a lack of strong functional studies leaves an open question as to whether observed changes in IL1R1 expression across telomere short/long cancer cells are biologically meaningful.</p>
<p>Statistical significance is described sporadically throughout the paper. Most major trends hold, but the statistical significance of the results is often unclear. For example, Figure 1A uses a statistical test to show statistically significant increases in TRF2 occupancy at the IL1R1 promoter in short telomere HT1080 relative to long telomere HT1080. However, similar experiments (i.e. Figure 2B, Figure 4A - D) lack statistical tests.</p>

<p>This study highlights the role of telomeres in modulating IL-1 signaling and tumor immunity. The authors demonstrate a strong correlation between telomere length and IL-1 signaling by analyzing TNBC patient samples and tumor-derived organoids. Mechanistic insights revealed non-telomeric TRF2 binding at the IL-1R1. The observed effects on NF-kB signaling and subsequent alterations in cytokine expression contribute significantly to our understanding of the complex interplay between telomeres and the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, the study reports that the length of telomeres and IL-1R1 expression is associated with TAM enrichment. However, the manuscript lacks in-depth mechanistic insights into how telomere length affects IL-1R1 expression. Overall, this work broadens our understanding of telomere biology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, entitled &quot;Telomere length sensitive regulation of Interleukin Receptor 1 type 1 (IL1R1) by the shelterin protein TRF2 modulates immune signalling in the tumour microenvironment&quot;, Dr. Mukherjee and colleagues pointed out clarifying the extra-telomeric role of TRF2 in regulating IL1R1 expression with consequent impact on TAMs tumor-infiltration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Upon careful manuscript evaluation, I feel that the presented story is undoubtedly well conceived. At the technical level, experiments have been properly performed and the obtained results support the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the covered topic is not particularly novel. In detail, the TRF2 capability of binding extratelomeric foci in cells with short telomeres has been well demonstrated in a previous work published by the same research group. The capability of TRF2 to regulate gene expression is well-known, the capability of TRF2 to interact with p300 has been already demonstrated and, finally, the capability of TRF2 to regulate TAMs infiltration (that is the effective novelty of the manuscript) appears as an obvious consequence of IL1R1 modulation (this is probably due to the current manuscript organization).</p>

<p>TRF2 overexpression resulted in ~ 5-fold or more change in IL1R1 expression. Compared to this, telomere length-dependent alterations in IL1R1 expression, although about 2-fold, appear modest (~ 50% reduction in cells with long telomeres across different model systems used). Notably, this was consistent and significant across cell-based model systems and xenograft tumors (see Figure 1). Unlike TRF2 induction, telomere elongation or shortening vary within the permissible physiological limits of cells. This is likely to result in the observed variation in IL1R1 levels.
For biological relevance, we further demonstrated that IL1 signalling in TNBC tissue and tumor organoids, and M2 macrophage infiltration, was significantly dependent on telomere length.
Details of tests of significance were included in the individual figure legends. Based on the comment here we will expand on it in a dedicated paragraph in the methods section to make the information clearer for readers.  We noticed that the stars (*) denoting statistical significance were omitted in some ChIP-experiment figures. This was likely an error during figure assembly for PDF conversion. We thank the reviewer for bringing this up; necessary changes will be made in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>The mechanism of how telomere length affects IL1R1 expression involves sequestration and reallocation of TRF2 between telomeres and gene promoters (in this case, the IL1R1 promoter). We have previously shown this across multiple genomic sites (Mukherjee et al, 2018; reviewed in J. Biol. Chem. 2020, Trends in Genetics 2023). We have described this in the manuscript along with references citing the previous works. A scheme explaining the model was provided as Additional Supplementary Figure 1, along with a description of the mechanistic model.</p>
<p>Figure 1-4 in main figures describe the molecular mechanism of telomere-dependent IL1R1 activation. This includes ChIP data for TRF2 on the IL1R1 promoter in long/short telomeres, as well as TRF2-mediated histone/p300 recruitment and IL1R1 gene expression. We further show how specific acetylation on TRF2 is crucial for TRF2-mediated IL1R1 regulation (Figure 5).</p>

<p>Here we studied the TRF2-IL1R1 regulatory axis (not reported earlier by us or others) as a case of the telomere sequestration model that we described earlier (Mukherjee et al., 2018; reviewed in J. Biol. Chem. 2020, Trends in Genetics 2023).
This manuscript demonstrates the effect of the TRF2-IL1R1 regulation on telomere-sensitive tumor macrophage recruitment. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study connects telomeres of tumor cells mechanistically to the tumor immune microenvironment.
Here we focused on the IL1R1 promoter and provided mechanistic evidence for acetylated-TRF2 engaging the HAT p300 for epigenetically altering the promoter. This mechanism of TRF2 mediated activation has not been previously reported. Further, the function of a specific post translational modification (acetylation of the lysine residue 293K) of TRF2 in IL1R1 regulation is described for the first time.  Additional experiments showed that TRF2-acetylation mutants, when targeted to the IL1R1 promoter, significantly alter the transcriptional state of the IL1R1 promoter. To our knowledge, the function of any TRF2 residue in transcriptional activation had not been previously described. Taken together, these demonstrate novel insights into the mechanism of TRF2-mediated gene regulation, that is telomere-sensitive, and affects the tumor-immune microenvironment.
We are considering the suggestion to reorganize the manuscript to highlight the novel aspects of our work more convincingly.</p>
