<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The brain’s ability to consolidate a wide range of memories while maintaining their distinctiveness across experiences remains poorly understood. Sharp-wave ripples, neural oscillations that occur predominantly within CA1 of the hippocampus during immobility and sleep, have been shown to play a critical role in the consolidation process. More recently, evidence has uncovered functional heterogeneity of pyramidal neurons within distinct sublayers of CA1 that display unique properties during ripples, potentially contributing to memory specificity. Despite this, it remains unclear exactly how ripples shift the activity of CA1 neuronal populations to accommodate the consolidation of specific memories and how sublayer differences manifest. Here, we studied interactions between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and CA1 neurons during ripples and discovered a reorganization of their communication following learning. Notably, this reorganization appeared specifically for CA1 superficial (CA1sup) sublayer neurons. Utilizing a generalized linear model decoder, we demonstrate the pre-existence of ACC-to-CA1sup communication, which is suppressed during new learning and subsequent sleep suggesting that ACC activity may reallocate the contribution of CA1sup neurons during memory acquisition and consolidation. Further supporting this notion, we found that optogenetic stimulations of the ACC preferentially suppressed CA1sup interneurons while activating a unique subset of CA1 interneurons. Overall, these findings highlight a possible role of the ACC in rebalancing CA1 neuronal populations’ contribution to ripple contents surrounding learning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Memories are not static, rather they are gradually consolidated into long-term traces across days and weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Klinzing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Squire et al., 2015</xref>). At any given moment, we are processing and consolidating an array of differing experiences. The ability to preserve distinctiveness across these various experiences is essential for memory consolidation. This requires a delicate balance between the mechanisms that facilitate the reactivation and transformation of new memories alongside those which regulate consolidation to prevent the intermingling of distinct experiences. While much attention has been focused on uncovering the principles that guide the reactivation and consolidation of memories, less is known about the mechanisms which regulate these processes and govern memory specificity.</p>
<p>During sleep, sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), neural oscillations predominantly within the CA1 of the hippocampus, facilitate hippocampal reactivations and accompany cortical reactivations of memory-related neurons, a process referred to as replay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buzsáki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Diba &amp; Buzsáki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Foster &amp; Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lee &amp; Wilson, 2002</xref>). Replay has been shown to be essential for memory consolidation as disruption or enhancement of ripples impairs or improves memory, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ego-Stengel &amp; Wilson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Girardeau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gridchyn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jadhav et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, evidence has uncovered functional and anatomical heterogeneity in CA1 neurons based on their position within the pyramidal layer: the superficial (CA1sup) and deep (CA1deep) sublayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Geiller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hall &amp; Wang, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harvey et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mizuseki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sharif et al., 2021</xref>). CA1sup neurons have more stable firing rates and higher spatial acuity than CA1deep neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harvey et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mizuseki et al., 2011</xref>). Whereas CA1deep neurons respond more to enriched environments, sensory landmarks, and reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Geiller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harvey et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sharif et al., 2021</xref>). During replays, CA1sup neurons show increased activity after spatial learning, whereas CA1deep neurons show decreased activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berndt et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harvey et al., 2023</xref>). Together, ripples and the recruitment of distinct subpopulations within CA1 drive new memory formation. Despite this understanding, the mechanisms which regulate their activity to balance consolidation across experiences remain less understood.</p>
<p>Emerging evidence has demonstrated the importance of suppression within the hippocampal network to balance neuronal excitability surrounding learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gava et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Karaba et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Norimoto et al., 2018</xref>). During pre-learning sleep, ripples depotentiate synapses which, if perturbed, impairs learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Norimoto et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, after learning, ripples facilitate the depotentiation of memory-unrelated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Norimoto et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, during post-learning sleep, hippocampal neurons initially display heightened firing rates before ultimately returning to baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Giri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wilson &amp; McNaughton, 1994</xref>). Prior studies have demonstrated that reestablishing baseline is necessary for learning, as excessive neuronal activity and synchrony impairs learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gava et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Karaba et al., 2024</xref>). Suppression of the hippocampus, then, appears to play a key role in down regulating synapses, preventing memory saturation, and promoting memory flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balduzzi &amp; Tononi, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, CA1sup neurons appear to be the most sensitive to this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gava et al., 2024</xref>). Following repetitive learning, CA1sup neurons become highly synchronized and coactive, which impairs future memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gava et al., 2024</xref>). Optogenetic inhibition of CA1sup, but not CA1deep neurons, after learning decouples and decreases neuronal activity which reduces rigidity and restores new memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gava et al., 2024</xref>). Still, exactly how facilitation and suppression are balanced throughout consolidation, and whether cortical inputs play a role in modifying hippocampal activity in this process, remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Here, we employ <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiology recording across contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and sleep to understand how communications between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampal CA1 are modified following learning. Previous studies have shown that the ACC displays increased activity immediately preceding CA1 ripples and is instrumental in CFC and memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Einarsson &amp; Nader, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Frankland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang &amp; Ikemoto, 2016</xref>). We uncovered a novel, sublayer specific, line of communication between ACC and CA1 surrounding ripples with ACC preferentially communicating with CA1sup neurons. This communication rebalances following learning, suggesting a potential role in memory consolidation.</p>

<p>We first examined ACC neuronal spiking activity surrounding CA1 ripples during pre-training sleep. Across 8 mice, we recorded 238 ACC neurons, with individual counts per animal ranging between 21–47 neurons. Most ACC neurons (224/238) displayed significant changes in activity surrounding ripples compared to baseline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>; see Methods). Of the neurons with significant changes, the majority displayed a pre-ripple peak in activity (182/224; 81.25%) while only a minority (42/224 18.75%) showed a post-ripple peak in activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). To determine whether this correlated activity preceding ripples is indicative of information flow, we implemented general linear model (GLM) machine learning decoding to test whether ACC activity preceding ripples can predict CA1 activity during ripples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) (Jun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rothschild et al., 2017</xref>). ACC spiking was binned into 200ms segments across multiple time windows to predict individual CA1 neuronal firing rates between 0-100ms after ripple onset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>; see Methods). The decoder was trained on 50% of the recorded data upon which the remaining 50% data was used for testing. All data collected for decoding was recorded during the first ∼2 hours of pre- and post-training sleep. We found that across all time-windows, ACC prediction gain using real data was significantly higher than shuffled (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1f</xref>). However, ACC prediction was greatest when ACC spiking was collected 200ms preceding ripple onset, which aligns with the observed correlated firing seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>. In accordance, all subsequent GLM analyses in this paper will use the – 200-0ms time window. We found that prediction gain for that time window was worsened after contextual fear conditioning, suggesting a learning-induced weakening in overall information flow from ACC to CA1 during ripples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>

<title>Task-inactive CA1 neurons reshape their activity with ACC after learning</title>
<p>Our GLM analysis provides a prediction gain score for each CA1 neuron, enabling us to examine how different properties of CA1 neurons may influence their prediction scores. We first aimed to investigate whether prediction gain scores across CA1 neurons differed based on their activity during training. To test this, we calculated a firing activity index ratio by comparing each CA1 neurons’ firing rate during training with its pre-training baseline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Karaba et al., 2024</xref>). Neurons were separated into two categories based on whether they increased (task active) or decreased (task inactive) their activity during training (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We found that, of the 190 CA1 neurons recorded, exactly one half increased while the other half decreased in activity during training (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). There were no pre-training baseline differences in firing rate between task active/inactive neurons (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 1a</xref>). We then asked whether prediction gain scores differed for task active versus task inactive CA1 neurons. Surprisingly, we found a significant learning induced decrease in prediction gain for task-inactive, but not task-active neurons, with no difference in prediction gain across groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). These findings suggest that task-inactive CA1 neurons are suppressed from communication with the ACC during ripple-associated consolidation processes following learning (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Given that prediction gain scores are significantly higher during pre-learning sleep for task-inactive neurons, we asked whether the overall firing rate changes during learning differed based on the neurons’ prediction score strength. Therefore, we split CA1 neurons into two categories based on their prediction gain scores: the top 50% and bottom 50% scores during pre-training sleep (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Our analysis showed that the CA1 neurons with the highest prediction scores (top 50%) had a significantly lower firing activity index compared to the neurons scoring in the bottom 50%. This suggests that neurons with greater pre-training predictive correlation with ACC are more likely to decrease their activity during learning (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). In contrast, CA1 neurons categorized based on post-training prediction gain scores do not show any difference in activity changes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The lack of difference in post-training sleep is notable, as it suggests that ACC heightened communication with task-inactive neurons is experience-dependent rather than intrinsic. These results further support our previous findings: the ACC is more strongly connected to CA1 task-inactive neurons during pre-learning sleep (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Overall, these findings support the existence of pre-training ACC-to-CA1 communication, which is suppressed during new learning.</p>

<title>ACC activity preferentially predicts CA1sup activity during ripples</title>
<p>It has been well established that functional heterogeneity exists within the pyramidal layer of CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hall &amp; Wang, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mizuseki et al., 2011</xref>). To investigate whether ACC communication is weighted differently for CA1 sublayers, we separated CA1 neurons into CA1deep and CA1sup neurons based on their sharp-wave deflection characteristics (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>; for details see Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mizuseki et al., 2011</xref>). We first examined the firing activity index during training and found sublayer differences with CA1deep neurons displaying significantly higher activity ratios than CA1sup (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Overall, CA1deep tended to increase their activity during training (task active; mean = .083) while CA1sup neurons decreased their activity (task inactive; mean= –.297) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). In terms of GLM decoding (ACC→CA1), prediction gains based on real data were significantly higher than shuffled data for both CA1 sublayers. However, ACC showed a trend to more strongly predict CA1sup neurons (<italic>p</italic> =.083<italic>)</italic>, and they alone displayed learning induced changes. Together, this suggests that ACC preferentially communicates with CA1sup neurons, and that this communication is modified following learning (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref>).</p>

<p>Task-active and task-inactive neurons were present in both sublayers despite overall differences in firing activity index between layers. Therefore, we next examined whether prediction gain scores differed for task-active and task-inactive neurons within each sublayer. We found that CA1sup neurons showed significant decreases in prediction gain following learning for task-inactive but not task-active neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). This difference was absent for CA1deep neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), indicating sublayer functional differences. We next examined whether prediction gain strength was associated with firing rate changes during training across the sublayers. We found that CA1sup neurons with higher pre-training prediction gain scores displayed significantly decreased activity compared to CA1sup neurons with low prediction gain scores (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Once more, there were no differences for CA1deep neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Overall, we find that ACC neurons preferentially communicate with CA1sup neurons during pre-learning sleep, and these CA1sup neurons are more likely to be task-inactive neurons. Learning appears to rebalance this communication, as predictability is weakened in post-training sleep.</p>

<title>Optogenetic stimulation of the ACC preferentially inhibits CA1sup neurons</title>
<p>To determine whether the ACC can directly influence the activity of CA1sup neurons, we performed optogenetic stimulation of ACC neurons during sleep while recording CA1 neurons. We unilaterally microinjected AAV-CaMKII-ChR2 into the ACC and ipsilaterally implanted an optic fiber above the injection site, alongside a recording tetrode array in CA1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 5</xref>). After waiting for viral expression, we administered 4 pulse 25Hz optogenetics stimulations during sleep to examine how CA1 neurons responded to ACC stimulations. CA1deep and CA1sup neurons both showed changes upon stimulations, albeit to different capacities (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b-c</xref>). CA1sup neurons displayed prolonged activity changes, primarily suppression, whereas CA1deep showed weaker transient responses. To quantify CA1sublayer differences, we normalized CA1 firing rates across the stimulation window (0 to 4s from stimulation onset) and compared pre-stim to post-stim normalized firing rate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d</xref>). We found that CA1sup firing rate was significantly lower than CA1deep neurons during the 4s post-stim window. Investigating further, we found that differences between sublayers lasted up to 3 seconds after stimulation, highlighting a prolonged impact of ACC stimulations on CA1sup neuronal activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4e</xref>). Of note, we replicated these stimulation parameters during wakefulness and found more muted responses across each sublayer, suggesting communication between regions is greater during sleep (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>). Overall, activating ACC produces long-lasting inhibition of CA1sup with minimal impact over CA1deep neurons, supporting a specific ACC-CA1sup line of communication during sleep.</p>

<title>Optogenetic stimulation of the ACC differentially affects CA1 interneurons</title>
<p>Within CA1 lies a dense and complex circuit of interneurons, which play critical roles in memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tzilivaki et al., 2023</xref>). We aimed to understand how local interneurons within CA1 respond to ACC stimulations. We first investigated the responses of fast-spiking putative parvalbumin neurons (PV) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>).

<p>Our CA1 LFPs exhibited a laser-evoked response peaking roughly 13ms after ACC stimulation, which precedes many of the responses seen in CA1sup (mean latency .97s, SD = 1.04s) and PV interneurons (mean latency =.13s, SD = .15s) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b&amp;c</xref>; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). This suggests the presence of a different population of CA1 neurons that respond on a scale similar to that seen in the CA1 LFP. Throughout our recording sessions, we noticed a reoccurring neuron type that showed a distinct V-shape waveform (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6d</xref>). Notably, these V-type interneurons displayed distinct activity patterns during sleep, i.e., decreasing their activity during ripples. Unlike pyramidal cells and PV interneurons, which showed delayed and prolonged inhibition, V-type neurons displayed low latency (mean latency = 17ms, SD = 22ms) and brief excitatory responses to the stimulations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). Given that V-type neuron activation precedes suppression pf pyramidal cells and PV interneurons after ACC stimulation, it is possible that V-type neurons mediate the inhibition seen in pyramidal cells and PV interneurons. However, further studies are needed to identify and test whether these neurons influence CA1 network activity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Balancing network excitability with suppression after learning has long been thought to be essential for memory formation, with sleep serving a key homeostatic role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tononi &amp; Cirelli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tononi &amp; Cirelli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Watson et al., 2016</xref>) Excessive excitability and overly strengthened synapses can hinder neuronal flexibility and saturate the capacity for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balduzzi &amp; Tononi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gava et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Norimoto et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, underregulated excitability may pathologically link multiple memory traces, leading to memory overgeneralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jinde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, regulatory mechanisms that rebalance the excitability of neurons to enable neuronal flexibility are essential for memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gava et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Karaba et al., 2024</xref>). CA1sup neurons have been shown to be particularly susceptible to memory rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gava et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hall &amp; Wang, 2023</xref>). While activation of these neurons is necessary for the encoding of new memories, their regulation and timely suppression appear equally important to evoke flexibility and enable <italic>de novo</italic> consolidation within the hippocampal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gava et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harvey et al., 2023</xref>). Our results reveal a rebalancing of communication between the ACC and hippocampus following learning. Specifically, we find that ACC displays a trend for stronger communication, as determined by prediction gain, with CA1sup neurons during pre-learning sleep. CA1sup neurons with higher prediction gains were more likely to display decreased activity during training. After learning, this communication undergoes reconfiguration. Prediction gain of CA1sup neurons is weakened and ACC shows no sublayer preference in communication. Overall, our study uncovers an ACC-CA1sup line of communication that adapts to learning, potentially playing a role in the rebalancing of network excitability for memory formation.</p>

<title>Pre-ripple ACC activity is associated with CA1sup task-inactive neurons</title>
<p>We implemented generalized linear models to decode CA1 neuronal firing rates during ripples based off the spiking rates of large ACC neuronal populations preceding ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rothschild et al., 2017</xref>). The underlying principles of this analysis posit that if ACC activity preceding ripples influences subsequent activity in CA1 during ripples, the specific activity pattern of ACC neurons (predictor cells) should hold relevancy over the outcome of CA1 neurons (predicted cells). We found this to be true across all sleep sessions and neuron types, with real ACC spiking data showing significantly higher prediction gain compared to shuffled data, indicating an information flow from ACC to CA1 surrounding ripples. Interestingly, prediction gain was weakened following learning specifically for task-inactive CA1sup neurons. This suggests that ACC activity during pre-training sleep may predispose CA1sup neurons to be less active during subsequent training. However, questions remain over exactly how the ACC influences CA1sup activity and why this information flow rebalances after learning. Below we highlight two possible explanations.</p>
<p>One possible explanation is that ACC acts to reduce CA1sup excitability to prevent rigidity by decreasing their likelihood for involvement in upcoming encoding/consolidation. We found that ACC stimulation preferentially inhibits CA1sup neurons during sleep. These stimulations were prolonged, on the order of seconds, demonstrating that ACC can induce long-lasting suppression in CA1sup neurons. It is possible, then, that our observed communication flow between ACC-CA1sup is mainly inhibitory and that reducing CA1sup neurons makes them less likely to be involved in subsequent encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guskjolen &amp; Cembrowski, 2023</xref>). Accordingly, we found that CA1sup neurons with greater functional connectivity are more likely to be task-inactive. Therefore, the ACC may act to suppress CA1sup neurons to either promote memory flexibility or enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of information coding for other CA1 neurons, including CA1deep neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balduzzi &amp; Tononi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gava et al., 2024</xref>). Nevertheless, future tests examining how ACC stimulation impacts learning and CA1sup activity are needed to parse out these details.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation is that ACC-CA1sup communication before training may reflect encoding of past experiences. Research has demonstrated that the ACC has a limited role in consolidation immediately after learning (Junyu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). Instead, memories become ACC-dependent beginning typically two days after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Einarsson &amp; Nader, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Frankland et al., 2004</xref>; Junyu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). It is possible that enhanced pre-learning communication between ACC-CA1sup is reflective of consolidating past experiences. If true, decreased activity of ACC associated CA1sup neurons may be due to the network’s shift towards prioritizing the encoding/consolidating of the new experience and thus the role of the ACC to CA1sup, consolidating past memories, is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Diekelmann &amp; Born, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Huelin Gorriz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wilson &amp; McNaughton, 1994</xref>). Future experiments casually manipulating this communication are needed to determine whether ACC activity directly influences the downregulation of CA1sup activity during training, or whether these regions are correlated partners whose activity is ultimately mediated by an external brain region.</p>
<p>As research investigating CA1 heterogeneity continues to gain attention, functional distinctions across different behaviors have emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hall &amp; Wang, 2023</xref>). Previous research has found that CA1deep neurons are more involved in reward and sensory landmark encoding, while CA1sup neurons are more involved in context and spatial encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Geiller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harvey et al., 2023</xref>). Likewise, CA1deep place cells are more likely to remap in response to local cue changes than CA1sup place cells (Esparza et al.). Here, we add to this understanding with CA1sup neurons having a diminished role in fear memory formation. There have been conflicting reports over which sublayer is more involved in learning and replay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berndt et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Geiller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hall &amp; Wang, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harvey et al., 2023</xref>). We speculate that it may depend on the behavioral task. Past reports which have shown that CA1sup neurons are more involved in memory replay, implemented spatial learning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berndt et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harvey et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, CA1deep neurons have been shown to be more important for encoding reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harvey et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we found a trend for CA1deep neurons increasing their activity during contextual fear training, suggesting a potential role in encoding fear memories. Therefore, encoding and replay of more episodic-like features such as reward or fear learning may primarily be mediated by CA1deep neurons whereas spatial memories may be facilitated by CA1sup. Yet, recent findings complicate this notion, demonstrating sublayer differences emerging between two classes of ripples that differ based on current source density profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Castelli et al., 2025</xref>). Ultimately, future studies are needed to fully dissect the functional differences among CA1 sublayers during ripples and across behaviors.</p>

<title>Optogenetic stimulation of the ACC inhibits CA1sup neurons and PV interneurons</title>
<p>We found that cell body stimulation of ACC excitatory neurons inhibited CA1sup and PV interneurons. Notably, these responses were delayed for CA1sup and PV, indicating polysynaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Piñol et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, both neuron types exhibited sustained suppression in response to stimulations suggesting that the ACC may have an indirect and broad influence over CA1 network activity rather than a direct and transient role. Sustained inhibition over certain populations of pyramidal neurons and PV interneurons may support a rebalancing of network excitability, especially during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Diekelmann &amp; Born, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Norimoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tononi &amp; Cirelli, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The identification of V-type neurons may help explain responses seen in CA1sup and PV interneurons. These neurons displayed the lowest latency responses to stimulations and produced brief excitatory bursts indicative of a more direct response to ACC stimulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Piñol et al., 2012</xref>). These neurons share features with CCK expressing interneurons, such as decreased activity during ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vancura et al., 2023</xref>). It is possible that V-type neurons may overlap with CCK interneurons. Should this be verified, CCK interneuron functionality may explain some of the phenomena we see with the optogenetics findings. Namely, CCK interneurons are known to target CA1sup and PV interneurons and induce long-term excitability changes as seen in our optogenetic experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hefft &amp; Jonas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Karson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Klausberger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Valero et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, CCK interneurons have been identified as playing a causal role in regulating the excitability of CA1 neurons during ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Karaba et al., 2024</xref>). Together, this suggests a possible ACC influence on CA1 CCK neurons, which provides sustained inhibition of CA1 pyramidal and PV interneurons during sleep in facilitating memory formation. However, these interpretations remain speculative as further studies are needed to characterize V-type neurons, and casual experiments are required to completely elucidate their role. Finally, an important caveat to mention is that it remains an ongoing debate whether ACC directly projects to CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrianova et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shi et al., 2022</xref>). While our LFP and V-type responses to ACC stimulation have a shortened latency ∼13-17ms, future anatomical studies are needed to conclusively determine connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>GLM decoding</title>
<p>We constructed generalized linear models (GLMs) with a log link function to predict spike counts of individual CA1 neurons during ripples based on population spike counts in ACC across specific time windows (Jun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rothschild et al., 2017</xref>). Spike counts of each neuron were binned in 200-ms bins relative to ripple onset: −600 to −400 ms, −400 to −200 ms, −200 to 0 ms to predict CA1 activity 0–100ms. We randomly partitioned the ripples into two equally sized datasets: one of them was used to train the GLM decoder, and the other was used for testing. The model derived from the training phase was applied to the ACC population spike data in the test set, yielding predictions for the predicted CA1 spike counts across ripples. We calculated a prediction error for each CA1 neuron that was the mean difference between the predicted spike rate and real spike rate. We replicated this same analysis for shuffled data. Prediciton gains were derived by dividing shuffled prediction error by the real prediction error.</p>

<title>ACC activity surrounding ripples</title>
<p>To calculate significant differences in ACC activity surrounding ripples, we computed peri-ripple event histograms (smoothed with a three-bin Gaussian filter; bin size, 5 ms) for individual ACC neurons. We then compared ACC spiking activity between two 250ms windows starting either 200ms or 2000ms (baseline) before ripple onset. 224 neurons (94%) showed significant differences from baseline (Wilcoxen-signed rank <italic>p</italic>&lt;.01<italic>)</italic>. Pre- or post-ripple peaks were determined whether a neurons firing rate peaked before (200 to 0ms) or after (0-200ms) ripple onset.</p>

<title>Response latency to ACC optogenetic stimulations</title>
<p>Neural activity following stimulation onset was binned (CA1sup 20ms; PV 10ms; V-type 3ms) and z scored. Response latency was obtained by selecting the first bin where a neuron showed a difference from the baseline by a z-score of ± 2 or more (minimum for 3 consecutive bins).</p>

<title>Classification of CA1 pyramidal and interneurons</title>
<p>Putative excitatory (pyramidal) neurons and parvalbumin fast-spiking interneurons were classified based on spike waveform, firing rate, and spike width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Opalka et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>). V-type neurons were classified based on waveform, firing rate, spike width, and decreased ripple related activity (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>). For sublayer classification, we examined the mean amplitude of the sharp wave deflection at maximum ripple power for each tetrode. Sharp-wave deflection means that were greater than 50μV were classified as targeting the deep sublayer whereas tetrodes with a deflection less than -50 μV were classified as superficial layer tetrodes. Any deflection which had peaks that spanned both positive and negative voltage range, were treated as intermediate and were excluded from sublayer analyses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>).</p>

<title>Fear conditioning (<italic>in vivo</italic> recording)</title>
<p>The fear-conditioning chamber used in the experiment was a square chamber measuring 25 × 25 × 32 cm, with a 36-bar shock grid floor (<italic>Med Associates</italic>). The behaviors of the mice were recorded using <italic>Blackrock Neurotech NeuroMotive</italic> video system. During training, the mice were first allowed to explore the footshock chamber for 3 minutes. They then received 3 mild footshocks (0.75 mA, 0.5 s), with a 2min interval between shocks. About 30 seconds after the last shock, the mice returned to their home cages. After ∼2 hours of post-training sleep, the mice were placed back in the footshock chamber for a 5-min contextual fear test. Neural activity was recorded continuously, including the pre-training sleep (2-3 hours), training (7.5 min), post-training sleep (2-3 hours), and contextual-fear test (5 min). Additionally, the day prior to fear conditioning, mice were placed into a novel box for 7.5min; neural activity was recorded across the pre-exposure sleep, exposure, and post-exposure sleep phases.</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>To mark the final recording sites, we made electrical lesions by passing 20-second, 10-μA currents through two or more tetrodes. Mice were deeply anesthetized and intracardially perfused with ice-cold PBS or saline, followed by 10% formalin. The brains were removed and postfixed in formalin for at least 24 hours. The brains were sliced into coronal sections of 50-μm thickness using <italic>Leica</italic> vibratome. Sections were mounted with Mowiol mounting medium mixed with DAPI for microscopic examination of electrode placements, viral vector expression, and/or optical fiber placements.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work by Hall et al provides a novel and important new finding about communication between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus: there is a clear ability of ACC to predict CA1 activity, and that is modulated by learning/experience. Furthermore, they have some evidence that the modulation differs by whether the CA1 neurons were in the deep versus superficial sub-layer of CA1. The evidence is suggestive of new and exciting findings, but some gaps and weaknesses remain to be addressed before I believe all of the authors' claims can be supported. The figures also need to be slightly better organized, and the discussion is missing a major dimension in my opinion. Overall, this is a strong submission, but with some gaps to fill.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This is a well-written manuscript - the introduction was especially clear, well-cited, and motivating.</p>
<p>(2) The sub-layer specific communication between ACC and CA1 represents the discovery of a novel and functionally impactful piece of neurobiology.</p>
<p>(3) Optogenetics was an important verification of ACC-CA1 communication, as was the analysis of neurons by waveform type.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 2: Why are the data separated into two groups from the outset? If all data are combined, is there a general drop in prediction gain from pre to post?</p>
<p>(2) 2b and 2c are important since they are complementary means to show the same thing, and it is important that they cross-validate each other, especially since the non-significant task active neuron difference in 2b appears to be nearly as strong as the significant difference to its left. A more holistic analysis can be done to compare these dimensions.</p>
<p>(3) Sup vs deep neuron definition: Did the authors have any means to validate this anatomical separation using histology or otherwise? I don't believe they described anything like that, and instead use physiology to infer anatomical location. I understand anatomy-based methods may be practically impossible with tetrodes, but this limitation should at least be mentioned, and it should be explained that without something like silicon probes or histological validation, anatomy had to be inferred from physiology.</p>
<p>(4) Superficial vs deep differences in firing rate ratio based on PG: there are many fewer CAdeep neurons, but in 4c, the trends appear to be the same pre-training, top PG lower than others. It seems the lack of difference in CA1deep in 4c may be due to the much lower power/n. This should be discussed or addressed.</p>
<p>(5) In Figure 5, the term &quot;firing rate ratio&quot; is used, and it sounds the same as in previous figures, but this is a different ratio (based on modulation by opto stim, not task).</p>
<p>(6) I would like to learn more about these v-type neurons. I understand we do not yet know about their molecular or morphologic correlate, but more analysis can be done with the current data.</p>
<p>(7) I would like more discussion of ACC-CA1 connectivity.</p>
<p>(8) Some elements may be missing from the discussion, relating baseline functioning versus post-learning function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study uncovers an inhibitory pathway from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to pyramidal cells in the superficial sublayer of hippocampal area CA1 (CA1sup). As ACC neuron spiking tends to precede hippocampal ripples, this presents the intriguing possibility that ACC inputs are selectively inhibiting particular CA1sup neurons, which could play a role in the reactivation of task-related ensembles known to take place during hippocampal ripples. Indeed, through a generalized linear model (GLM) analysis, the authors demonstrate that the ACC activity within the 200ms immediately preceding the ripple is predictive of the ripple content.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The biggest strength of the work is the optogenetic manipulation experiments, which convincingly demonstrate that stimulation of ACC pyramidal neurons activates an interneuron population with symmetric spike waveforms, and inhibits parvalbumin interneurons and pyramidal cells in CA1sup but not CA1deep sublayer.</p>
<p>An additional strength in the GLM analysis which consistently shows that ACC activity preceding the ripple is predictive of hippocampal activity during the ripple considerably more than in shuffled data for all cells and periods tested.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness of this work is that the link with learning and memory is not very well supported.</p>
<p>The only evidence of rebalancing and reorganization appears to be a single statistical test (the test in Figure 1f, p=0.013) demonstrating a decrease of the GLM prediction gain from pre-task sleep to post-task sleep; the same test is repeated for subsets of the data in the rest of the figures. As the idea of rebalancing and reorganization is central to the paper as currently written, exploring it through another measure, independent of the GLM prediction gain, should be expected. The notion that this pathway is suppressed in sleep following learning can be supported by demonstrating a decrease in any of the following measures: ACC spike-triggered average CA1sup responses, cross-covariances (Wierzynski et al 2009) between ACC and CA1sup cells in post-task sleep, or ripple-triggered cross-correlations (Sirota et al. 2009).</p>
<p>The differences between task-active and task-inactive neurons are not convincing. The separation between task-active and task-inactive neurons is to divide a distribution that is far from bimodal into what appears to be two arbitrary groups. Similarly, the authors divide cells relative to their prediction gain (&quot;Top PG&quot; and &quot;Bottom PG&quot; in Figure 2c), which fails to select for the population of significantly predicted cells (relative to the shuffle). Within CA1sup cells, after learning, there is a significant decrease in the prediction gain for &quot;task-inactive&quot; cells but not &quot;task-active&quot; cells, but it is important to keep in mind that the &quot;task-active&quot; group contains only 24 neurons, and there was no difference between the two groups of cells (&quot;task-active&quot; vs &quot;task-inactive&quot;) when directly compared.</p>
<p>Finally, it is not clear whether the identity of the pathway-responsive CA1sup neurons is fixed or whether it may change with learning. A deeper analysis into the cell pair cross-correlations or the weights of the GLM analysis may reveal whether there is a reorganization of CA1sup responses (some cells that were inhibited are no longer inhibited, and vice versa) or a dampening (the same CA1sup cells are inhibited in both cases, but the inhibition is less-pronounced in post-task sleep). The possibility of a rigid circuit dampened immediately following fear conditioning, is not discussed by the authors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Hall and colleagues investigate how the coupling of activity from ACC to CA1is altered by fear learning, showing that during sleep immediately before learning, there is evidence for increased coupling of ACC activity with neurons that will subsequently be inhibited during the learning process. They go on to show that this effect seems to be mediated most by a subpopulation of neurons in the superficial layer of CA1. This fits with previous reports suggesting that these superficial neurons are key for the flexible updating of memory. The authors then go on to show that artificial activation of ACC using optogenetics results in varied effects in CA1, including a subtle decrease in activity of superficial neurons that lasts longer than the stimulus itself. Finally, the authors present some preliminary data suggesting that different interneurons may be recruited by this optogenetic stimulation in different ways and at different times.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting paper, but much of the analysis is very preliminary, and much of the crucial data about the learning effects and alterations to cell firing are not presented clearly and fully. This is further confounded by a rather opaque description of the results and analysis in the text. Overall, there is something very interesting here, but there needs to be a substantial series of extra analyses to clearly say what this is. In many cases, more robust analysis may render the results underpowered, which could dramatically change the conclusions of the paper.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors performed difficult, dual-location recordings across a multi-day learning paradigm, which seems like it could be a really nice dataset. They delve into the circuit basis of an interesting finding regarding ACC to CA1 connectivity and how this changes before and after fear conditioning. They provide data to suggest this connectivity may be through specific and distinct subcircuits in CA1.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There is essentially no information in the text or figures about what the actual learning was, how it was done, how individual animals performed, and how any of these metrics related to learning. Looking at the methods, the authors did a number of things never mentioned anywhere in the text or figures, including novel arena exposure, contextual reexposure in extinction after learning, etc. It seems that this is a very rich dataset that has not been presented at all. I would recommend at the very least:</p>
<p>
a) Plot all of the behavioural training data, and how each mouse relates to one another - did the mice learn? At this stage, we don't know!</p>
<p>
b) Explain in the text in detail exactly what was done and why, and what this tells us about the neuronal activity.</p>
<p>
c) If there is variance in learning and or conditioning, does this relate to features in the analysis, such as the GLM result.</p>
<p>(2) Along similar lines, a key metric for most of the paper is that neurons most coupled with ACC are more likely to be inhibited during training. However, there is nothing anywhere in the paper showing these data. How do neurons in general respond to contextual shocks? The methods describe this as the average firing rate during training, normalised to pre-sleep activity. This metric seems a bit coarse and may obscure really important task-relevant dynamics. Are the neurons active at specific times, are they tuned to relevant parts of the task, and do any of these features of the cell activity also relate to the coupling with ACC? Similarly, how did the authors mitigate the influence of electrical artefacts caused by the foot shock in their recordings? Again, there is a huge amount of data here that is not being described, and likely holds very valuable information about what is actually happening. The paper would really benefit from the inclusion of these data in an accessible form, such as heatmaps of spiking, how these patterns change over time, and around e.g., foot shock, etc. Also key is how these features are altered by the variability of learning across subjects.</p>
<p>(3) A number of the effects are presented by comparing a statistically significant effect to a non-statistically significant effect (e.g. in Figure 2b, Figure 2d, Figure 4 b,c, and others). This isn't really valid - the key test that the two groups are different is either with a direct test of the difference or an interaction term in an e.g., ANOVA test. In some places, I am not sure the same conclusions will be drawn from the data with these tests.</p>
<p>(4) To what extent is defining superficial and deep CA1 neurons solely by ripple waveform an accepted method? Of the two papers referenced for this approach, one is a 2-photon calcium imaging paper that does not do electrical recordings (as far as I am aware), and the second uses this as a descriptor after defining the positions of units on an array. It would be good to clarify how accepted this is, and also how robust this is. At the very least, some kind of metric or walkthrough in the supplement as to how this was done, and how well each cell was classified and with what confidence, or some metric of how distinct and separate the two populations were (or was it just a smudge).</p>
<p>(5) In the optogenetic experiment in Figure 5, the effect on the CA1 sup neurons seems to be driven by changes in a small subpopulation of this group, with no change in the others. Related to point 2, is there anything else in the data that can pull out what these cells are? More detailed analysis of the firing of these neurons might pull out something really interesting.</p>
<p>(6) Related to this - a number of comparisons simply pool neurons across mice and analyse them as if independent. This is done a lot in the past, but it would be better if an approach that included the interdependence of neurons recorded from the same mouse at the same time were used (such as a hierarchical model). While this is complex, a simpler approach would just be to plot the summary data also per mouse. For example, in Figure 5, how do the neurons inhibited by ACC activation spread across the different mice? Is the level of inhibition related to how well the mice learned the CS-US association?</p>
<p>(7) Figure 6 is interesting, but very preliminary. None of the effects are quantified, and one of the cell types is not identified. I think some proper analysis needs to be done, again across mice, to be able to draw conclusions from these data.</p>
<p>(8) Finally, in general, I felt that the way the paper was written was very hard to follow, often relying on very processed levels of analysis that were hard to relate back to the raw traces and their biological meaning. In general taking more words to really simply and fully explain each analysis, and taking the words and figures to walk through how each analysis was done and what it tells us about the neuronal data/biology would be really beneficial, especially to someone who is not an extracellular electrophysiologist or immersed in the immediate field.</p>
<p>In summary, while this manuscript explores an intriguing hypothesis about pre-learning circuit dynamics, it is currently held back by insufficient clarity in behavioural analysis, data presentation, and statistical quantification. Addressing these core issues would greatly improve interpretability and confidence in the findings.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewers and the editorial team for all their thoughtful and constructive feedback. The reviewers provided many helpful comments which we will work to incorporate in our resubmission as we believe they will significantly enhance the quality of our manuscript.</p>
<p>An overarching critique shared among reviewers was regarding limitations in our datasets. Namely, lower N-values for certain groups make some conclusions less reliable. We acknowledge this limitation and will add more experiments to address this concern. Additionally, attention was drawn to our reliance on using the generalized linear model (GLM) for making claims about rebalancing and learning-related changes. To address this, we will work to include additional analyses such as ACC spike-triggered average CA1sup responses, cross-covariances between ACC and CA1sup cells in post-task sleep, and ripple-triggered cross-correlations, among others as per reviewer recommendations. We will also provide a deeper analysis of the weights CA1 neuron in our GLM analysis and their specific features during learning. In accordance, we will provide a clearer description of our learning paradigm including performance data for each animal and how performance relates to our analyses. Overall, we will include more analyses of our datasets across various task events such as recall, to make more efficient use of the full repertoire of our recordings.</p>
<p>Concerns were also raised regarding some aspects of our statistical analyses. During revision, we will ensure we select the most appropriate statistical measure for each of our tests. Our paper implements the use of tetrode recordings to assess sublayer identification. This approach comes with limitations, and in our resubmission, we will provide a more detailed explanation of those limitations along with a more thorough description of our measures to mitigate them.</p>
<p>Lastly, in our follow-up submission we will work to improve the written clarity of findings. Specifically, we will simplify and better explain our findings and provide clearer justification for our interpretations and choice of analyses.</p>
