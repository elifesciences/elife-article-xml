<title>Abstract</title><p>Cysteine-bound sulfane sulfur atoms in proteins have received much attention as key factors in cellular redox homeostasis. However, the role of sulfane sulfur in zinc regulation has been overlooked. We report here that cysteine-bound sulfane sulfur atoms serve as ligands to hold and release zinc ions in growth inhibitory factor (GIF)/metallothionein-3 (MT3) with an unexpected C–S–S–Zn structure. Oxidation of such a zinc/persulfide cluster in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 results in the release of zinc ions, and intramolecular tetrasulfide bridges in apo-GIF/MT3 efficiently undergo S–S bond cleavage by thioredoxin to regenerate Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3. Three-dimensional molecular modeling confirmed the critical role of the persulfide group in the thermostability and Zn-binding affinity of GIF/MT3. The present discovery raises the fascinating possibility that the function of other Zn-binding proteins is controlled by sulfane sulfur.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sulfane sulfur is a chemical state of the sulfur atom with six valence electrons that are covalently bound to sulfur atoms (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>). Growing evidence supports the widespread existence of hydropersulfidated and polysulfidated proteins in all cell types, referred to as sulfane sulfur-binding proteins (SSBPs) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic>). Protein sulfuration occurs via post-translational and co-translational pathways. Rhodanese is known to catalyze the production of sulfane sulfur and attach it to the thiol group of the protein itself using thiosulfate as a substrate (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></italic>). 3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase is a rhodanese-like enzyme that uses 3-mercaptopyruvate as the preferred sulfur donor (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></italic>). Cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase use cystine as a substrate and catalyze the production of sulfane sulfur-containing cysteine hydropersulfide (CysSSH)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>), whose terminal sulfane sulfur can be reversibly transferred to other thiols such as glutathione (GSH) or protein-SH to form GSH hydropersulfide (GSSH) or protein hydropersulfides (protein-SSH), respectively (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>). Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 2 catalyzes the production of CysSSH from CysSH (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>), thereby producing CysSSH-integrated nascent proteins. The biological function of sulfane sulfur has received considerable attention in redox biology because of its antioxidant/anti-electrophilic capacity. However, the role of sulfane sulfur in proteins is not fully understood; therefore, further mechanistic investigation is required. Although several SSBPs have been identified using various methods (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></italic>), in the present study we used β-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl iodoacetamide (HPE-IAM) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>) to derivatize the sulfane sulfur because we herein found that HPE-IAM has ability to extract sulfane sulfur atoms from SSBPs to form bis-S-HPE-AM adduct at a certain condition, thereby enabling quantitative analysis using LC-MS/MS with a stable isotope-labeled standard, bis-S<sup>34</sup>-HPE-AM.</p>
<p>In biological systems, cysteine-rich proteins can act as “redox switches” which sense accumulated oxidative stressors and free zinc ions, store excess metals, control the activity of metalloproteins, and serve as triggers for the activation of cellular redox signaling cascades (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></italic>). Metallothionein (MT), discovered in 1957 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>), is an important cysteine-rich metal-binding protein involved in three major biological processes: homeostasis of essential metals, detoxification of toxic metals, and protection from oxidative stress (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). It is recognized that metal binding to MT is thermodynamically stable, but oxidation of the thiolate cluster readily leads to metal release and formation of intramolecular MT-disulfide linkages. Zinc ions released from zinc/thiolate clusters of MT are suggested to function as signaling molecules for cellular redox homeostasis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>). Simultaneously, reduction of MT-disulfide by cellular reducing agents can occur in a process called the “MT redox cycle” (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>). However, the biochemical features of MT related to these functions have not been fully characterized. In addition, although the gas chromatography–flame photometric detector technique showed that MT isoforms contain sulfide ions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>), it remains unclear if these sulfides are indeed sulfane sulfur atoms that act as essential factors in controlling protein redox states, thereby regulating cellular zinc homeostasis. Because of its constitutive expression, this study focused on MT3, which was originally identified as a growth inhibitory factor (GIF) in the human brain (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></italic>). This study aimed to clarify the existence and content of sulfane sulfur in GIF/MT3, the redox regulation of sulfane sulfur in holo- and apo-GIF/MT3 in association with zinc release, and the effect of sulfane sulfur on the thermostability and metal binding affinity of GIF/MT3. We found that sulfane sulfur atoms provide a redox-dependent switching mechanism for zinc/persulfide cluster formation in GIF/MT3.</p>

<title>Existence of persulfide and polysulfide groups in apo-GIF/MT3</title>
<p>It is well recognized that GIF/MT3 is able to bind seven zinc ions. To determine if GIF/MT3 is an SSBP, we used an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> expression system to prepare recombinant human Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 protein, from which apo-GIF/MT3 was subsequently prepared (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To detect sulfur modification in GIF/MT3, we attempted to first measure the molecular weight of the whole protein with and without bound zinc. Using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR)-MALDI-TOF/MS, Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 was mainly detected at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 7071 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), which corresponded to the mass of zinc-free apo-GIF/MT3 and indicated that zinc was removed during MS analysis. However, apo-GIF/MT3 showed several peaks at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 7071, 7085, 7103, and 7117, with a main peak at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 7053 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) that corresponded to oxidized GIF/MT3 with nine intramolecular cysteine disulfide bonds, which presumably release nine molecules of H<sub>2</sub>. Thus, the peaks at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 7085 (oxidized GIF/MT3 plus one sulfur atom), 7103 (apo-GIF/MT3 plus one sulfur atom), and 7117 (oxidized GIF/MT3 plus two sulfur atoms) suggested that oxidized apo-GIF/MT3 contains sulfane sulfur-like species that presumably exist as intramolecular cysteine trisulfide or tetrasulfide bridges. An increase in mass of 32 Da can also result from addition of two oxygen atoms, but we attributed it to one sulfur atom for reasons described later.</p>

<p>Raman spectroscopy is used to detect bonding changes in proteins, including MTs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>). The Raman shift of Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) contained a peak at 307 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which is attributable to both S-terminal and S-bridging ligands (e.g., S–Zn, S–Zn–S) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>). Also, the peaks at 761 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 778 cm<sup>−1</sup> presumably corresponded to cysteine–metal bonds (e.g., C–S–Zn) and backbone vibrations, respectively (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>). Overall loss of zinc was indicated by the decrease in the intensity of these peaks in the Raman spectra of apo-GIF/MT3 and GIF/MT3 treated with HPE-IAM to consume sulfane sulfur atoms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) and also confirmed using inductively-coupled plasma (ICP)-MS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The peak around 400 cm<sup>−1</sup> is reported to correspond to vibrations of metal–S bridges (e.g., Zn–S– Zn) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>); however, loss of such a peak was not observed for apo-GIF/MT3 and HPE-IAM-treated GIF/MT3. The Raman peaks within the 510–520 cm<sup>−1</sup> range reportedly indicate disulfide bonds in MT (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>); in our spectra, an intense peak at 511 cm<sup>−1</sup> was observed for apo-GIF/MT3 but not Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 and HPE-IAM-treated GIF/MT3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, the S–S bonds of polysulfides are strong Raman scatterers due to the high polarizability of the bonding and lone pair electrons at the two-coordinate sulfur atoms (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></italic>). It was also shown that S–S, S–S–S, and S–S–S–S structures exhibit different Raman shifts (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>) and the different Raman bands reported for polysulfide may correspond to different geometrical forms of the molecule. To confirm the origin of the Raman peak at 511 cm<sup>−1</sup>, quantum chemical calculations were made based on three-dimensional (3D) homology modeling, as described later, of apo-GIF/MT3 structures with and without persulfides; the free cysteines and their persulfides were assumed to be protonated and some of the neighboring cysteines formed disulfides or tetrasulfides, depending on the model. The details of the model structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E–H</xref>) and the calculation schemes are described in the Experimental procedures section. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref> shows the calculated Raman spectra of apo-GIF/MT3 with thiol (–SH) groups and disulfide (S–S) bonds (apo-GIF/MT3_S2 model), and of apo-GIF/MT3 persulfide (–SSH) groups and tetrasulfide (S–S–S–S) bonds (apo-GIF/MT3_S4 model). Although the theoretical and experimental Raman spectra exhibited different overall shapes, owing to computational limitations, it is clear that the peak near 511 cm<sup>−1</sup> was markedly more intense for the apo-GIF/MT3_S4 model than the apo-GIF/MT3_S2 model. The normal mode vectors were evaluated, and the resulting assignments of these peaks are summarized in Table S1. The peaks mainly corresponded to the stretching and bending of disulfide and tetrasulfide bonds. The commensurate increase in peak intensity with the number of S–S bonds was consistent with the fact that the apo-GIF/MT3_S4 model has several S–S and S–S–S–S bonds, while the apo-GIF/MT3_S2 model has only S–S bonds. The Zn-binding models with/without persulfide also showed that the peaks around 500 cm<sup>−1</sup> were almost lost in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 without persulfide (Fig. S1 and Table S2), indicating that the peak near 488 cm<sup>−1</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>) for Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 corresponded to the S–S structure of persulfide. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of sulfane sulfur atoms in both Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 and apo-GIF/MT3.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Determination of sulfane sulfur atoms in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3</title>
<p>HPE-IAM is a relatively inert electrophile that allows the detection of sulfur atoms (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>S) by forming a bis-S-β-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl acetamide (bis-S-HPE-AM) adduct (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>). Our rationale was that if GIF/MT3 is an SSBP, the interaction of HPE-IAM with Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 should eventually form a bis-S-HPE-AM adduct that can be quantified using LC-MS/MS with the stable isotope-labeled standard bis-S<sup>34</sup>-HPE-AM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Small molecules such as H<sub>2</sub>S were removed during the purification of Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 to exclude their contribution to the measured bis-S-HPE-AM adduct concentration. In a preliminary examination, a negligible amount of sulfane sulfur in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 could be detected after 36 h incubation with HPE-IAM at 37°C. Stillman and coworkers reported that it was difficult for <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide to access an apo-MT isoform at 37°C because of its folded structure, whereas heat treatment allowed such an electrophile to covalently bind the protein (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></italic>). Therefore, as expected, the amount of sulfane sulfur detected in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 depended on the HPE-IAM concentration (plateauing at 5 mM), the amount of Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 (up to 10 µM), and the reaction temperature and duration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B–D</xref>). We performed the reaction with 5 mM HPE-IAM at 60°C for 36 h. Under these optimized conditions, each MT isoform (each containing 20 cysteine residues) possessed approximately 20 sulfane sulfurs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). None of the Cys-to-Ala mutants of GIF/MT3 possessed sulfane sulfur (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), indicating that all 20 sulfane sulfurs were bound to cysteine residues of Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3. Although the form of binding (e.g., 20 RSSH, 10 RSSSH, RSS<sub>20</sub>SR, 2 RSS<sub>10</sub>SR) was not identified, persulfide (20 RSSH) was suggested to be formed rather than polysulfide for reasons described in the discussion section.</p>

<title>Redox-based GIF/MT3 recycling system during oxidative stress</title>
<p>To explore the functional role of sulfane sulfur in GIF/MT3, we examined the stability of sulfane sulfur in the protein with or without bound zinc. Freshly prepared Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 and apo-GIF/MT3 possessed almost the same amount of sulfane sulfur (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Unexpectedly, sulfane sulfur content in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 remained unchanged for up to 28 days in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 37°C (data not shown). In contrast, in apo-GIF/MT3, sulfane sulfur content decreased markedly within 12 h of incubation, and the addition of zinc blocked any further decrease (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). This suggests that zinc ions are rapidly re-coordinated by the persulfide group in apo-GIF/MT3, thereby stabilizing sulfane sulfur atoms. To examine the possibility of forming intramolecular cysteine tetrasulfide, which is stable and cannot react with iodoacetamide in the absence of a reducing agent (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>), apo-GIF/MT3 left in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 36 h (i.e., oxidized apo-GIF/MT3) was incubated with the reducing agent tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). The presence of free SH/SSH groups in oxidized apo-GIF/MT3, determined using 5,5′-ditiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></italic>), was negligible but increased following TCEP incubation, leading to a complete recovery of sulfane sulfur atoms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). These observations led us to assume that the time-dependent disappearance of persulfide in apo-GIF/MT3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) was not due to the oxidative degradation of sulfane sulfur but rapid closure of a ring that can be cleaved by TCEP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Moreover, our method, based on TCEP-mediated reduction of tetrasulfide and subsequent trapping of sulfane sulfur atoms by HPE-IAM, was validated using the model compounds <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine-tetrasulfide (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and diallyltetrasulfide (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). In the absence of TCEP, minimal amounts of bis-S-HPE-AM adducts were detected in all the compounds examined. However, incubation with TCEP resulted in the stoichiometric detection of sulfane sulfur but not oxidized-<italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine and diallyl disulfide, suggesting that sulfane sulfur was stably trapped by HPE-IAM during the 36 h TCEP incubation. A possible mechanism of reaction between tetrasulfide compounds and HPE-IAM is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>. Thus, we confirmed that sulfane sulfur atoms of cysteine tetrasulfide in apo-GIF/MT3 could be preserved after zinc release and oxidation.</p>

<p>Several reports have indicated that oxidative modification of MTs results in the release of zinc involved in zinc signaling (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>). Incubation with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and <italic>S</italic>-nitroso-<italic>N</italic>-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a nitrosonium ion donor, induced zinc release from Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Under these conditions, the numbers of free SH/SSH groups and sulfane sulfur atoms in GIF/MT3 were also decreased by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and SNAP treatment. However, subsequent TCEP treatment nearly restored the original levels of free SH/SSH and sulfane sulfur (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The persulfide in apo-GIF/MT3 appeared to be resistant to TCEP-induced release of sulfane sulfur, although tetrasulfide was not. Overall, it seems likely that sulfane sulfur in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 acts as a reserve of sulfur to be modified under physiological oxidative stress and a component of the redox-active closed-ring structure regulated by reductants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>The interaction of sulfane sulfur species with KCN to yield thiocyanate and thiol products (cyanolysis) has been used as evidence of the presence of protein hydropersulfides (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>). Therefore, we used KCN to eliminate the sulfane sulfur atoms from Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3. KCN treatment decreased the sulfane sulfur atom content of Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 by approximately 75% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). After removing KCN, the reducing agent TCEP was subsequently added because intramolecular cysteine disulfide/tetrasulfide bridges can be formed under the condition. TCEP did not recover the level of sulfane sulfur in GIF/MT3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), indicating that KCN indeed removed sulfane sulfur from GIF/MT3. In addition to eliminating the sulfane sulfur atoms, KCN treatment also reduced the zinc content of GIF/MT3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). To examine the role of sulfane sulfur in zinc retention, sulfane sulfur-diminished apo-GIF/MT3 was incubated with zinc after TCEP treatment to reconstruct zinc-bound GIF/MT3. Re-coordination of zinc ions to KCN-treated apo-GIF/MT3 was incomplete compared with KCN-untreated apo-GIF/MT3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), implying that the sulfane sulfur is an essential zinc ligand in apo-GIF/MT3 and that an asymmetric SSH or SH ligand is insufficient for native zinc binding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p>

<title>Reduction of apo-GIF/MT3 by thioredoxin</title>

Therefore, we hypothesized that the zinc/persulfide clusters in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 may block the interaction of the protein with Trx and that the zinc ions bound to GIF/MT3 may act as a repressor of Trx-mediated S–S bond cleavage. In addition, apo-GIF/MT3 was a poor substrate for Trx-related proteins 14 (TRP14) and 32 (TRP32) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Furthermore, HPE-IAM trapping assay analysis confirmed that the Trx/Trx reductase (TR) system recovered sulfane sulfur content in apo-GIF/MT3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>) but not in the low-molecular-weight (&lt;3 kDa) fraction (data not shown). These observations indicate that Trx is a powerful enzyme that cleaves the tetrasulfide bond in apo-GIF/MT3 and that persulfide in apo-GIF/MT3 seems to be resistant to Trx as well as TCEP. Notably, a small amount of sulfane sulfur in apo-GIF/MT3 was observed even in the absence of Trx and TR, thereby supporting our conclusion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E–I</xref>) that some persulfides or their deprotonated forms exist in apo-GIF/MT3.

<title>3D modeling of GIF/MT3 with sulfane sulfur atoms</title>
<p>We generated a 3D homology model of human Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures 4MT2 and 2F5H as templates (Fig. S2). Then we created a 3D structure of sulfane sulfur-bound Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 (one sulfane sulfur per cysteine residue), Zn<sub>7</sub>S<sub>20</sub>GIF/MT3 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>), which was also used for Raman spectra modeling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-I</xref>). The predicted 3D structure of Zn<sub>7</sub>S<sub>20</sub>GIF/MT3 was almost the same as that of Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>), with the root-mean-square deviation of atom positions being only 0.789 Å. Similar results were obtained for Zn<sub>7</sub>MT1 and Zn<sub>7</sub>MT2 (Fig. S3). Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 contains a cyclohexane-like Zn<sub>3</sub>Cys<sub>9</sub> cluster in the β domain and a bicyclononane-like Zn<sub>4</sub>Cys<sub>11</sub> cluster in the α domain (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></italic>). The structures of both clusters were mostly maintained even when all thiol groups were changed to persulfides by adding one sulfane sulfur atom to each (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). Schematic structures of the generated Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 with or without sulfane sulfurs are shown in Fig. S4. Addition of two sulfane sulfur atoms, corresponding to cysteine trisulfide, disrupted each cluster structure (cf. Fig. S5 and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). When they contained one sulfane sulfur in each cysteine, the thermostability scores of MT1, MT2, and GIF/MT3 in the presence of zinc ions were higher than those in the absence of zinc ions (Table S3), indicating that these ions are key to the thermostability of MT isoforms, including those containing sulfane sulfur atoms. The thermostabilities and Cd<sub>7</sub>, Cu<sub>7</sub>, Hg<sub>7</sub>, and Zn<sub>7</sub> binding affinities of S<sub>20</sub>GIF/MT3 were more favorable than the corresponding values of the sulfane sulfur-free protein (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Conversely, placing more than one sulfane sulfur on each cysteine residue decreased the thermostability and zinc binding affinity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that zinc ions contribute to protection against persulfide oxidation and MT thermostability, while sulfane sulfur atoms participate in cysteine tetrasulfide formation, marked enhancement of metal binding affinity, and rearrangement of zinc ions. Therefore, our study provides evidence for an interdependence of zinc and sulfane sulfur and for unique structural and functional roles of the persulfide groups in GIF/MT3.</p>

<p>To confirm the presence of SSBPs in mouse brain, we attempted to isolate them from the high-molecular-weight fraction (&gt;3 kDa) of the cytosol using diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MT isoforms are believed to possess a zinc/thiolate cluster characterized by strong Zn–S bonds but facile release of zinc ions under oxidative stress (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). Here, we developed a reliable assay involving prolonged (36 h) incubation with HPE-IAM at 60°C to extract sulfane sulfur from Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 and isotope-dilution LC-MS/MS analysis. The present study provided evidence that MTs are SSBPs containing a sulfane sulfur atom on each of their 20 cysteine residues, which form a zinc/persulfide cluster. Although Capdevila et al. previously showed evidence for existence of sulfide ions in recombinant MT1, MT2, and MT4, they detected only one to four sulfide ions liberated from MTs as H<sub>2</sub>S gas using gas chromatography–flame photometric detection in strongly acidic conditions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>). These observations suggest that unlike our assay, this method is likely to underestimate the sulfane sulfur content of proteins. While our assay has difficulty detecting sulfane sulfur in oxidized polysulfide bridges such as cysteine tetrasulfide, which is supported by a recent observation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>), a TCEP cleavage step enabled this problem to be overcome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Sulfane sulfur modification of MTs appears to be universal because similar sulfane sulfur contents were observed in recombinant human MT1, MT2, and GIF/MT3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Although MTs have been mainly studied in vertebrates, their diversity and distribution have been widely reported (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></italic>). So far, three functional MT forms (reduced apoprotein, oxidized apoprotein, and metalated protein) are known. In this current study, we propose that sulfane sulfur is another key factor involved in regulation of MT function that may have major implications for several biological functions.</p>
<p>Oxidation of sulfane sulfur in GIF/MT3 is a fascinating mechanism of zinc release that does not involve direct thiol oxidation. There is little doubt that zinc release from the zinc/persulfide cluster in GIF/MT3 will be sensitive to mild oxidative stress because the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> value of cysteine persulfide is lower than that of cysteine (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></italic>). However, formation of cysteine tetrasulfides following zinc release from the oxidized GIF/MT3 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>) represents a paradigm shift in GIF/MT3 biochemistry. The sulfane sulfur atoms of MT-tetrasulfide are stably retained and can reacquire zinc after they are reduced, as shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>. Tetrasulfides, whose presence in apo-GIF/MT3 was shown (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>), are presumably formed in response to structural frustration of the disulfide form, as reported for the sulfide-responsive transcriptional repressor, SqrR (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>). In our preliminary study, we failed to directly identify cysteine tetrasulfide during reaction of apo-GIF/MT3 with pronase because alkaline hydrolysis of polysulfide makes it unstable in water (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></italic>). We therefore speculate that cysteine tetrasulfide groups exist in an acidic local environment of apo-GIF/MT3 and that Trx rapidly interacts with and cleaves tetrasulfide S–S bonds because of their markedly low p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values, resulting in the regeneration of persulfide groups.</p>
<p>It is believed that the function of the sulfane sulfur moiety in proteins is to protect cysteine thiols from irreversible oxidation (e.g., to sulfinic acid and sulfonic acid) because such oxidative modifications of cysteine persulfides can be reversed by Trx-mediated reduction (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></italic>). In other words, sulfane sulfurs act as “sacrificial” sulfur atoms. However, in this study, we discovered that sulfane sulfur has a higher affinity for zinc than thiol (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and is stored in non-sacrificial tetrasulfide groups when oxidized (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). As a result, tetrasulfides in oxidized-apo-GIF/MT3 are reduced by the Trx system, with Trx being regenerated to a reduced form by NADPH and TR, thereby enabling reacquisition of zinc ions by the persulfide moiety. In contrast, Trx has been proposed to reduce albumin-persulfide (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></italic>). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that apo-GIF/MT3-persulfide is rapidly changed into a different conformation that is topologically resistant to Trx reduction. In other words, Trx may be substrate-specific.</p>
<p>While our proposed mechanism of MT redox regulation is consistent with that proposed by Maret et al. (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>), discovery of sulfane sulfur in MTs explains unknown features of MT redox biochemistry. Maret and coworkers showed that approximately 50% of MT existed in the apo form in the rat brain, although they did not examine specific isoforms (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>). A reasonable explanation for this observation is that reduced apo-MT can undergo redox-coupled reactions with oxidized proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></italic>), leading to the formation of apo-MT-tetrasulfide, which loses its zinc ion-binding capability. GIF/MT3 is a constitutive form predominantly expressed in the brain (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>) and protects against Alzheimer’s disease (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></italic>). Notably, several studies have indicated that Trx acts as a protection factor in Alzheimer’s disease (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></italic>). Although the involvement of GIF/MT3 and Trx in regulating this disorder has not been elucidated, Trx-mediated reduction of apo-GIF/MT3 may lead to the reduction of unknown proteins that might suppress the onset of Alzheimer’s disease because of the high antioxidant capabilities of apo-MT persulfides. Further studies are required to identify the redox-coupled protein dynamics associated with the reduced form of apo-GIF/MT3 and their relevance to the molecular basis of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform 3D structural modeling of an SSBP with or without sulfane sulfur. Our structural modeling studies revealed that, like Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3, the seven zinc ions of Zn<sub>7</sub>S<sub>20</sub>GIF/MT3 were tetrahedrally coordinated by the array of 20 sulfane sulfurs but not by cysteine thiols, thereby forming two zinc/persulfide clusters (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8A</xref> and S3, cyclohexane-like Zn<sub>3</sub>S<sub>9</sub> and bicyclononane-like Zn<sub>4</sub>S<sub>11</sub> clusters were conserved even in the presence of 20 sulfane sulfurs without affecting the overall structure of the MTs. Nevertheless, sulfane sulfur is important for both metal binding affinity and protein stability (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and thus MT function. We suggest that the 20 sulfane sulfurs are evenly distributed among 20 cysteine residues in GIF/MT3 for the following reasons: i) zinc binding of Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 was suggested to involve a C–S–S–Zn rather than Zn–S–Zn structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>); ii) addition of two or three sulfane sulfurs to each cysteine residue in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT3 decreased its stability (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>); iii) the polysulfide form of sulfane sulfur seems to have difficulty maintaining zinc/sulfur clusters in GIF/MT3 (Fig. S5). However, one of the limitations of our study is that we did not directly obverse such zinc-persulfide cluster itself.</p>
<p>Because protein sulfuration occurs during nascent protein translation, SSBPs appear to be ubiquitous in cells. In fact, we previously reported that a variety of cellular proteins were per/poly-sulfidated, as determined using a tag-switch-tag assay. We have recently characterized several SSBPs such as GSH S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></italic>), dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ethylmalonic encephalopathy 1 (ETHE1) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>), and now MT1, MT2, and GIF/MT3. As shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, the present assay also confirmed that there are numerous SSBPs in addition to GIF/MT3 in the cytosol of the mouse brain. Notably, 3,207 zinc-binding proteins in the human proteome have been identified with three and four zinc ligands, with 40% of the latter category consisting of Cys4 coordination (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></italic>). Once oxidants react with thiols in a zinc finger domain, zinc is released from the coordination site, resulting in inhibition of the zinc finger protein function. However, disulfide formation in the zinc finger domain is reversed by reducing agents such as GSH.</p>
<p>We speculate that sulfane sulfur is a key component of such a “zinc redox switch”, enabling it to provide high-affinity for zinc and protection against excess oxidative/electrophilic stress. Supporting our notion, zinc finger proteins such as tristetraprolin (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></italic>), androgen receptor (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></italic>), and prolyl hydroxylase (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></italic>) were reported to undergo persulfidation by H<sub>2</sub>S. In this context, H<sub>2</sub>S inhibits enzymatic activity of tristetraprolin and androgen receptor, but increases enzymatic activity of prolyl hydroxylase. A possible explanation for this difference is that excess exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S may cause protein polysulfidation, thereby disturbing the native protein structure. Our findings provide structural and mechanistic insights into the role of sulfane sulfur in hold-and-release regulation of zinc ions by zinc-binding proteins. A future research goal is to investigate the universal role of sulfane sulfur atoms in redox regulation of all zinc-finger proteins.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have provided evidence that S-sulfuration based on addition of sulfane sulfur plays a central role in hold-and-release regulation of zinc by GIF/MT3. Our study has further revealed a fascinating redox-dependent switching mechanism of a zinc/persulfide cluster involving formation of a cystine tetrasulfide bridge. We believe that our findings open new directions of research in redox and metals biology.</p>

The column was washed with buffer B at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, then SSBPs were eluted using 200 mL buffer B with a linear gradient of 0–0.4 M NaCl and 5 mL fractions were collected. The major SSBP-containing fractions (fractions 40–44 in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>) were filtered using a 3 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit and centrifugation at 14,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4°C with buffer A seven times to concentrate the protein and exchange the buffer.

The total running time, including initial conditioning of the column, was 90 min. The eluted peptides were transferred to the nanoelectrospray source of a quadrupole TOF-MS instrument (Synapt High Definition Mass Spectrometry system, Waters) via a Teflon capillary union and pre-cut PicoTip (Waters). ESI was used with a capillary voltage of 3 kV and sampling cone voltage of 35 V.

Then, low-molecular-weight molecules were removed using a 3 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit. The resulting protein was concentrated to ≈4 mg/mL using a 5 kDa centrifugal concentrator (Vivaspin; Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany). For drop-deposition Raman spectroscopy, 0.5 μL of each protein sample was first dried onto a hydrophobic quartz coverslip for up to 15 min under vacuum. Spectra were then collected from the “coffee ring” of each drop, where proteins were found in the absence of bulk salt, using a Raman microscope system with a charge-coupled-device detector (InVia, Renishaw, New Mills, UK). Each sample was excited using a 785 nm diode laser focused through a Leica 50× (0.75 numerical aperture) short-working-distance air objective, with ≈100 mW power incident on each sample. The laser was focused onto the sample using an on-screen camera. WiRE software (v4.1, Renishaw) was used for spectral acquisition, data collection, and cosmic ray removal. The Raman system was calibrated against the 520 cm<sup>−1</sup> reference peak of silicon prior to each experiment. All spectra were processed using the IrootLab plugin (0.15.07.09-v) in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., MA, United States). The background was carefully subtracted from the spectra using blank quartz spectra, then the background-corrected spectra were smoothed using a wavelet denoising function.

A high-molecular-weight cytosolic fraction from mouse brain or purified MT protein solution was incubated with HPE-IAM under the appropriate conditions to yield bis-S-HPE-AM adducts.

To construct a model of GIF/MT3 (National Center for Biotechnology Information reference sequence: NP_005945.1), the crystal structure of rat MT2 (PDB code: 4MT2) and the NMR structure of the α domain of human GIF/MT3 (PDB code: 2F5H) were used as templates. Following the alignment of the primary structures (Fig. S2A), the sequence similarities of the templates were 67.7% and 100% compared with the β domain and α domain of GIF/MT3, respectively. The metals in the templates were changed as desired or deleted to model apo-GIF/MT3. To construct the GIF/MT3 model, 100 independent models of the target protein were built using the segment-matching procedure in MOE. Refinement of the model with the lowest generalized Born/volume integral (GVBI) was achieved by energy minimization of outlier residues in Ramachandran plots generated within MOE. The final model of GIF/MT3 exhibited a 3D structure similar to those of MT2 and the α domain of GIF/MT3 (Fig. S2B). The same method was used to construct homology models of human MT1A and MT2, with rat MT2 as the template for MT1, and both rat MT2 and the α domain of human MT2 (PDB code: 1MHU) as templates for MT2 (Fig. S3).</p>

<title>Quantum chemistry calculations</title>
<p>Since the whole structure of the GIF/MT3 is quite large, we divided MT3 into two domains (α-domain and β-domain) in the quantum chemistry calculations in order to assign the observed Raman spectra. We have independently constructed α-domain and β-domain models of apo-GIF/MT3 with disulfide bonds between neighboring cysteines or tetrasulfide bonds. These models are referred to as apo-MT3_S2 and apo-MT3_S4, respectively, and are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E–H</xref>. The initial structures were taken from the results of the homology modeling by MOE (see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). H atoms were placed instead of Zn-S bonds in the models. To consider apo-MT3 models, the nearest S atoms are supposed to form disulfide or tetrasulfide bond. The Raman spectra were computed by frequency calculation. All quantum chemical calculations were carried out at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level by GAUSSIAN16 (Revision C.01, Gaussian, Inc., Wallingford CT, 2016). After obtaining the Raman spectra for the α- and β-domains, these spectra are summed to obtain the Raman spectra of the apo-GIF/MT3 as illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>. The corresponding Zn-binding models were constructed and evaluated the Raman spectra with the same manner.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>useful</bold> evidence that GIF/MT-3 harbors sulfane sulfur, which may play a role in zinc coordination. The study includes a variety of well-designed assays to support the authors' hypothesis, revealing that sulfane sulfur is released from MT-3.

<p>The manuscript by Dr. Shinkai and colleagues is about the posttranslational modification of a highly important protein, MT3, also known as the growth inhibitory factor. Authors postulate that MT3, or generally all MT isoforms, are sulfane sulfur binding proteins. The presence of sulfane sulfur at each Cys residue has, according to the authors, a critical impact on redox protein properties and almost does not affect zinc binding. They show a model in which 20 Cys residues with sulfane sulfur atoms can still bind seven zinc ions in the same clusters as unmodified protein. They also show that recombinant MT3 (but also MT1 and MT2) protein can react with HPE-IAM, an efficient trapping reagent of persulfides/polysulfides. This reaction performed in a new approach (high temperature and high reagent concentration) resulted in the formation of bis-S-HPE-AM product, which was quantitatively analyzed using LC-MS/MS. This analysis indicated that all Cys residues of MT proteins are modified by sulfane sulfur atoms. The authors performed a series of experiments showing that such protein can bind zinc, which dissociates in the reaction with hydrogen peroxide or SNAP. They also show that oxidized MT3 is reduced by thioredoxin. It gives a story about a new redox-dependent switching mechanism of zinc/persulfide cluster involving the formation of cystine tetrasulfide bridge.</p>
<p>The whole story is hard to follow due to the lack of many essential explanations or full discussion. What needs to be clarified is the conclusion (or its lack) about MT3 modification proven by mass spectrometry. Figure 1B shows the FT-ICR-MALDI-TOF/MS spectrum of recombinant MT3. It clearly shows the presence of unmodified MT3 protein without zinc ions. Ions dissociate in acidic conditions used for MALDI sample preparation. If the protein contained all Cys residues modified, its molecular weight would be significantly higher. Then, they show the MS spectrum (low quality) of oxidized protein (Fig. 1C), in which new signals (besides reduced apo-MT3) are observed. They conclude that new signals come from protein oxidation and modification with one or two sulfur atoms. If the conclusion on Cys residue oxidation is reasonable, how this protein contains sulfur is unclear. What is the origin of the sulfur if apo-MT does not contain it? Oxidized protein was obtained by acidification of the protein, leading to zinc dissociation and subsequent neutralization and air oxidation. Authors should perform a detailed isotope analysis of the isotopic envelope to prove that sulfur is bound to the protein. They say that the +32 mass increase is not due to the appearance of two oxygen donors. They do not provide evidence. This protein is not a sulfane sulfur binding protein, or its minority is modified. Moreover, it is unacceptable to write that during MT3 oxidation are &quot;released nine molecules of H2&quot;. How is hydrogen molecule produced? Moreover, zinc is not &quot;released&quot;, it dissociates from protein in a chemical process.</p>
<p>Another important point is a new approach to the HPE-IAM application. Zinc-binding MT3 was incubated with 5 mM reagent at 60oC for 36 h. Authors claim that high concentration was required because apoMT3 has stable conformation. Figure 2B shows that product concentration increases with higher temperature, but it is unclear why such a high temperature was used. Figure 1D shows that at 37oC, there is almost no reaction at 5 mM reagent. Changing parameters sounds reasonable only when the reaction is monitored by mass spectrometry. In conclusion, about 20 sulfane sulfur atoms present in MT3 would be clearly visible. Such evidence was not provided. Increased temperature and reagent concentration could cause modification of cysteinyl thiol/thiolates as well, not only persulfides/polysulfides. Therefore, it is highly possible that non-modified MT3 protein could react with HPE-IAM, giving false results. Besides mass spectrometry, which would clearly prove modifications of 20 Cys, authors should use very important control, which could be chemically synthesized beta- or alfa-domain of MT3 reconstituted with zinc (many protocols are present in the literature). Such models are commonly used to test any kind of chemistry of MTs. If a non-modified chemically obtained domain would undergo a reaction with HPE-IAM under such rigorous conditions, then my expectation would be right.</p>
<p>- The remaining experiments provided in the manuscript can also be applied for non-modified protein (without sulfane sulfur modification) and do not provide worthwhile evidence. For instance, hydrogen peroxide or SNAP may interact with non-modified MTs. Zinc ions dissociate due to cysteine residue modification, and TCEP may reduce oxidized residue to rescue zinc binding. Again, mass spectrometry would provide nice evidence.</p>
<p>- The same is thioredoxin (Fig. 7) and its reaction with oxidized MT3. Nonmodified and oxidized MT3 would react as well.</p>
<p>- If HPE-IAM reacts with Cys residues with unmodified MT3, which is more likely the case under used conditions, the protein product of such reaction will not bind zinc. It could be an explanation of the cyanolysis experiment (Fig. 6).</p>
<p>- Figure 4 shows the reactivity of (pol)sulfides with TCEP and HPE-IAM. What are redox potentials? Do they correlate with the obtained results?</p>
<p>- Raman spectroscopy experiments would illustrate the presence of sulfane sulfur in MT3 only if all Cys were modified.</p>
<p>- The modeling presented in this study is very interesting and confirms the flexibility of metallothioneins. MT domains are known to bind various metal ions of different diameters. They adopt in this way to larger size the ions. The same mechanism could be present from the protein site. The presence of 9 or 11 sulfur atoms in the beta or alfa domain would increase the size of the domains without changing the cluster structure.</p>
<p>- Comment to authors. Apo-MT is not present in the cell. It exists as a partially metallated species. The term &quot;apo-MT&quot; was introduced to explain that MTs are not fully saturated by metals and function as a metal buffer system. Apo-MT comes from old ages when MT was considered to be present only in two forms: apo-form and fully saturated forms.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, the authors reveal that GIF/MT-3 regulates zinc homeostasis depending on the cellular redox status. The manuscript technically sounds, and their data concretely suggest that the recombinant MTs, not only GIF/MT-3 but also canonical MTs such as MT-1 and MT-2, contain sulfane sulfur atoms for the Zn-binding. The scenario proposed by the authors seems to be reasonable to explain the Zn homeostasis by the cellular redox balance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The data presented in the manuscript solidly reveal that recombinant GIF/MT-3 contains sulfane sulfur.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
It is still unclear whether native MTs, in particular, induced MTs in vivo contain sulfane sulfur or not.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors were trying to show that a novel neuronal metallothionein of poorly defined function, GIF/MT3, is actually heavily persulfidated in both the Zn-bound and apo (metal-free) forms of the molecule as purified from a heterologous or native host. Evidence in support of this conclusion is compelling, with both spectroscopic and mass spectrometry evidence strongly consistent with this general conclusion. The authors would appear to have achieved their aims.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The analytical data are compelling in support of the author's primary conclusions are strong. The authors also provide some modeling evidence that strongly supports the contention that MT3 (and other MTs) can readily accommodate sulfane sulfur on each of the 20 cysteines in the Zn-bound structure, with little perturbation of the structure. This is not the case with Cys trisulfides, which suggests that the persulfide-metallated state is clearly positioned at lower energy relative to the immediately adjacent thiolate- or trisulfidated metal coordination complexes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The biological significance of the findings is not entirely clear. On the one hand, the analytical data are clearly solid (albeit using a protein derived from a bacterial over-expression experiment), and yes, it's true that sulfane S can protect Cys from overoxidation, but everything shown in the summary figure (Fig. 8D) can be done with Zn release from a thiol by ROS, and subsequent reduction by the Trx/TR system. In addition, it's long been known that Zn itself can protect Cys from oxidation. I view this as a minor weakness that will motivate follow-up studies. Fig. 1 was incomplete in its discussion and only suggests that a few S atoms may be covalently bound to MT3 as isolated. This is in contrast to the sulfate S &quot;release&quot; experiment, which I find quite compelling.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>
The impact will be high since the finding is potentially disruptive to the metals in the biology field in general and the MT field for sure. The sulfane sulfur counting experiment (the HPE-IAM electrophile trapping experiment) may well be widely adopted by the field. Those of us in the metals field always knew that this was a possibility, and it will interesting to see the extent to which metal-binding thiolates broadly incorporate sulfate sulfur into their first coordination shells.</p>
