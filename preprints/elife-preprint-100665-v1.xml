<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), an X-linked muscular dystrophy, is mostly caused by an in-frame deletion of DMD. BMD severity varies from asymptomatic to severe, associated with the genotype of DMD. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.</p>
<p>We established BMD mice carrying three representative exon deletions: ex45–48 del., ex45–47 del., and ex45–49 del. (d45–48, d45–47 and d45–49), with high frequencies and different severities in the human BMD hotspot. All three BMD mice showed muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, and fibrosis, but these changes appeared at different times for each exon deletion, consistent with the severities obtained by the natural history study of BMD. BMD mice showed site-specific muscle changes, unlike <italic>mdx</italic> mice, which showed diffuse muscle changes, and we demonstrated selective type IIa fiber reduction in BMD mice. Furthermore, BMD mice showed sarcolemmal neuronal nitric oxide synthetase (nNOS) reduction and morphological capillary changes around type IIa fibers.</p>
<p>These results suggest that capillary changes caused by nNOS reduction may be associated with the mechanism of skeletal muscle degeneration and type IIa fiber reduction in BMD mice. BMD mice may be useful in elucidating the pathomechanisms and developing therapeutic strategies for human BMD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), an X-linked muscle disorder, is characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness, mostly caused by an in-frame variant in <italic>DMD</italic> encoding the sarcolemmal protein dystrophin. In BMD muscle tissues, truncated and reduced dystrophin is expressed; therefore, its clinical status is generally milder than that of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an allelic disorder with complete loss of dystrophin (<italic>Koenig et., 1989</italic>). BMD is clinically heterogeneous, with some affected individuals experiencing a near-normal lifestyle and lifespan, while others lose the ability to walk in their late teens or early 20s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beggs et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Bushby et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Comi et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>A natural history study of patients with BMD revealed that part of the skeletal muscle phenotype may be associated with the genotype of <italic>DMD</italic> and that there are several patterns of exon deletions associated with severe or milder phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nakamura et al., 2023</xref>). In-frame exon deletions of BMD accumulate in exon 45–55 (first hot spot) or exon 3–7 (second hot spot) of DMD. Particularly, 80 percent of all in-frame deletions were included in the first hotspot: exon 45–55. Among these, the deletion of exon 45–47 (d45–47) is the most frequent, approximately 30 percent of patients with BMD have this in-frame deletion. Deletion of exon 45–48 (d45–48) is the second most frequent; approximately 18 percent of patients with BMD have this deletion and a milder phenotype than D45–47. In contrast, the deletion of exon 45–49 (d45–49) has a more severe phenotype than D45–47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nakamura et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between the pathomechanisms of disease severity and each exon deletion remains unclear. In the muscle tissue of patients with BMD, truncated dystrophin expression levels are lower than those of healthy controls, and dystrophin immunohistochemistry shows a ‘faint and patchy’ staining pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beggs et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jimi et al., 1992</xref>). The correlation between the severity and expression levels of truncated dystrophin is still conflicting, and the truncated dystrophin expression levels in muscle tissues are well correlated with the clinical severity of BMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anthony et al., 2011</xref>). However, there is another report that truncated dystrophin levels do not appear to be a major determinant of disease severity in BMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Van Den Bergen et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Dystrophin is a large filamentous protein with a molecular weight of 427 kDa that protects the sarcolemma from mechanical stress during muscle contraction. Dystrophin connects to cytoskeletal protein families that can assemble into macromolecular structures with a large number of proteins and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Le Rumeur et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, a report suggested that the BMD clinical heterogeneity is associated with the changes in dystrophin structure generated by exon deletion using an in silico prediction model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nicolas et al., 2015</xref>). They expect that the d45–48 and d45–51 displayed a structure similar to that of wild-type dystrophin (hybrid repeat), whereas the d45–47 and d45–49 leads to proteins with an unrelated structure (fractional repeat) among the representative exon deletions in the BMD variant hotspot. Exon deletions associated with fractional repeats are expected to lead to a more severe BMD phenotype than those associated with hybrid repeats; however, the influence of changes in dystrophin structure on clinical BMD severity is not fully understood.</p>
<p>Recently, two animal models of BMD have been developed. One group generated the first BMD rat model carrying a deletion of exon 3–16 of the rat DMD using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Teramoto et al., 2020</xref>). This BMD rat model exhibited muscle degeneration, muscle fibrosis, heart fibrosis, and reduced truncated dystrophin levels. Another group generated a BMD mouse model carrying a deletion in exon 45–47 of the mouse DMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Heier et al., 2023</xref>). The BMD mice show skeletal muscle weakness, heart dysfunction, increased myofiber size variability, increased centronuclear fibers, and reduced truncated dystrophin. However, underlying mechanism of BMD severity remain unclear, and comparative investigations using several BMD animal models carrying exon deletions associated with various severities are necessary.</p>
<p>To clarify the issue, we generated three types of BMD mice with representative exon deletions in the BMD hotspots: d45–47, d45–48 and d45–49 using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and compared the phenotypes and histopathological changes.</p>

<title>Establishment of BMD mice carrying d45348, d45347 and d45349 in <italic>DMD</italic></title>
<p>To create mouse strains carrying three in-frame deletions: d45–48, d45–47 and d45–49, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique to introduce approximately 160,000 bp genomic deletions into the endogenous murine DMD. Guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed to target protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences upstream of DMD exon 45 and downstream of DMD exons 47, 48, and 49. We confirmed the genomic deletion of dystrophin exons 45–47, 45–48, and 45–49 by cDNA sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). By analyzing the deletion breakpoint, we confirmed that double-strand breaks were formed inside the sequences corresponding to gRNAs in d45–48, d45–47 and d45–49 mice (<xref rid="figS1_1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). We performed phenotypic testing of WT, d45–48, d45–47, d45–49 and <italic>mdx</italic> mice at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months of age. d45–49 and <italic>mdx</italic> mice had large body weights at 1 and 3 months of age, but the d45–48 and d45–47 mice did not differ from that in WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Serum creatinine kinase (CK) levels at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months were high in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, and were 2–4 to fold higher in all BMD mice after 3 months compared in WT mice, although the difference was not statistically significant (<xref rid="figS1_1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>d45349 mice showed muscle weakness at an earlier age compared to d45348 and d45347 mice</title>
<p>To assess the muscle strength of the BMD mice, we conducted forelimb grip tests at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12 months of age, and the hanging wire tests at 3 months of age, and compared with WT and <italic>mdx</italic> mice. At the age of 1 month, d45–47, d45–49 and <italic>mdx</italic> mice showed reduced forelimb grip strength compared to WT and d45–48 mice. mice. However, the weakness of d45–47 mice was milder compared to d45–49, and <italic>mdx</italic> mice of the same age were used. At the age of 3 months, reduced grip strength in the d45–47 mice was remarkable, and d45–48 mice exhibited a slight reduction in forelimb grip strength. Finally, after 6 months, all three BMD mice reached the same levels of reduced forelimb grip strength, although not as much as that of <italic>mdx</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The hanging wire test showed reduced suspension times in the d45–49 and <italic>mdx</italic> mice, although the WT, d45–48 and d45–47 mice exceeded the 600 s time limit (<xref rid="figS1_1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the observation using video for the hanging wire test revealed changes in the mice moving during wire grasping: WT, d45–48 and d45–47 mice could quickly bring their posterior legs up toward their faces and catch the wire; in contrast, d45–49 and <italic>mdx</italic> mice could not raise their posterior legs above their chest (<xref rid="figV1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-video 1</xref>).</p>

<title>d45349 mice showed earlier muscle degeneration and fibrosis compared with d45 348 and d45347 mice</title>
<p>Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles showed muscle degeneration and regeneration (i.e., opaque fibers, necrotic fibers, and centronuclear fibers) in all BMD and <italic>mdx</italic> mice, except for WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Opaque fibers, which are thought to be precursors of necrotic fibers, increased at an earlier age of 1 month in d45–49 mice; in contrast, the d45–47 mice exhibited increased opaque fibers at 3 months. In d45–48 mice, opaque fibers tended to increase at 3 months, but this was not statistically different from that of WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Necrotic fibers were seen only in <italic>mdx</italic> mice at 1 month, but were also increased in d45–49 mice at 3 months (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Centronuclear fibers, which are thought to be regenerated fibers after muscle damage, were increased in <italic>mdx</italic> mice and slightly increased in all BMD mice at 1 month. At 3 months, centronuclear fibers were increased in the d45–49 mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). In addition, Sirius red staining of the TA muscles revealed an increase in fibrosis in all BMD and <italic>mdx</italic> mice, except in WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). At 1 month, an increased fibrotic area was seen only in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, but after 3 months, it was seen also in d45–49 mice. After 6 months, fibrosis gradually became apparent, even in d45–48 and d45–47 mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>

<title>All BMD mice showed a decrease in nNOS expression and no utrophin overexpression</title>
<p>We confirmed the immunohistochemical analysis in TA muscles of dystrophin and dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins: alpha-sarcoglycan (aSG) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) at 1 and 3 months. Dystrophin immunohistochemistry demonstrated a reduction of dystrophin and “faint” and “patchy” staining patterns in all BMD mice. Consistent with the lack of an nNOS binding site, encoded by exon 42–45, all BMD mice showed decreased levels of nNOS expression in the sarcolemma to levels similar to <italic>mdx</italic> mice. On the contrary, consistent with the remaining dystroglycan binding site: encoded by exon 63–70, the expression of aSG was detected on the sarcolemma in all BMD mice, whereas the expression levels were slightly low compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Western blot (WB) analysis demonstrated truncated dystrophin expression in all BMD mice at 1 and 3 months (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The truncated dystrophin expression levels were reduced to 30–40 percent at 1 month, and 10–20 percent at 3 months compared to those in WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), despite adequate levels of dystrophin mRNA expression (<xref rid="figS3_1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>). WB analysis showed increased levels of utrophin in <italic>mdx</italic> mice (8 folds at 1 month, and 30 folds at 3 months) compared to WT mice. Even in all BMD mice at 3 months, the utrophin expression levels increased 3–4 folds in WT mice, although the difference was not statistically significant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). In contrast, utrophin mRNA expression levels did not differ among WT, BMD, and <italic>mdx</italic> mice (<xref rid="figS3_1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>).

<title>BMD mice showed site-specific muscle degeneration and type IIa fiber reduction</title>
<p>Generally, patients with muscle diseases, including BMD, show changes in MRI or CT images of a particular group of muscles (<italic>Diaz-Manera et al., 2015; </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tasca et al., 2012</xref>). This allows investigators to use muscle images as a diagnostic tool for diagnosis. Thus, we examined whether the histopathological changes are different in particular parts of the muscle in BMD mice at 3 months, by observing the inner or outer part of the TA, four parts of the quadriceps: vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), vastus medialis (VM), vastus intermedius (VI), and three parts of the erector spinae: multifidus (MF), longissimus (LG), and iliocostalis (IC). <italic>mdx</italic> mice showed diffuse muscle degeneration on HE staining and no remarkable histopathological differences between the inner and outer part of the TA. In contrast, BMD mice showed significant site-specific muscle degeneration in the inner part of the TA compared with the outer part (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, upper panel</xref>). Even in the quadriceps and erector spinae, d45–49 mice showed site-specific muscle degeneration predominantly in the RF, VM, VI, MF, and LG, whereas less muscle degeneration was observed in the VL and IC. In contrast, <italic>mdx</italic> mice exhibited diffuse muscle generation in all parts of the quadriceps and erector spinae (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). We observed site-specific muscle degeneration in BMD mice, especially in the deep muscle or inner part of the same muscle. Next, we examined the muscle fiber composition in each muscle or part of the same muscle in WT, BMD, and <italic>mdx</italic> mice using MYH-1, -2, -4, and -7 immunohistochemistry, corresponding to type IIx, IIa, IIb, and I fibers, respectively. In WT mice at 3 months, type IIb fibers were dominant in the outer part of the TA, while type IIa and type IIx fibers were dominant in the inner part of the TA, although type I fibers were rare in the TA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, middle and lower panels</xref>). These deviations in muscle fiber type in the TA were also seen in BMD and <italic>mdx</italic> mice at 3 months, however, the ratio of type IIa fibers in the inner part of the TA was decreased in all BMD and <italic>mdx</italic> mice compared with WT mice. In contrast, the ratio of type IIb to type-IIx fibers was unchanged in all BMD and <italic>mdx</italic> mice compared with that in WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). The deviation in muscle fiber type was seen even in the quadriceps and erector spinae in WT mice at 3 months: type IIb fibers were present dominantly in the VL and outer part of the RF and IC, and type IIa fibers were present dominantly in the inner part of the RF, VM, VI, MF, and LG. Type I fibers, which are rare in the TA, were present in the VI, MF, and LG. In particular, the VL and IC were mostly composed of type-IIb fibers and rarely contained other fiber types (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E and H</xref>). In contrast, all BMD and <italic>mdx</italic> mice showed the same fiber type deviation in the quadriceps and erector spinae at 3 months, however, the ratio of type IIa fibers in the inner part of the RF, VM, VI, MF, and LG was lower than that in WT mice. In contrast, the ratio of type I and IIb fibers was unchanged or slightly increased in all BMD and <italic>mdx</italic> mice compared to that in WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">I</xref>).</p>

<title>Type IIa fibers were delayed in recovery at Cardiotoxin (CTX) induced regeneration models in WT mice</title>
<p>Although the mechanisms of type IIa fiber reduction in BMD mice remain unclear, there is a report about a shift in the muscle fiber type composition in a CTX induced regeneration model in the TA of WT mice, which suggested the vulnerability of type IIa fibers to CTX injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dalle et al., 2020</xref>). Next, we observed the changes in type IIa, IIb, and IIx fibers in the point on days 0 (CTX (-)), 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28 after CTX injection. HE staining of TA after CTX injection showed extensive muscle fiber necrosis on day 1, infiltration of small mononuclear cells between the necrotic fibers on day 3, appearance of regenerated centronuclear muscle fibers on day 5, and progressive repair of muscle tissues with growth of regenerated muscle fibers on days 7, 14, and 28 after CTX injection (<xref rid="figS5_1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5-figure supplement 1, left panels</xref>). MYH-1, -2, and -4 immunohistochemistry in the TA after CTX injection revealed elimination of stainability in all type IIa, IIb, and IIx fibers according to muscle necrosis at days 0 and 3 after CTX injection. On days 5 and 7 after CTX injection, only type IIb fibers appeared, with the recovery of regenerated muscle fibers. The recovery of type IIa and IIx fibers was delayed compared to that of type-IIb fibers: days 14 and 28 after CTX injection in type IIa and IIx fibers, respectively (<xref rid="figS5_1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5-figure supplement 1, middle and right panels</xref>).</p>

<title>Capillary formation contacting type IIa fiber was altered in BMD mice compared with WT mice</title>
<p>It is hypothesized that vascular dysfunction accompanied by sarcolemmal nNOS reduction is involved in the pathomechanisms of muscle impairment in human DMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Miike et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Thomas et al., 1998</xref>).

WT mice showed ‘ring-pattern’ capillaries contacting type IIa and IIx fibers at the inner part of TA.

Especially in type IIa fibers, capillaries that circumferentially contact muscle fibers were rich in WT mice, and showed remarkable ‘ring-pattern’ around type IIa fibers in WT mice. However, these circumferentially contacting capillaries were reduced around the type IIa fibers in the d45–49 and <italic>mdx</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we established three types of BMD mice carrying the d45–48, d45–47 and d45–49. All BMD mice showed reduced muscle weakness and histopathological changes, including muscle degeneration and fibrosis; however, these changes appeared at different times with each exon deletion. In addition, we confirmed the decreased truncated dystrophin levels and the decreased nNOS expression levels in all BMD mice. Furthermore, unlike <italic>mdx</italic> mice, BMD mice showed site-specific muscle degeneration in particular muscle parts, especially those rich in type IIa fibers.</p>
<p>The phenotypic evaluation confirmed that the d45–49 and <italic>mdx</italic> mice had larger body weights at 1 and 3 months compared with d45–48, d45–47 and WT mice; however, after 6 months, there was no difference in body weight between the groups. <italic>Mdx</italic> mice are generally larger in body weight at a young age than WT mice, whereas the difference between <italic>mdx</italic> and WT mice disappears at old age (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Pastoret and Sebile, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Shiba et al., 2015</xref>). The body weights of <italic>mdx</italic> mice in our study were consistent with previous reports, and we demonstrated that the d45–49 mice showed similar changes in body weight as <italic>mdx</italic> mice. All BMD mice showed slightly increased serum CK levels: 2–4 folds higher than those of WT mice after 3 months and is similar to a previous study on a BMD rat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Teramoto et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, muscle weakness in forelimb grip strength in <italic>mdx</italic> mice was already apparent from 1 month and was consistent toward 12 months compared with WT mice. In contrast, all BMD mice showed muscle weakness in forelimb grip strength compared to WT mice, but the beginning of the appearance differed depending on the type of exon deletion. Muscle weakness was demonstrated in the d45–49 mice at 1 month similar to that of <italic>mdx</italic> mice, but was apparent in the d45–48 and d45–47 mice after 3 months. All BMD mice reached the same levels of muscle weakness after 6 months whereas milder than those of <italic>mdx</italic> mice. Furthermore, analysis of the hanging wire test revealed decreased power to pull up the trunk in BMD mice, especially in the d45–49 mice. Generally, <italic>mdx</italic> mice show muscleweakness in grip strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Takeshita et al., 2017</xref>) and hanging wire tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Klein et al., 2012</xref>), and muscle weakness is already seen at 1 month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">McDonald et al., 2015</xref><italic>; Aartsuma-Rus et al., 2014</italic>). Furthermore, <italic>mdx</italic> mice are difficult to pull themselves up from their hanging position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hübner et al., 1996</xref>), which was consistent with our results. The BMD rats did not show significant muscle weakness, and the BMD mice carrying the d45–47 showed muscle weakness at 10 to 15 weeks compared to WT mice, whereas it was milder than that in <italic>mdx</italic> mice (<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Teramoto et a., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Heier et al., 2023</xref>). On the other hand, we were able to demonstrate differences in severity due to exon deletions in BMD mice, consistent with the severity of human BMD carrying d45–48, d45–47 and d45–49.</p>
<p>The histopathological changes in our <italic>mdx</italic> mice correspond to previous reports (<italic>Pastoret et al., 1995; </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pessina et al., 2014</xref><italic>; </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Giovarelli et al., 2022</xref>). BMD rats showed muscle degeneration accompanied by necrotic fibers and inflammatory cell infiltration at 1 month and became conspicuous after 2 months, and muscle fibrosis was shown after 2 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Teramoto et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, BMD mice carrying d45–47 showed muscle degeneration with necrotic fibers and immune cell infiltration, and an increase in fibrotic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Heier et al., 2023</xref>). In this study, all BMD mice exhibited muscle degeneration and fibrosis correspond to previous reports, furthermore, we revealed the timing of its appearance varied depending on the type of exon deletion.</p>
<p>All BMD mice showed faint and patchy dystrophin staining patterns and decreased truncated dystrophin expression levels. These findings are typical in the muscles of patients with BMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beggs et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jimi et al., 1992</xref>). Furthermore, sarcolemmal nNOS reduction was observed in all BMD mice to levels similar to those in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, consistent with the lack of an nNOS binding site from exon deletions. Unlike normal, sarcolemmal nNOS expression is decreased and altered in localization not only in patients with DMD and <italic>mdx</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brenman et al., 1995</xref>), but also in patients with BMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Torelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chao et al., 1996</xref>). The sarcolemmal expression of aSG was remaining in BMD mice; however, the expression level was slightly decreased. In patients with BMD, proteins expression of DGC including aSG are usually detected in the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anthony et al., 2014</xref>). In our BMD mice, utrophin expression was slightly increased compared with WT mice, but this change was smaller than that in <italic>mdx</italic> mice. Utrophin is overexpressed in the muscles of human DMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anthony et al., 2014</xref><italic>; Arechavala-Gomeza et al., 2020</italic>) and <italic>mdx</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pons et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Banks et al., 2014</xref>), but not in the muscles of patients wih BMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Torelli et al., 2004</xref><italic>; Arechavala-Gomeza et al., 2020; </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pons et al., 1994</xref><italic>; </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Janghra et al., 2016</xref>). All of our BMD mice showed reduced nNOS expression and residual aSG expression on the sarcolemma and no overexpression of utrophin.</p>
<p>Our BMD mice showed differences in the beginning of muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, and fibrosis accompanied by exon deletions, but the mechanisms underlying these differences from exon deletions remain unclear. We confirmed decreased levels of truncated dystrophin in all BMD mice; however, the expression levels were almost the same despite differences in phenotypic severity. Therefore, the severity of BMD in mice might be influenced by the qualitative shift in truncated dystrophin proteins along with exon deletions, and not by quantitative changes. Indeed, using an in silico prediction model, it has been reported that in-frame exon deletions possibly induce a structural shift in dystrophin, and the collapse of the dystrophin structure might influence BMD severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nicolas et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>We demonstrated site-specific muscle degeneration in BMD mice, unlike <italic>mdx</italic> mice, which showed diffuse and non-specific muscle degeneration. Even in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, multiple and heterogeneously distributed MRI hyperintensities are seen in a short period of approximately 13–19 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pratt et al., 2013</xref>),38 although BMD mice showed selective and site-specific muscle degeneration, especially in the deep muscle or the inner part of the same muscle. In human BMD, specific muscles are known to change the intensity of muscle MRI images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tasca et al., 2012</xref>). Furteher,it has been known that muscles located near the body surface are rich in white muscle fibers, while the deep muscles are rich in medium and red muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ogata, 1958</xref>). In our BMD mice, type IIa fibers were decreased compared to WT mice, especially in the inner muscle region, where type IIa fibers are abundant. And we found that type IIa fiber reduction started after 3 months in BMD mice, whereas WT mice showed type IIa fiber increment after 3 months. In contrast, type I, IIx, and IIb fibers were unchanged in BMD mice compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Type IIa fibers are also known as fast-oxidative fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Talbot and Maves, 2016</xref>) and are known to have fatigue resistance compared with type-IIb and IIx fibers, known as having the least and the second least fatigue-resistant fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Larsson et al., 1991</xref>); type IIa fiber reduction is thought to contribute to muscle fatigability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Percival et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, it was reported that mice lacking the RNA-binding protein Musashi-2, which is predominantly expressed in slow-type muscle fibers, showed a reduction in type IIa fibers along with reduced muscle contraction force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Furuichi et al., 2023</xref>). These findings suggest that decrease in type IIa fibers contributes to the muscle weakness and fatigability in BMD mice. In addition, only type I, IIa, and IIx fibers are present in human skeletal muscle, and type-IIb fibers appear to be absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Talbot and Maves, 2016</xref><italic>; Schiaýno and Reggeiani, 2011</italic>). Thus, the reduction of type IIa fibers might have a greater effect on the skeletal muscle function of human BMD than that of BMD mice. The vulnerability of type IIa fibers to CTX induced muscle damage has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Miike et al., 1987</xref>), and we also observed that the recovery of type IIa and IIx fibers was delayed compared to that of type-IIb fibers after CTX injection. Taken together, the decrease in type IIa fibers in BMD mice may be associated with vulnerability and delayed recovery of type IIa fibers during muscle degeneration and regeneration processes in BMD mice. A decrease in type IIa fibers was also observed in microgravity-induced muscle atrophy in WT mice, where a decrease in sarcolemmal nNOS occurred (<italic>Sandona et al., 2012</italic>). It has been reported that the expression level of nNOS is higher in type IIa fibers than in type I and type IIb fibers (<italic>Planitzer and Miethke, 2001</italic>) and that nNOS-deficient mice have reduced type IIa fibers compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Percival et al., 2010</xref>) and reduced capillary density only in the inner part of the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baum et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>By examining BMD mice, we found for the first time morphological capillary changes from a “ring pattern” to a “dot pattern” with decreased nNOS expression in the sarcolemma and fewer capillaries in circumferential contact with type IIa fibers. Between the main muscle capillaries running parallel to the muscle fibers, there are transversely interconnected branches and capillary loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Haas and Nwadozi, 2015</xref>), and the capillary changes in BMD mice may be associated with the deterioration of these interconnected branches and capillary loops (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Vascular dysfunction has been implicated in muscle damage in canine model of DMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kodippili et al., 2021</xref>) and in human DMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Thomas et al., 1998</xref>), and our analysis of BMD mice also suggests that the reduction of type IIa fibers may be influenced by vascular dysfunction with reduced sarcolemmal nNOS as well as fragility and delayed recovery.</p>

<title>Generation of CRISPR/Cas9-induced BMD mice</title>
<p>To introduce the mutations d45–48, d45–47 and d45–49 in the mouse DMD, we designed four guide RNA (gRNA) corresponding to intron sequences 44, 47, 48, and 49 (gRNA-44, -47, -48, and-49, respectively). Next, we electroporated two gRNA at the combination of gRNA-44 and -47 to generate d45–47, gRNA-44 and -48 to generate d45–48, and gRNA-44 and -49 to generate d45–49, with Cas9-nuclease (Integrated DNA Technologies), into embryos from C57BL/6J female mice. F0 mice with the three desired mutations were selected based on the results of PCR analysis and DNA sequencing of tail DNA using intron primers set forward and backward at the deletions. F0 female mice were repeatedly backcrossed with WT male mice, and then F4–F8 male BMD mice having d45–48, d45–47 and d45–49 were used in our study, with WT control and <italic>mdx</italic> mice. Furthermore, we examined multiple mouse lines with the same exon deletions of d45–48 and d45–47, and confirmed muscle weakness and pathological changes similar to those observed in the mouse line used in this study (data not shown).</p>

At least 500 fibers were analyzed for each muscle, and we calculated the percentages of opaque, necrotic, and centronuclear fibers, and the percentages of type IIx, IIa, IIb, and I fibers. All images were obtained under identical conditions at the same magnification. A study for muscle fibrosis was performed on 7-µm-thick TA muscle sections stained with Sirius-Red stain at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. The area occupied by fibrosis was detected using Image J, and the percent fibrosis area was calculated. In addition, studies on capillaries contacting type IIa fibers were performed on MYH-2 and PECAM-1 immunohistochemically stained muscle sections, and the number and size of PECAM-1-positive capillaries contacting type IIa fibers were counted. The endothelial area was calculated using the number and size of capillaries according to previous methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baum et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Miyazaki et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this article the authors described mouse models presenting with backer muscular dystrophy, they created three transgenic models carrying three representative exon deletions: ex45-48 del., ex45-47 19 del., and ex45-49 del.. This article is well written but needs improvement in some points.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This article is well written. The evidence supporting the authors' claims is robust, though further implementation is necessary. The experiments conducted align with the current state-of-the-art methodologies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This article does not analyze atrophy in the various mouse models. Implementing this point would improve the impact of the work</p>

<p>Miyazaki et al. established three distinct BMD mouse models by deleting different exon regions of the dystrophin gene, observed in human BMD. The authors demonstrated that these models exhibit pathophysiological changes, including variations in body weight, muscle force, muscle degeneration, and levels of fibrosis, alongside underlying molecular alterations such as changes in dystrophin and nNOS levels. Notably, these molecular and pathological changes progress at different rates depending on the specific exon deletions in the dystrophin gene. Additionally, the authors conducted extensive fiber typing, revealing a site-specific decline in type IIa fibers in BMD mice, which they suggest may be due to muscle degeneration and reduced capillary formation around these fibers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript introduces three novel BMD mouse models with different dystrophin exon deletions, each demonstrating varying rates of disease progression similar to the human BMD phenotype. The authors also conducted extensive fiber typing across different muscles and regions within the muscles, effectively highlighting a site-specific decline in type IIa muscle fibers in BMD mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have inadequate experiments to support their hypothesis that the decay of type IIa muscle fibers is likely due to muscle degeneration and reduced capillary formation. Further investigation into capillary density and histopathological changes across different muscle fibers is needed, which could clarify the mechanisms behind these observations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this article the authors described mouse models presenting with backer muscular dystrophy, they created three transgenic models carrying three representative exon deletions: ex45-48 del., ex45-47 19 del., and ex45-49 del. This article is well written but needs improvement in some points.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This article is well written. The evidence supporting the authors' claims is robust, though further implementation is necessary. The experiments conducted align with the current state-of-the-art methodologies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This article does not analyze atrophy in the various mouse models. Implementing this point would improve the impact of the work</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their constructive suggestions and comments on this work. Muscle hypertrophy is shown with growth in dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscle in mdx mice; thus, we did not pay attention to the factors associated with muscle atrophy in BMD mice. As the reviewer suggested, the examination of the association between type IIa fiber reduction and muscle atrophy is important, and the result is considered to be helpful in resolving the cause of type IIa fiber reduction in BMD mice.</p>
<p>Thus, we are planning to:</p>
<p>(1) Evaluate the cross-sectional areas (CSA) of muscles and compare them with the changes in the proportion of type IIa fibers.</p>
<p>(2) Evaluate the expression levels of Murf1 and Atrogin1 as markers of muscle atrophy using RT-PCR.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Miyazaki et al. established three distinct BMD mouse models by deleting different exon regions of the dystrophin gene, observed in human BMD. The authors demonstrated that these models exhibit pathophysiological changes, including variations in body weight, muscle force, muscle degeneration, and levels of fibrosis, alongside underlying molecular alterations such as changes in dystrophin and nNOS levels. Notably, these molecular and pathological changes progress at different rates depending on the specific exon deletions in the dystrophin gene. Additionally, the authors conducted extensive fiber typing, revealing a site-specific decline in type IIa fibers in BMD mice, which they suggest may be due to muscle degeneration and reduced capillary formation around these fibers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript introduces three novel BMD mouse models with different dystrophin exon deletions, each demonstrating varying rates of disease progression similar to the human BMD phenotype. The authors also conducted extensive fiber typing across different muscles and regions within the muscles, effectively highlighting a site-specific decline in type IIa muscle fibers in BMD mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have inadequate experiments to support their hypothesis that the decay of type IIa muscle fibers is likely due to muscle degeneration and reduced capillary formation. Further investigation into capillary density and histopathological changes across different muscle fibers is needed, which could clarify the mechanisms behind these observations.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for these positive comments and the very important suggestion about type IIa fiber reduction and capillary change around muscle fibers in BMD mice. From the results of the cardiotoxin-induced muscle degeneration and regeneration model, type IIa and IIx fibers showed delayed recovery compared with that of type-IIb fibers. However, this delayed recovery of type IIa and IIx could not explain the cause of the selective muscle fiber reduction limited to type IIa fibers in BMD mice. Therefore, we considered vascular dysfunction as the reason for the selective type IIa fiber reduction, and we found morphological capillary changes from a “ring pattern” to a “dot pattern” around type IIa fibers in BMD mice. However, the association between selective type IIa fiber reduction and the capillary change around muscle fibers in BMD mice remains unclear due to the lack of information about capillaries around type IIx and IIb fibers. The reviewer pointed out this insufficient evaluation of capillaries around other muscle fibers (except for type IIa fibers), and this suggestion is very helpful for explaining the association between selective type IIa fiber reduction and vascular dysfunction in BMD mice.</p>
<p>Thus, we are planning to:</p>
<p>(1) Evaluate the changes in capillary formation around other muscle fibers, except for type IIa fibers (e.g., type IIx and IIb fibers).</p>
<p>(2) Evaluate the endothelial area around other muscle fibers, except for type IIa fibers.</p>
