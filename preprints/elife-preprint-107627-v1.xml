<title>Abstract</title><p>The efficiencies with which activated B lymphocytes proliferate and develop into antibody (Ab)- secreting plasma cells are critical determinants of adaptive humoral immunity and central to sustaining certain autoimmune diseases. Increasing evidence indicates that specific pathways in intermediary metabolism, or their substrate supply, influence lymphocyte differentiation and function. We now show that although stringent restriction of glutamine supply decreases proliferation and differentiation of B cells into plasma cells, glutaminolysis - a major means of metabolism of this amino acid - was only conditionally crucial in B cells and the Ab responses derived from them. Strikingly, <italic>Gls</italic>, the gene encoding the main glutaminase of lymphocytes, promoted anti-NP Ab responses at the primary and recall phases only when either glucose uptake into B cells or pyruvate into their mitochondria was also impaired. This synthetic auxotrophy involved support to a progressive expansion of mitochondrial respiration followed by plasma cell differentiation. Surprisingly, impairment of glutaminase and the mitochondrial pyruvate channel not only decreased the coupling of IL-21 stimulation to STAT3 induction, but also interferon stimulation of STAT1 activation. Together, our findings establish not only a powerful collaboration of metabolic pathways in promoting increased respiration and the development of Ab-secreting cells, but also a capacity of metabolism to modulate cytokine receptor signaling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Circulating antibodies (Ab) are crucial mediators of protection against potentially pathogenic microbes, but Ab also can cause tissue damage or cellular dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). In both adaptive and pathological settings, Ab functions depend on their heavy chain class, affinity, and concentration [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)]. Increased affinity after initial and repeated immunizations can be selected in several ways, one of which involves processes that occur in the micro-anatomy of germinal centers (also known as secondary follicles) [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>)]. Progeny cells that survive a gauntlet of programmed death in selecting for continued clonal proliferation ultimately can generate either memory B cells (MBC) or an end-stage descendant of the B lineage, the plasma cell (PC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The magnitude of PC output (the numbers generated after B cell activation) and their rates of immunoglobulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) determine the net output and steady-state concentrations of Ab. Accordingly, understanding mechanisms that regulate the qualities or quantities of Ab, and that reduce or enhance the efficiency of generating PC, are important goals.</p>
<p>To elicit protective Ab, immune exposures such as vaccination activate B cell proliferation, and some progeny of such activated B cells develop into Ab-secreting PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Specificity is fostered by a reliance on signal initiation through the BCR, the clonal Ag receptor on mature B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The capacity to be activated, survival efficiency, rates of proliferation, and propensity to yield GC B cells or PC depend on an array of other signal-initiating receptors, among them CD19, co-stimulators such as CD40 [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)], the death receptor Fas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), pattern recognition receptors in the TLR family [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>); reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)] and cytokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). One consequence of activation is that B lymphoblasts dramatically increase expression of an array of nutrient transporters that include those for amino acids and for glucose [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>); reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>)]. Beyond this general picture, however, the effects or outputs of receptors likely are scalar and conditional, i.e., dependent on other signals. For instance, antigen with a high affinity and high valency of the BCR epitope signals differently from a monovalent, lower-affinity antigen [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>))], and may influence generation of PC. Moreover, increased expression of TLR7 or type 1 interferon (IFN) receptor stimulation each reduces the capacity of B cells to maintain self-tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), presumably involving changes in the quantitative balance among signal transducers and transcription factors. At a later stage, the IL-21 receptor is crucial for PC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Moreover, IL-21 has recently been reported to promote affinity maturation of GC-derived PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Little is known about the relationships between signal strength and metabolism. In vitro experiments showed that hypoxia or genetically-mediated stabilization of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) blunted activation-induced increases in amino acid uptake and transporter gene expression as well as GC and Ab responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). However, it remains unclear if metabolism can modulate signaling.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a substantial and increasing body of evidence indicates that nutrient supply, uptake, and intermediary metabolism influence the properties of adaptive immunity, in part by their effects on differentiation and function of cells that mediate host responses [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>)]. The bulk of evidence is from analyses of the differentiation and functions of T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells and documents condition- and cell type-specificity of findings. Nonetheless, several analyses point to important effects on B cells as well. In addition to a function during B cell development, expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 on mature B cells supported the initial GC size, the Ag-specific Ab responses derived from B cells, and affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>).</p>
<p>Among nutrients, only the distribution and sufficiency of oxygen are readily measured, but such analyses consistently reveal evidence of functional hypoxia in follicles, most accentuated in GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Consistent with and potentially as a result of the hypoxia, GC B cells can exhibit higher rates of glucose uptake with several-fold increased glucose oxidation as well as utilization in the pentose phosphate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Moreover, the ability to feed intermediates into one-carbon metabolism via increased expression of the enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase was reported to be crucial for germinal center size and normal degrees of high-affinity antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Cell type- and stage-specific inactivation of <italic>Slc2a1</italic>, the gene that encodes GLUT1, indicates that the increased glucose uptake is crucial for both GC homeostasis and the capacity of B cells to yield antibody-secreting PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Metabolomic analyses suggested that increases in anaplerotic conversion and usage of amino acids may be evoked in GLUT1-deficient B cells as a potential compensatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). In parallel, however, a remarkable degree of metabolic flexibility was suggested by the in vitro finding that although glucose is absolutely essential for PC development and Ab production in the absence of other hexoses, mannose and galactose together could substitute for glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Thus, the reduced influx and availability of glucose reduced Ab responses and affinity maturation, but the decrease in these outputs fell short of what likely could be therapeutically meaningful. Moreover, the importance of feeding the increase in B cell-intrinsic generation of serine with diversion of 3-phosphoglyerate away from generating pyruvate raised the question whether the capacity of mitochondria to use this latter metabolite was important in promoting greater quality and quantity of Ab after immunization.</p>
<p>To explore these issues, we used both immunizations and in vitro analyses that leveraged genetic and pharmacological approaches to test the importance of glutaminolysis - on its own or in combination with a second pathway - in Ab responses. Glutamine concentrations in vitro were found to be crucial for class switching as well as PC and Ab production, and B cell type-restricted inactivation of the <italic>Gls</italic> gene, which encodes the glutaminase expressed in post-natal cells outside the liver, impaired the response to ovalbumin in one immunization model. Surprisingly, however, the anti-NP response in a hapten-carrier model was unaffected. However, a synergistic impact resulted when GLS depletion was combined with targeted loss-of-function for either GLUT1 (<italic>Slc2a1</italic>) or an essential subunit of a mitochondrial pyruvate import carrier [<italic>Mpc2,</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>)]. Thus, glutaminolysis promoted the anti-NP response only if glucose intake or pyruvate flux was impaired, revealing one limit imposed on the metabolic flexibility of B cells in their mediation of Ab responses. The combined restriction of two pathways that feed mitochondrial metabolism represented what can be termed &quot;synthetic auxotrophy&quot; rather than synthetic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>), in that effects on differentiation were observed independent from death or proliferation. Gene expression signatures in GC B cells highlighted a requirement for GLS in metabolic reprogramming, i.e., both amplification of glucose-stimulated proton secretion and a major increase in mitochondrial respiration between the first and second days after B cell activation. Surprisingly, MPC2 and GLS were found to promote not only IL-21-stimulated STAT3 activation but also an interferon response signature in addition to promoting increased respiration. Together, the results reveal that an interplay between two metabolic pathways unexpectedly converged on programming not only IL-21R activation of STAT3, PC differentiation and high-affinity Ab responses, but also the tyrosyl and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 induced by type 1 and type 2 IFNs. These findings have important implications for diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, in which B cells and their response to IFN are crucial elements of pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Alpha ketoglutarate can alter threshold glutamine concentration requirements for B cell responses</title>
<p>B lymphoblasts subjected to persistent stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors took up amino acids at lower rates in vitro and exhibited decreased mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). mTORC1 promotes Ab class switching by a mechanism beyond effects on the rate of proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>), and extracellular glutamine influences class switch recombination in B cells through a mechanism involving the action of mTORC1 on proteins regulating translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Other work has provided evidence that plasmablasts developing in the setting of plasmodial infection are glutamine avid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). The admixture of red and white pulp in spleen preclude accurate measurement of amino acid concentrations surrounding B cells in lymphoid follicles. Instead, we adapted a technique used for tumor masses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>) to measure glutamine in the fluid eluted from transected lymph nodes, revealing a strikingly lower concentration than in plasma (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). This apparent glutamine gradient was not a universal feature of the lymph node, in that neither leucine nor pyruvate differed substantially between plasma and interstitium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). To test the dependence of B cells on extracellular glutamine concentration in vitro, we measured both class switching and plasma cell differentiation. Titrations of glutamine in media showed that PC differentiation as well as the Ab class switch to IgG1 were impaired, but with different dose-response curves for the inflection point at which impairment was observed (addition of 0.2 mM for PC, at which the %IgG1<sup>+</sup> was not affected) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 1a</xref>). Although not pursued herein, it is intriguing that some aspects of the immune micro-environment appear to support robust switching and PC generation at a glutamine level that would be insufficient in vitro, suggesting that the required concentration is affected by the signals or nutrients in vivo.</p>

<p>Among uses of glutamine after its uptake into cells, glutaminolysis is the first step in generation of Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±KG) from the amino acid for usage in the Krebs (TCA) cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). To screen whether this process might be of functional significance in the molecular regulation of the class-switch or PC differentiation, and to test if the observed effects were purely division-related, we used dye partitioning in vitro combined with addition of dimethyl-ketoglutarate (DMK), a cell-permeable molecule that can bypass glutaminolysis yet supply Î±KG. The glutamine requirement for switching to IgG1 was almost completely substituted by DMK. Moreover, development of CD138<sup>+</sup> cells involved a process beyond just the proliferative effect, and DMK in the same cultures effected a definite but incomplete reversion of the glutamine requirement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 1b, c</xref>). These findings suggest that although other mechanisms may also apply, the need for glutamine involves a capacity to supply sufficient Î±KG to the B lymphoblasts.</p>

However, the in vitro data supported testing to what extent immunization-induced Ab responses are affected by glutaminolysis.

Mice (all huCD20-CreER<sup>T2</sup> +/-, and Gls +/+ or f/f) in which tamoxifen was administered prior to immunization were sensitized to ovalbumin followed by antigen (Ag) challenge in the airways. Lack of GLS (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 1d</xref>) reduced class-switched GC B cells in lymph nodes draining the lung (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1e</xref>) as well as the populations of ovalbumin-specific Ab-secreting cells (ASCs) in the lung and bone marrow (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1f-h</xref>).

<p>Most of the splenic ASC pool at 7 d after a recall challenge and high-affinity IgG anti-NP Ab in sera is expected to derive from re-activation of memory B cells (MBCs) that directly differentiated into PCs after the second immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). We tested how the loss-of-function interventions impact the recall process by performance of a priming immunization, tamoxifen treatments only several weeks thereafter, followed by the second immunization and harvest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3h</xref>). In this setting where the primary response from a pre-immune repertoire was unperturbed, a synergistic interplay of <italic>Gls</italic> and <italic>Mpc2</italic> was again observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3i</xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 3a-h</xref>).

Moreover, high-affinity anti-NP Ab of several switched isotypes were drastically reduced: IgG1 to &lt; 1/4 of control values (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3i</xref>), with IgG2c and IgA almost undetectable (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 3a-c</xref>). Since high-affinity, class-switched (IgG or IgA) Ab are undetectable 1 wk after a primary immunization, we infer from these results that the rapid generation of ASCs from memory B cells required glutaminolysis and pyruvate import. Together, the findings reveal a cell-intrinsic process that promotes both affinity selection and differentiation toward a PC fate through the collaboration of pyruvate influx rate and glutaminolysis.</p>

We tested the effect of these agents - in combination, or each one singly-on physiology and differentiation of B cells activated via CD40. CB839 reduced the production of CD138<sup>+</sup> progeny (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a, b</xref>), ASC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c, d</xref>) and Ab (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4e</xref>). Consistent with its ability to inhibit glutaminase, this agent decreased intracellular glutamate and the calculated glutaminolysis rate while increasing the glutamine pool (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 4a-c, e</xref>). On its own, UK5099 had no effect on development of CD138<sup>+</sup> cells, yet addition of UK5099 to CB839 substantially intensified the inhibition of ASC generation and Ab production. Of note, UK5099 reduced neither glutamine nor glutamate, yet substantially reduced intracellular alanine, which is generated in mitochondria by glutamate-pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) conversion of glutamate and pyruvate to alanine and Î±KG (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 4b, d</xref>). Combining UK5099 with CB839 trended toward accentuation of the glutamate reduction caused by the glutaminase inhibitor on its own (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 4b, c</xref>). Further, the frequencies of ASCs and spot sizes were substantially reduced when metabolism was inhibited only during the differentiation phase, followed by washout of the inhibitors (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 5a, c</xref>). These data indicate that glutaminolysis and mitochondrial pyruvate import promote the differentiation process, but results from applying inhibitors only during the ELISpot culture, i.e., after 4 d of differentiation in vitro, suggest that glutaminolysis also non-redundantly supports the synthesis and/or secretion of Ab (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 5b, d</xref>).</p>

<p>Progression from B cell activation to the differentiation of plasmablasts and plasma cells requires several rounds of cell cycling and a division-counting mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). When the frequency of CD138<sup>+</sup> progeny was measured as a function of division number, the results showed that CB839 reduced the capacity to become CD138-positive at equal divisions (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 6a-d</xref>). Moreover, whereas UK5099 on its own did not reduce differentiatino efficiency at equal divisions, its addition intensified the inhibitory effect of CB839 (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 6a-d</xref>). Recent work with profound B cell-depletion therapy in chronic autoimmune disease indicates that disease activity depends on continual production of new auto-Ab-producing cells [80, reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>)]. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the standard of care in systemic lupus erythematosus; while effective, it incompletely reduces pathogenic auto-Ab concentrations and disease activity, and often is not sufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>). We explored the interplay between HCQ and CB839 (glutaminase inhibition), alone or along with UK5099. Strikingly, whereas HCQ alone slightly increased the %CD138<sup>+</sup> at each division and overall, addition of HCQ to metabolic inhibition caused more substantial reductions in PC differentiation (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 6a-d</xref>).</p>

This finding is consistent with an effect on differentiation beyond simple division-counting and with the pattern of results with metabolic inhibition. Moreover, analyses of cell-type modules in RNA-seq data from B lymphoblast cultures at this inflection point yielded evidence that the main systemic impact of combined inhibition was on plasmablast - plasma cell gene expression programs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4g, h</xref>). We further found that DMK, the cell-permeable Î±KG precursor, partially reversed the inhibitory effects of CD839 and UK5099 on B cell differentiation to a CD138<sup>+</sup> plasmablast/PC status (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>).

T cell help drives greater proliferation of both extrafollicular- and GC- B cell-derived plasmablasts that bore higher-affinity BCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>), but the findings (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b-d</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 2c, e</xref>) demonstrate effects on GC B cells. Since in vitro systems cannot faithfully recapitulate GC B cell physiology, we performed RNA-seq analyses of flow-purified GC B cells from the mice with induced B cell type-specific gene inactivation and matched controls (CreER<sup>T2</sup> transgenics injected with tamoxifen). The analyses consistently showed major reductions in the mRNA encoded by the targeted genes (<italic>Mpc2</italic>; <italic>Gls</italic>), indicating both that deletion of the flox alleles was efficient and that the GC were not dominated by selective outgrowth of the B cells that retained functional genes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 2f, g</xref>). Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of the impact of GLS on the relative RNA levels in GC B cells highlighted modules for the interconnected functions of Myc-regulated genes, those connected to mTOR signaling and oxidative metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation; fatty acid oxidation) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4j-l</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 7</xref>). Moreover, the abnormal metabolism led to reduced expression of RNAs linked to proliferation (E2F-responsive genes and those associated with the cell cycle G2-M transition) (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 7a</xref>). These effects could be discerned when comparing <italic>Gls</italic> Î/Î B cells to CreER<sup>T2</sup>, +/+ controls but effects were heightened when <italic>Mpc2</italic> inactivation was compared to <italic>Mpc2</italic> Î/Î, <italic>Gls</italic> Î/Î samples or in comparing doubly-deficient B cells to WT controls (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 7</xref>).</p>
<p>The gene modules pointed to proliferation, c-Myc (a central mediator of metabolic reprogramming), and oxidative metabolism. Oxidative metabolism is vital for PC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>). Accordingly, we measured respiration by B lymphoblasts of each genotype on two successive days after activation and culture in conditions promoting development into ASC. Of note, rates of mitochondrion-dependent oxygen consumption by WT cells quadrupled between days 1 and 2 after mitogenic stimulation, (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a-d</xref>). Consistent with the GSEA data, the increased respiration was blunted in GLS-deficient B cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a, b</xref>). In addition, the inactivation of <italic>Mpc2</italic>, while not affecting respiration on its own, further reduced both the absolute rate and the capacity to increase this core mitochondrial function during the second day when GLS was deficient (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a, b</xref>). To explore if these effects were attributable either to abnormal naive B cells prior to stimulation, or simply to a failure to provide sufficient substrates to the mitochondria, we added CB839 or UK5099 to cultures of normal B cells after activation but performed the metabolic flux assays in the absence of inhibitors. Strikingly, the impacts on respiration caused by pharmacological inhibition initiated at the time of B cell activation matched those obtained using genetic loss-of-function (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c, d</xref>). Further consistent with altered mitochondrial metabolism, the inhibition of glutaminolysis also impacted the acetyl-carnitine /ratio that is central to the provision of substrates for fatty acid oxidation, with reduced L-carnitine and increased acetyl-carnitine as well as computationally inferred rates of fatty acid oxidation (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 4g-j</xref>).</p>

<p>Rates of extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) were measured to test if B lymphoblasts compensated for the reduced respiration by increasing &quot;aerobic glycolysis&quot; - the hallmark of which would be to generate and excrete lactate from pyruvate. Targeting glutaminolysis led to striking decreases in ECAR that were even greater when in concert with interference with the MPC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5e, f</xref>). These decreases indicate that the interference with glutaminolysis broadly reprograms metabolism in the activated B cells. Although activated B cells perform fatty acid oxidation [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>); reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>)] the inhibitors decreased steady-state ATP concentrations in the CD40-activated lymphoblasts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5g</xref>). Of note, the main cause of these decreases appeared to be interference with the capacity of B cells to increase their respiratory capacity during growth (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5h</xref>) rather than the modest impact of acute inhibition of glutaminolysis and pyruvate import in blasts cultured in the absence of inhibitors during 2 d prior to adding inhibitors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5i</xref>). The reduced respiration, lower signals from TMRE staining (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5j</xref>), together with normal signal after MitoTracker Green staining and qPCR for mitochondrial DNA content (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 6e, f</xref>), indicate that decreased respiration was linked to a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential rather than a failure to increase mitochondrial mass or DNA. This decrease in turn was associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5k</xref>).</p>

<title>Metabolic regulation of interferon) cytokine receptor responsiveness</title>
<p>To gain further insight into molecular consequences of synthetic auxotrophy, we analyzed the RNA-Seq data to determine how <italic>Mpc2</italic> gene inactivation affected GLS-depleted GC B cells. Surprisingly, the RNA-seq data indicated that a Jak-STAT3 signature was reduced not only in GC B cells deficient GLS and MPC2 but also in the comparison of <italic>Mpc2</italic> Î/Î to combined loss-of-function (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 7a</xref>). IL-21R, acting via STAT3, is crucial for PC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>). Cytokine receptors activate STAT3 via Jak1-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, but ROS can alter STAT3-dependent gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>). We found that the tyrosyl phosphorylation of Jak1 and STAT3 stimulated by IL-21 treatment of activated B cells was attenuated in cells cultured in CB839 and UK5099 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b</xref>). Unexpectedly, computational algorithms identified the interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene signature as the most prominently impaired pathway in the <italic>Mpc2</italic>, <italic>Gls1</italic> double-deficient GC B cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6c</xref>). Thus, the effects of MPC2 in the setting of GLS depletion were to promote interferon response signatures and Jak-STAT signaling as well as suites of RNA linked to respiration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6d</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 7a, d</xref>). Among processes that could lead to such a strong effect on mRNA levels, a straightforward possibility was that the metabolism in B cells affects their IFN-elicited signal transduction. Strikingly, IFN-induced phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine was attenuated when activated cells were treated with CB839 and UK5099 prior to stimulation with type 1 or 2 IFN (IFN-Î² and -Î³, respectively) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6e, f</xref>). This effect was observed in B cells three days after initial activation via CD40 crosslinking, and inhibition was observed when the pharmacological agents were present only for the final 16 h, or when anti-CD40-activated blasts were analyzed the day after activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e, f</xref>). Decreased IFN-stimulated phospho-STAT1 was also observed in comparisons between WT and <italic>Gls</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> <italic>Mpc2</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> B cells from tamoxifen-treated mice (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 8a-e</xref>). One consequence of STAT1 nuclear translocation and chromatin association is that the C-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) can become phosphorylated at S727, an event that depends on the Jak/Tyk2 tyrosyl kinase action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>). Of note, IFN-induced STAT1(Y727) phosphorylation also was attenuated when GLS and MPC2 were impeded in activated B cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e, f</xref>). We conclude that altered intermediary metabolism in B cells can, within less than a day, change IFN receptor induction of phospho-STAT1.</p>

</fig>
<p>Finally, we tested models of mechanisms that could mediate the observed ability of metabolism (i.e., glutaminolysis and mitochondrial pyruvate import) to increase STAT1 phosphorylation in activated B cells. Flow cytometry results indicated that a simple model in which surface expression of IFN receptors was reduced is unlikely (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 8f</xref>), suggesting instead an impairment of receptor signaling to STAT1. One observed effect of the combined metabolic reprogramming was to increase steady-state ROS in B cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5k</xref>). Of note, ROS can reduce function of complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC) by modifying reactive sulfhydryl groups in the complex, and elimination of complex I from the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) decreased IFN-Î³ activation of STAT1 in a genome-wide loss-of-function screen with an immortalized macrophage-like cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>). The absence of complex I was mimicked by the ETC inhibitor rotenone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>). Longer rotenone treatments were highly toxic to B cells, but we found that p-STAT1(Y701) induction in activated B cells was dramatically decreased by a remarkably short (45 min) exposure to this agent prior to IFN stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g, h</xref>). Metformin also inhibits complex I, albeit at higher concentrations than apply clinically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>). When tested with activated B cells, this pharmaceutical agent also decreased p-STAT1 elicited by IFN stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g, h</xref>).</p>
<p>Dysfunction or chemical inhibition of ETC complex I causes increased mitochondrial production and export of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>), so it was possible that these results were in part attributable to elevated ROS. Using an approach that had provided evidence of ROS inhibiting STING-dependent IFN-Î² production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>), we increased ROS in activated B cells by applying either menadione or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> prior to interferon treatment. Menadione substantially reduced induction of P-STAT1 by receptors for both IFN-Î² and -Î³, which was almost completely abrogated by a short-term pre-treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6i, j</xref>). We conclude that increased steady-state ROS and mtROS in B cells, which arise when GLS and MPC function are impaired, contribute to an unexpected defect in IFN-R signaling to STAT1. All together, the results reveal that an interplay between two metabolic pathways progressively reduced the expansion of mitochondrial respiration in B cells. A key functional effect of the combined impairment of two metabolic pathways is the establishment of a block to PC differentiation and high-affinity Ab responses. Unexpectedly, however, the mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated ROS also converged on IFN-receptor signaling and the programming interferon-response functions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We and others have published examples of how metabolic flexibility in B lineage cells may allow limiting or negating the effects of loss-of-function mutations in key steps of intermediary metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>). These findings raise questions as to forms of intervention that could interfere with the ongoing production of plasma cells secreting pathogenic auto-Ab or, conversely, which pathways might need to collaborate for promoting full-strength Ab responses. The work presented here supports three central insights. First, we have identified conditions under which the anti-NP response is relatively glutaminase-independent, both in the primary phase and upon recall stimulation of memory B cells. Despite this apparent independence, this enzyme central to processing of glutamine and to anaplerosis takes on a vital role if mitochondrial pyruvate import is impeded. A related point is that the findings underscore the fallacy in stating conclusions as if universally applicable, inasmuch as the effect of B cell specific loss-of-function for GLS depended on the nature of the immunization. Thus, the anti-ovalbumin response derived from GLS-depleted B cells was substantially reduced even though the anti-NP responses after multivalent hapten-carrier immunization with NP were not similarly reduced with isolated <italic>Gls</italic> gene inactivation. Mechanistically, the findings revealed that glutaminase activity promotes a progressive increase in mitochondrial respiration in a manner enhanced by pyruvate import, an alternative pathway for providing substrates to the TCA (Krebs) Cycle. A third major finding is that the efficiency of coupling IFN receptors to the tyrosyl and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 - and IL-21 stimulation to STAT3 - depends on the programming of intermediary metabolism in a manner linked to ROS homeostasis. Taken all together, the findings reveal not only new insights into how intermediary metabolism can modulate differentiation and receptor signaling, but suggest the potential for new interventions in autoimmune diseases driven by interferon effects and auto-Ab.</p>
<p>A self-reinforcing network of increased interferon production and pathological levels and persistence of auto-Ab production is characteristic of several autoimmune conditions of humans. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are most common and studied, but this pairing also is involved in inflammatory myopathies and primary Sjogrenâs syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>). Effectiveness of therapeutic mAb for B cell depletion is best established in RA; unimpressive results in SLE raised concerns that disease might be perpetuated by long-lived PC that secrete auto-Ab, do not need BAFF, and are CD20<sup>neg</sup>. However, dramatic results of testing CD19-directed chimeric Ag receptor T cells in patients with SLE and myositis showed that targeting B cells reduced clinical disease, IFN levels and those of pathologic auto-Ab [80, reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>)]. These effects imply that ongoing production of PC from B cells maintains IFN production and disease activity. Cost, production complexity, and risk profile mean that a need to identify other approaches that restrict the ongoing differentiation of B cells into PC remains, despite the dramatic results in patients with severe disease. The capacity of CB839 to collaborate with UK5099 to suppress both PC differentiation and responsiveness to IFNs suggests that this agent and glutaminase-specific inhibition in general merit further analysis. Since CB839 appeared safe in patients during phase 2 clinical testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>), our finding of an interplay between the standard-of-care agent hydroxychloroquine and CB839 in the inhibition of plasma cell development in vitro similarly militates in favor of translational investigation. Which B cells are major sources of the PC that secrete pathological auto-Ab, and the extent to which SLE susceptibility might involve a distinct relationship between intermediary metabolism and PC differentiation, are important issues beyond the scope of the present study. Our data indicate that inhibition of the pathways impacted memory B cells that rapidly differentiated after a secondary challenge, but do not specifically test the atypical MBC that are implicated in SLE pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>).</p>
<p>Another finding of the work bears both on consideration of the intersection of B cell metabolism and function after immunization, and perhaps on the relationship of our findings to SLE. Our data show that although the Ag-specific Ab response elicited by a protein, ovalbumin, was reduced by B cell-specific depletion of GLS in an allergic lung inflammation model of immunization, the anti-NP response was normal. Our finding that the metabolic requirements for Ab responses differed according to Ag or type of immunization raises questions that merit being worked out in future research. A key point is that immunization to elicit anti-NP responses usually is carried out with heavily haptenated carriers, i.e., many NP-groups on each protein molecule. In sharp contrast, a particular epitope in the carrier protein (ovalbumin, KLH, gamma globulin) will be monovalent unless part of an aggregate. Valency and the extent of BCR cross-linking influence signaling by the BCR, which in turn can affect metabolic regulators such as mTORC1 and c-Myc. A related possibility derives from the characteristics of the anti-NP response, which is dominated by a limited Ig heavy chain repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>). Thus, intrinsic biochemical characteristics of V<sub>H</sub>125:V<sub>L</sub>Î» BCR interactions with NP might lead to programming metabolic requirements that differ from what is elicited by the BCR repertoire responding to ovalbumin. The issue of valency has a bearing on the pathological Ab in auto-immunity in that so many auto-Ab of SLE are directed against multivalent Ag such as dsDNA and ribonucleoprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>). Finally, the specific immunization regimen might affect the results. General issues of valency in engagement of BCR at the cell surface remain incompletely clarified despite years of papers, so extensive further studies will be needed to understand better the relationship to a specific step in intermediary metabolism. Nonetheless, a striking finding herein is that a vital requirement for glutaminolysis is cryptic in the anti-NP response until uncovered by reduced import rates of either glucose into cells or pyruvate into mitochondria.</p>
<p>Our findings connect to questions of metabolic flexibility, which is a central issue for the potential translatability or implications of intermediary metabolism in targeting immune responses or auto-immunity. Targeting a particular process is less likely to be efficacious to the extent that GC B cells, or B cells in general, can use alternatives and achieve normal responses or outputs. For instance, although there is evidence that the majority of energy generation by activated and GC B cells involves fatty acid (FA) oxidation, most of it in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>), elimination of a key step in mitochondrial acquisition and use of FAs had no impact on Ab responses or discernible reduction in GC or affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>). Alternatively, restricting cell-intrinsic generation of serine from a glycolytic intermediate represents one potential point of vulnerability that was not compensated by flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Depletion of a major glucose transporter - and inferentially of reduced supply of glucose for some combination of NADPH regeneration from NADP, serine biosynthesis, oxidation, and perhaps other use of glucose - also reduced GC size, Ab responses, and affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). However, the effect magnitude (reduction to â¼1/4 normal) appeared less promising from the standpoint of potential treatment of autoimmunity. Metabolomic data suggested that increased anaplerosis was a compensatory mechanism that might have limited the severity of the defect in ASC generation and Ab responses of GLUT1-depleted B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Our findings support this inference in that the defects with <italic>Slc2a1</italic> Î/Î or <italic>Mpc2</italic> Î/Î B cells were each dramatically amplified by impedance of glutaminolysis. The size of the differences, the impact on the IgG2(a/)c isotype that is particularly important in SLE pathogenesis [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>)], and the vital functions of STAT1 induction by IFN receptors in autoimmune models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>) indicate that this synthetic auxotrophy merits translational consideration.</p>

<p>RNA was isolated from sorted B cells or in vitro-generated B lymphoblasts using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturerâs instructions (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). RNA from cultured B cells purified from TriZol and processed for bulk RNA-seq by the VANTAGE Core of the Vanderbilts. To assess the extent of the loss-of-function in B cell populations, gene expression was analyzed using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT<sup>2</sup>-PCR). After cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription with an AMV Reverse Transcriptase kit (Promega, Madison, WI), amplifications were performed using SYBR green Power UP PCR master-mix (ThermoFisher Scientific) and primer pairs specific for <italic>Gls</italic> (Forward 5â-GGGAATTCACTTTTGTCACGA -3â; Reverse 5â-GACTTCACCC TTTGATCACC -3â), <italic>Mpc2</italic> (Forward 5â-TGTTGCTGCCAAAGAAATTG-3â; Reverse 5â-AGTGGACTGAGCTGTGCTGA -3â), and b-actin (Forward 5â-GGCACCACAC CTTCTACAATG-3â; Reverse 5â-GGGGTGTTGAAGGTCTCAAAC-3â). The relative level of gene expression was calculated using the 2-DDCT method after each sample was normalized to b-actin. Libraries for low-input bulk RNA-seq analyses with flow-purified GC B cells were generated and sequenced essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref>) and sequenced at the Emory Integrated Genomics Core. In brief, For each sample 1,000 cells were sorted directly into RLT buffer (79216; Qiagen) containing 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. RNA was isolated using Zymo Quick-RNA MicroPrep Kit (11-328M; Zymo Research). Synthesis of cDNA was performed using SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (634894; Takara Bio) kit. Final libraries were generated using 200 pg of cDNA as input for the NexteraXT kit (Illumina, FC-131-1024) with 12 cycles of PCR amplification. Final RNA-seq libraries were quantitated by QuBit (Life Technologies, Q33231), size distributions determined by bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100), pooled at equimolar ratios, and sequenced at the Emory Genomics Core on a NovaSeq6000 using a PE100 run. The RNA-seq samples of a biologically independent replication set of flow-purified GC B cells from immunized mice representing the four different genotypes were sequenced at Novogene on a NovaSeq X Plus using a PE150 runBulk RNA-seq. RNA from cultured B cells was performed by similar methods at the Vanderbiltsâ VANTAGE core.</p>
<p>To analyze sequencer outputs of each core, Fastq files were assessed for quality using FastQC. Adapters were trimmed using TrimGalore, followed by FastQC to validate adapter removal. hisat2 was used to align fastq files to the mm10 genome downloaded from UCSC genome browser. Qualimap was used to analyze the aligned sequences for quality, Subreadâs featureCounts was used to count and normalize sequence counts in groups being compared. featureCount outputs were then used for DESeq2 analysis to identify fold change and significance of observed differences in gene expression. Normalized RNA-Seq counts were analyzed using GSEA 4.3.2 (Broad Institute) and the Hallmark gene sets collection from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to identify changes in biological pathways. Differentially expressed genes identified by DESeq2 were analyzed using the MyGeneset tool from the Immunological Genome Project (Immgen) to identify B cell subsets associated with genes effected by intervention in metabolic pathways. The web-based gene set analysis toolkit (WebGestalt) was used for gene ontology over-representation analysis of biological processes using the protein coding genome as the reference set.

In brief, a total of 50 Î¼L deuterated water (D<sub>2</sub>O) and 50 Î¼L of 0.75% sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionate (TSP) in D<sub>2</sub>O were added to 500 Î¼L of diluted biological fluids and transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes (Wilmad-LabGlass, Kingsport, TN). <sup>1</sup>H-NMRS spectra were acquired on an Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a Triple Resonance CryoProbe (TCI) (Bruker) at 298 K with 7500-Hz spectral width, 32,768 time domain points, 32 scans, and a relaxation delay of 2.7 seconds. The water resonance was suppressed by a gated irradiation centered on the water frequency. The spectra were phased, baseline corrected, and referenced to TSP using Chenomx NMR Suite. Spectral assignments were based on literature values.</p>
<p>Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were measured using a Seahorse Bioscience XFe96 extracellular flux analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara CA). B cells (2.5 x 10<sup>5</sup>) activated for 2 days with anti-CD40, BAFF, IL-4, and IL-5 were seeded per well of a Cell-Tak (5 Î¼g/mL; Corning) coated plate. Glycolytic and mitochondrial stress tests were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Basal respiration, maximum respiration, and ATP production were calculated using formulas derived from the software accompanying the Agilent Seahorse platform. Steady-state ATP concentrations in activated B cells were measured using the Promega Mitochondrial ToxGloâ¢ Assay (Promega, Madison WI), following the manufacturerâs protocol. B cells activated and cultured 2 d in anti-CD40, BAFF, IL-4, and IL-5 after negative selection of splenocytes with anti-Thy1.2, in the presence or absence of metabolic inhibitors (CB839, UK5099, or both). Equal numbers of viable (Trypan Blue<sup>neg</sup>), washed twice with warm, sterile phosphate-buffered saline, were resuspended in glucose-supplemented RPMI1640, with their designated drug treatment added, and cultured (10<sup>5</sup> B cells in 100 Î¼L) 90 min at 37Â°C. Cytotoxicity Reagent (20 ÂµL 5x) was added to each well followed (30 min) by quantifying fluorescence (520-520 nm Em; 485nmEx/). 100 Î¼L of ATP Detection Reagent was then added to each well followed by orbital shaking (500rpm for 5 min). Luminescence was then measured to quantify ATP present in the B cells.</p>
<p>For metabolomic analyses, frozen (-70 C) cell pellets were extracted in plastic vials with 40 ÂµL of UPLC grade isopropanol, sonicated (3 cycles, 10 seconds each), and clarified by centrifugation (20 min). Total protein content was measured using Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Fisher-Thermo Scientific). Supernatants were analyzed using the Biocrates MxP Quant 500 XL targeted metabolomic kit (Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria), potentially quantitating 106 small molecules and free fatty acids in chromatography mode and 913 complex lipids in flow-injection mode (FIA-MS/MS).</p>
<p>Metabolite identification was based on triple quadrupole ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) using a Shimadzu Nexera chromatography platform (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) coupled to Sciex QTRAP 7500 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex LLC, Framingham, Massachusetts, USA). Metabolic indicators (474) were then calculated from sums or ratios of relevant metabolites according to Biocrates MetaboINDICATOR formulas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref>). These indicators can be regarded as physiologically relevant measures and are statistically analyzed separately from metabolites. In addition, indicators denoted as âX synthesisâ were computed as a ratio of metabolite X and its main precursors as a reflection of the inferred conversion ratio. Using solvents of LC/UHPLC-MS grade, cleared extracts were transferred onto a kit plate with pre-injected internal standards, dried, derivatized with 5% phenylisothiocyanate in pyridine, ethanol and water (1:1:1 v/v/v), and subsequent extraction with 5 mM ammonium acetate in methanol. UHPLC was performed with 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile (organic mobile phase) and 0.2% formic acid in water (inorganic mobile phase). Flow-injection analysis was performed with methanol and Biocrates MxP Quant 500 XL additive. Sample handling, randomized with stratification prior to processing to avoid potential biases, was done on dry ice to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Plates included isopropanol blanks to calculate limits of detection, repeats of a kit quality control sample to calculate concentrations and monitor the coefficient of variation, and kit calibrators for seven-point calibrations of certain compounds. Analytes (metabolic indicators) were calculated according to Biocrates MetaboINDICATOR formulas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref>). Ratios with zeros in denominator were treated as missing values that were not considered in the analysis. As additional data transformations, Box-Cox transformation with R package <italic>car</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref>), and Tukeyâs fencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>) were applied for metabolomic data.

Tests used in particular settings are generally indicated in the Figure Legends. In experiments with individual analyses and comparisons of limited numbers of samples, t-tests or non-parametric formulae were applied as appropriate, based on modeling of the similarity of variances between data from the two conditions being compared, and of the estimated fit to Gaussian distributions; Mann-Whitney testing was used if statistical analysis indicated that the two samples sets probably had unequal variance. Data are displayed as mean (Â± SEM); conventionally, a difference is considered &quot;statistically significant&quot; when the p value of for the null hypothesis of a comparison was &lt;0.05. In addition to application of this method to individual features in the metabolomic analyses, a series of multivariable linear regression models were employed, each corresponding to a specific analyte, to analyze differences in metabolomic data. In these models, the values of the analytes served as the dependent variables, while individual non-DMSO treatment groups were included as key independent variables, i.e. considering the DMSO group as the reference.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Cho et al. present a comprehensive and multidimensional analysis of glutamine metabolism in the regulation of B cell differentiation and function during immune responses. They further demonstrate how glutamine metabolism interacts with glucose uptake and utilization to modulate key intracellular processes. The manuscript is clearly written, and the experimental approaches are informative and well-executed. The authors provide a detailed mechanistic understanding through the use of both in vivo and in vitro models. The conclusions are well supported by the data, and the findings are novel and impactful. I have only a few, mostly minor, concerns related to data presentation and the rationale for certain experimental choices.</p>
<p>Detailed Comments:</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1b, it is unclear whether total B cells or follicular B cells were used in the assay. Additionally, the in vitro class-switch recombination and plasma cell differentiation experiments were conducted without BCR stimulation, which makes the system appear overly artificial and limits physiological relevance. Although the effects of glutamine concentration on the measured parameters are evident, the results cannot be confidently interpreted as true plasma cell generation or IgG1 class switching under these conditions. The authors should moderate these claims or provide stronger justification for the chosen differentiation strategy. Incorporating a parallel assay with anti-BCR stimulation would improve the rigor and interpretability of these findings.</p>
<p>(2) In Figure 1c, the DMK alone condition is not presented. This hinders readers' ability to properly asses the glutaminolysis dependency of the cells for the measured readouts. Also, CD138+ in developing PCs goes hand in hand with decreased B220 expression. A representative FACS plot showing the gating strategy for the in vitro PCs should be added as a supplementary figure. Similarly, division number (going all the way to #7) may be tricky to gate and interpret. A representative FACS plot showing the separation of B cells according to their division numbers and a subsequent gating of CD138 or IgG1 in these gates would be ideal for demonstrating the authors' ability to distinguish these populations effectively.</p>
<p>(3) A brief explanation should be provided for the exclusive use of IgG1 as the readout in class-switching assays, given that naÃ¯ve B cells are capable of switching to multiple isotypes. Clarifying why IgG1 was preferentially selected would aid in the interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>(4) The immunization experiments presented in Figures 1 and 2 are well designed, and the data are comprehensively presented. However, to prevent potential misinterpretation, it should be clarified that the observed differences between NP and OVA immunizations cannot be attributed solely to the chemical nature of the antigens - hapten versus protein. A more significant distinction lies in the route of administration (intraperitoneal vs. intranasal) and the resulting anatomical compartment of the immune response (systemic vs. lung-restricted). This context should be explicitly stated to avoid overinterpretation of the comparative findings.</p>
<p>(5) NP immunization is known to be an inducer of an IgG1-dominant Th2-type immune response in mice. IgG2c is not a major player unless a nanoparticle delivery system is used. However, the authors arbitrarily included IgG2c in their assays in Figures 2 and 3. This may be confusing for the readers. The authors should either justify the IgG2c-mediated analyses or remove them from the main figures. (It can be added as supplemental information with proper justification).</p>
<p>(6) Similarly, in affinity maturation analyses, including IgM is somewhat uncommon. I do not see any point in showing high affinity (NP2/NP20) IgMs (Figure 3d), since that data probably does not mean much.</p>
<p>(7) Following on my comment for the PC generation in Figure 1 (see above), in Figure 4, a strategy that relies solely on CD40L stimulation is performed. This is highly artificial for the PC generation and needs to be justified, or more physiologically relevant PC generation strategies involving anti-BCR, CD40L, and various cytokines should be shown.</p>
<p>(8) The effects of CB839 and UK5099 on cell viability are not shown. Including viability data under these treatment conditions would be a valuable addition to the supplementary materials, as it would help readers more accurately interpret the functional outcomes observed in the study.</p>
<p>(9) It is not clear how the RNA seq analysis in Figure 4h was generated. The experimental strategy and the setup need to be better explained.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the functional requirements for glutamine and glutaminolysis in antibody responses. The authors first demonstrate that the concentrations of glutamine in lymph nodes are substantially lower than in plasma, and that at these levels, glutamine is limiting for plasma cell differentiation in vitro. The authors go on to use genetic mouse models in which B cells are deficient in glutaminase 1 (Gls), the glucose transporter Slc2a1, and/or mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 2 (Mpc2) to test the importance of these pathways in vivo.</p>
<p>Interestingly, deficiency of Gls alone showed clear antibody defects when ovalbumin was used as the immunogen, but not the hapten NP. For the latter response, defects in antibody titers and affinity were observed only when both Gls and either Mpc2 or Slc2a1 were deleted. These latter findings form the basis of the synthetic auxotrophy conclusion. The authors go on to test these conclusions further using in vitro differentiations, Seahorse assays, pharmacological inhibitors, and targeted quantification of specific metabolites and amino acids. Finally, the authors document reduced STAT3 and STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IL-21 and interferon (both type 1 and 2), respectively, when both glutaminolysis and mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism are prevented.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The main strength of the manuscript is the overall breadth of experiments performed. Orthogonal experiments are performed using genetic models, pharmacological inhibitors, in vitro assays, and in vivo experiments to support the claims. Multiple antigens are used as test immunogens--this is particularly important given the differing results.</p>
<p>(2) B cell metabolism is an area of interest but understudied relative to other cell types in the immune system.</p>
<p>(3) The importance of metabolic flexibility and caution when interpreting negative results is made clear from this study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) All of the in vivo studies were done in the context of boosters at 3 weeks and recall responses 1 week later. This makes specific results difficult to interpret. Primary responses, including germinal centers, are still ongoing at 3 weeks after the initial immunization. Thus, untangling what proportion of the defects are due to problems in the primary vs. memory response is difficult.</p>
<p>(2) Along these lines, the defects shown in Figure 3h-i may not be due to the authors' interpretation that Gls and Mpc2 are required for efficient plasma cell differentiation from memory B cells. This interpretation would only be correct if the absence of Gls/Mpc2 leads to preferential recruitment of low-affinity memory B cells into secondary plasma cells. The more likely interpretation is that ongoing primary germinal centers are negatively impacted by Gls and Mpc2 deficiency, and this, in turn, leads to reduced affinities of serum antibodies.</p>
<p>(3) The gating strategies for germinal centers and memory B cells in Supplemental Figure 2 are problematic, especially given that these data are used to claim only modest and/or statistically insignificant differences in these populations when Gls and Mpc2 are ablated. Neither strategy shows distinct flow cytometric populations, and it does not seem that the quantification focuses on antigen-specific cells.</p>
<p>(4) Along these lines, the conclusions in Figure 6a-d may need to be tempered if the analysis was done on polyclonal, rather than antigen-specific cells. Alum induces a heavily type 2-biased response and is not known to induce much of an interferon signature. The authors' observations might be explained by the inclusion of other ongoing GCs unrelated to the immunization.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, the authors investigate how glutaminolysis (GLS) and mitochondrial pyruvate import (MPC2) jointly shape B cell fate and the humoral immune response. Using inducible knockout systems and metabolic inhibitors, they uncover a &quot;synthetic auxotrophy&quot;: When GLS activity/glutaminolysis is lost together with either GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake or MPC2, B cells fail to upregulate mitochondrial respiration, IL 21/STAT3 and IFN/STAT1 signaling is impaired, and the plasma cell output and antigen-specific antibody titers drop significantly. This work thus demonstrates the promotion of plasma cell differentiation and cytokine signaling through parallel activation of two metabolic pathways. The dataset is technically comprehensive and conceptually novel, but some aspects leave the in vivo and translational significance uncertain.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Conceptual novelty: the study goes beyond single-enzyme deletions to reveal conditional metabolic vulnerabilities and fate-deciding mechanisms in B cells.</p>
<p>(2) Mechanistic depth: the study uncovers a novel &quot;metabolic bottleneck&quot; that impairs mitochondrial respiration and elevates ROS, and directly ties these changes to cytokine-receptor signaling. This is both mechanistically compelling and potentially clinically relevant.</p>
<p>(3) Breadth of models and methods: inducible genetics, pharmacology, metabolomics, seahorse assay, ELISpot/ELISA, RNA-seq, two immunization models.</p>
<p>(4) Potential clinical angle: the synergy of CB839 with UK5099 and/or hydroxychloroquine hints at a druggable pathway targeting autoantibody-driven diseases.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Physiological relevance of &quot;synthetic auxotrophy&quot;</p>
<p>The manuscript demonstrates that GLS loss is only crippling when glucose influx or mitochondrial pyruvate import is concurrently reduced, which the authors name &quot;synthetic auxotrophy&quot;. I think it would help readers to clarify the terminology more and add a concise definition of &quot;synthetic auxotrophy&quot; versus &quot;synthetic lethality&quot; early in the manuscript and justify its relevance for B cells.</p>
<p>While the overall findings, especially the subset specificity and the clinical implications, are generally interesting, the &quot;synthetic auxotrophy&quot; condition feels a little engineered. Therefore, the findings strongly raise the question of the likelihood of such a &quot;double hit&quot; in vivo and whether there are conditions, disease states, or drug regimens that would realistically generate such a &quot;bottleneck&quot;. Hence, the authors should document or at least discuss whether GC or inflamed niches naturally show simultaneous downregulation/lack of glutamine and/or pyruvate. The authors should also aim to provide evidence that infections (e.g., influenza), hypoxia, treatments (e.g., rapamycin), or inflammatory diseases like lupus co-limit these pathways.</p>
<p>It would hence also be beneficial to test the CB839 + UK5099/HCQ combinations in a short, proof-of-concept treatment in vivo, e.g., shortly before and after the booster immunization or in an autoimmune model. Likewise, it may also be insightful to discuss potential effects of existing treatments (especially CB839, HCQ) on human memory B cell or PC pools.</p>
<p>(2) Cell survival versus differentiation phenotype</p>
<p>Claims that the phenotypes (e.g., reduced PC numbers) are &quot;independent of death&quot; and are not merely the result of artificial cell stress would benefit from Annexin-V/active-caspase 3 analyses of GC B cells and plasmablasts. Please also show viability curves for inhibitor-treated cells.</p>
<p>(3) Subset specificity of the metabolic phenotype</p>
<p>Could the metabolic differences, mitochondrial ROS, and membrane-potential changes shown for activated pan-B cells (Figure 5) also be demonstrated ex vivo for KO mouse-derived GC B cells and plasma cells? This would also be insightful to investigate following NP-immunization (e.g., NP+ GC B cells 10 days after NP-OVA immunization).</p>
<p>(4) Memory B cell gating strategy</p>
<p>I am not fully convinced that the memory-B-cell gate in Supplementary Figure 2d is appropriate. The legend implies the population is defined simply as CD19+GL7-CD38+ (or CD19+CD38++?), with no further restriction to NP-binding cells. Such a gate could also capture naÃ¯ve or recently activated B cells. From the descriptions in the figure and the figure legend, it is hard to verify that the events plotted truly represent memory B cells. Please clarify the full gating hierarchy and, ideally, restrict the MBC gate to NP+CD19+GL7-CD38+ B cells (or add additional markers such as CD80 and CD273). Generally, the manuscript would benefit from a more transparent presentation of gating strategies.</p>
<p>(5) Deletion efficiency</p>
<p>mRNA data show residual GLS/MPC2 transcripts (Supplementary Figure 8). Please quantify deletion efficiency in GC B cells and plasmablasts.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Cho et al. present a comprehensive and multidimensional analysis of glutamine metabolism in the regulation of B cell differentiation and function during immune responses. They further demonstrate how glutamine metabolism interacts with glucose uptake and utilization to modulate key intracellular processes. The manuscript is clearly written, and the experimental approaches are informative and well-executed. The authors provide a detailed mechanistic understanding through the use of both in vivo and in vitro models. The conclusions are well supported by the data, and the findings are novel and impactful. I have only a few, mostly minor, concerns related to data presentation and the rationale for certain experimental choices.</p>
<p>Detailed Comments:</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1b, it is unclear whether total B cells or follicular B cells were used in the assay. Additionally, the in vitro class-switch recombination and plasma cell differentiation experiments were conducted without BCR stimulation, which makes the system appear overly artificial and limits physiological relevance. Although the effects of glutamine concentration on the measured parameters are evident, the results cannot be confidently interpreted as true plasma cell generation or IgG1 class switching under these conditions. The authors should moderate these claims or provide stronger justification for the chosen differentiation strategy. Incorporating a parallel assay with anti-BCR stimulation would improve the rigor and interpretability of these findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will edit the manuscript to be more explicit that total splenic B cells were used in this set-up figure and the rest of the paper. In addition, we will try to perform new experiments to improve this &quot;set-up figure&quot; (and add old and new data for Supplemental Figure presentation). Specifically, we will increase the range of conditions tested - e.g., styles of stimulating proliferation and differentiation - to foster an increased sense of generality. We plan to compare mitogenic stimulation with anti-CD40 to  anti-IgM and to anti-IgM + anti-CD40, all with BAFF, IL-4, and IL-5, bearing in mind excellent work from Aiba et al, Immunity 2006; 24: 259-268, and similar papers. We also will try to present some representative flow cytometric profiles (presumably in new Supplemental Figure panels).</p>
<p>To be transparent and add to a more open public discussion (using the virtues of this forum, the senior author and colleagues would caution about whether any in vitro conditions exist that warrant complete confidence. That is the reason for proceeding to immunization experiments in vivo. That is not said to cast doubt on our own in vitro data - there are some experiments (such as those of Fig. 1a-c and associated Supplemental Fig. 1) that only can be done in vitro or are better done that way (e.g., because of rapid uptake of early apoptotic B cells in vivo).</p>
<p>For instance: Well-respected papers use the CD40LB and NB21.2D9 systems to activate B cells and generate plasma cells. Those appear to be BCR-independent and unfortunately, we found that they cannot be used with a.a. deprivation or these inhibitors due to effects on the engineered stroma-like cells. In considering BCR engagement, Reth has published salient points about signaling and concentrations of the Ab, the upshot being that this means of activating mitogenesis and plasma cell differentiation (when the B cells are costimulated via CD40 or TLR(4 or 7/8) is probably more than a bit artificial. Moreover, although Aiba et al, Immunity 2006; 24: 259-268 is a laudable exception, one rarely finds papers using BAFF despite the strong evidence it is an essential part of the equation of B cell regulation in vivo and a cytokine that modulates BCR signaling - in the cultures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 1c, the DMK alone condition is not presented. This hinders readers' ability to properly asses the glutaminolysis dependency of the cells for the measured readouts. Also, CD138+ in developing PCs goes hand in hand with decreased B220 expression. A representative FACS plot showing the gating strategy for the in vitro PCs should be added as a supplementary figure. Similarly, division number (going all the way to #7) may be tricky to gate and interpret. A representative FACS plot showing the separation of B cells according to their division numbers and a subsequent gating of CD138 or IgG1 in these gates would be ideal for demonstrating the authors' ability to distinguish these populations effectively.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that exact placement  of divisions deconvolution by FlowJow is more fraught than might be thought forpresentations in many or most papers. For the revision, we will try to add one or several representative FACS plot(s) with old and new data to provide the gating on CTV fluorescence, bearing these points in mind when extending the experiments from ~7 years ago (Fig. 1b, c). With the representative examples of the old data pasted in here, we will aver, however, that using divisions 0-6, and â¥7 was reasonable.</p>
<p>Ditto for DMK with normal glutamine. However, in the spirit of eLife transparency lacking in many other journals, this comparison is more fraught than the referee comment would make things seem. The concentration tolerated by cells is highly dependent on the medium and glutamine concentration, and perhaps on rates of glutaminolysis (due to its generation of ammonia). In practice, we find that DMK becomes more toxic to B cells unless glutamine is low or glutaminolysis is restricted. Thus, the concentration of DMK that is tolerated and used in Fig. 1b, c can become toxic to the B cells when using the higher levels of glutamine in typical culture media (2 mM or more) - at which point the &quot;normal conditions + DMK&quot; &quot;control&quot; involves the surviving cells in conditions with far greater cell death and less population expansion than the &quot;low glutamine + DMK&quot;. condition. Overall, we appreciate the suggestion to show more DMK data and will work to do so for the earlier proliferation data (shown above) and the new experiments.</p>

<p>(3) A brief explanation should be provided for the exclusive use of IgG1 as the readout in class-switching assays, given that naÃ¯ve B cells are capable of switching to multiple isotypes. Clarifying why IgG1 was preferentially selected would aid in the interpretation of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will edit the text to be more explicit and harmonize in light of the referee's suggestion that we focus the presentation of serologic data on IgG1 in the immunization experiments.</p>
<p>[IgG1 provides the strongest signal and hence better signal/noise both in vitro and with the alum-based immunizations that are avatars for the adjuvant used in the majority of protein-based vaccines for humans.]</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The immunization experiments presented in Figures 1 and 2 are well designed, and the data are comprehensively presented. However, to prevent potential misinterpretation, it should be clarified that the observed differences between NP and OVA immunizations cannot be attributed solely to the chemical nature of the antigens - hapten versus protein. A more significant distinction lies in the route of administration (intraperitoneal vs. intranasal) and the resulting anatomical compartment of the immune response (systemic vs. lung-restricted). This context should be explicitly stated to avoid overinterpretation of the comparative findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the referee and will edit the text accordingly. Certainly, the difference in how the anti-ova response is elicited compared to the anti-NP response in the same mice or with a bit different an immunization regimen might be another factor - or the major factor - that could contribute towards explaining why glutaminolysis was important after ovalbumin inhalations (used because emergence of anti-ova Ab / ASCs is suppressed by the NP hapten after NP-ova immunization) but not needed for the anti-NP response unless Slc2a1 or Mpc2 also was inactivated. Thank you prompting addition of this caveat.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it seems fair to note that in Figures 1 and 2, the ASCs and Ab are being analyzed for NP and ova in the same mice, albeit with the NP-specific components not being driven by the inhalations of ovalbumin. With that in mind, when one compares the IgG1 anti-NP ASC and Ab to those for IgG1 anti-ovalbumin (ASC in bone marrow; Ab), the ovalbumin-specific response was reduced whereas the anti-NP response was not.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) NP immunization is known to be an inducer of an IgG1-dominant Th2-type immune response in mice. IgG2c is not a major player unless a nanoparticle delivery system is used. However, the authors arbitrarily included IgG2c in their assays in Figures 2 and 3. This may be confusing for the readers. The authors should either justify the IgG2c-mediated analyses or remove them from the main figures. (It can be added as supplemental information with proper justification).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will rearrange the Figure panels to move the IgM and IgG2c data to Supplemental Figures.</p>
<p>For purposes of public discourse, we note that the data of previous Figure 3(c, g) show a very strong NP-specific IgG2c response that seems to contradict the concept that IgG2c responses necessarily are weak in this setting, and the important role of IgG2c (mouse - IgG1 in humans) in controlling or clearing various pathogens as well as in autoimmunity. So from the standpoint of providing a better sense of generality to the loss-of-function effects, we continue to think that these measurements are quite important. That said, the main text has many figure panels and as the review notes, the class switching and in vitro ASC generation were done with IL-4 / IgG1-promoting conditions. If possible, we will try to assay in vitro class switching with IFN-g rather than IL-4 but there may not be enough resources (time before lab closure; money).</p>
<p>[As a collegial aside, we speculate that a greater or lesser IgG2c anti-NP response may arise due to different preparations of NP-carrier obtained from the vendor (Biosearch) having different amounts of TLR (e.g., TLR4) ligand. In any case, the points of presenting the IgG2c (and IgM) data were to push against the limiting boundaries of convention (which risks perpetuating a narrow view of potential outcomes) and make the breadth of results more apparent to readers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Similarly, in affinity maturation analyses, including IgM is somewhat uncommon. I do not see any point in showing high affinity (NP2/NP20) IgMs (Figure 3d), since that data probably does not mean much.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted in the reply immediately preceding this one, we appreciate this suggestion from the reviewer and will move the IgM and IgG2c to Supplemental status.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in collegial discourse we disagree a bit with the referee in light of our data as well as of work that (to our minds) leads one to question why inclusion of affinity maturation of IgM is so uncommon - as the referee accurately notes. Of course a defect in the capacity to class-switch is highly deleterious in patients but that is not the same as concluding that recall IgM or its affinity is of little consequence.</p>
<p>In some of the pioneering work back in the 1980's, Bothwell showed that NP-carrier immunization generated hybridomas producing IgM Ab with extensive SHM (~11% of the 18 lineages; ~ 1/3 of the IgM hybridomas) [PMID: 8487778], IgM B cells appear to move into GC, and there is at least a reasonable published basis for the view that there are GC-derived IgM (unswitched) memory B cells (MBC) that would be more likely, upon recall activation, to differentiate into ASCs. [As an example, albeit with the Jenkins lab anti-rPE response, Taylor, Pape, and Jenkins generated quantitative estimates of the numbers of Ag-specific IgM<sup>+</sup>vs switched MBC that were GC-derived (or not). [PMID: 22370719]. While they emphasized that ~90% of  IgM<sup>+</sup> MBC appeared to be GC-independent, their data also indicated that ~1/2 of all GC-derived MBC were IgM<sup>+</sup> rather than switched (their Fig. 8, B vs C; also 8E, which includes alum-PE). And while we immensely respect the referee, we are perhaps less confident that IgM or high-affinity Ag-specific IgM doesn't mean that much, if only because of evidence that localized Ab compete for Ag and may thus influence selective processes [PMCID: PMC2747358; PMID: 15953185; PMID: 23420879; PMID: 27270306].</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Following on my comment for the PC generation in Figure 1 (see above), in Figure 4, a strategy that relies solely on CD40L stimulation is performed. This is highly artificial for the PC generation and needs to be justified, or more physiologically relevant PC generation strategies involving anti-BCR, CD40L, and various cytokines should be shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In line with our response to point (1), we plan and will try to self-fund testing BCR-stimulated B cells (anti-CD40 to  anti-IgM and to anti-IgM + anti-CD40, all with BAFF, IL-4, and IL-5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The effects of CB839 and UK5099 on cell viability are not shown. Including viability data under these treatment conditions would be a valuable addition to the supplementary materials, as it would help readers more accurately interpret the functional outcomes observed in the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will add to the supplemental figures to present data that provide cues as to relative viability / survival under the experimental conditions used. [FSC X SSC as well as 7AAD or Ghost dye panels; we also hope to generate new data that include further experiments scoring annexin V staining.]</p>

<p>(9) It is not clear how the RNA seq analysis in Figure 4h was generated. The experimental strategy and the setup need to be better explained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The revised manuscript will include more information (at minimum in the Methods, Legend), and we apologize that in this and a few other instances sufficiency of detail was sacrificed on the altar of brevity.</p>
<p>[Adding a brief synopsis to any reader before the final version of record, given the many months it will take to generate new data, thoroughly revise the manuscript, etc:</p>
<p>In three temporally and biologically independent experiments, cultures were harvested 3.5 days after splenic B cells were purified and cultured as in the experiments of Fig. 4a-e. total cellular RNA prepared from the twelve samples (three replicates for each of four conditions - DMSO vehicle control, CB839, UK5099, and CB839 + UK5099) was analyzed by RNA-seq. After the RNA-seq data were initially processed using the pipeline described in the Methods. For panels g &amp; h of Fig 4, DE Seq2 was used to quantify and compare read counts in the three CB839 + UK5099 samples relative to the three independent vehicle controls and identify all genes for which variances yielded P&lt;0.05. In Fig 4g, all such genes for which the difference was 'statistically significant' (i.e., P&lt;0.05) were entered into the Immgen tool and thereby mapped to the B lineage subsets shown in the figure panels (i.e., g, h). In (g), these are displayed using one format, whereas (h) uses the 'heatmap' tool in MyGeneSet.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the functional requirements for glutamine and glutaminolysis in antibody responses. The authors first demonstrate that the concentrations of glutamine in lymph nodes are substantially lower than in plasma, and that at these levels, glutamine is limiting for plasma cell differentiation in vitro. The authors go on to use genetic mouse models in which B cells are deficient in glutaminase 1 (Gls), the glucose transporter Slc2a1, and/or mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 2 (Mpc2) to test the importance of these pathways in vivo.</p>
<p>Interestingly, deficiency of Gls alone showed clear antibody defects when ovalbumin was used as the immunogen, but not the hapten NP. For the latter response, defects in antibody titers and affinity were observed only when both Gls and either Mpc2 or Slc2a1 were deleted. These latter findings form the basis of the synthetic auxotrophy conclusion. The authors go on to test these conclusions further using in vitro differentiations, Seahorse assays, pharmacological inhibitors, and targeted quantification of specific metabolites and amino acids. Finally, the authors document reduced STAT3 and STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IL-21 and interferon (both type 1 and 2), respectively, when both glutaminolysis and mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism are prevented.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The main strength of the manuscript is the overall breadth of experiments performed. Orthogonal experiments are performed using genetic models, pharmacological inhibitors, in vitro assays, and in vivo experiments to support the claims. Multiple antigens are used as test immunogens--this is particularly important given the differing results.</p>
<p>(2) B cell metabolism is an area of interest but understudied relative to other cell types in the immune system.</p>
<p>(3) The importance of metabolic flexibility and caution when interpreting negative results is made clear from this study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) All of the in vivo studies were done in the context of boosters at 3 weeks and recall responses 1 week later. This makes specific results difficult to interpret. Primary responses, including germinal centers, are still ongoing at 3 weeks after the initial immunization. Thus, untangling what proportion of the defects are due to problems in the primary vs. memory response is difficult.</p>
<p>(2) Along these lines, the defects shown in Figure 3h-i may not be due to the authors' interpretation that Gls and Mpc2 are required for efficient plasma cell differentiation from memory B cells. This interpretation would only be correct if the absence of Gls/Mpc2 leads to preferential recruitment of low-affinity memory B cells into secondary plasma cells. The more likely interpretation is that ongoing primary germinal centers are negatively impacted by Gls and Mpc2 deficiency, and this, in turn, leads to reduced affinities of serum antibodies</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We provisionally plan to edit the wording of the conclusion a bit to add a possibility we consider unlikely to avoid a conclusion that MBCs bearing switched BCRs are affected once reactivated. We also will perform a new experiment to investigate, but unfortunately time before lab closure has been and remains our enemy both for performance and multiple replication of the work presented in Figure 3, panels h &amp; i, and the related Supplemental Data (Supplemental Fig. 3a-j). Unfortunately, it will not be possible to do a memory experiment with recall immunization out at 8 weeks.  Despite the grant funding running out and institutional belt-tightening, however, we'll try to perform a new head-to-head comparison of 4 wk post-immunization with and without the boost at three weeks.</p>
<p>The intriguing concern (points 1 &amp; 2) provides a springboard for consideration of generalizations and simplifications. Germinal center durability is not at all monolithic, and instead is quite variable**. The premise (cognitive bias, perhaps?) in the interpretation is that in our previous work we find few if any GC B cells - NP-APC-binding or otherwise - above the background (non-immunized controls) three weeks after immunization with NP-ovalbumin in alum. Recognizing that it is not NP-carrier in alum as immunizations, we note for the readers and referee that Fig. 1 of the Taylor, Pape, &amp; Jenkins paper considered above [PMID: 22370719] reported 10-fold more Ag-specific MBCs than GC B cells at day 29 post-immunization (the point at which the boost / recall challenge was performed in our Figure 3h, i).</p>
<p>Viewed from that perspective, the surmise of the comment is that a major contribution to the differences in both all-affinity and high-affinity anti-NP IgG1 shown in Fig. 3i derives from the immunization at 4 wk stimulating GC B cells we cannot find as opposed to memory B cells. However, it is true that in the literature (especially with the experimentally different approach of transferring BCR-transgenic / knock-in versions of an NP-biased BCR) there may be meaningful pools of IgG1 and IgG2c GC B cells. Alternatively, our current reagents for immunizations may have become better at maintaining GC than those in the past - which we will try to test.</p>
<p>The issue and question also relate to rates of output of plasma cells or rises in the serum concentrations of class-switched Ab. To this point, our prior experiences agree with the long-published data of the Kurosaki lab in Figure 3c of the Aiba et al paper noted above (Immunity, 2006) (and other such time courses). Readers can note that the IgG1 anti-NP response (alum adjuvant, as in our work) hits its plateau at 2 wk, and did not increase further from 2 to 3 wk. In other words, GC are on the decline and  Ab production has reached its plateau by the time of the 2nd immunization in Fig. 3h).</p>
<p>Assuming we understand the comment and line of reasoning correctly, we also lean towards disagreeing with the statement &quot;This interpretation would only be correct if the absence of Gls/Mpc2 leads to preferential recruitment of low-affinity memory B cells into secondary plasma cells.&quot; Our evidence shows that both low-affinity as well as high-affinity anti-NP Ab (IgG1) went down as a result of combined gene-inactivation after the peak primary response (Fig. 3i). Recent papers show that affinity maturation is attributable to greater proliferation of plasmablasts with high-affinity BCR. Accordingly, the findings with loss of GLS and MPC function are quite consistent with the interpretation that much of the response after the second immunization draws on MBC differentiation into plasmablasta and then plasma cells, where the proliferative advantage of high-affinity cells is blunted by the impaired metabolism. The provisional plan, however, is to note the alternative, if less likely, interpretation proposed by the review.</p>
<p>** In some contexts, of course, especially certain viral infections or vaccination with lipid nanoparticles carrying modified mRNA, germinal centers are far more persistent; also, in humans even the seasonal flu vaccine **</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The gating strategies for germinal centers and memory B cells in Supplemental Figure 2 are problematic, especially given that these data are used to claim only modest and/or statistically insignificant differences in these populations when Gls and Mpc2 are ablated. Neither strategy shows distinct flow cytometric populations, and it does not seem that the quantification focuses on antigen-specific cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will enhance these aspects of the presentation, using old and hopefully new data, but note for readers that many many other papers in the best journals show plots in which the separation of, say, GC-Tfh from overall Tfh is based on cut-off within what essentially is a continuous spectrum of emission as adjusted or compensated by the cytometer (spectral or conventional).</p>
<p>Perhaps incorrectly, we omitted presenting data that included the results with NP-APC-staining - in part because within the GC B cell gate the frequencies of NP-binding events (GCB cells) were similar in double-knockout samples and controls. In practice, that would mean that the metabolic requirement applied about equally to NP+ and the total population. We will try to rectify this point in the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Along these lines, the conclusions in Figure 6a-d may need to be tempered if the analysis was done on polyclonal, rather than antigen-specific cells. Alum induces a heavily type 2-biased response and is not known to induce much of an interferon signature. The authors' observations might be explained by the inclusion of other ongoing GCs unrelated to the immunization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will make sure the text is clear that the in vitro experiments do not represent GC B cells and that the RNA-seq data were not an Ag (SRBC)-specific subset.</p>
<p>We also will try to work in a schematic along with expanding the Legends to make it more readily clear that the RNA-seq data (and hence the GSEA) involved immunizations with SRBC (not the alum / NP system which - it may be noted - in these experiments actually generated a robust IgG2c (type 1-driven) response along with the type 2-enhanced IgG1 response.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, the authors investigate how glutaminolysis (GLS) and mitochondrial pyruvate import (MPC2) jointly shape B cell fate and the humoral immune response. Using inducible knockout systems and metabolic inhibitors, they uncover a &quot;synthetic auxotrophy&quot;: When GLS activity/glutaminolysis is lost together with either GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake or MPC2, B cells fail to upregulate mitochondrial respiration, IL 21/STAT3 and IFN/STAT1 signaling is impaired, and the plasma cell output and antigen-specific antibody titers drop significantly. This work thus demonstrates the promotion of plasma cell differentiation and cytokine signaling through parallel activation of two metabolic pathways. The dataset is technically comprehensive and conceptually novel, but some aspects leave the in vivo and translational significance uncertain.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Conceptual novelty: the study goes beyond single-enzyme deletions to reveal conditional metabolic vulnerabilities and fate-deciding mechanisms in B cells.</p>
<p>(2) Mechanistic depth: the study uncovers a novel &quot;metabolic bottleneck&quot; that impairs mitochondrial respiration and elevates ROS, and directly ties these changes to cytokine-receptor signaling. This is both mechanistically compelling and potentially clinically relevant.</p>
<p>(3) Breadth of models and methods: inducible genetics, pharmacology, metabolomics, seahorse assay, ELISpot/ELISA, RNA-seq, two immunization models.</p>
<p>(4) Potential clinical angle: the synergy of CB839 with UK5099 and/or hydroxychloroquine hints at a druggable pathway targeting autoantibody-driven diseases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and thank the referee for the positive comments and this succinct summary of what we view as contributions of the paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Physiological relevance of &quot;synthetic auxotrophy&quot;</p>
<p>The manuscript demonstrates that GLS loss is only crippling when glucose influx or mitochondrial pyruvate import is concurrently reduced, which the authors name &quot;synthetic auxotrophy&quot;. I think it would help readers to clarify the terminology more and add a concise definition of &quot;synthetic auxotrophy&quot; versus &quot;synthetic lethality&quot; early in the manuscript and justify its relevance for B cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will edit the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion to try to do better on this score. Conscious of how expansive the prose and data are even in the original submission, we appear to have taken some shortcuts that we will try to rectify. Thank you for highlighting this need to improve on a key concept!</p>
<p>That said, we punctiliously &amp; perhaps pedantically encourage readers to be completely accurate, in that under one condition of immunization GLS loss substantially reduced the anti-ovalbumin response (Fig. 1, Fig. 2a-c). And for this provisional response, we will expand a bit on the notion that synthetic auxotrophy represents effects on differentiation that appear to go beyond and not simply to be selective death, even though decreased population expansion is observed and one cannot exclude some contribution of enhanced death in vivo. Finally, we will note that this comment of the review raises interesting semantic questions about what represents &quot;physiological relevance&quot; but leave it at that.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While the overall findings, especially the subset specificity and the clinical implications, are generally interesting, the &quot;synthetic auxotrophy&quot; condition feels a little engineered.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One can readily say that CAR-T cells are 'a little engineered' so it is a matter of balancing this perspective of the referee against the strengths they highlight in points 1, 2, and 4. In any case, we will probably try to expand and be more explicit in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>In brief, even were the money not all gone, we would not believe that expanding the heft of this already rather large manuscript and set of data would be appropriate. As matters stand, a basic new insight about metabolic flexibility and its limits leads to evidence of a way to reduce generation of Ab and a novel impairment of STAT transcription factor induction by several cytokine receptors. The vulnerability that could be tested in later work on B cell-dependent autoimmunity includes the capacity to test a compound that already has been to or through FDA phase II in patients together with an FDA-approved standard-of-care agent.</p>
<p>Put a different way, the point is that a basic curiosity to understand why decreasing glucose influx did not have an even more profound effect than what was observed, combined with curiosity as to why glutaminolysis was dispensable in relatively standard vaccine-like models of immunize / boost, provided a springboard to identification of new vulnerabilities. As above, we appreciate being made aware that this point merits being made more explicit in the Discussion of the edited version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Therefore, the findings strongly raise the question of the likelihood of such a &quot;double hit&quot; in vivo and whether there are conditions, disease states, or drug regimens that would realistically generate such a &quot;bottleneck&quot;.</p>
<p>Hence, the authors should document or at least discuss whether GC or inflamed niches naturally show simultaneous downregulation/lack of glutamine and/or pyruvate. The authors should also aim to provide evidence that infections (e.g., influenza), hypoxia, treatments (e.g., rapamycin), or inflammatory diseases like lupus co-limit these pathways.</p>

<p>Again, we appreciate some 'licensing' to be more expansive and explicit, and will try to balance editing in such points against undue tedium or tendentiously speculative length in the Discussion. In particular, we will note that a clear, simple implication of the work is to highlight an imperative to test CB839 in lupus patients already on hydroxychloroquine as standard-of-care, and to suggest development of UK5099 (already tested many times in mouse models of cancer) to complement glutaminase inhibition.</p>
<p>As backdrop, we note that the failure to advance imaging mass spectrometry to the capacity to quantify relative or absolute (via nano-DESI) concentrations of nutrients in localized interstitia is a critical gap in the entire field. Techniques that sample the interstitial fluid of tumor masses or in our case LN as a work-around have yielded evidence that there can be meaningful limitations of glucose and glutamine, but it needs to be acknowledged that such findings may be very model-specific and, as can be the case with cutting-edge science, are not without controversy. That said, yes, we had found that hypoxia reduced glutamine uptake but given the norms of focused, tidy packages only reported on leucine in an earlier paper [PMID27501247; PMCID5161594].</p>

<p>It would hence also be beneficial to test the CB839 + UK5099/HCQ combinations in a short, proof-of-concept treatment in vivo, e.g., shortly before and after the booster immunization or in an autoimmune model. Likewise, it may also be insightful to discuss potential effects of existing treatments (especially CB839, HCQ) on human memory B cell or PC pools.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We certainly agree that the suggestions offered in this comment are important next steps and the right approach to test if the findings reported here translate toward the treatment of autoimmune diseases that involve B cells, interferons, and pathophysiology mediated by auto-Ab. As practical points, performance and replication of such studies would take more time than the year allotted for return of a revised manuscript to eLife and in any case neither funds nor a lab remain to do these important studies.</p>
<p>Concrete evidence for our concurrence was embodied in a grant application to NIH that was essential for keeping a lab and doing any such studies. [We note, as a suggestion to others, that an essential component of such studies would be to test the effects of these compounds on B cells from patients and mice with autoimmunity]. Perhaps unfortunately for SLE patients, the review panelists did not agree about the importance of such studies. However, it can be hoped that the patent-holder of CB839 (and perhaps other companies developing glutaminase inhibitors) will see this peer-reviewed pre-print and the public dialogue, and recognize how positive results might open a valuable contribution to mitigation of diseases such as SLE.</p>

<p>(2) Cell survival versus differentiation phenotype</p>
<p>Claims that the phenotypes (e.g., reduced PC numbers) are &quot;independent of death&quot; and are not merely the result of artificial cell stress would benefit from Annexin-V/active-caspase 3 analyses of GC B cells and plasmablasts. Please also show viability curves for inhibitor-treated cell</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This comment leads us to see that the wording on this point may have been overly terse in the interests of brevity, and thereby open to some misunderstanding. Accordingly, we will expand out the text of the Abstract and elsewhere in the manuscript, to be more clear. In addition, we will add in some data on the point, hopefully including some results of new experiments.</p>
<p>To clarify in this public context, it is not that an increase in death (along with the reported decrease in cell cycling) can be or is excluded - and in fact it likely exists in vitro. The point is that beyond any such increase, and taking into account division number (since there is evidence that PC differentiation and output numbers involve a 'division-counting' mechanism), the frequencies of CD138+ cells and of ASCs among the viable cells are lower, as is the level of Prdm1-encoded mRNA even before the big increase in CD138+ cells in the population.</p>

<p>(3) Subset specificity of the metabolic phenotype</p>
<p>Could the metabolic differences, mitochondrial ROS, and membrane-potential changes shown for activated pan-B cells (Figure 5) also be demonstrated ex vivo for KO mouse-derived GC B cells and plasma cells? This would also be insightful to investigate following NP-immunization (e.g., NP+ GC B cells 10 days after NP-OVA immunization).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that such data could be nice and add to the comprehensiveness of the work. We will try to scrounge the resources (time; money; human) to test this roughly as indicated. That said, we would note that the frequencies and hence numbers of NP+ GC B cells are so low that even in the flow cytometer we suspect there will not be enough &quot;events&quot; to rely on the results with DCFDA in the tiny sub-sub-subset. It also bears noting that reliable flow cytometric identification of the small NP-specific plasmablast/plasma cell subset amidst the overall population, little of which arose from immunization or after deletion of the floxed segments in B cells, would potentially be misleading.</p>

<p>(4) Memory B cell gating strategy</p>
<p>I am not fully convinced that the memory-B-cell gate in Supplementary Figure 2d is appropriate. The legend implies the population is defined simply as CD19+GL7-CD38+ (or CD19+CD38++?), with no further restriction to NP-binding cells. Such a gate could also capture naÃ¯ve or recently activated B cells. From the descriptions in the figure and the figure legend, it is hard to verify that the events plotted truly represent memory B cells. Please clarify the full gating hierarchy and, ideally, restrict the MBC gate to NP+CD19+GL7-CD38+ B cells (or add additional markers such as CD80 and CD273). Generally, the manuscript would benefit from a more transparent presentation of gating strategies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will further expand the supplemental data displays to include more of the gating and analytic scheme, and hope to be able to have performed new experiments and analyses (including additional markers) that could mitigate the concern noted here. In addition, we will include flow data from the non-immunized control mice that had been analyzed concurrently in the experiments illustrated in this Figure.</p>
<p>Although it should be noted that the labeling indicated that the gating included the important criterion that cells be IgD- (Supplemental Fig. 2b), which excludes the vast majority of naive B cells, in principle marginal zone (MZ) B cells might fall within this gate. However, the MZ B population is unlikely to explain the differences shown in Supplemental Fig. 2b-d.</p>

<p>(5) Deletion efficiency - [The] mRNA data show residual GLS/MPC2 transcripts (Supplementary Figure 8). Please quantify deletion efficiency in GC B cells and plasmablasts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Even were there resources to do this, the degree of reduction in target mRNA (Gls; Mpc2) renders this question superfluous.</p>
<p>Are there likely to be some cells with only one, or even neither, allele converted from fl to D? Yes, but they would be a minor subset in light of the magnitude of mRNA reduction, in contrast to our published observations with Slc2a1. As to plasmablasts and plasma cells, the pre-existing populations make such an analysis misleading, while the scarcity of such cells recoverable with antigen capture techniques is so low as to make both RNA and genomic DNA analyses questionable.</p>
