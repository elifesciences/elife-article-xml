<title>Abstract</title><p>The epigenetic reader SntB was identified as an important transcriptional regulator of growth, development, and secondary metabolite synthesis in <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. In this study, <italic>sntB</italic> gene deletion (Δ<italic>sntB</italic>), complementary (Com-<italic>sntB</italic>), and HA tag fused to <italic>snt2</italic> (<italic>snt2</italic>-HA) strains were constructed by using the homologous recombination method, respectively. Our results revealed that deletion of <italic>sntB</italic> inhibited the processes of mycelia growth, conidial production, sclerotia formation, aflatoxin synthesis, and ability to colonize host compared to wild type (WT), and the defective phenotype of knockout strain Δ<italic>sntB</italic> can be restored by its complementary strain Com-<italic>sntB</italic>. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of <italic>sntB-</italic>HA and WT and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of Δ<italic>sntB</italic> and WT strains revealed that SntB played key roles in oxidative stress response of <italic>A. flavus</italic>. The function of <italic>catC</italic> (encode a catalase) gene was further analyzed based on the integration results of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. In Δ<italic>sntB</italic> strain, the relative expression level of <italic>catC</italic> was significantly higher than in WT strain, while a secretory lipase encoding gene (G4B84_008359) was down-regulated. Under the stress of oxidant menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB), the deletion of <italic>sntB</italic> obvious down-regulated the expression level of <italic>catC</italic>. After deletion of <italic>catC</italic> gene, the mycelia growth, conidial production, and sclerotia formation were inhibited, while aflatoxin synthesis was increased compared to the WT strain. Results also showed that the inhibition rate of MSB to Δ<italic>catC</italic> strain was significantly lower than that of WT group and AFB1 yield of the Δ<italic>catC</italic> strain was significantly decreased than that of WT strain under the stress of MSB. Our study revealed the potential machinery that SntB regulated fungal morphogenesis, mycotoxin anabolism, and fungal virulence through the axle of from SntB to fungal virulence and mycotoxin bio-synthesis, i.e. H3K36me3 modification-SntB-Peroxisomes-Lipid hydrolysis-fungal virulence and mycotoxin bio-synthesis. The results of the study shad light into the SntB mediated epigenetic regulation pathway of fungal mycotoxin anabolism and virulence, which provided potential strategy for control the contamination of <italic>A. flavus</italic> and its aflatoxins.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> is one of the common asexual species, a saprophytic fungus and the second largest pathogenic fungus after <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, widely distributed in soil, air, water, plants, and agricultural products in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Aflatoxins produced by <italic>A. flavus</italic> has strong toxicity, and is extremely harmful to human society. Animal and human health can be negatively affected by aflatoxins, which are carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Among aflatoxins, AFB1 is the most frequently occurring and the most toxic and carcinogenic, which is converted to AFB1-8 and 9-epoxide in the liver and formed adducts with the guanine base of DNA and thus results in acute and chronic diseases in both human and household animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 25% of the food crops in the world are contaminated with aflatoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], which are often detected in grains, nuts, and spices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. It is urgent to control the contamination of <italic>A. flavus</italic> and its main mycotoxin, AFB1. In recent decades, the biosynthetic pathway of aflatoxins was investigated in detail benefit from the sequence of <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. This pathway consists of a complex set of enzymatic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. In general, these enzymes are encoded by clusters of genes, which are regulated by cluster-specific genes: <italic>aflR</italic> and <italic>aflS</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. The initial stage of aflatoxins biosynthesis is catalyzed by polyketide synthase (PKSA) to form the polyketone backbone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Aflatoxins synthesis also regulated by environmental stimuli including pH, light, nutrient sources, and oxidative stress response, which may result in the modulation of the expression of genes involved in toxin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Besides the biosynthetic pathway and its internal gene regulation, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), an important mean of epigenetics, represent an important role in the regulation of aflatoxins synthesis, including 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, succinylation, acetylation, and methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], in which Snt2 (also called <italic>sntB</italic>, an epigenetic reader) is deeply involved. Despite advancements in the field, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aflatoxin production in <italic>A. flavus</italic> is still fragmentary.</p>
<p>The epigenetic reader encoded by <italic>sntB</italic> in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> was identified as a transcriptional regulator of the sterigmatocystin biosynthetic gene cluster and deletion of <italic>sntB</italic> gene in <italic>A. flavus</italic> results in loss of aflatoxin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], increasing global levels of H3K9K14 acetylation and impairing several developmental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The homolog gene in yeast, <italic>SNT2</italic> coordinates the transcriptional response to hydrogen peroxide stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. In <italic>Penicillium expansum</italic>, SntB regulated the development, patulin and citrinin production, and virulence on apples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. In <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, SntB combined with a H3K4 histone demethylase KdmB, a cohesin acetyltransferase (EcoA), and a histone deacetylase (RpdA) to form a chromatin binding complex and bound to regulatory genes and coordinated fungal development with mycotoxin synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. <italic>sntB</italic> also regulated the virulence in <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, and respiration in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>].</p>
<p>However, the specific regulatory mechanism of <italic>sntB</italic> in <italic>A. flavus</italic> remains unclear. In this study, we identified the regulatory network of <italic>sntB</italic> by Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which shed light on its impact on fungal biology.</p>

<title>The phenotype of SntB in <italic>A. flavus</italic></title>
<p>The role of SntB in <italic>A. flavus</italic> has been previously characterized by analyzing both Δ<italic>sntB</italic> and overexpression <italic>sntB</italic> genetic mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. To further investigate the intrinsic mechanism of this regulator on the development and aflatoxin biosynthesis in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, the <italic>sntB</italic> deletion strain (Δ<italic>sntB</italic>) and the complementary strain (Com-<italic>sntB</italic>) were constructed by the method of homologous recombination and verified by diagnostic PCR and southern blotting (Figure S1). The expression levels of <italic>sntB</italic> in WT, Δ<italic>sntB</italic>, and Com-<italic>sntB</italic> strains was further detected by qRT-PCR and the result showed that the expression of <italic>sntB</italic> was absent in the gene-deletion strains, and it fully recovered in the Com-<italic>sntB</italic> (Figure S1), which reflected that the <italic>sntB</italic> and Com-<italic>sntB</italic> had been constructed, and could be used in the subsequent experiments of this study. The phenotype analysis of this study revealed that the deletion of <italic>sntB</italic> gene significantly inhibited the growth of mycelium, hyphae morphology, the length of fungal cell (between two adjacent septa), the number of conidiation, sclerotium formation, and aflatoxin biosynthesis, while the above phenotypes of both development and mycotoxin bio-synthesis were fully recovered in the Com-<italic>sntB</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). To reveal the signaling pathways of <italic>sntB</italic> in conidiation, sclerotium formation, and aflatoxin biosynthesis, qRT-PCR analysis was performed to assess the expression levels of sporulation related transcriptional factor genes, <italic>steA</italic>, <italic>WetA</italic>, <italic>fluG</italic>, and <italic>veA,</italic> sclerotia formation related transcriptional factor genes, <italic>nsdC</italic>, <italic>nsdD</italic>, and <italic>sclR</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], and the AFs synthesis gene cluster structural genes <italic>aflC</italic>, <italic>aflR,</italic> and <italic>aflP</italic>, and the main regulatory gene <italic>aflR</italic> and <italic>aflS</italic>. As shown in Figure S2, the relative expression levels of these genes were significantly lower in the Δ<italic>sntB</italic> strain compared to that of the WT strain, and recovered in the Com-<italic>sntB</italic> strain. These results indicated that SntB regulates the conidiation, sclerotium formation, and aflatoxin biosynthesis by the canonical signaling pathways mediated by these regulators.</p>

<p>The capacity of fungal infection is closely related to secreted hydrolases, such as amylase, lipase, protease, etc. In order to explore the effect of SntB on the activity of hydrolases, the activities of amylase in the above each fungal strain were further determined. The results showed that the colonies of Δ<italic>sntB</italic> produced almost no degradation transparent circle after adding iodine solution compared with that of WT and Com<italic>-sntB</italic>, which indicated that the activity of α-amylase in Δ<italic>sntB</italic> strain was significantly reduced (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) (Figure S3B and S3C).

<p>To characterize the chromatin regions targeted by SntB, ChIP-seq studies were carried out with both HA tag fused <italic>sntB</italic> strain (<italic>sntB</italic>-HA) and WT strain. The <italic>sntB</italic>-HA strain was constructed by homologous recombination through fused HA to the 3’ end of <italic>sntB</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In the ChIP-seq assay, more than 94.66% of bases score Q30 and above in each sample (Table S6), and reaching 52.50% to 94.48% of mapping ratio (Table S7). The principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure S4A) and heat map (Figure S4B) reflected that the quality of samples was competent for subsequent ChIP-seq analysis.

<title>Integration of the results of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq assays</title>
<p>After the overlapping the results from both different sequence methods (ChIP-seq and RNA-seq), 238 DEGs were found (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). According to the GO annotation, these DEGs were significantly enriched in 8 GO terms, including “cellular response to reactive oxygen species (GO:0034614)”, “reactive oxygen species metabolic process (GO:0072593)”, and “cellular response to oxygen-containing compound (GO:1901701)” (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).

These results revealed that SNT2 is essential for <italic>A. flavus</italic> to maintain the homeostasis of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Studies had shown that SNT2 could response to oxidative stress in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] and <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>].

SntB can regulate the production of uncharacterized secondary metabolites, including aspergillicin A1 and aspergillicin F2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. MoSnt2 protein was required for regulation of infection-associated autophagy in <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>].

SntB deletion impaired several developmental processes, such as sclerotia formation and heterokaryon compatibility, secondary metabolite synthesis, and ability to colonize host seeds, which were consistent with our results (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Unlike, a complementation strain was constructed in this study which further clarified and confirmed the function of <italic>sntB</italic> gene. In this study, the potential mechanism under these effects were further analyzed by detection the related transcriptional factor genes of sporulation (<italic>steA</italic>, <italic>WetA</italic>, <italic>fluG</italic>, and <italic>veA</italic>), sclerotia formation (<italic>nsdC</italic>, <italic>nsdD</italic>, and <italic>sclR</italic>), and the AFs synthesis related genes <italic>aflC</italic>, <italic>aflD</italic>, <italic>aflO</italic>, <italic>aflP</italic>, and <italic>aflR</italic> (Figure S2).

These results were corroborated by previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].

What’s more, we also assayed the effect of SntB on the activity amylase, which was closely related to the capacity of fungal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>].

Besides, SntB is reported to be a transcriptional regulator in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] and <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. So, we use RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to study the transcriptional response of <italic>sntB</italic> in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. By integration analysis the results of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq assays, we found that the enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways of the DEGs were related to oxidative response (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). These results reflected that Snt2 plays an important role in fungal responding to oxidative stress, which is consistent with previous reports that Snt2 could response to oxidative stress in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], and <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>].</p>
<p>As a harmful by-product of oxidative metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) is unavoidable and essential for fungus development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. ROS has also been shown to be required for aflatoxin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Several oxidative stress-responsive transcription factors have been identified as regulating aflatoxin production, including AtfB, AP-1, and VeA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Previous studies shown that Snt2 protein coordinates the transcriptional response to hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidative stress in the yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] and is involved in fungal respiration and reactive oxidative stress in <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Several GO terms (“cellular response to reactive oxygen species”, “reactive oxygen species metabolic process”, and “cellular response to oxygen-containing compound”) and KEGG pathways (Peroxisome) were enriched by the DEGs screened out by integration of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data in this study (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This is the first time to show that the SntB in <italic>A. flavus</italic> is important in oxidative stress response, through which SntB participates the regulating of aflatoxin bio-synthesis and fungal development.</p>
<p>Fungal defense against ROS is mediated by superoxide dismutases (SOD), catalases (CAT), and glutathione peroxidases (GPX). The effect of MSB on cellular growth and antioxidant enzyme induction in <italic>A. flavus</italic> was previously explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Once in the cell, menadione may release superoxide anion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], which was scavenged by superoxide dismutases (SOD) and transformed into hydrogen peroxide, or react with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. This study found that after knock out <italic>sntB</italic> gene, the strain growth was significantly inhibited by MSB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). Some genes encoded superoxide dismutases and catalases were reported to associated with AF/ST synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>], including <italic>mnSOD</italic>, <italic>sod1</italic>, <italic>sod2</italic>, <italic>catA</italic>, <italic>catB</italic>, and <italic>hyr1</italic>. In our RNA-seq data, 7 related genes were screened out (Table S14), among which, bZIP transcription factor <italic>Atf21</italic> (G4B84_008675), <italic>catlase C</italic> (G4B84_009242), <italic>catlase A</italic> (G4B84_010740), superoxide dismutases <italic>sod2</italic> (G4B84_003204), peroxisomal membrane protein <italic>PmpP24</italic> (G4B84_001452) were up-regulated, while <italic>catlase B</italic> (G4B84_008381) and superoxide dismutase <italic>sod1</italic> (G4B84_009129) were down-regulated in Δ<italic>sntB</italic> strain, respectively.</p>
<p>Some studies reported the correlation between ROS formation, aflatoxin production, and antioxidant enzyme activation. Aflatoxin B1 biosynthesis and the activity of total superoxide dismutase were effectively inhibited by cinnamaldehyde, whereas the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase were opposite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. The expression of <italic>catA</italic>, <italic>cat2</italic> and <italic>sod1</italic>, and CAT enzymatic activity were opposite correlated to AFB1 biosynthesis under AFs inhibitor piperine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. Deletion the gene of <italic>sod</italic> (GenBank accession no: CA747446) reduced AFs production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>], which was most similar to <italic>sod2</italic> (G4B84_003204). The mitochondria-specific <italic>sod</italic> and the genes <italic>aflA</italic>, <italic>aflM</italic>, and <italic>aflP</italic> belonging to the AFs gene cluster were reported to co-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. Ethanol can inhibit fungal growth and AFB<sub>1</sub> production in <italic>A. flavus</italic> and enhanced levels of anti-oxidant enzymatic genes including <italic>Cat</italic>, <italic>Cat1</italic>, <italic>Cat2</italic>, <italic>CatA</italic>, and Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase gene <italic>sod1</italic>. All these reports indicated that the expression of anti-oxidant enzymatic genes was opposite correlated to AFB1 biosynthesis.</p>
<p>In our study, 7 genes related to oxidative response were obviously differentially expressed in transcriptome data (Table S14). Among these DEGs, 5 out of 7 genes were up-regulated in Δ<italic>sntB</italic> strain. Based on the AFs production in Δ<italic>sntB</italic> was significantly decreased compared to WT and Com-<italic>sntB</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), the most up-regulated gene in Δ<italic>sntB</italic> strain, <italic>catC</italic> (G4B84_000242), was selected for further analysis. We found that the deletion of <italic>sntB</italic> significantly up-regulated the <italic>catC</italic> gene, however, the expression of the <italic>catC</italic> gene was almost undetectable under MSB treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Results also showed that the inhibition rates of MSB to Δ<italic>catC</italic> strain was significantly lower than that of WT group and AFB1 yield of the Δ<italic>catC</italic> strain was significantly decreased than that of WT strain under the stress of MSB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>). These results indicated that SntB is profoundly involved in the <italic>catC</italic> mediated oxidative response.</p>
<p>Peroxisomes are intimately associated with the metabolism of lipid droplets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>] and the histone lysine methyltransferase ASH1 promotes peroxisome biogenesis, inhibits lipolysis, and further affects pathogenesis of <italic>Metarhizium robertsii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Set2 histone methyltransferase family in <italic>A. flavus</italic>, AshA and SetB, were found to regulate mycotoxin metabolism and virulence via H3K36me3, including the chromatin region of the <italic>sntB</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. By ChIP-seq and RNA-seq, SntB was found to essential for <italic>A. flavus</italic> to maintain the homeostasis of intracellular reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) and several anti-oxidant enzymes were up-regulated in Δ<italic>sntB</italic> strain (Table S14). In addition, we also found only one down-regulated DEG (G4B84_008359) in lipase activity GO term in our RNA-seq data (Table S13), which encodes a secretory lipase and belongs to the virulence factors reported in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. These results suggested that SntB plays a pivotal role in regulating peroxisome biogenesis to promote lipolysis involving in fungal pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Overall, we explored and clarified the bio-function of the SntB and found that SntB responses to oxidative stress through related oxidoreductase represented by CatC in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>flavus</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Our study revealed the potential machinery associated with SntB mediated regulation on fungal morphogenesis, mycotoxin anabolism and fungal virulence, which lurks the axle of from SntB to fungal virulence and mycotoxin bio-synthesis (i.e. SntB-Peroxisomes-Lipid hydrolysis-fungal virulence and mycotoxin bio-synthesis). The work of this study provided a novel perspective for developing new prevention and control strategies against pathogenic fungi.</p>

<p>In this <bold>useful</bold> study, the authors investigate the regulatory mechanisms related to toxin production and pathogenicity in Aspergillus flavus. Their observations indicate that the SntB protein regulates morphogenesis, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and the oxidative stress response, however, the data supporting these conclusions are <bold>incomplete</bold>. The work will be of interest to bacteriologists.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Wu et al. explores the role of the histone reader protein SntB in Aspergillus flavus, claiming it to be a key regulator of development and aflatoxin biosynthesis. While the study incorporates various techniques, including gene deletion, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq, several concerns and omissions in the paper raise questions about the validity and completeness of the presented findings.</p>
<p>(1) Omissions of Prior Work:</p>
<p>
The authors fail to acknowledge and integrate prior research by Pfannenstiel et al. (2018) on the sntB gene in A. flavus, which covered phenotypic changes, RNA-seq data, and histone modifications. This omission raises concerns about the transparency and completeness of the current study.</p>
<p>The absence of reference to studies by Karahoda et al. (2022, 2023) revealing SntB's involvement in the KERS complex in A. flavus and A. nidulans is a major oversight. This raises questions about the specificity of SntB's regulatory functions, as it may be part of a larger complex. The authors should clarify why these studies were omitted and how they ensure that SntB alone, and not the entire KERS complex, is responsible for the observed effects.</p>
<p>(2) Transparency and Accessibility of Data:</p>
<p>
The lack of accessibility and visualization tools for ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data poses a challenge for independent verification and in-depth analysis. The authors should address this issue by providing more accessible data or explaining the limitations of data availability. A critical component missing from the paper is a detailed presentation of ChIP-seq data, specifically demonstrating SntB binding patterns on key promoters. This omission weakens the link between SntB and the mentioned regulatory genes. The authors should include these crucial data visualizations to strengthen their claims.</p>
<p>(3) SntB Binding Sites and Consensus Sequence:</p>
<p>
The study mentions several genes upregulated in the sntB mutant without demonstrating SntB binding sites on their promoters. A detailed analysis of SntB binding maps is necessary to establish a direct link between SntB and these regulatory genes.</p>
<p>(4) Mechanistic Insight into Peroxisome Biogenesis:</p>
<p>
If SntB indeed regulates peroxisome biogenesis, the absence of markers for peroxisomes and the localization of peroxisomes in the sntB mutant vs. WT strains is a significant gap. Providing evidence for peroxisome regulation is crucial for understanding the proposed mechanism and validating the study's claims.</p>
<p>In summary, while the manuscript presents intriguing findings regarding SntB's role in A. flavus, the omissions of prior work, lack of transparency in data accessibility, and insufficient mechanistic insights call for revisions and additional experimental evidence to strengthen the validity and impact of the study. Addressing these concerns will enhance the manuscript's contribution to the field.</p>
<p>Additionally, the way the English language is used could be improved.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This work is of great significance in revealing the regulatory mechanisms of pathogenic fungi in toxin production, pathogenicity, and in its prevention and pollution control. Overall, this is generally an excellent manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The data in this manuscript is robust and the experiments conducted are appropriate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
(1) The authors found that SntB played key roles in the oxidative stress response of A. flavus by ChIP-seq and RNA sequencing. To confirm the role of SntB in oxidative stress, the authors have to better measure the ROS levels in the ΔsntB and WT strains, besides the ΔcatC strain.</p>
<p>(2) Why did the authors only study the function of catC among the 7 genes related to an oxidative response listed in Table S14?</p>
