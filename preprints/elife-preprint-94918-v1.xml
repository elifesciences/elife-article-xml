<title>Abstract</title>
<p>All living organisms have developed strategies to respond to chromosomal damage and preserve genome integrity. One such response is the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), one of the most toxic forms of DNA lesions. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, DSBs are repaired via RecBCD-dependent homologous recombination. RecBCD is essential for accurate chromosome maintenance, but its over-expression can lead to reduced DNA repair ability. This apparent paradox suggests that RecBCD copy numbers may need to be tightly controlled within an optimal range. Using single-molecule fluorescence mi-croscopy, we have established that RecB is present in very low abundance at mRNA and protein levels. RecB transcription shows high fluctuations, yet cell-to-cell protein variability remains remarkably low. Here, we show that the post-transcriptional regulator Hfq binds to <italic>recB</italic> mRNA and down-regulates RecB protein translation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, specific disruption of the Hfq-binding site leads to more efficient translation of <italic>recB</italic> mRNAs. In addition, we observe a less effective reduction of RecB protein fluctuations in the absence of Hfq. This fine-tuning Hfq-mediated mechanism might have the underlying physiological function of maintaining RecB protein levels within an optimal range.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All living organisms rely on multiple molecular mechanisms to repair their chromosomes in order to preserve genome integrity. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), simultaneous lesions on both strands of the chromosome, are one of the most detrimental types of DNA damage because they can lead to loss of genetic information. If not repaired or repaired incorrectly, DSBs can trigger cell death, deleterious mutations and genomic rearrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. In addition to various exogenous sources such as ionizing radiation, mechanical stresses and DNA-damaging agents, DSBs can occur during the normal cell cycle as a results of endogenous metabolic reactions and replication events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. For instance, replication fork breakage has been shown to result in spontaneous DSBs in 18% of wild-type <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) cells in each generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], underscoring the crucial need to repair these breaks to ensure faithful DNA replication.</p>
<p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, DSBs are repaired by homologous recombination using an intact copy of the chromosome as a template. Initially, the multi-subunit nuclease/helicase enzyme RecBCD detects a double-strand DNA (dsDNA) end and degrades both strands. Upon recognition of a short DNA sequence, known as a <italic>chi</italic> (<italic>χ</italic>) site (5’-GCTGGTGG-3’), the RecBCD complex stops cleaving the 3’-ended strand and initiates loading of the RecA protein onto the 3’-single-strand (ssDNA) overhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. This leads to the formation of a RecA-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], which catalyses homology search and strand exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments have highlighted the extraordinary processive DNA degradation activity of RecBCD upon recognition of a dsDNA end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Indeed, RecBCD has been shown to process the chromosome for up to ∼ 100 <italic>kb</italic> at ∼ 1.6 <italic>kb</italic>/<italic>s</italic> in live bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Such a potent DNA degradation activity is controlled by <italic>chi</italic> recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. However, because this recognition is probabilistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], RecBCD can degrade large chromosome fragments before DNA repair is initiated. As a result, overproduction of RecBCD has been shown to sensitize wild-type cells to ultraviolet and gamma irradiations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. This strongly suggests that an excess of RecBCD imposes a threat to cells upon DNA damage. In contrast, RecBCD expression is essential upon DSB induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], hence too low levels might impair DNA repair. Thus, the observation that RecBCD can positively and negatively impact cell fitness upon DNA damage suggests that its activity needs to be tightly controlled.</p>
<p>Whilst the biochemical and <italic>in vivo</italic> activities of RecBCD have been extensively studied ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] for review), less is known about the regulation of its expression. RecBCD has been reported to be expressed at very low levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] and is present in less than ten molecules per cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the RecBCD subunits are encoded in the same locus by two operons. One operon controls the expression of RecC whilst the other is polycistronic and encodes PtrA, RecB and RecD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). PtrA is a periplasmic protease with no known function in DNA repair, and the positioning of its gene likely results from a horizontal gene transfer event that has interrupted the usual order <italic>recC-recB-recD</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. As sometimes found in bacterial operons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], the ribosome binding site (RBS) of <italic>recB</italic> is located within the coding sequence of <italic>ptrA</italic>, suggesting a potential translational coupling mechanism between these genes. Previous attempts to explore RecBCD expression upon DNA-damage conditions did not reveal any transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] and the <italic>recBCD</italic> genes were shown not to belong to the SOS-response regulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Thus, RecBCD transcription is considered to be constitutive.</p>

<p>Given that RecBCD is essential for cell survival upon DSB formation and toxic when overproduced, it is likely that its expression needs to be tightly regulated to avoid fluctuations leading to cellular death or deleterious genomic rearrangements. However, its very low abundance, often leading to high stochastic fluctuations, could result in large cell-to-cell variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Although these fluctuations might not play a significant role during normal cell growth, they may become crucial and determine cell fate upon stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Thus, the low abundance of RecBCD enzyme molecules raises the following questions: (i) to what extent do RecBCD numbers fluctuate, (ii) are these fluctuations controlled, (iii) if this is the case, at which level (transcription, translation, mRNA or protein degradation) is the control operating.</p>
<p>The lack of evidence of RecBCD transcriptional regulation does not preclude that other mechanisms may be involved in regulating its expression. For example, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been shown to fine tune gene expression both co- and post-transcriptionally during stress responses and adaptation to environmental changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. One of the most studied RBPs in <italic>E. coli</italic>, a Sm-like hexameric ring-shaped protein called Hfq, has been shown to regulate RNA stability and degradation, transcription elongation and translation initiation through various mechanisms (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]). In the most prevalent case, Hfq facilitates base-paring between small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) and target mRNAs which often results in mRNA translation and/or stability modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. There is also increasing evidence that Hfq can control mRNA translation directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. This mechanism is typically based on altering the accessibility of the RBS of a target mRNA by direct binding near this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we show that the expression of RecB is regulated post-transcriptionally in an Hfq-dependent manner in <italic>E. coli</italic>. By quantifying RecB mRNAs and proteins at single-molecule resolution, we found that constitutive transcription leads to low levels of <italic>recB</italic> mRNAs and a noisy distribution. In contrast, fluctuations in RecB protein levels are significantly lower than expected, given the very low number of proteins present in cells. We show that Hfq negatively regulates RecB translation and demonstrate the specificity of this post-transcriptional control <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, we provide evidence of the role of Hfq in reducing RecB protein fluctuations and propose that this could constitute a fine-tuning mechanism to control RecBCD molecules within an optimal range.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title><italic>recB</italic> mRNAs are present at very low levels and are short-lived</title>
<p>To quantitatively measure RecB expression, we first precisely quantified <italic>recB</italic> mRNAs using single-molecule fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (smFISH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. We confirmed that our hybridization conditions are highly specific as <italic>recB</italic> mRNA quantification in a ∆<italic>recB</italic> strain resulted in a negligible error (∼ 0.007 molecules per cell, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In wild-type cells, we detected a very low average level of <italic>recB</italic> transcripts: ∼ 0.62 molecules per cell. Notably, ∼ 70% of cells did not have any <italic>recB</italic> mRNAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). To confirm that this result was not because of low sensitivity of the smFISH protocol, we over-expressed <italic>recB</italic> mRNAs from an arabinose-inducible low-copy plasmid and detected the expected gradual amplification of the fluorescence signal with increased arabinose concentration (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
<p>We next measured the degradation rate of <italic>recB</italic> transcripts in a time-series experiment. Initiation of transcription was inhibited with rifampicin and <italic>recB</italic> mRNA expression levels were quantified by sm-FISH at subsequent time points. By fitting the mean mRNA value evolution over time to an exponential function, we estimated the <italic>recB</italic> degradation rate as <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0.62 <italic>min</italic><sup>−1</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub> [0.48, 0.75]) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). This corresponds to a <italic>recB</italic> mRNA lifetime of 1.6 <italic>min</italic> and is consistent with the genome-wide studies in <italic>E. coli</italic> where transcript lifetimes were shown to be on average ∼2.5 <italic>min</italic> across all mRNA species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title><italic>recB</italic> transcription is constitutive and weak</title>
<p>As noted previously, quantitative analysis of transcription at the single-cell level needs to take into account the variation of gene copy number during the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Therefore, we analysed RNA molecule abundance using cell size as a proxy for the cell cycle. Specifically, we binned all bacteria in groups based on cell area and averaged mRNA numbers in each of those size-sorted groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). A two-fold increase in mRNA abundance was observed within a narrow cell-size interval (∼ 3.0-3.5 <italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup>), which is consistent with an expected doubling of the transcriptional output as a result of the replication of the <italic>recB</italic> gene. We further showed that <italic>recB</italic> transcription from sister chromosomes happens independently, in full agreement with the hypothesis of an unregulated gene (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Taken together, this evidence indicates that <italic>recB</italic> mRNA levels follow a gene-dosage trend, strongly suggesting that <italic>recB</italic> is constitutively expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Next, to infer <italic>recB</italic> transcription rate, we used a simple stochastic model of transcription where mR-NAs are produced in bursts of an average size <italic>b</italic> at a constant rate <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and degraded exponentially at a rate <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> (Suppl. Info.: Section 1). The expected probability distribution for mRNA numbers at steady-state is given by a negative binomial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. We used maximum likelihood estimation to infer the parameters of the negative binomial distribution from the experimental data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, Methods). For the inference, we restricted our analysis to newborn cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) as this model does not take into account cell growth. We then inferred the burst size for the <italic>recB</italic> gene, <italic>b</italic> ∼ 0.95 <italic>molec</italic>, and the rate of transcription, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0.21 <italic>min</italic><sup>−1</sup> (<xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, Methods). The latter is remarkably low and close to the lower-bound reported range of transcription rates in <italic>E. coli</italic>, 0.17-1.7 <italic>min</italic><sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Therefore, the low abundance of <italic>recB</italic> mRNAs can be explained by infrequent transcription combined with fast mRNA decay.</p>
<p>Variations in mRNA molecule numbers, as a result of their low abundance and short lifetimes, can significantly contribute to gene expression noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. To evaluate fluctuations of <italic>recB</italic> transcription, we calculated a commonly-used measure of noise, the squared coefficient of variation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, defined as the variance divided by the squared mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.

<title>RecB proteins are present in low numbers and are long-lived</title>
<p>To determine whether the mRNA fluctuations we observed are transmitted to the protein level, we quantified RecB protein abundance with single-molecule accuracy in fixed individual cells using the Halo self-labelling tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A&amp;B</xref>). As we previously reported, the translational RecB-HaloTag fusion does not affect the activity of the RecBCD enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].

<p>To test if RecB is actively degraded by proteases or mainly diluted as a result of cell growth and division, we estimated the RecB protein removal rate. This is usually obtained from either pulse-chase experiments using radio-labelled amino acids or detection of protein concentration decay after treatment with a translation inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. While the first approach is not amenable to single-cell assays, the latter may affect the measurements on long time scales because of the physiological impacts of stopping all protein production. Therefore, we used an alternative approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>] where we pulselabelled RecB molecules with the HaloTag ligand, then removed the excess of the dye by extensive washing and measured the abundance of the labelled molecules over time. Assuming protein removal can be described by a first-order reaction, we fitted the mean protein counts over time to an exponential function on a subset of time points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, shaded area). The decay rate was extracted from the fit and resulted in <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = 0.015 <italic>min</italic><sup>−1</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub> [0.011, 0.019]). Comparison to the population growth rate in these conditions (0.017 <italic>min</italic><sup>−1</sup>) suggests that RecB protein is stable and effectively removed only as a result of dilution and molecule partitioning between daughter cells.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>RecB protein cell-to-cell fluctuations are lower than expected</title>
<p>We then extended the transcription model described above by considering protein synthesis and removal. This is known as the <italic>two-stage</italic> or <italic>mRNA-protein</italic> model of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. In this model, a protein is produced from an mRNA at a constant translation rate <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> while protein dilution is implicitly modelled by a first-order chemical reaction with rate <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> (Suppl. Info.: Section 1). As discussed earlier, we focused on newborn cells and estimated the rate of translation as 0.15 <italic>min</italic><sup>−1</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub> [0.12, 0.18], <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, Methods). This value fell below the lower bound of previously reported range of the translation rates in <italic>E. coli</italic> (0.25-1 <italic>min</italic><sup>−1</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Therefore, we concluded that <italic>recB</italic> mRNAs are translated at low levels compared to other proteins in the cell.</p>
<p>Next, we examined whether the two-stage model can reproduce the cell-to-cell variability in the protein levels observed in our experiments. To this end, we simulated single trajectories of protein abundance over time using the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>] for the two-stage model with the estimated parameters (<xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Strikingly, the simulated distribution had larger fluctuations than the experimentally measured one (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). While both protein means were equal because of the first-moment-based parameter estimation we used (Methods), we found the standard deviations to be higher in simulation (2.2) than in experiments (1.5) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). In other words, a two-stage protein production model predicts a higher level of fluctuations than what is observed experimentally.</p>
<p>This phenomenon can also be analysed using the squared coefficient of variation of the protein distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, which is defined as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. For the two-stage gene expression model with bursty transcription, it has been established that the following expression gives the coefficient of variation (Suppl. Info.: Section 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]:

where ⟨<italic>p</italic>⟩ and ⟨<italic>m</italic>⟩ are the mean protein and mRNA counts (per cell), <italic>b</italic> is the average (mRNA) burst size, <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> are the mRNA degradation and protein removal rates, respectively. We found that the experimental coefficient of variation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is approximately half of the analytically predicted one <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). On the contrary and as expected, both the theoretically predicted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and the one computed from the simulated data <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> are in good agreement. This deviation from the theoretical prediction implies a potential regulatory mechanism of RecB expression that actively suppresses protein production variation to maintain protein levels within a certain range.</p>

<title>RecB translational efficiency is increased upon DSB induction</title>
<p>Next, we addressed whether there was any further evidence of this potential regulation once bacterial cells are exposed to stress. We hypothesized that RecB mRNA and/or protein levels may exhibit a concentration change upon DNA damage to stimulate DNA repair. To test this, we treated bacterial cells with a sub-lethal concentration of ciprofloxacin (4 <italic>ng</italic>/<italic>ml</italic>), an antibiotic that leads to DNA DSB formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. After two hours of exposure to ciprofloxacin, we quantified proteins by Halo-labelling and mRNAs by smFISH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). This induction duration is sufficient to detect changes in mRNA and protein levels (see Suppl. Info.: Section 2 for the mathematical model supporting this choice). Because <italic>E. coli</italic> cells filament upon activation of the DNA damage response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B&amp;C</xref>), we measured single-cell distributions of mRNA and protein concentrations (calculated as molecule numbers normalized by cell area) rather than absolute numbers. Cell area is a reasonable proxy for cell volume as rod-shaped <italic>E. coli</italic> cells maintain their diameter while elongating in length upon ciprofloxacin treatment. RecB protein concentration did not change upon DSB induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). In fact, the average cellular RecB concentration was surprisingly conserved: 2.28 <italic>mol</italic>/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [2.21, 2.32]) in perturbed condition and 2.12 <italic>mol</italic>/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [2.01, 2.32]) in intact cells. Additionally, we analysed RecB concentration in size-sorted groups of cells (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5b</xref>). Regardless of moderate fluctuations in protein concentration over a cell cycle, both samples significantly overlap along the whole range of cell sizes.</p>

</fig>
<p>In contrast, single-cell mRNA concentration quantification showed a sharp decrease in <italic>recB</italic> transcripts upon DNA damage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Specifically, mRNA concentrations upon DSB induction are ∼ 2.4-fold lower than in the unperturbed control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>: insert): 0.12 <italic>mol</italic>/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [0.06, 0.17]) upon DNA damage versus 0.28 <italic>mol</italic>/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [0.23, 0.32]) in the control. We further confirmed the decrease in all cell-size sorted groups (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5a</xref>). As previously reported, the <italic>recB</italic> gene is not part of the SOS regulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], hence its transcription is not necessarily expected to be upregulated upon DNA damage. However, downregulation of <italic>recB</italic> transcription is an unforeseen observation and may be a result of lower concentration of genomic DNA and/or shortage of resources (such as RNA polymerases) upon SOS response activation.</p>
<p>We then computed the average number of proteins produced per mRNA in both conditions. The ratio between the average protein and mRNA concentrations in damaged cells is 19.7 (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [17.5, 24.2]) whereas it is 7.9 proteins/mRNA (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [7.5, 8.3]) in intact cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Thus, a ∼ 2.5 increase in translational efficiency was detected upon DSB induction (p-value &lt; 0.001, two sample t-test). Taken together, our results show decoupling between mRNA and protein production upon DNA damage, suggesting the existence of a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that controls RecB protein level.</p>

<title>Hfq controls the translation of <italic>recB</italic> mRNA</title>
<p>To identify the post-transcriptional mechanism controlling <italic>recB</italic> expression, we focused on Hfq because (i) it has been shown to regulate a vast number of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>] and (ii) its activity has been directly linked to the DNA damage and SOS responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>].</p>
<p>To assess whether Hfq is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of RecBCD, we analysed the available transcriptome-wide dataset, wherein Hfq binding sites were identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> using CLASH (cross-linking and analysis of cDNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. In a CLASH experiment, Hfq-RNA complexes are cross-linked <italic>in vivo</italic> and purified under highly stringent conditions, ensuring specific recovery of Hfq RNA targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. Analysis of the Hfq binding profile across <italic>recBCD</italic> transcripts showed the interaction of Hfq with the <italic>recBCD</italic> mRNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Hfq binding is mainly localized at two sites: one in close proximity to the RBS of the <italic>ptrA</italic> gene, and the second further downstream in the coding sequence of <italic>recB</italic> gene. Interestingly, multiple trinucleotide Hfq-binding motifs, A-R(A/G)-N(any nucleotide) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>] were found ∼ 8 nucleotides upstream of the RBS of the <italic>ptrA</italic> sequence (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>), suggesting that Hfq may control translation initiation and/or decay of the operon mRNA.</p>

<p>To test this hypothesis, we quantified RecB protein and mRNA levels in an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain lacking Hfq. ∆<italic>hfq</italic> mutant has been reported to have an increased average cell size and various growth defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. Indeed, we confirmed the increased cell size of our ∆<italic>hfq</italic> mutant compared to wild-type cells (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7a</xref>&amp;b). In our conditions, no difference between the growth rates of WT and the ∆<italic>hfq</italic> mutant was observed in the exponential phase of growth (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7d</xref>).</p>
<p>Using Halo-labelling technique, we performed RecB protein quantification in ∆<italic>hfq</italic>. Remarkably, we observed an increase of RecB protein concentration in the ∆<italic>hfq</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>&amp;C). The ∆<italic>hfq</italic> mutant showed more fluorescent foci relative to the wild-type strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Even after normalization by cell area to take into account the larger cell size in ∆<italic>hfq</italic> cells, RecB concentration distribution was shifted towards higher values (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Quantification across five replicated experiments showed a statistically significant 30% increase in RecB protein concentration in the ∆<italic>hfq</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>: insert). The concentration was 2.67 <italic>mol</italic>/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [2.54, 2.80]) in ∆<italic>hfq</italic> compared to 2.17 <italic>mol</italic>/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [2.01, 2.32]) in the control.</p>
<p>We further quantified <italic>recB</italic> mRNA molecules in the ∆<italic>hfq</italic> strain using smFISH and analysed mRNA concentration distributions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D&amp;E</xref>). Although the average <italic>recB</italic> mRNA concentration is slightly decreased in the ∆<italic>hfq</italic>: 0.21 <italic>mol</italic>/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [0.08, 0.30]) <italic>versus</italic> 0.28 <italic>mol</italic>/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [0.23, 0.32]) in the wild-type cells, this difference is insignificant (p-value = 0.11, two sample t-test). These results were confirmed by RT-qPCR measurements, which did not show any significant changes for <italic>recB</italic> mRNA steady-state levels (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7c</xref>). Thus, we conclude that Hfq binding to the <italic>recBCD</italic> mRNA does not sub-stantially alter the stability of the transcript.</p>
<p>The observed increase of RecB protein concentration without a significant change in <italic>recB</italic> mRNA steady-state levels is reflected in a rise in RecB translational efficiency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). The average level of proteins produced per mRNA in the ∆<italic>hfq</italic> mutant is 14.0 (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [13.0, 18.1]), which is two-fold higher than in the wild-type cells (p-value &lt; 0.05, two-sample t-test). Altogether, this demonstrates that Hfq alters RecB translation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>To test if Hfq regulation contributes to the noise suppression detected in the wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), we looked at the level of fluctuations of RecB copy numbers in ∆<italic>hfq</italic>. To this end, we computed the difference between the analytically predicted noise <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and the noise observed experimentally <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Since in the ∆<italic>hfq</italic> mutant <italic>recB</italic> transcription is not affected, the theoretical noise was calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. (1)</xref> assuming the same mRNA contribution (the second term of the equation). As seen in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>, the wild-type strain shows effective noise suppression as the theoretically predicted noise is larger than the one detected experimentally. Interestingly, this suppression is less effective in the ∆<italic>hfq</italic> mutant. In other words, in the absence of Hfq, the mismatch between the model and the experimental data is decreased in comparison to the native conditions of the wild-type cells (p-value = 0.0088, two sample t-test). This provides evidence that, in addition to the average RecB abundance, Hfq affects RecB protein fluctuations.</p>

<title>RecB protein number distribution is recovered by Hfq complementation</title>
<p>To further confirm that Hfq regulates RecB expression, we complemented the ∆<italic>hfq</italic> mutant with a multi-copy plasmid that expresses Hfq, pQE-Hfq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>].

Although in our experimental conditions, Hfq is expressed at lower levels than in wild-type cells (transcription is ∼ a third of the wild-type level, <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8b</xref>), RecB protein concentration was nearly fully recovered to the wild-type conditions: 2.57 <italic>mol</italic>/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [2.50, 2.65]).

<title>Sequestering Hfq leads to an increase in RecB production</title>
<p>To further ascertain the role of Hfq in controlling RecB expression, we characterized RecB expression while sequestering Hfq proteins away from its <italic>recB</italic> mRNA targets. Hfq is known to bind ∼ 100 sRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>], some of which can reach high expression levels and/or have a higher affinity for Hfq and, thus, compete for Hfq binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>]. We reasoned that because <italic>recB</italic> mRNA is present in very low abundance, it could be outcompeted for Hfq binding by over-expression of a small RNA that efficiently binds Hfq, such as ChiX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>]. We constructed a multi-copy plasmid pZA21-ChiX to over-express ChiX and obtained a ∼ 30-fold increase in ChiX expression relative to its native expression in wild-type cells (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>). Given its already high abundance in wild-type cells, ChiX overproduction has been demonstrated to effectively sequester a large number of Hfq molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>].</p>
<p>Wild-type cells carrying the pZA21-ChiX plasmid (or the backbone plasmid) were grown to mid-exponential phase, and RecB mRNA and protein levels were quantified with RT-qPCR and Halo-labelling, respectively. No significant changes were detected at the <italic>recB</italic> transcript levels when ChiX was overproduced (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>). In contrast, a significant increase in RecB protein production was detected upon ChiX over-expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Indeed, RecB concentration in the cells where ChiX was over-expressed almost fully overlapped with the distributions in the ∆<italic>hfq</italic> mutant. This suggests that when fewer Hfq molecules are available for RecB regulation because ChiX is overproduced, RecB is translated at a higher rate. A similar experiment with a plasmid that carried a different sRNA, CyaR which is not expected to titrate Hfq, did not change RecB protein concentration. This indicates that ChiX over-expression specifically impairs RecB post-transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>).</p>
<p>To exclude the possibility of a direct ChiX involvement in RecB regulation, we characterized RecB expression in ∆<italic>chiX</italic>. No significant change relative to wild-type cells was detected in RecB mRNA or protein levels (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>). Thus, we concluded that ChiX does not affect RecB translation. Instead, titration of Hfq proteins from a shared pool by ChiX sRNAs leads to the increased availability of <italic>ptrA-recB</italic> RBS for ribosomes and, thus, results in more efficient RecB translation.</p>

<title>Deletion of an Hfq-binding site results in increased RecB translational efficiency</title>
<p>To further investigate the mechanism of RecB translation, we tested the specificity of Hfq interaction with the mRNA of <italic>recB</italic> without affecting other functions of Hfq. Based on the localization of the Hfq-binding uncovered in the CLASH data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), we deleted a 36 nucleotide region (5’-TTAACGTGTTGAATCTGGACAGAAAATTAAGTTGAT-3’) located in 5’UTR of the operon, in front of <italic>ptrA</italic> gene. This region showed the highest enrichment of Hfq binding (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). It is closely located to the RBS site and 76 nucleotides downstream of the promoter sequence of <italic>ptrA-recB</italic>. To get a complete picture of RecB expression in the mutant strain carrying this deletion (which we further refer to as the <italic>recB</italic>-5’UTR* mutant), we performed single-cell quantification of both mRNA and protein levels of RecB and quantified its translational efficiency.</p>
<p>Firstly, we quantified <italic>recB</italic> mRNAs molecules in the <italic>recB</italic>-5’UTR* strain using smFISH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). We detected a significant decrease in the concentration of mRNAs in the strain with the modified sequence: 0.14 <italic>mol</italic>/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [0.07, 0.17]) compared to 0.28 <italic>mol</italic>/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [0.23, 0.32]) in the wild type. This is not an unexpected outcome as the 5’-untranslated region of a transcript can control its degradation and stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>]. Despite the mRNA steady-state level decreasing two-fold in the modified <italic>recB</italic>-5’UTR* strain, only a slight decrease in RecB protein concentration was detected in comparison with the wild type (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>): 1.96 <italic>mol</italic>/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [1.56, 2.36]) in <italic>recB</italic>-5’UTR* and 2.17 <italic>mol</italic>/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [2.01, 2.32]) in the wild type.</p>
<p>We calculated the translational efficiency of <italic>recB</italic> transcripts based on our single-cell mRNA and protein quantification. The resulting translational efficiency in the <italic>recB</italic>-5’UTR* strain was found to be significantly higher than in the wild-type cells: 16.3 (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [14.3, 19.7]) in <italic>recB</italic>-5’UTR*, whereas it is 7.9 (<italic>CI</italic><sub>95%</sub>: [7.5, 8.3]) proteins/mRNA in the wild type (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Remarkably, the RecB translational efficiency in the <italic>recB</italic>-5’UTR* strain is comparable with the values observed in the ∆<italic>hfq</italic> mutant (a two-sample t-test confirmed that the difference is not significant). Thus, when the main Hfq binding site was deleted, the lower abundance of the mRNA was compensated by more efficient translation. This demonstrates that the translation of <italic>recB</italic> mRNA is limited by a specific interaction with Hfq.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite its essential role in DSB repair, over-expression of RecBCD decreases cell viability upon DNA damage induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Such a dual impact on cell fitness suggests the existence of an underlying regulation that controls RecBCD expression within an optimal range. Using state-of-the-art single-molecule mRNA and protein quantification, we (i) characterize RecB expression at transcriptional and translational levels in normal and DNA-damaging conditions and (ii) describe a novel post-transcriptional mechanism of RecB expression mediated by the global regulator Hfq <italic>in vivo</italic>. Utilizing stochastic modelling, we provide evidence that Hfq contributes to suppressing fluctuations of RecB molecules. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence of an RNA-binding protein involved in noise suppression in bacterial cells under native conditions.</p>
<p>While our observations are consistent with recent studies demonstrating direct gene regulation by Hfq in a sRNA-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>], we cannot entirely exclude a small RNA being involved. Using the available Hfq CLASH and RIL-seq datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>], CyaR and ChiX sRNAs were identified as potentially interacting with the <italic>ptrA-recB-recD</italic> mRNA. However, we did not find any significant changes in RecB expression when CyaR was overexpressed (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>) and we showed that ChiX was involved indirectly by sequestering Hfq (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>). Strictly speaking, we cannot totally rule out the possibility of another small RNA candidate, but the very low abundance of the <italic>recB</italic> transcripts is likely to make it particularly difficult to detect RNA-RNA interactions in bulk experiments, making it necessary to develop a specific approach with single-molecule resolution.</p>
<p>Hfq-mediated control of RecB expression may be just a hint of a larger bacterial post-transcriptional stress-response programme to DNA damage. Indeed, post-transcriptional regulation has already been shown to impact DNA repair and genome maintenance pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>]. For instance, the DNA mismatch repair protein, MutS, was shown to be regulated by a sRNA-independent Hfq binding mechanism and its translation repression was linked to increased mutagenesis in stationary phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. In addition, a modest decrease (∼ 30%) in Hfq protein abundance has been seen in a proteomic study in <italic>E. coli</italic> upon DSB induction with ciprofloxacin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>]. It is conceivable that even modest changes in Hfq availability could result in significant changes in gene expression, and this could explain the increased translational efficiency of RecB upon DBS induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Therefore, Hfq-mediated regulation might play a larger role in DNA repair pathways than previously considered. As many metabolic pathways are regulated through Hfq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>], the control of RecB (and other DNA repair proteins) expression may even provide a way of coordinating DNA repair pathways with other cellular response processes upon stress.</p>
<p>Mechanisms similar to the one described in our study might underlay the expression networks of other DNA repair proteins, many of which are known to be present in small quantities. In this regard, it is worth emphasizing the valuable methodological insights which can be taken from our study. By utilizing single-molecule mRNA and protein quantification techniques, we show the importance of detailed investigation of both mRNA and protein levels when establishing novel regulation mechanisms of gene expression. Indeed, measuring the protein level only would not be sufficient to draw the correct interpretation, for example, in the case of <italic>recB</italic>-5’UTR* mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Moreover, single-molecule measurements combined with stochastic modelling allow access to cell-to-cell variability, which can be a powerful and, possibly, the only approach to investigate the regulation mechanisms of gene expression for low abundant molecules.</p>
<p>In agreement with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], we confirm that RecBCD overproduction led to less efficient repair when DSBs were induced using ciprofloxacin (<xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref>). We note that another study did not detect any toxicity of RecBCD overproduction upon DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>]. However, this is likely because the level of UV irradiation was too low to detect a significant reduction in cell viability. We only observed the effect at a relatively high level of ciprofloxacin exposure (&gt;10 <italic>ng</italic>/<italic>ml</italic> with the minimum inhibitory concentration at 16 <italic>ng</italic>/<italic>ml</italic> in our conditions).</p>
<p>In addition to the regulation of the average number of proteins per cell, fluctuation control might be crucial for a quasi-essential enzyme with very low abundance, such as RecBCD. Our analysis of RecB fluctuations suggests that Hfq is playing a role in protein copy number noise reduction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Post-transcriptional regulation has been proposed theoretically as an effective strategy for reducing protein noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>]. Conceptually, this is achieved via buffering stochastic fluctuations of mRNA transcription and enabling more rapid response. Based on these principles, suppression of protein fluctuations via post-transcriptional control has been demonstrated in synthetically engineered systems in bacteria, yeast and mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>]. However, do cells employ these strategies under native conditions? Suppressed fluctuations of protein expression were experimentally detected for hundreds of microRNA-regulated genes in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>]. Remarkably, those genes were expressed at a very low level. This is precisely the case for the regulation of <italic>recB</italic> translation by Hfq, where a very abundant post-transcriptional regulator can effectively buffer the fluctuations of the low-abundant RecB enzyme. Taken together, these previous observations and our results could hint at a universal functional ‘niche’ for post-transcriptional regulators across a wide range of organisms.</p>

<p>Image acquisition was performed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Ti-E) equipped with an EMCCD Camera (iXion Ultra 897, Andor), a Spectra X Line engine (Lumencor), dichronic mirror T590LPXR, 100X oil-immersion Plan Apo objective (NA 1.45, Nikon) and 1.5X magnification lens (Nikon). A TRITC (ET545/30nm, Nikon) filter was used for imaging Halo-labelling experiments while smFISH data were acquired with an mCherry (ET572/35nm, Nikon) filter.</p>
<p>Once a protocol (smFISH or Halo-labelling) had been carried out, fixed cells were resuspended in 1X PBS and mounted onto a 2% agarose pad. The snapshots were acquired in bright-field and fluorescence channels. In all experiments, an electron-multiplying (EM) gain of 4 and an exposure time of 30 <italic>ms</italic> were used for bright-field imaging. In the fluorescence channel, smFISH data were acquired with a 2 <italic>s</italic> exposure time and a gain of 4, while RecB proteins were visualized with the same exposure time but EM gain 200. For each XY position on an agarose pad, a Z-stack of 6 images centred around the focal plane (total range of 1 <italic>μm</italic> with a step of 0.2 <italic>μm</italic>) was obtained in both channels. A set of multiple XY positions were acquired for each slide to visualize ∼1000 cells per sample.</p>

<title>Cell segmentation</title>
<p>Microscopy bright-field images were used to identify positions of bacterial cells with an automated MATLAB-based pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>]. Briefly, the segmentation algorithm is based on detection of cell edges by passing an image through a low-pass filter. In comparison to the original version, we applied this analysis to defocused bright-field images (instead of fluorescence signal from a constitutive reporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>]) and tuned segmentation parameters for our conditions. The segmentation outputs were manually corrected by discarding misidentified cells in the accompanied graphical interface. The corrected segmentation results were saved as MATLAB matrices (cell masks) containing mapping information between pixels and cell ID numbers. The cell masks were used as an input for the spot-finding software described below.</p>

<title>Spot detection</title>
<p>The Spätzcell package (MATLAB) was utilized to detect foci in fluorescent smFISH images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Principally, the analysis consists of the following steps: (i) identification of local maxima above a chosen intensity threshold, (ii) matching the maxima across frames in a Z-stack, (iii) performing 2D-Gaussian fitting of the detected maxima. Based on the peak height and spot intensity, computed from the fitting output, the specific signal was separated from false positive spots (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1a</xref>). The integrated spot intensity histograms were fitted to the sum of two Gaussian distributions, which correspond to one and two mRNA molecules per focus. An intensity equivalent corresponding to the integrated intensity of FISH probes in average bound to one mRNA was computed as a result of multiple-Gaussian fitting procedure (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1b</xref>), and all identified spots were normalized by the one-mRNA equivalent.</p>
<p>To detect fluorescent single-molecule foci in the Halo-labelling experiments, the first step of Spätzcell analysis was modified (similar to the modification for fluorescent protein detection implemented here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]). For the Halo-labelling single-molecule data, we tested two modifications: (i) removing a Gaussian filter (that was used to smooth raw signal in the original version) or (ii) calculating the Laplacian of a Gaussian-filtered image. Both versions gave similar and consistent quantification results. Peak height intensity profiles allowed the separation of specific signal from false positive spots (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). As a result of low-abundance of the protein of interest and single-molecule labelling, the analysis of integrated intensity was skipped for Halo-labelling images. All other steps of the Spätzcell software remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Total (mRNA or protein) molecule numbers per cell were obtained by matching spot positions to cell segmentation masks and quantifying the number of (mRNA or protein) spots within each cell. Molecule concentration was calculated for each cell as total number of (mRNA or protein) molecules (per cell) divided by the area of the cell (1/<italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup>).</p>

<title>A stochastic two-stage model of RecB expression</title>
<p>To model RecB expression, we applied a well-established stochastic mRNA-protein model of gene expression and inferred its parameters by fitting to the experimental data. Here, we briefly introduce the model, discuss its underlying assumptions and provide the analytical expressions used in the fitting procedure.</p>
<sec id="s8a1">
<title>Model description</title>
<p>A stochastic two-stage model of gene expression has been widely utilized to study fluctuations underlying protein production in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref>]. Generally, the model is based on four biological processes: transcription of a gene by an RNA polymerase, translation of an mRNA by a ribosome, mRNA degradation and protein decay. As elsewhere, we assume a cell to be a well-stirred system of biochemical molecules, the interaction between which can be described with a common approach of chemical reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref>]. We focus on two species, mRNAs and proteins, and denote molecule numbers in a cell as <italic>m</italic> and <italic>p</italic>, respectively.</p>
<p>Considering gene expression in bacterial cells allows several further assumptions to be made. First, transcription of bacterial genes was demonstrated to occur in bursts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref>] and quite a few transcriptional models describing gene bursting have been proposed in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">121</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref>]. Thus, mRNA production is described as a zeroth-order chemical reaction where a gene is transcribed in mRNA bursts with a constant rate <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and the number of mRNAs per each burst <italic>n</italic> is sampled from a geometric distribution with a mean size <italic>b</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Secondly, based on a broadly accepted view of the exponential RNA degradation in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">126</xref>], mRNA decay is modelled as a first order reaction with a constant rate <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>. Furthermore, proteins in bacteria were shown to be diluted exclusively because of cell growth and division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">127</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref>]. This process can be implicitly modelled by a first-order chemical reaction with a constant rate equal to growth rate <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>. Finally, we assume that a protein is produced from an mRNA with a constant rate <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>. Thus, the entire reaction network for the two-stage model with burst transcription is summarized in the following schematic:

<title>Deterministic model of RecB expression upon DSB induction</title>
<p>In this section, we analytically describe the dynamics of RecB mRNA and protein levels after a per-turbation made by DSB induction with a sub-lethal dose of ciprofloxacin. Taking into account different time-scales of the response in mRNA and protein levels, we address the following question: how long does the DSB induction need to be applied for to see changes (if any) in both species? We focus on the average mRNA and protein concentrations instead of molecule numbers (because of cell elongation upon ciprofloxacin treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>&amp;C) and modify a two-stage model of RecB expression by including deterministic time-dependency of cell volume, <italic>V</italic>(<italic>t</italic>).</p>
<p>As discussed above, we consider the same set of reactions for two species of the system: mRNAs and proteins. While the processes of translation, active mRNA and protein degradation are described by first-order reactions with constant rates: <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, respectively, mRNA transcription is given by a zeroth-order reaction. According to the law of mass action, we shall scale a zeroth-order reaction rate by the volume of the system, as <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub><italic>V</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">130</xref>]. We define the number of mRNA and protein molecules at time <italic>t</italic> in a cell of volume <italic>V</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) as <italic>m</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>p</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), respectively. Then, the evolution of the average numbers of mRNA and protein molecules in time is described by the following rate equations:

</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqnA9">

We further define <italic>recB</italic> mRNA and RecB protein concentration as <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) = <italic>m</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)/<italic>V</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) = <italic>p</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)/<italic>V</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and differentiate with respect to <italic>t</italic>:

<graphic xlink:href="465540v2_eqnA11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
In order to obtain time-dependent solutions for mRNA and protein concentrations, we divide the rate equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnA8">Eq. (A8)</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnA9">Eq. (A9)</xref>) by cell volume <italic>V</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and replace <italic>dm</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)/<italic>dt</italic> and <italic>dp</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)/<italic>dt</italic> with the expressions from the equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnA10">Eq. (A10)</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnA11">Eq. (A11)</xref>). Based on the experimental evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">131</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">132</xref>], we assume the exponential dependence of cell volume from time, <italic>V</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = <italic>V</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>e</italic><sup><italic>γt</italic></sup>, where <italic>γ</italic> is a growth rate. Thus, we obtain the following ordinary differential equations for mRNA and protein concentrations:
<disp-formula id="eqnA12">
<graphic xlink:href="465540v2_eqnA12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqnA13">
<graphic xlink:href="465540v2_eqnA13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
By equating the left-hand sides of the equations to zero, we find the steady-state mRNA and protein concentrations, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>:
<disp-formula id="eqnA14">
<graphic xlink:href="465540v2_eqnA14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>

Next, by assuming the initial conditions for mRNA and protein concentration to be <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>m (t</italic>=0)</sub> and <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>p(t</italic>=0)</sub>, we obtain the time-dependent solutions for mRNA and protein concentrations:
<disp-formula id="eqnA15">
<graphic xlink:href="465540v2_eqnA15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqnA16">
<graphic xlink:href="465540v2_eqnA16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The last expression can be simplified by taking into account that the RecB protein does not have an active degradation mechanism (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Thus, after imposing the condition of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, we obtain a time-dependent solution for RecB protein concentration as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqnA17">
<graphic xlink:href="465540v2_eqnA17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Now we can estimate the mRNA and protein response times from the expressions <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnA15">Eq. (A15)</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnA17">Eq. (A17)</xref>, respectively. It is worth noting that although cells are elongated upon ciprofloxacin treatment, they do not slow down the growth (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). Thus, the analysis of the obtained equations shows that mRNA solution has one mode, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and hence a characteristic response time-scale can be estimated as 1/(<italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> + <italic>γ</italic>) ∼ 1.6 <italic>min</italic> (the results of growth rate measurements, <italic>γ</italic> = <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>cipro</italic>+</sub> = 0.0165 <italic>min</italic><sup>−1</sup>, are shown in <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5c</xref>). In contrast, the expression for protein concentration is given by two time-scales: <italic>e</italic><sup>−<italic>γt</italic></sup> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="465540v2_inline19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where the slowest one defines the response time as 1/<italic>γ</italic> ∼ 61 <italic>min</italic>. This means that a perturbation needs to be applied for at least ∼ 1 hour in order to be able to detect changes in protein concentrations. In our experiments, DSBs were induced for two hours to guarantee fulfillment of the time-scale requirement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study the authors use an elegant set of single-molecule experiments to assess the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of RecB. The question stems from a previous observation from the same lab, that RecB protein levels are low and not induced under DNA damage. The authors first show that recB transcript levels are low and have a short half-life. They further show that RecB levels are likely regulated via translational control. They provide evidence for low noise in RecB protein levels across cells and show that the translation of the mRNA increases under double-strand break conditions. Authors identify Hfq binding sites in the recBCD operon and show that Hfq regulates the levels of RecB protein without changing the mRNA levels. They suggest that RecB translation is directly controlled by Hfq binding to mRNA, as mutating one of the binding sites has a direct effect on RecB protein levels.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The implication of Hfq in regulation of RecB translation is important and suggests mechanisms of cellular response to DNA damage that are beyond the canonically studied mechanisms (such as transcriptional regulation by LexA). Data are clearly presented and the writing is direct and easy to follow. Overall, the study is well-designed and provides novel insights into the regulation of RecB, that is part of the complex required to process break ends.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some key findings need additional support/ clarifications to strengthen the conclusions. These are suggested to the authors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors carry out a careful and rigorous quantitative analysis of RecB transcript and protein levels at baseline and in response to DNA damage. Using single-molecule FISH and Halo-tagging in order to achieve sensitive measurements, they provide evidence that enhanced RecB protein levels in response to DNA damage are achieved through a post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by the Sm-like RNA binding protein, Hfq. In terms of biological relevance, the authors suggest that this mechanism provides a way to control the optimum level of RecB expression as both deletion and over-expression are deleterious. In addition, the proposed mechanism provides a new framework for understanding how transcriptional noise can be suppressed at the protein level.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Strengths of the manuscript include the rigorous approaches and orthogonal evidence to support the core conclusions, for example, the evidence that altering either Hhq or its recognition sequence on the RNA similarly enhance the protein to RNA ratio of RecB. The writing is clear and the experiments are well-controlled. The modeling approaches provide essential context to interpret the data, particularly given the small numbers of molecules per cell. The interpretations are careful and well supported.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors make a compelling case for the biological need to exquisitely control RecB levels, which they suggest is achieved by the pathway they have uncovered and described in this work. However, this conclusion is largely inferred as the authors only investigate the effect on cell survival in response to (high levels of) DNA damage and in response to two perturbations - genetic knock-out or over-expression, both of which are likely more dramatic than the range of expression levels observed in unstimulated and DNA damage conditions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The work by Kalita et al. reports regulation of RecB expression by Hfq protein in E.coli cell. RecBCD is an essential complex for DNA repair and chromosome maintenance. The expression level needs to be regulated at low level under regular growth conditions but upregulated upon DNA damage. Through quantitative imaging, the authors demonstrate that recB mRNAs and proteins are expressed at low level under regular conditions. While the mRNA copy number demonstrates high noise level due to stochastic gene expression, the protein level is maintained at a lower noise level compared to expected value. Upon DNA damage, the authors claim that the recB mRNA concentration is decreased, however RecB protein level is compensated by higher translation efficiency. Through analyzing CLASH data on Hfq, they identified two Hfq binding sites on RecB polycistronic mRNA, one of which is localized at the ribosome binding site (RBS). Through measuring RecB mRNA and protein level in the ∆hfq cell, the authors conclude that binding of Hfq to the RBS region of recB mRNA suppresses translation of recB mRNA. This conclusion is further supported by the same measurement in the presence of Hfq sequestrator, the sRNA ChiX, and the deletion of the Hfq binding region on the mRNA.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript is well-written and easy to understand.</p>
<p>
(2) While there are reported cases of Hfq regulating translation of bound mRNAs, its effect on reducing translation noise is relatively new.</p>
<p>
(3) The imaging and analysis are carefully performed with necessary controls.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weaknesses include a lack of mechanistic depth, and part of the conclusions are not fully supported by the data.</p>
<p>(1) Mechanistically, it is still unclear why upon DNA damage, translation level of recB mRNA increases, which makes the story less complete. The authors mention in the Discussion that a moderate (30%) decrease in Hfq protein was observed in previous study, which may explain the loss of translation repression on recB. However, given that this mRNA exists in very low copy number (a few per cell) and that Hfq copy number is on the order of a few hundred to a few thousand, it's unclear how 30% decrease in the protein level should resides a significant change in its regulation of recB mRNA.</p>
<p>
(2) Based on the experiment and the model, Hfq regulates translation of recB gene through binding to the RBS of the upstream ptrA gene through translation coupling. In this case, one would expect that the behavior of ptrA gene expression and its response to Hfq regulation would be quite similar to recB. Performing the same measurement on ptrA gene expression in the presence and absence of Hfq would strengthen the conclusion and model.</p>
<p>
(3) The authors agree that they cannot exclude the possibility of sRNA being involved in the translation regulation. However, this can be tested by performing the imaging experiments in the presence of Hfq proximal face mutations, which largely disrupt binding of sRNAs.</p>
<p>
(4) The data on construct with a long region of Hfq binding site on recB mRNA deleted is less convincing. There is no control to show that removing this sequence region itself has no effect on translation, and the effect is solely due to the lack of Hfq binding. A better experiment would be using a Hfq distal face mutant that is deficient in binding to the ARN motifs.</p>
<p>
(5) Ln 249-251: The authors claim that the stability of recB mRNA is not changed in ∆hfq simply based on the steady-state mRNA level. To claim so, the lifetime needs to be measured in the absence of Hfq.</p>
<p>
(6) What's the labeling efficiency of Halo-tag? If not 100% labeled, is it considered in the protein number quantification? Is the protein copy number quantification through imaging calibrated by an independent method? Does Halo tag affect the protein translation or degradation?</p>
<p>
(7) Upper panel of Fig S8a is redundant as in Fig 5B. Seems that Fig S8d is not described in the text.</p>

<p>In the discussion, we proposed that the post-transcriptional regulation of recB that we have uncovered could be involved in keeping RecB levels within an optimal range. We agree that testing the phenotypic impact of small changes in RecB levels would add additional strength to this suggestion. However, this is experimentally very challenging because of the low copy number of RecB molecules, which makes it difficult to slightly alter RecB levels in a controlled and homogeneous (across cells) manner. Developing the synthetic biology tools necessary for such an experiment is beyond the scope of this article. In the manuscript, we will clarify the limits of our interpretation of the role of the uncovered regulation.</p>

<p>While Hfq is a highly abundant protein, it has many mRNA and sRNA targets, some of which are also present in large amounts (DOI: 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03734.x). As recently shown, the competition among the targets over Hfq proteins results in unequal (across various targets) outcomes, where the targets with higher Hfq affinity have an advantage over the ones with less efficient binding (DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2020.02.016). In line with these findings, we reason that upon DNA damage, a moderate decrease in the Hfq protein abundance (30%) can lead to a similar competition among Hfq targets where high-affinity targets outcompete low- affinity ones as well as low-abundant ones (such as recB mRNAs). Therefore, we hypothesise that the regulation of low abundant targets of Hfq by moderate perturbations of Hfq protein level is a potential explanation for the change in RecB translation that we have observed. We will expand this part of the discussion to explain our reasoning in a more explicit and coherent way.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, based on our model, we expect PtrA expression to be regulated by Hfq in a similar manner to RecB. However, the product encoded by the ptrA gene, Protease III, (i) has been poorly characterised; (ii) unlike RecB, is located in the periplasm (DOI: 10.1128/jb.149.3.1027-1033.1982); and (iii) is not involved in any DNA repair pathway. Therefore, analysing PtrA expression would take us away from the key questions of our study.</p>

<p>(6) What's the labeling efficiency of Halo-tag? If not 100% labeled, is it considered in the protein number quantification? Is the protein copy number quantification through imaging calibrated by an independent method? Does Halo tag affect the protein translation or degradation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our previous study (DOI: 10.1038/s41598-019-44278-0) described a detailed characterisation of the HaloTag labelling technique for quantifying low-copy proteins in single E. coli cells.</p>
<p>In that study, we used RecB-HaloTag as an example of a low-copy number protein. We showed a complete quantitative agreement of RecB detection between two fully independent methods: HaloTag-based labelling with cell fixation and RecB-sfGFP combined with a microfluidic device that lowers protein diffusion in the bacterial cytoplasm. This second method has previously been validated for protein quantification (DOI: 10.1038/ncomms11641) and provides detection of 80-90% of the labelled protein. Additionally, in our protocol, immediate chemical fixation of cells after the labelling and quick washing steps ensure that new, unlabelled RecB proteins are not produced. We, therefore, conclude that our approach to RecB detection is highly reliable and sufficient for comparing RecB production in different conditions and mutants.</p>
<p>The RecB-HaloTag construct has been designed for minimal impact on RecB production and function. The HaloTag is translationally fused to RecB in a loop positioned after the serine present at position 47 where it is unlikely to interfere with (i) the formation of RecBCD complex (based on RecBCD structure, DOI: 10.1038/nature02988), (ii) the initiation of translation (as it is far away from the 5’UTR and the beginning of the open reading frame) and (iii) conventional C-terminal-associated mechanisms of protein degradation (DOI: 10.15252/msb.20199208). In our manuscript, we showed that the RecB-HaloTag degradation rate is similar to the dilution rate due to bacterial growth. This is in line with a recent study on unlabelled proteins, which shows that RecB’s lifetime is set by the cellular growth rate (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.01.502339">https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.01.502339</ext-link>) and indicates that the HaloTag fusion is not affecting RecB stability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have demonstrated (DOI: 10.1038/s41598-019-44278-0) that (i) bacterial growth is not affected by replacing the native RecB with RecB-HaloTag, (ii) RecB-HaloTag is fully functional upon DNA damage, and (iii) no proteolytic processing of the RecB-HaloTag is detected by Western blot.</p>
<p>These results suggest that RecB expression and functionality are unlikely to be affected by the translational HaloTag insertion at Ser-47 in RecB. In the revised version of the manuscript, we will add information about the construct and discuss the reliability of the quantification.</p>
