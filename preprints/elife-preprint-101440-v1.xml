<title>Summary</title><p>Odors are intimately tied to the taste system to aid food selection and determine the sensory experience of food. However, how smell and taste are integrated in the nervous system to drive feeding remains elusive. We show in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that odors alone activate gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), trigger proboscis extension reflex (PER), a canonical taste-evoked feeding behavior, and enhance food intake. Odor-evoked PER requires the function of sugar-sensing GRNs but not olfactory organs. Calcium imaging and electrophysiological recording show that GRNs directly respond to odors. Odor-evoked PER is mediated by the Gr5a receptor, and is bidirectionally modulated by olfactory binding proteins. Finally, odors and sucrose co-applied to GRNs synergistically enhance PER and food consumption. These results reveal a cell-intrinsic mechanism for odor-taste multimodal integration that takes place as early as in GRNs, indicating that unified chemosensory experience is a product of layered integration in peripheral neurons and in the brain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Feeding behavior is an outcome of intricate interactions among multiple external and internal senses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Boesveldt and de Graaf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McCrickerd and Forde, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Spence, 2015</xref>). Of particular relevance is an interplay between the senses of smell and taste. Olfactory and gustatory systems prime feeding by signaling food presence, guiding food choice, and inducing anticipatory responses in digestive organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Boesveldt and de Graaf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McCrickerd and Forde, 2016</xref>). During consumption, they synergistically define the sensory experience of food together with other cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Spence, 2015</xref>). Although imaging studies have identified neural correlates of odor-taste interaction in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Small, 2012</xref>), mechanistic understanding of chemosensory integration is still lacking.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> offers an attractive model to address this issue, where peripheral chemosensory systems are well-characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scott, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wilson, 2013</xref>), and feeding behavior can be quantified by measuring the strength of proboscis extension reflex (PER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dethier, 1976</xref>) and the amount of subsequent food consumption. PER is an initial step of feeding evoked by the presentation of sugar to the proboscis or legs housing gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs). Previous studies reported that odors increase the rate of PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Oh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reisenman and Scott, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shiraiwa, 2008</xref>) as well as food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reisenman and Scott, 2019</xref>), exemplifying olfactory enhancement of feeding in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, aside from the involvement of olfactory receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Oh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shiraiwa, 2008</xref>), biological mechanisms underlying this multisensory enhancement remain elusive.</p>
<p>Here we investigated the impact of odors on feeding behavior and found direct contribution of GRNs to odor-evoked PER, odor-taste integration, and odor-driven enhancement of food consumption, indicating that multisensory integration commences at the very periphery.</p>

<title>Odors alone evoke PER</title>
<p>To examine how odors affect PER, we built a behavioral recording setup in which a tastant and multiple odors with diverse innate values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Badel et al., 2016</xref>) can be applied to individual, tethered flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To quantify the movement of proboscis, we used a deep learning-based, markerless pose estimation algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>) and tracked the trajectory of three segments constituting the proboscis. The angles made between the segments (rostrum, haustellum, and labellum angles) were subsequently calculated over time to detect PER (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>; see Methods for the definition of PER). Unexpectedly, we found that the odors alone evoked repetitive PER without an application of a tastant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>, and Movie S1). Different odors evoked PER with different probability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), latency (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>), and duration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>, and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). Stimulus-triggered PER was not observed in response to solvents or air (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). Odors evoked PER even at the concentration of 10<sup>-2</sup>, which induce stimulus-specific activity in the olfactory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Badel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Endo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kato et al., 2023</xref>). The level of PER did not correlate with the innate value of odors, previously determined by quantifying the odor preference of flies in a behavioral arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Badel et al., 2016</xref>; Pearson’s R = 0.33, p = 0.52). Odor-evoked PER was observed in other genetic backgrounds and another <italic>Drosophila</italic> species as well albeit at a lower level with different tuning (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

<p>Odor-evoked PER resembled taste-evoked PER in multiple aspects. First, its trajectory was similar to that of taste-evoked PER (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>, Movie S1) and was consistent with the reported movement of proboscis during sucrose-evoked PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>). The trajectories were indistinguishable between the tested odors (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). Second, it showed concentration dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dethier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). The probability and duration of PER increased as a function of stimulus concentration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). Third, it depended on the metabolic state just as taste-evoked PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>). The duration of PER was higher in starved as compared to fed flies (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, odors initiate feeding behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Odors evoke PER through GRNs</title>
<p>To confirm that this behavior is mediated by the olfactory system, we repeated the experiment after removing the sensory organs housing the olfactory receptor neurons, namely the antennae and the maxillary palps. However, this manipulation only attenuated and did not eliminate odor-evoked PER (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Suppressing the activity of most olfactory receptor neurons by expressing a potassium channel Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Paradis et al., 2001</xref>) with <italic>Orco-Gal4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>) gave similar results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). These data show that the olfactory system modulates but is not required for odor-evoked PER.</p>

<p>We thus turned to another chemosensory system, the gustatory system. To examine its involvement in odor-evoked PER, we expressed Kir2.1 in different types of GRNs using type-specific Gal4 drivers, each of which mediates a specific taste modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scott, 2018</xref>). Gr5a GRNs detect sugar and mediate food acceptance behaviors including PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dahanukar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Suppression of Gr5a GRNs significantly reduced odor-evoked PER, indicating that sweet-sensing neurons detect odors and drive PER (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Bitter-sensing Gr66a GRNs, on the other hand, have been shown to inhibit sweet-evoked PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). However, expression of Kir2.1 in these neurons had little effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). We hypothesized that this is due to our use of starved flies because Gr66a pathway is reported to be downregulated in a starved condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Devineni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, flies of the same genotype showed increased PER to odors in a fed state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), indicating that Gr66a GRNs counteract PER. Two other tastes, water and low salt can also induce PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cameron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), which are detected by Ppk28 and Ir94e GRNs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cameron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jaeger et al., 2018</xref>). However, suppression of these cell types did not affect odor-evoked PER (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). Together, Gr5a GRNs enhance whereas Gr66a GRNs inhibit odor-evoked PER.</p>
<p>As GRNs are housed in multiple external organs including the labella at the tip of proboscis, the legs, the wing margins, and the ovipositor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scott, 2018</xref>), we next sought to narrow down the GRNs responsible for odor-evoked PER. We found that removal of the legs and wings did not abolish the behavior (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). Moreover, activation of the ovipositor induces egg laying rather than PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dethier, 1976</xref>). These results suggest that GRNs act predominantly in the labella to induce odor-evoked PER.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Gustatory receptors and olfactory binding proteins mediate odor-evoked PER</title>
<p>We have shown that Gr5a GRNs tuned to tastes trigger PER in response to a wide range of odors. Because GRNs do not express olfactory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scott et al., 2001</xref>), either gustatory receptors or some other molecules are likely to interact with odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>). Gr5a receptor is a primary candidate as Gr5a GRNs drive odor-evoked PER (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, odor-evoked PER was nearly undetectable in the Gr5a mutant but spared in the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). This demonstrates that Gr5a receptor is necessary for odor-evoked PER.</p>
<p>Odorant binding proteins (OBPs) are another set of molecules that could mediate odor detection by GRNs. They are thought to bind and help transport hydrophobic odorants to chemosensory receptors through aqueous lymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Larter et al., 2016</xref>). OBPs are expressed in taste as well as olfactory sensilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Galindo and Smith, 2001</xref>) and modulate sugar-evoked PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Swarup et al., 2014</xref>), raising the possibility that those in the taste sensilla also mediate odorant detection. To test this, we conducted a genetic screen by expressing individual Obp RNAi constructs with <italic>tubulin-Gal4</italic>. We targeted 9 Obp genes that are expressed highly in the labella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cameron et al., 2010</xref>) but in trace amounts in the antenna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Larter et al., 2016</xref>) to examine the function of OBPs in the taste sensilla. Knockdown of <italic>Obp18a</italic>, <italic>Obp57d/e</italic>, and <italic>Obp57e</italic> genes decreased whereas that of <italic>Obp49a</italic> gene increased odor-evoked PER (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2J</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2K</xref>, and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Obp19b, Obp56g</italic>, <italic>Obp56h</italic>, <italic>Obp57a/c</italic>, and <italic>Obp83c</italic> genes did not have a significant effect on odor-evoked PER (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>, and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). The increased PER following <italic>Obp49a</italic> knockdown likely reflects disinhibition of sweet-sensing GRNs as Obp49a mediates the inhibitory impact of bitter chemicals on the activity of sweet-sensing GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jeong et al., 2013</xref>). These results suggest that OBPs modulate odor detection by GRNs.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>GRNs directly respond to odors</title>
<p>To gain direct evidence that GRNs respond to odors, we performed two-photon calcium imaging and single-sensillum electrophysiological recording that have complementary properties (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Calcium imaging of GRN axons using a cell-specific driver reports the population activity of neurons but can unambiguously ascribe the signals to genetically identified GRNs. On the other hand, while single-sensillum electrophysiology cannot uniquely ascribe the signals to genetically defined GRNs, it is sensitive and fast enough to detect individual spikes.</p>

<p>For imaging, we expressed a calcium indicator GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) in Gr5a, Gr66a, Ppk28, or Ir94e GRNs and scanned the axons in the subesophageal zone of the brain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistent with the contribution of Gr5a and Gr66a GRNs to odor-evoked PER, robust odor responses were observed in these neurons. They responded to all the tested odors but not to control stimuli, with distinct tuning (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figures S7A</xref>-<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7F</xref>), in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figures S7G</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7H</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8</xref>). A linear combination of Gr5a and Gr66a GRN responses well predicted the magnitude of odor-evoked PER with the former and the latter contributing to enhancement and suppression of PER, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Odor and sucrose responses were positively correlated in Gr5a GRNs (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7I</xref>). By contrast, Ppk28 and Ir94e GRNs did not respond to any odors (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figures S7J</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7K</xref>), matching their little contribution to odor-evoked PER (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>).</p>
<p>These responses could reflect the activity originating in GRNs or that from a central olfactory circuit impinging on GRN’s presynaptic terminals. To distinguish between the two scenarios, we physically covered the maxillary palps to block the input from the olfactory organs and applied odors (antennae were already removed to gain optical access to the subesophageal zone, see Methods). This manipulation had little effect on the odor responses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). On the other hand, the responses were eliminated after covering the labella (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>), demonstrating that GRNs themselves sense odors.</p>
<p>As we observed that Gr5a receptor was necessary for odor-evoked PER, we further asked whether it is required for Gr5a GRNs to respond to odors. We found that odor responses were absent in the Gr5a mutant but spared in control flies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). This confirms that odor responses in Gr5a GRNs depend on Gr5a receptor.</p>
<p>For electrophysiology, we measured odor-evoked responses from individual taste sensilla on the proboscis using tip recording, a conventional technique where a glass electrode placed on the tip of a sensillum delivers a stimulus as well as records neural responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>; Hodgson et al., Science, 1955). We targeted large and intermediate type (L- and I-type) taste sensilla, and recorded responses to odors and sucrose. Odors were dissolved in tricholine citrate (TCC), an electrolyte that suppresses the responses of water-sensing neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wieczorek and Wolff, 1989</xref>). L-type sensilla housing a sweet-sensing GRN robustly responded to sucrose, but also to two tested odors, 4-methylcyclohexanol and banana odor, at a rate higher than the solvent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). I-type sensilla housing sweet- and bitter-sensing GRNs also responded to odors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). These sensilla exhibited spikes with different amplitudes that may originate in different GRNs. This is consistent with our calcium imaging results showing that both Gr5a and Gr66a GRNs respond to odors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Here we counted all the spikes and did not sort them based on their amplitude and shape, because these characteristics change depending on the spiking frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fujishiro et al., 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, recording from specific types of GRNs using calcium imaging and specific types of taste sensilla using tip recording together demonstrate that GRNs in the labella sense odors in line with a recent study using a different electrophysiological technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dweck and Carlson, 2023</xref>).</p>

We presented sucrose, banana odor or a mixture of the two to individual taste sensilla during tip recording. We found that the responses to a mixture were stronger than those to component stimuli (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). While the strength of responses varied across sensilla, responses to banana odor and sucrose recorded in the same sensillum were positively correlated (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref>).

<title>GRNs integrate multisensory input to enhance PER and food consumption</title>
<p>We finally asked if GRNs can enhance PER and subsequent food consumption through multisensory integration. We decided to apply a mix of banana odor and sucrose as a mimic of multisensory food stimuli in the natural environment. We confirmed that the banana odor can evoke PER and GRN responses in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>). We then presented sucrose solution mixed with or without a low concentration (10<sup>-4</sup>) of banana odor locally to the labella (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Although banana odor could not evoke PER on its own at this concentration (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8A</xref>), we found that the addition of banana odor increased PER to sucrose especially at low concentrations where sucrose alone can only induce unreliable PER (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, this enhancement was observed even after removing the olfactory organs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that the superadditive integration takes place in GRNs. Similar results were obtained when sucrose was mixed with different monomolecular odorants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>).</p>

<p>We further examined if the amount of food consumption is also enhanced by odor-taste integration in GRNs. Using a previously reported multisensory feeding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reisenman and Scott, 2019</xref>), we quantified the amount of sucrose consumed by freely behaving flies with or without odors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).

Critically, this effect was observed in olfactory organs-removed flies as well (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>), indicating the contribution of the gustatory system. Similar results were observed under the presence of ethyl butyrate and 4-methylcyclohexanol, with the former odor exerting a stronger impact (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In terrestrial animals, it has been considered that there is a clear division of labor between the two types of chemosensory organs in sensing stimuli with distinct physical properties; the olfactory and gustatory organs sense volatile and non-volatile chemicals, respectively. Therefore, although odorants and tastants are defined by the identity of cognate organs, they are used interchangeably with volatile and non-volatile chemicals. However, we found using calcium imaging and electrophysiological recording that GRNs directly detect odorants, and this drives a classical taste-induced feeding behavior, PER, as well as increased food consumption. Previous studies have also hinted that odors alone evoke PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Oh et al., 2021</xref>), and induce activity in GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Devineni et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, volatile chemicals are within the molecular receptive range of GRNs and should also be regarded as tastants based on the conventional definition. Critically, this indicates that GRNs are engaged in non-contact chemo-sensing as well, a behavioral strategy distinct from contact-based chemo-sensing.</p>
<p>A study applying base recording, an electrophysiological technique to record from individual taste sensilla, had reported that I-type sensilla do not respond to odorant molecules dissolved in solution (Hiroi et al., 2008). However, a recent study using the same method found that S-, I-, and L-type sensilla respond to a variety of odors applied as vapor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dweck and Carlson, 2023</xref>). Here we found that GRNs respond to odors applied in both ways in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dweck and Carlson (2023)</xref>. Although the reason behind the discrepancy is not entirely clear, one possibility is the difference between the preparation used in different studies; whereas Hiroi et al. used a severed head preparation, we as well as Dweck and Carlson used immobilized, intact flies. Because we noticed in preliminary experiments that stimulus-evoked GRN spikes become weaker over time in a head only preparation where hemolymph circulation is lost, the physiological condition of sensilla may be one of the factors underlying the discrepancy. Another possibility is a difference in genotype or genetic background. We found that the strength of odor-evoked PER is different between genetic backgrounds with w<sup>1118</sup> exhibiting weaker PER than Dickinson wild type (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>), implying that odor responses of GRNs vary across genetic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Our results showed that odor responses of Gr5a GRNs are mediated by the Gr5a receptor. This may not be totally enigmatic as gustatory and olfactory receptor genes belong to the same ancient superfamily sharing a motif in the transmembrane region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Robertson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scott et al., 2001</xref>), and some gustatory receptors expressed outside of GRNs function in odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>), temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ni et al., 2013</xref>), and light detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Montell, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>). However, Gr5a is unique in that the same receptor can detect stimuli of two different sensory modalities. Furthermore, we found that OBPs enriched in the labella modulate odor-evoked PER, suggesting that OBPs in this taste organ not only link tastants with gustatory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jeong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Swarup et al., 2014</xref>), but also mediate detection of odors.</p>
<p>PER was evoked by all the tested odors albeit to different extents, and this likely reflects the broad odor tuning of Gr5a GRNs that drive PER (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The question, then, is why might it be useful to exhibit PER to such a wide variety of odors including those that are normally aversive? A likely benefit can be discussed by considering foraging behavior under natural settings. During foraging in the air, olfactory receptor neurons that are more sensitive to odors locate a potential food source together with other sensory systems. After landing on the potential food, GRNs on the legs join to assess its edibility. In parallel, GRNs on the labella sense odors and enhance the probability of PER. Given that the olfactory system most likely has already guided the animal to palatable food, keeping the GRNs broadly tuned to odors is an efficient mechanism to enhance PER. Once PER brings the labella into contact with the food, GRNs act as a multisensory integrator to make a decision on food intake (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Because inputs from olfactory and gustatory organs interact centrally as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Oh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shiraiwa, 2008</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), this indicates that unified chemosensory experience is built through layered integration in different parts of the body.</p>
<p>Although odor detection by GRNs through gustatory receptors has not previously been reported outside of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, olfactory receptors are expressed in the proboscis in multiple insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Haverkamp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kwon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Xia and Zwiebel, 2006</xref>). A recent study reported that olfactory receptors are also expressed and functional in cultured human fungiform and mouse taste papilla cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Malik et al., 2019</xref>), implying that peripheral odor-taste integration may be a process incorporated in various species. These and our results reveal that GRNs should be further studied not as gustatory neurons but more broadly as chemosensory integrators.</p>

<title>Examination of odor-evoked PER</title>
<p>Virgin females that had been raised on food for 1-3 days were starved for 24-28 h in vials with water supplied through a wet piece of Kimwipe. Individual flies were briefly anesthetized on ice and their dorsal side of the thorax was attached to a cover glass with ultraviolet-curing adhesive (NOA 63, Norland), after which the flies were allowed to rest for an hour. Prior to recording odor-evoked PER, flies were water satiated until they did not consume any more. Subsequently, 100 mM sucrose solution, which acted as a positive control stimulus, was applied either on the fly’s legs or proboscis (without letting the fly consume it) to examine if the fly could exhibit tastant-evoked PER. Flies were discarded if they did not exhibit PER to this stimulus. Flies showing excessive spontaneous PER before the assay were also discarded.

<p>Individual flies went through an experiment consisting of three blocks. In each block, 6 odors (see below), two solvent controls (mineral oil and water), and another control stimulus (air) were applied for 2 s per trial in a randomized order with a 15 s inter-trial-interval.</p>

<title>Olfactory stimulation</title>
<p>Odors were delivered with a custom-made, multi-channel olfactometer controlled by a PC as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Badel et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, an air stream (300 ml/min) was passed through 4 ml of odor solution diluted with mineral oil (nacalai tesque, 23334-85) or water. The concentration of odor was varied between 10<sup>-4</sup>, 10<sup>-2</sup>, 10<sup>-1</sup>, and 0.5 (v/v), but the default was 0.5 unless otherwise noted. The odorized air was further diluted by mixing it with a main air stream (500 ml/min), a small portion of which was delivered frontally to the fly through an outlet placed 10 mm away from the fly. The speed of odorized air flow at the position of the fly was 0.6 m/s. Using the photoionization detector (200B miniPID, Aurora Scientific Inc.), the time odors reach the position of the fly was estimated to be 1.1 s after the odor valve opening. The odors used in the study and their abbreviations are as follows: 2-pentanone (2PT, Wako, 13303743), 3-octanol (OCT, Tokyo chemical industry, O0121), 4-methylcyclohexanol (MCH, Sigma-Aldrich, 153095), banana essence (Narizuka corporation), benzaldehyde (BNZ, Sigma-Aldrich, 418099), ethyl butyrate (EBR, Sigma-Aldrich, E15701), and isopentyl acetate (IPA, Wako, 016-03646), 1-hexanol (Tokyo chemical industry, H0130), ethyl acetate (Tokyo chemical industry, A0030), yeast (nacalai tesque, M1E8921), fenchone (Tokyo chemical industry, F0164), isoamyl alcohol (Tokyo chemical industry, I0289), phenethyl alcohol (Tokyo chemical industry, P0084).</p>

<title>Examination of multisensory PER</title>
<p>To examine how flies respond to odor-taste multimodal stimuli presented to GRNs in the labella, individual flies were gently attached to a cover glass vertically by wrapping their thorax with a piece of parafilm, and multimodal stimuli were applied by touching the ventral part of the labellum with a wick made of Kimwipe immersed in a sucrose solution with or without odors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shiraiwa, 2008</xref>)). A constant air stream (0.5∼0.7 m/s) was applied with an air pump (eAir6000, GEX) from behind the wick. The legs of the flies were tucked under the parafilm to prevent them from touching the wick. The flies were allowed to rest for an hour after fixation. The concentration of sucrose was varied between 0.25-2% (v/v, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) or fixed at 0.25% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>) depending on the experiment. When the concentration of sucrose was varied, the stimuli were applied in an ascending order to avoid adaptation. The concentration of the added odor was 10<sup>-4</sup> for all the tested stimuli. Each stimulus was applied 3 times with an inter-trial-interval of 15 s. PER was manually scored when the proboscis was fully extended within ∼2 s from the stimulation.</p>

<title>Quantification of PER</title>
<p>A markerless pose estimation algorithm DeepLabCut v2.0 was used to quantify the movement of the proboscis. The position and orientation of three segments of the proboscis, the rostrum, the haustellum, and the labellum were characterized by tracking six points, namely the proximal end of the antenna, the distal end of the antenna, the rostrum apex, the rostrum-haustellum joint, the haustellum-labellum joint, and the distal end of the labellum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). These six points were manually labeled on the lateral view of the fly to generate the training dataset, which consisted of 1465 labeled frames in video data from 19 flies. The ResNet50 based pose estimation neural network was trained for about 200,000 iterations, after which the six points were automatically tracked in all the frames in video data.</p>
<p>Following the pose estimation, data were analyzed using custom code written in Python. To detect proboscis extensions, the rostrum angle (the angle made by the line passing through the proximal and distal ends of the antenna and the line along the rostrum), the haustellum angle (the angle between the rostrum and the haustellum), and the labellum angle (the angle between the haustellum and the labellum) were calculated over time (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The baseline of each proboscis angle was calculated as the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of a rolling 5 s time window. The proboscis extension was defined as PER if the haustellum angle exceeded 100° because it corresponded to full extension by visual inspection. PER duration was defined as the time during which the fly exhibited PER in each second. Integrated PER duration was defined as the sum of PER duration over 4 s starting 1 s after the odor onset. These values were averaged across three trials for each odor in each fly. PER probability was defined as the percentage of trials in which PER was observed for each stimulus in each fly.</p>
<p>Because repetitive, spontaneous PER occurring at regular intervals represented an abnormal condition, flies showing such repetitive, spontaneous PER in more than 9 trials were excluded from further analysis.</p>
<p>To examine if the movement of the proboscis is similar between odor-evoked and tastant-evoked PER as well as between PER evoked by different odors, temporal sequences of the rostrum and the haustellum angles during PER and partial proboscis extensions were clustered with K-medoids clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Park and Jun, 2009</xref>). PER and partial proboscis extensions were detected from the baseline subtracted rostrum angle using hysteresis thresholding with a lower threshold of 5° and an upper threshold of 15°. Because the length of a temporal sequence is different between PER, the data were converted to a distance metric using dynamic time warping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sakoe and Chiba, 1978</xref>) with a warping window of 0.25 s prior to clustering. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method.</p>

Brains were dissected out from the head capsule in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, nacalai tesque, 2757531), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (nacalai tesque, 915414) for 90 min on ice, and incubated in blocking solution containing 5% normal goat serum (Invitrogen, 50197Z) in PBST (0.2% Triton X-100 (nacalai tesque, 3550102) in PBS) for 30 min. Primary antibodies were then added and incubated at 4 °C for ∼48 h. After removing antibodies and washing over an hour, the brains were incubated in a solution of secondary antibodies at 4 °C for 24 h. The brains were immersed in Vectashield (Vector laboratories, H-1000), sealed with a cover glass, and imaged with a confocal microscope (FV3000, Olympus).

<title>Fly preparation for calcium imaging</title>
<p>Individual flies starved for 24-28 h with water were anesthetized on ice, and their dorsal side of the thorax was fixed to a piece of parafilm with ultraviolet-curing adhesive (NOA 63, Norland). The legs of the fly were covered with another piece of parafilm. The fly was subsequently attached to a custom-made recording plate in a vertical position such that the anterior part of the head was accessible through a small hole on the recording plate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The proboscis was pulled out gently with forceps and immobilized in an extended position using a strip of parafilm with the labella exposed to the air. After covering the head with saline containing 103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM N-tris (hydroxymethyl) methyl-2-aminoethane-sulfonic acid, 8 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (osmolarity adjusted to 270-275 mOsm), the antennae and the associated cuticle were removed to expose the subesophageal zone.

<title>Two-photon calcium imaging</title>
<p>Calcium imaging of GRN axons in the subesophageal zone was conducted using a two-photon microscope (LSM 7 MP, Zeiss) equipped with a piezo motor (P-725.2CD PIFOC, PI) that drives a water immersion objective lens (W Plan-Apochromat, 20x, numerical aperture 1.0) along the z-axis. The fluorophore was excited with a titanium:sapphire pulsed laser (Chameleon Vision II, Coherent) mode-locked at 930 nm. The laser power measured at the back aperture of the objective lens was below 20 mW. Fluorescence was collected with a GaAsP detector through a bandpass emission filter (BP470-550). Five optical slices separated by 5 μm were scanned every 500 ms. The odor delivery system was identical to that used in behavioral experiments. Sucrose was presented by a syringe whose movement was controlled by an actuator.</p>

<sec id="s6l">
<title>Image processing</title>
<p>Calcium imaging data were analyzed using custom code written in MATLAB (MathWorks). Images were registered within and across trials to correct for movement in the x-y plane as well as in depth by determining the shift along three dimensions that maximizes the correlation between the images. The region of interest (ROI) was set to cover the GRN axons in the subesophageal zone. The size of ROI was 80 × 60 μm for Gr5a GRNs, 60 × 40 μm for Gr66a GRNs, 80 × 60 μm for Ir94e GRNs, and 80 × 40 μm for Ppk28 GRNs, respectively. The average pixel intensity within the ROI was calculated for each time frame. The average of 5 frames preceding a stimulus was used as the baseline signal to calculate ΔF/F for each time frame. The peak stimulus response was quantified by averaging ΔF/F across five frames at the peak, followed by averaging across three trials for each stimulus.</p>

<title>Food consumption assay</title>
<p>Food consumption was quantified in principle as described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reisenman and Scott, 2019</xref>). Briefly, virgin females that had been raised on food for 1-2 days were starved for 24-28 h in vials with water supplied through a wet piece of Kimwipe. Flies were then transferred to a custom-made vial (n = 10 to 15 per vial) with a filter paper (3 cm in diameter) on the top and a small mesh tube attached laterally near the top (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). The filter paper on the top was impregnated with sucrose solution (0.1%, 150 μl) containing blue dye blue, kyoritsu-foods), and a small piece of filter paper (0.5 x 1 cm) placed in the mesh tube was impregnated with odor (1%, 10 μl) or control solution. Flies were allowed to consume sucrose solution for 5 min after which the vials were placed in the freezer (-20 °C) for at least 1 h. The extent of sucrose consumption by individual flies was quantified under the microscope based on the amount of blue dye in the abdomen, which was scored using the five-point scale ranging from 0 to 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reisenman and Scott, 2019</xref>). The scorer was blind to the experimental condition (whether the filter paper in the mesh tube was impregnated with odor or control solvent).

<title>Electrophysiological recording from taste sensilla on the proboscis</title>
<p>Odor and taste responses of individual taste sensilla on the proboscis were measured using tip recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hodgson et al., 1955</xref>). Virgin females that had been raised on food for 1-2 days were starved for 24-28 h in vials with water supplied through a wet piece of Kimwipe. Individual flies were immobilized at the end of a pipette tip. The proboscis was fixed at an extended position using ultraviolet-curing adhesive (NOA 63, Norland). A saline-filled reference electrode was inserted into the eye. Individual taste sensilla were stimulated for ∼2 s with a capillary electrode containing the stimulus and an electrolyte, 30 mM TCC. The recording electrode was connected to an amplifier (Multiclamp 700B, Molecular Devices). Signals were bandpass filtered at 100-1000 Hz, and digitally sampled at 10 kHz using a data acquisition module (NI cDAQ9178, NI 9215, National Instruments). The intensity of the response was measured by counting the number of spikes generated between 200 and 700 ms after the stimulus contact following the convention to avoid the contamination of motion artifact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Dahanukar and Benton, 2023</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Delventhal et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hiroi et al., 2002</xref>). Responses to sucrose, banana odor, MCH, and TCC were recorded from L- and I-type sensilla. Sucrose and odors were dissolved in TCC (30 mM) solution. Each stimulus was applied to the same sensillum for 2 or 3 times, with 1 min inter-stimulus-interval. To examine odor-taste integration in each sensillum, banana odor and sucrose solution were presented individually or simultaneously in a mixture. Recordings were made from L2 and L6 sensilla. Each stimulus was presented twice, with 1 min inter-stimulus-interval, in a random order.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>important</bold> new insight into chemosensation by showing that odors activate taste sensory neurons in Drosophila to promote feeding behaviors. Using a <bold>convincing</bold> methodology, combining behavior analysis, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging, Kazama and colleagues have deepened our understanding of how this phenomenon modulates the feeding behavior, although in some cases additional controls would strengthen the conclusions. Here, the authors articulate a clear instance of a novel neural and behavioral mechanism for gustatory receptors in an olfactory response making this work relevant to researchers studying chemosensation, sensory biology, and insect behavior.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Odor- and taste-sensing are mediated by two different systems, the olfactory and gustatory systems, and have different behavioral roles. In this study, Wei et al. challenge this dichotomy by showing that odors can activate gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in Drosophila to promote feeding responses, including the proboscis extension response (PER) that was previously thought to be driven only by taste. While previous studies suggested that odors can promote PER to appetitive tastants, Wei et al. go further to show that odors alone cause PER, this effect is mediated through sweet-sensing GRNs, and sugar receptors are required. The study also shows that odor detection by bitter-sensing GRNs suppresses PER. The authors' conclusions are supported by behavioral assays, calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and genetic manipulations. The observation that both attractive and aversive odors promote PER leaves an open question as to why this effect is adaptive. Overall, the study sheds new light on chemosensation and multimodal integration by showing that odor and taste detection converge at the level of sensory neurons, a finding that is interesting and surprising while also being supported by another recent study (Dweck &amp; Carlson, Sci Advances 2023).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The main finding that odors alone can promote PER by activating sweet-sensing GRNs is interesting and novel.</p>
<p>(2) The study uses video tracking of the proboscis to quantify PER rather than manual scoring, which is typically used in the field. The tracking method is less subjective and provides a higher-resolution readout of the behavior.</p>
<p>(3) The study uses calcium imaging and electrophysiology to show that odors activate GRNs. These represent complementary techniques that measure activity at different parts of the GRN (axons versus dendrites, respectively) and strengthen the evidence for this conclusion.</p>
<p>(4) Genetic manipulations show that odor-evoked PER is primarily driven by sugar GRNs and sugar receptors rather than olfactory neurons. This is a major finding that distinguishes this work from previous studies of odor effects on PER and feeding (e.g., Reisenman &amp; Scott, 2019; Shiraiwa, 2008) that assumed or demonstrated that odors were acting through olfactory neurons.</p>
<p>Weaknesses/Limitations:</p>
<p>1. The authors may want to discuss why PER to odors alone has not been previously reported, especially as they argue that this is a broad effect evoked by many different odors. Previous studies testing the effect of odors on PER only observed odor enhancement of PER to sugar (Oh et al., 2021; Reisenman &amp; Scott, 2019; Shiraiwa, 2008) and some of these studies explicitly show no effect of odor alone or odor with low sugar concentration; regardless, the authors likely would have noticed if PER to odor alone had occurred. Readers of this paper may also be aware of unpublished studies failing to observe an effect of PER on odor alone (including studies performed by this reviewer and unrelated work by other colleagues in the field), which of course the authors are not expected to directly address but may further motivate the authors to provide possible explanations.</p>
<p>(2) Many of the odor effects on behavior or neuronal responses were only observed at very high concentrations. Most effects seemed to require concentrations of at least 10-2 (0.01 v/v), which is at the high end of the concentration range used in olfactory studies (e.g., Hallem et al., 2004), and most experiments in the paper used a far higher concentration of 0.5 v/v. It is unclear whether these are concentrations that would be naturally encountered by flies.</p>
<p>(3) The calcium imaging data showing that sugar GRNs respond to a broad set of odors contrasts with results from Dweck &amp; Carlson (Sci Adv, 2023) who recorded sugar neurons with electrophysiology and observed responses to organic acids, but not other odors. This discrepancy is not discussed.</p>
<p>(4) Related to point #1, it would be useful to see a quantification of the percent of flies or trials showing PER for the key experiments in the paper, as this is the standard metric used in most studies and would help readers compare PER in this study to other studies. This is especially important for cases where the authors are claiming that odor-evoked PER is modulated in the same way as previously shown for sugar (e.g., the effect of starvation in Figure S4).</p>
<p>(5) Given the novelty of the finding that odors activate sugar GRNs, it would be useful to show more examples of GCaMP traces (or overlaid traces for all flies/trials) in Figure 3. Only one example trace is shown, and the boxplots do not give us a sense of the reliability or time course of the response. A related issue is that the GRNs appear to be persistently activated long after the odor is removed, which does not occur with tastes. Why should that occur? Does the time course of GRN activation align with the time course of PER, and do different odors show differences in the latency of GRN activation that correspond with differences in the latency of PER (Figure S1A)?</p>
<p>(6) Several controls are missing, and in some cases, experimental and control groups are not directly compared. In general, Gal4/UAS experiments should include comparisons to both the Gal4/+ and UAS/+ controls, at least in cases where control responses vary substantially, which appears to be the case for this study. These controls are often missing, e.g. the Gal4/+ controls are not shown in Figure 2C-G and the UAS/+ controls are not shown in Figure 2J-L (also, the legend for the latter panels should be revised to clarify what the &quot;control&quot; flies are). For the experiments in Figure S5, the data are not directly compared to any control group. For several other experiments, the control and experimental groups are plotted in separate graphs (e.g., Figure 2C-G), and they would be easier to visually compare if they were together. In addition, for each experiment, the authors should denote which comparisons are statistically significant rather than just reporting an overall p-value in the legend (e.g., Figure 2H-L).</p>
<p>(7) Additional controls would be useful in supporting the conclusions. For the Kir experiments, how do we know that Kir is effective, especially in cases where odor-evoked PER was not impaired (e.g., Orco/Kir)? The authors could perform controls testing odor aversion, for example. For the Gr5a mutant, few details are provided on the nature of the control line used and whether it is in the same genetic background as the mutant. Regardless, it would be important to verify that the Gr5a mutant retains a normal sense of smell and shows normal levels of PER to stimuli other than sugar, ruling out more general deficits. Finally, as the method of using DeepLabCut tracking to quantify PER was newly developed, it is important to show the accuracy and specificity of detecting PER events compared to manual scoring.</p>
<p>(8) The authors' explanation of why both attractive and aversive odors promote PER (lines 249-259) did not seem convincing. The explanation discusses the different roles of smell and taste but does not address the core question of why it would be adaptive for an aversive odor, which flies naturally avoid, to promote feeding behavior.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>A gustatory receptor and neuron enhances an olfactory behavioral response, proboscis extension.</p>
<p>This manuscript clearly establishes a novel mechanism by which a gustatory receptor and neuron evokes an olfactory-driven behavioral response. The study expands recent observations by Dweck and Carlson (2023) that suggest new and remarkable properties among GRNs in Drosophila. Here, the authors articulate a clear instance of a novel neural and behavioral mechanism for gustatory receptors in an olfactory response.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The systematic and logical use of genetic manipulation, imaging and physiology, and behavioral analysis makes a clear case that gustatory neurons are bona fide olfactory neurons with respect to proboscis extension behavior.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No weaknesses were identified by this reviewer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Using flies, Kazama et al. combined behavioral analysis, electrophysiological recordings, and calcium imaging experiments to elucidate how odors activate gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) and elicit a proboscis extension response, which is interpreted as a feeding response.</p>
<p>The authors used DeepLabCut v2.0 to estimate the extension of the proboscis, which represents an unbiased and more precise method for describing this behavior compared to manual scoring.</p>
<p>They demonstrated that the probability of eliciting a proboscis extension increases with higher odor concentrations. The most robust response occurs at a 0.5 v/v concentration, which, despite being diluted in the air stream, remains a relatively high concentration. Although the probability of response is not particularly high it is higher than control stimuli. Notably, flies respond with a proboscis extension to both odors that are considered positive and those regarded as negative.</p>
<p>The authors used various transgenic lines to show that the response is mediated by GRNs. Specifically, inhibiting Gr5a reduces the response, while inhibiting Gr66a increases it in fed flies. Additionally, they find that odors induce a strong positive response in both types of GRNs, which is abolished when the labella of the proboscis are covered. This response was also confirmed through electrophysiological tip recordings.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors demonstrated that the response increases when two stimuli of different modalities, such as sucrose and odors, are presented together, suggesting clear multimodal integration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The integration of various techniques, that collectively support the robustness of the results.</p>
<p>The assessment of electrophysiological recordings in intact animals, preserving natural physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The behavioral response is observed in only a small proportion of animals.</p>
