<title>Abstract</title><p>The experience-dependent spatial cognitive process requires sequential organization of hippocampal neural activities by theta rhythm, which develops to represent highly compressed information for rapid learning. However, how the theta sequences were developed in a finer time scale within theta cycles remains unclear. In this study, we found that sweep-ahead structure of theta sequences developing with exploration was predominantly dependent on a relatively large proportion of FG-cells, i.e. a subset of place cells dominantly phase-locked to fast gamma rhythms. These ensembles integrated compressed spatial information by cells consistently firing at precessing slow gamma phases within the theta cycle. Accordingly, the sweep-ahead structure of FG-cell sequences was positively correlated with the intensity of slow gamma phase precession, in particular during early development of theta sequences. These findings highlight the dynamic network-modulation by fast and slow gamma in the development of theta sequences which may further facilitate memory encoding and retrieval.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The hippocampus is known as its central role in encoding and storing experience and thus is essential for forming episodic memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Buzsaki, McKenzie, &amp; Davachi, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cohen &amp; Eichenbaum, 1993</xref>). In the context of active navigation in an environment, hippocampal place cells are organized to fire sequentially within individual cycles of theta oscillations (4-12Hz) and form time-compressed representations of behavioral experiences, referred to as theta sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Colgin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Comrie, Frank, &amp; Kay, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dragoi &amp; Buzsaki, 2006</xref>; W. E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Skaggs, McNaughton, Wilson, &amp; Barnes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wallis, 2018</xref>). By sweeping ahead from the past to the upcoming locations, theta sequences represent information about potential future paths that could guide goal-directed behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gupta, van der Meer, Touretzky, &amp; Redish, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Joshi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zheng, Hwaun, Loza, &amp; Colgin, 2021</xref>). These predictive theta sequences exhibited experience-dependent development when rats were exploring a novel environment or learning a novel goal location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng, Silva, &amp; Foster, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gobbo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wikenheiser &amp; Redish, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). However, how the hippocampal network modulated the development of theta sequencesâ temporospatial-compressed organization remains incompletely understood.</p>
<p>A common assumption was established by previous studies that theta sequences were manifestations of theta phase precession, in which an individual place cell fired at progressively earlier theta phase as the animal traversed the place field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aoki et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Foster &amp; Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">OâKeefe &amp; Recce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Qasim, Fried, &amp; Jacobs, 2021</xref>; W. E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref>). However, when examined the theta sequences with experience at single trial level, their sequential structures were not developed on the first experience of a novel environment even if the phase precession of individual place cells has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Colgin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that the dynamic process of theta sequences development could be modulated by another network-level mechanism with neuronal firing organized at a finer timescale within theta cycles. Gamma (25-100Hz) could be a candidate that is thought to interact with theta to temporally organize theta sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dragoi &amp; Buzsaki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fernandez-Ruiz, Sirota, Lopes-Dos-Santos, &amp; Dupret, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lisman &amp; Jensen, 2013</xref>). As two subtypes of gamma, fast and slow gamma rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang, Lee, Rozell, &amp; Singer, 2019</xref>) occur at distinct theta phases and coordinate theta sequences in different manners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zheng, Bieri, Hsiao, &amp; Colgin, 2016</xref>). This indicates that fast and slow gamma may act as different tuners but collaborate together in modulating theta sequence development.</p>
<p>Fast gamma (â¼65-100Hz), associated with the input from the medial entorhinal cortex, is thought to rapidly encode ongoing novel information in the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kemere, Carr, Karlsson, &amp; Frank, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). During fast gamma rhythms, place cell spikes occurred across all positions within a place field and displayed theta phase precession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bieri, Bobbitt, &amp; Colgin, 2014</xref>). This type of cells was identified recently as âphase-precessingâ cells, in which the phase-precession pattern emerges with strong fast gamma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Guardamagna, Stella, &amp; Battaglia, 2023</xref>). Their discrete distribution of theta phases is likely to contribute to the sequential structure formation when the sequences have been developed (M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wang, Foster, &amp; Pfeiffer, 2020</xref>). However, a question is raised about how these fast gamma-modulated cells be coordinated for the developmental process of theta sequences.</p>
<p>Slow gamma (â¼25-45Hz) in the hippocampal CA1 reflects information received from CA3, which is responsible for the integration processing of learned information and experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast to fast gamma, spiking during slow gamma exhibited dominant theta phase locking and attenuated theta phase precession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Guardamagna et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). This concentrated distribution of theta phase could be interpreted as they are coordinated within slow gamma cycles, as a finer time-scale than a theta cycle. Place cells spiking exhibited slow gamma phase precession, to generate mini-sequences in an individual theta sequence, for highly time-compressed representation of ongoing and future information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, how fast and slow gamma rhythms coordinate place cells spiking to modulate the dynamic process of theta sequence development remains unclear.</p>
<p>Here, we proposed a scheme that fast gamma rhythms coordinate a subgroup of place cells for rapidly encoding and processing sensory information since from the early phase of theta sequence development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The developing process would be then dependent on the slow gamma modulation, that the spikes are fired at slow gamma phase-precessed pattern for spatial information compression within theta cycles. To test this hypothesis, we investigated how fast and slow gamma separately modulated place cells activities during the whole process of theta sequence development. We found that the fast gamma phase-locked place cells (FG-cells) were crucial for the development of theta sequences, without which the temporospatially compressed structure of theta sequences could not be developed. Furthermore, these cells exhibited slow gamma phase precession within theta cycles associated with the sweep-ahead structure of theta sequences, which occurred earlier than those cells not phase locked to fast gamma (NFG-cells). Our findings highlight the dynamic network-modulation by neural oscillations fast and slow gamma, at finer timescales within theta, in development of theta sequences which may further facilitate memory encoding and retrieval.</p>

<caption><title>The schematic of a model for theta sequence development</title><p>Fast gamma rhythms coordinate a subgroup of place cells, as their spikes are dominantly phase-locked to fast gamma rhythms (FG-cells). The development process of theta sequences is disrupted by excluding these FG-cells. A possible model would be that development of sweep-ahead structure of theta sequences is dependent on the slow gamma modulation, i.e., slow gamma phase precession, whereby spatial information could be highly compressed within theta cycles. FG-cells are those cells exhibiting slow gamma phase precession within theta cycles since from the early stage of sequence development. However, the NFG-cells only excited slow gamma phase locking during late stage, which may unlikely contribute to the sequence development.</p></caption>

<title>A subgroup of hippocampal place cells phase locked to fast gamma rhythms during active behaviors</title>
<p>To investigate the temporal organization of place cellsâ firing associated with the gamma rhythms during the development of theta sequences, we trained 4 Long-Evans rats traversed unidirectionally on a circular track, with 5 trials (laps) in each recording session (day). Meanwhile, neuronal spiking of place cells and local field potentials were recorded simultaneously in hippocampal CA1 (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>) during active running behaviors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The slow and gamma episodes were detected in time periods when the power of each gamma type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>, fast gamma: 65-100 Hz, slow gamma: 25-45 Hz) was above a preset threshold (see Materials and Methods). We could observe both slow gamma and fast episodes occurred during active exploration. As shown in a previous study, 32% of hippocampal pyramidal cells were phase-locked to gamma rhythms during waking theta states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Senior, Huxter, Allen, OâNeill, &amp; Csicsvari, 2008</xref>). We further tested how the hippocampal place cells were modulated by slow and fast gamma rhythms respectively, by quantifying the slow or fast gamma phase distributions of all spikes across all trials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In this study, 488 place cells were included with place field distributed on the circular track but not located at the resting box. We employed local LFPs as reference to detect gamma phase-locking and found that 120 (24.6%) out of these cells were significantly phase-locked to gamma rhythms, a majority of which (113 cells, 23.2%) exhibited significant phase-locking to fast gamma rhythms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). We also detected FG-cells by using LFP from a different tetrode, i.e. the central one of the bundle that located in the pyramidal layer, and found approximate proportion of FG-cells which phase locked to â¼75Hz (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2C-F</xref>, Chi-squared test, Ï<sup>2</sup>= 0.9, p=0.4, Cramer V=0.03). Their preferred fast gamma phases (202.38Â±2.01 deg) were concentrated around the peak of fast gamma cycle, which was consistent with the findings in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schomburg et al. 2014</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>). However, a very small number (3.7%) of cells were found to phase-locked to slow gamma rhythms. Thus, these place cells were subdivided according to whether they were significantly phase-locked to fast gamma (FG-cells) or not (NFG-cells) during active behaviors in the subsequent analyses. Furthermore, the fast gamma phase-locking of FG-cells was stable across trials, with a significantly higher mean vector length of fast gamma phase-locking than those of NFG-cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, repeated measure ANOVA, main effect of cell type, F(1,22)=33.9, p=7.5Ã10<sup>-6</sup>, partial Î·<sup>2</sup> =0.6; main effect of trials, F(4,88)=1.3, p=0.3, partial Î·<sup>2</sup> =0.06, no cell type x trials interaction, F(4,88)=0.5, p=0.8, partial Î·<sup>2</sup> =0.02). Meanwhile, we also found that a larger proportion of neurons in FG-cells had significant theta phase precession than NFG-cell (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 3</xref>, chi-squared test, ratio of theta phase precession cell among the FG-cell vs. NFG-cell, n=457cell Ï<sup>2</sup>=13.7, p=2.1Ã10<sup>-4</sup>, Cramer V=0.2). These results suggested that the FG-cells were stably modulated by fast gamma rhythms during active behaviors.</p>

<title>The FG-cells were crucial for theta sequence development</title>
<p>As theta sequences were developed dependent on experience, we next investigated whether FG-cells and NFG-cells played different roles in the development of theta sequences. We then used a Bayesian decoding approach (see Methods) to identify trajectories represented as rats running on a circular track, and detected theta sequences in each single lap (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Another two decoders were built by excluding either FG-cells spikes or down-sampled NFG-cells spikes respectively, in order to compare the structures of theta sequences without each type of cells. It can be observed that posterior probability distribution of theta sequences was changed by excluding spikes from FG-cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The weighted correlation of each sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng et al., 2015</xref>) was then measured to quantify the temporospatial correlation of a theta sequence structure. We found that the weighted correlation of theta sequences decoded by excluding FG-cells spikes (exFG-sequences) was much lower than that of theta sequences decoded by excluding down-sampled NFG-cells spikes (exNFG-sequences) in the same theta cycles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, generalized linear mixed model, main effect of cell type, F(2,7255)=53.0, p=0; post-hoc test, raw sequences vs. exFG-sequences, p=0, raw sequences vs. exNFG-sequences, p=4.6Ã10<sup>-8</sup>, exFG-sequences vs. exNFG-sequences, p=1.1Ã10<sup>-6</sup>). This suggests that the sequential structure could be dominantly interrupted by excluding FG-cells rather than NFG-cells.</p>

<p>Consistent with the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng et al., 2015</xref>; M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), we also observed the development of theta sequences along with exploration experience (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref>, repeated measure ANOVA, main effect of trials, F(4,44)=7.0, p=2.0Ã10<sup>-4</sup>, partial Î·<sup>2</sup>=0.4). This could not be accounted for by behavioral parameters, as the rats were running at stable running speed and head direction across trials (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, repeated measure ANOVA, main effect of trials: F(4,44)=0.9, p=0.5 partial Î·<sup>2</sup> =0.07; <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>, Watson-Williams multi-sample test, F(4,55)=0.2, p=0.9, partial Î·<sup>2</sup>= 0.01). We further investigated whether the FG-cells or NFG-cells were required for the development of theta sequence structure. Interestingly, the temporospatial structure of the theta sequences cannot be developed with experience when the FG-cell spikes were excluded, with significantly lower weighted correlation than theta sequences constructed by excluding NFG-cell spikes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, G, repeated measure ANOVA, trials x cell type interaction, F(4,44)=3.0, p=0.03, partial Î·<sup>2</sup> =0.2, main effect of cell type, F(1,11)=7.8, p=0.02, partial Î·<sup>2</sup>=0.4; main effect of trials, F(4,44)=4.0, p=0.008). Since the theta sequences have been developed after Lap2, we defined the early development phase of sequences as the first 2 laps and late development phase of sequences as the last 2 laps of exploration experience, respectively. We found that the weighted correlation of both exFG-sequences and exNFG-sequences was low during early development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, paired t-test, t(24)=0.2, p=0.9, Cohenâs d=0.04). During late development, however, the weighted correlation of exNFG-sequences was higher than that of exFG-sequences (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, paired t-test, t(24)=-3.7, p=0.001, Cohenâs d=0.8). These results suggest that fast gamma modulation of place cells may contribute to the development of theta sequence with exploration experience.</p>
<p>In order to estimate to what extent, the FG cells contributed to theta sequence development, we investigated the relationship between the percentage of FG-cells and the formation of sequential structure in different developments. In our dataset, the percentage of FG-cells out of all place cells varied across days, thus we detected theta sequences from trials with relatively low percentage (â¼10%) and high percentage (â¼35%) of FG-cells. The number of excluded NFG-cells for decoding was matched up with the number of excluded FG-cells by a pseudo-random method in each day. During early development, the temporospatial structure of theta sequences has not been developed by excluding either low or high percentage of each type of cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). During late development, however, the sweeping-ahead structure of the theta sequence was significantly disrupted when excluding a high percentage (â¼35%) of FG-cells, which was not observed when excluding a low percentage (â¼10%) of FG-cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The sequential structure could be maintained by excluding NFG-cells at either low or high percentage. To quantify the relationship between sequence structure and the number of excluded neurons during early and late development, we then measured the weighted correlation difference between exFG-sequences and exNFG-sequences as a function of the fraction of excluded cells. The results showed that the weighted correlation difference was close to 0 regardless of the fraction of excluded cells during early development (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, Pearsonâs correlation, Corr=0.1, p=0.7). During late development, however, we found that the weighted correlation difference was positively correlated with the fraction of excluded cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, Pearsonâs correlation, Corr=0.6, p=0.03). These results suggest different roles of FG-cells and NFG-cells in the development of the sweeping-ahead structure of theta sequence with experience, that the more temporospatially compressed structure of theta sequences may require a larger percentage of FG-cells.</p>

<p>In addition, we tested whether these results could be accounted for by the different firing characteristics between FG-cells and NFG-cells. We found that although these two types of cells took different proportion of all recorded place cells, the place fields of both types of cells could cover the entire track uniformly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We measured the distribution of center of mess (COM) of main place field of FG-cells and number-matched NFG-cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), and found similar distribution of place field COM between cell types (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Z=0.1, p=0.8). Furthermore, Although the mean firing rate of FG-cell was significantly higher than NFG-cell (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, Studentâs t test, t(22) = 2.1, p = 0.04, Cohenâs D = 0.9), the theta sequences in the above analyses were decoded by excluding similar numbers of spikes from FG-cells and NFG-cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, excluded spike counts, t(22) = 1.2, p = 0.3, Cohenâs D = 0.5;), indicating that the different development patterns between exFG-sequences and exNFG-sequences were not due to quality difference between two decoders. The two type of cells exhibited similar place fields size (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, t(22)=0.7, p=0.5, Cohenâs D=0.3) and spatial information (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, t(22)=1.0, p=0.3, Cohenâs D=0.4).

<title>FG-cells exhibited slow gamma phase precession for information compression required in theta sequence development</title>
<p>In our previous study, we found that the place cell spikes occurred at progressively earlier slow gamma phases across slow gamma cycles in theta sequences, so-called slow gamma phase precession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). As sequences of locations were represented at different slow gamma phases, theta sequences exhibited temporospatially compressed structure representing long paths. We next investigated if the development of theta sequence structure was related to the slow gamma phase modulation of place cells. By detecting the slow gamma phases of spikes within all theta cycles, we observed that the slow gamma phases significantly shifted across successive slow gamma cycles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, multi-sample Mardia-Watson-Wheeler test, W(4)=369.4, p&lt;2.2Ã10<sup>-16</sup>; post-hoc test, Cycle â1 vs. Cycle 0, W(2)=97.5, p&lt;2.2Ã10<sup>-16</sup>, Cycle 0 vs. Cycle 1, W(2)=95.4, p&lt;2.2Ã10<sup>-16</sup>), which was consistent with the previous finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Then we separated out the spike activity from the early and late development, and tested if the slow gamma phase precession still existed during different developments. Interestingly, we observed slow gamma phase shifting, but not phase precession, across successive gamma cycles during early development. The distribution of slow gamma phases in Cycle0 was similar as that in Cycle-1, then was dispersed in Cycle1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, multi-sample Mardia-Watson-Wheeler test, W(4)=18.5, p=9.8Ã10<sup>-4</sup>; post-hoc test, Cycle â1 vs. Cycle 0, W(2)=0.8, p=0.7; Cycle 0 vs. Cycle 1, W(2)=15.5, p=4.4Ã10<sup>-4</sup>). However, the slow gamma phase precession existed during late development (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, multi-sample Mardia-Watson-Wheeler test, W(4)=21.2, p=2.8Ã10<sup>-4</sup>; post-hoc test, Cycle â1 vs Cycle 0, W(2) = 8.8, p = 0.01; Cycle 0 vs. Cycle 1, W(2)=8.2, p=0.02).

<p>Furthermore, we investigated how the slow gamma phase precession occurred in theta sequences developed with experience. We detected theta sequences during slow gamma episodes and measured the distribution of phase shifts across gamma cycles within single unites. In the theta sequences during slow gamma episodes, we observed the slow gamma phase precession from single unit, that the place cell spikes occurred at earlier slow gamma phases in later slow gamma cycles (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). To quantify the slow gamma phase precession at single unit level, we calculated the phase shift as the phase difference within spike pairs from adjacent active slow gamma cycles (See Methods). We found that slow gamma phase difference was significantly lower than 0 between 2 active slow gamma cycles (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, t-test, t(11)=-8.8, p=2.6Ã10<sup>-6</sup>, Cohenâs D=5.3), as well as among 3 or â¥4 active slow gamma cycles for strict limitation of theta sequences modulated by slow gamma (3 active cycles, t(11)=-7.3, p=1.5Ã10<sup>-5</sup>, Cohenâs D=4.4; â¥4 active cycles, t(8)=-3.6, p=0.007, Cohenâs D=2.5). Furthermore, we averaged the slow gamma phase differences across different cells within a theta sequence and compare their distribution along with learning trials. In the first lap, we found that the slow gamma phase differences were not significantly different from their surrogate data (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, median of phase difference from lap1 was in 95% confidence intervals of those from shuffled data, p=0.3). However, the distribution of slow gamma phase difference was negatively biased compared with their surrogate data (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, median of phase difference from lap2-5 was beyond the 95% confidence intervals of those from shuffled data; lap2 p=0.001, lap3 p=0.001, lap4 p=0.002, lap5 p=0.002). These results can also be replicated by averaging the slow gamma phase differences from a single unit across succussive theta sequences (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, lap1 p=0.1, lap2 p=0.001, lap3 p=0.001, lap4 p=0.002, lap5 p=0.01).</p>

<p>These findings raised a question of whether the development of slow gamma phase presession existed for both FG-cells and NFG-cells. To address this question, we quantified the distribution of slow gamma phase difference in FG-cells and NFG-cells respectively. We found that the slow gamma phase difference of FG-cells consistently exhibited a stable phase precession across trials, independent with learning experience (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>, lap1 p=0.007, lap2 p=0.006, lap3 p=0.007, lap4 p=0.002, lap5 p=0.02). In contrast, the slow gamma phase precession of NFG-cells was experience-dependent, with negative biased distribution of phase difference occurring from Lap2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>, lap1 p=0.9, lap2 p=0.01, lap3 p=0.001, lap4 p=0.009, lap5 p=0.1). These results suggest that FG-cells and NFG-cells have different dynamic modulated by slow gamma rhythms during exploration experience. The slow gamma modulation of FG-cells may occur earlier than that of NFG-cells, thereby driving the location information to be coded within theta cycles in a highly temporospatially compressed way.</p>

<title>FG-cells and NFG-cells exhibited different dynamics of slow gamma modulation along with theta sequence development</title>
<p>Finally, we wondered if there was correlation between slow gamma phase precession and the development of theta sequence structure, and how the FG-cells and NFG-cells coordinated during this process. Within each theta sequence, we measured its weighted correlation of the sequence structure, and plot it as a function of slow gamma phase difference across slow gamma cycles. Interestingly, we found most data were distributed in the Quadrant1 (Q1) compared to the shuffled data distributed at the center (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A-B</xref>). The theta sequences with negative slow gamma phase difference and positive weighted correlation were significantly dominant (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>, the probability of observed data from lap1 exceeded 95% confidence intervals of those from shuffled data, p=0.001).

<p>We further investigated the contribution of FG-cells and NFG-cells to the slow gamma modulated theta sequence development during different exploring phases. FG-cell-dominant theta sequence (FG-cell sequence) was defined as the theta sequence with at least one FG-cell fired. And NFG-cell-dominant theta sequence (NFG-cell sequence) was defined as the theta sequence with no FG-cell fired.</p>
<p>Importantly, the distribution of FG-cell sequences was significantly biased to Q1 than that of the shuffled data, not only in late development when the theta sequences have been developed, but also in early development (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D-F</xref>, early development, p=0.001; late development, p=0.004). However, for NFG-cell sequences, their distribution was significantly biased to Q1 than that of the shuffled data only in late development (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G-I</xref> bottom, p=0.046), but not in early development (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G-I</xref> top, p=0.08). Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that FG-cells and NFG-cells may exhibit different dynamical characteristics in gamma modulation, thus their coordination may contribute to the development of theta sequences. FG-cells were consistently modulated by slow gamma phase precession, which would be precondition for theta sequence development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In current study, we employed a circular track exploration task to investigate the different roles of fast and slow gamma rhythms in the coordination of neurons during the experience-dependent development of theta sequences. We first found that a subgroup of place cells (FG-cells) that were phase-locked to fast gamma played a crucial role in the development of theta sequences. By excluding a sufficiently high proportion of FG-cells, the sweep-ahead structure of theta sequences was significantly disturbed compared to that of excluding equivalent number of NFG-cells. These FG-cells exhibited slow gamma phase precession within single theta cycles throughout the developing process of theta sequences. Finally, we showed positive correlation between the intensity of slow gamma phase precession and development of the sweep-ahead structure of theta sequences.</p>
<p>Fast gamma episodes were detected with dominantly high probability as initial exploration of each day and decreased probability as being familiar to the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bieri et al., 2014</xref>). This could be related to the feedforward communication from upstream to downstream regions by using fast gamma frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Vinck et al., 2023</xref>). Although the information propagation of visual stimulation was unlikely synchronized between visual cortex and hippocampal CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schneider, Tzanou, Uran, &amp; Vinck, 2023</xref>), the MEC inputs could also be entrained by fast gamma to process ongoing sensory information to the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buzsaki &amp; Schomburg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the fast gamma phase-locked ensemble may act as a receiver of novel information that organized its intrinsic individual neurons in a time-compressed and spatially-ordered sequence to integrate the information under the mesoscopic cellular substrate modulated by fast gamma rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2023</xref>). These neurons exhibited similar firing characteristics as those of fast gamma non-phase-locked neurons, however, they showed higher probability presenting theta phase precession. Therefore, this fast gamma phase-locked ensemble likely has overlapping with âbimodal cellsâ involved in the formation of theta sequence structure including reverse and forward windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chu et al., 2023</xref>; M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In this case, regardless of these neurons, the sweep-ahead structure of theta sequences could not be developed with learning, with the extent of structure impairment positively correlated with the proportion of excluded fast gamma phase-locked neurons.</p>
<p>We noted that a relative low proportion of gamma phase-locked cells, particularly slow gamma phase locked cells, was detected in this study. A potential reason would be that the local LFP was chosen as a reference for estimating the phase-locking, not a reference from specific stratum lacunosum-moleculare or stratum radialis which exhibited stronger gamma episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Belluscio, Mizuseki, Schmidt, Kempter, &amp; BuzsÃ¡ki, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>). This may also cause spike leakage to constraint dominant fast gamma phase locking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Csicsvari, Jamieson, Wise, &amp; BuzsÃ¡ki, 2003</xref>). However, this would little affect the main conclusion because FG-cells were also detected by using LFP from a different tetrode, i.e. the central one of the bundle that located in the cell body layer, and found approximate proportion of FG-cells (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, rats were freely moving in a relatively familiar environment, and were not required to perform in a complex spatial memory task in a novel context which may lead to reduced proportion of gamma-modulated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kitanishi et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, our recordings were almost exclusively conducted from the deep CA1 layer where FG-cells were obtained, consistent with the dominant â¼50-100 Hz gamma power driven by entorhinal cortex layer III (EC3) inputs to stratum lacunosum-moleculare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>). The contribution of FG-cells in theta sequences likely reflects intrinsic EC3-CA1 circuit properties in spatial coding.</p>
<p>Theta phase precession has long been recognized as the only cause of forming the dominant theta sequence structure. The current findings offered some possible additional insights to this point. Our finding that FG-cells displayed stronger theta phase precession than NFG-cells was consistent with previous finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Guardamagna et al., 2023</xref>), that the theta phase precession pattern emerged with strong fast gamma. Since slow gamma phase precession occurred within theta cycles, it is hard to consider the contribution of these factors to theta sequences development, without taking theta phase precession into account. But one should be noted that the theta sequences could not be developed even if theta phase precession existed from the very beginning of the exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that theta phase precession, together with other factors, impact theta sequence development. But the weight of these factors and their interactions during memory and learning remain important aspects of further investigation.</p>
<p>The important role of fast gamma in modulating theta sequence development was also supported by a specific perturbation experiment. Liu and colleagues optogenetically entrained the MEC GABAergic cells at an artificial gamma frequency (53Hz) and observed the loss of phase precession patterns in CA1 place cells, and thereby the disrupted development of theta sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu, Todorova, Tang, Oliva, &amp; Fernandez-Ruiz, 2023</xref>). The failure of sequential firing organization during behaviors impaired the formation of a predictive map related to the highly time-compressed awake replay sequences executing information storage. Fast gamma was also found diminished between MEC and CA1 in transgenic model mice of Alzheimerâs Disease, linked with spatial memory impairment in AD as a circuit mechanism(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jun et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, our previous study showed that fast gamma-dominated theta sequences represented shorter trajectories with relative less spatial information within a theta cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). This is indeed not contradictory with the current results, as we found that slow gamma, related to information compression, was also required to modulate fast gamma phase-locked cells during sequence development. We replicated the results of slow gamma phase precession at ensemble level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), and furthermore observed it at late development, but not early development, of theta sequences. Thus, a scenario could be drawn out that the network modulator was transitioned from fast gamma to slow gamma throughout the sequence development with learning.</p>
<p>At single neuron level, we also observed that spikes of an individual place cell occurred at precessed slow gamma phases across consecutive slow gamma cycles under the time-scale of a theta window. At a finer scale within a theta cycle, slow gamma cycles coordinated place cells in a âmini-sequenceâ way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), in order to integrate information of long spatial trajectory related to the memory retrieval and predictive behaviors. This negatively-biased phase difference distribution appeared from lap2, when the sweep-ahead structures of theta sequences havenât been fully developed, suggesting that slow gamma phase precession of place cells contributed to the information compression required to the theta sequence development. More interestingly, we found that slow gamma phase precession of a subset of neurons was absent at initial exploration when the theta phase precession has already displayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng et al., 2015</xref>). This finding was in line with a previous study showing that silencing of CA3 output didnât affect theta phase precession of a single cell, but impaired theta sequence structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Middleton &amp; McHugh, 2016</xref>). A possibility was that recruitment of PV-interneurons during the CA3-driven descending phase of the theta cycle, associated with the induction of slow gamma oscillations in CA1, was found reduced in the absence of CA3 input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Topolnik &amp; Tamboli, 2022</xref>). We also provided additional evidence about the relationship between slow gamma phase precession and theta sequence formation, that the more negative slow gamma phase difference across cycles, the more sweep-ahead structure represented at late development of theta sequences.</p>
<p>Our results supported such a possible model of gamma modulation to mediate theta sequence development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The theta sequences were linked to a balance between fast and slow gamma modulations, especially in FG-cells, which displayed both fast gamma phase-locking and slow gamma phase precession. As shown in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), slow gamma phase precession supported spatial information retrieval in a temporally compressed format. Thus, we expected slow gamma precession in all cells during later laps when spatial information retrieval occurs. However, during early laps, when novel information was being encoded, only FG-cells exhibited slow gamma precession. This may suggest that FG-cells help manage the balance between encoding and retrieval through different phase-coding mechanisms: fast gamma for real-time encoding and slow gamma for retrieval. This dual-modulation in FG-cells may be crucial for the development of theta sequences, allowing them to include both FG and NFG cells in a well-sweep-ahead pattern during later laps.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the subset of neurons (FG-cells) was modulated by both fast gamma and slow gamma rhythms during the theta sequence development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), which was consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">LasztÃ³czi &amp; Klausberger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sharif, Tayebi, Buzsaki, Royer, &amp; Fernandez-Ruiz, 2021</xref>). These cells are seemingly challenging the above framework. However, these place cells, associated with both memory encoding and retrieval, seem to function like memory engram-like representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Goode, Tanaka, Sahay, &amp; McHugh, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Josselyn &amp; Tonegawa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lamothe-Molina et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pettit, Yap, Greenberg, &amp; Harvey, 2022</xref>). Indeed, the proportion of c-Fos positive place cells (putative engram cells) had higher proportion being phase-locked to fast gamma than the c-Fos negative place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). Another possibility was that these FG-cells were largely overlapped with the previously defined âfast-firing neuronsâ, which remained stable during learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grosmark &amp; BuzsÃ¡ki, 2016</xref>). In contrast, the NFG-cells exhibited experience-dependent phase coding, that they likely contributed to the path representation at the late learning process. Thus, further studies would be needed to investigate how memory engram cells contribute to theta sequence development and facilitate spatial memory and navigation.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Four male Long-Evans rats weighing 500 to 700g (â¼6-12 months old) were used in this study. Rats were housed in custom-made acrylic cages (40cmÃ40cmÃ40cm) on a reverse light cycle (Light: 8:00pm-8:00am). All waking behavior recordings were performed during the dark phase of the cycle (i.e., from 8:00am-8:00pm). Rats were handled prior to recording drive implantation surgery. Rats recovered from surgery for at least one week before behavioral training resumed. Behavioral training was initiated after at least one week of recovery from implantation surgery. Rats were physically deprived during experimental data collection so that their body weight was maintained at â¼90% of their free-feeding body weight. All experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Tianjin University.</p>

<title>Surgery and tetrode implanting</title>
<p>Multi-tetrode drives containing 21 independently moveable tetrodes (18 recording tetrodes and 3 reference tetrodes) were implanted into the hippocampal dorsal CA1 region (anterior-posterior [AP] â3.5 mm, medial-lateral [ML] 3.0mm, dorsal-ventral [DV] 1mm on day of implantation). Bone screws were placed in the skull, and the screws along with the base of the drive were covered with dental cement to affix the drive to the skull. Two screws above the cerebellum in the skull were connected to the recording drive ground. Before surgery, tetrodes were built from 17Î¼m polyimide-coated platinum-iridium (10/90%) wire (California Fine Wire, Grover Beach, California). The tips of tetrodes designated for single-unit recording were plated with platinum to reduce single-channel impedances under 300 kOhms. Tetrodes were gradually lowered to their target locations. Recording tetrodes were targeted to the dCA1 stratum pyramidale. One reference tetrode from each region was designated as the reference for differential recording and remained in a quiet area of the cortex throughout the experiments. This reference tetrode was moved up and down until a quiet location was found and was continuously recorded against ground to ensure that it remained quiet throughout data collection. The other reference tetrode in the dHPC was placed in the dCA1 apical dendritic layer to monitor and record local field potentials (LFPs) in the hippocampus during placement of the other tetrodes and to later obtain simultaneous recordings from a dendritic layer.</p>

<title>Data acquisition</title>
<p>Data were acquired using a Digital Lynx system and Cheetah recording software (Neuralynx, Bozeman, Montana). LFPs from one channel within each tetrode were continuously recorded in the 0.1-500 Hz band at a 2,000 Hz sampling rate. Input amplitude ranges were adjusted before each recording session to optimize resolution and prevent signal saturation. Input ranges for LFPs were typically within the range of Â±2,000 Î¼V to 3000Î¼V. To detect unit activity, signals from each channel in a tetrode were bandpass filtered from 600 to 6,000 Hz. The spike was detected when the signal on one or more of the channels exceeded a threshold set at 55 Î¼V. Detected events were acquired with a 32,000 Hz sampling rate. Signals were recorded differentially against a dedicated reference channel (see ââSurgery and recording drive implantationââ section above). The video was recorded through the Neuralynx system with a resolution of 720 Ã 480 pixels and a frame rate of 25 frames per second. The animal position was tracked via a red light-emitting-diode (LED) on one of the three HS-27-Mini-LED headstages (Neuralynx, Bozeman, Montana) attached to the hyperdrive.</p>

<title>Spike sorting and turning curve analysis</title>
<p>Detected spikes that occurred during trials were manually sorted using graphical cluster-cutting software (MClust; A.D. Redish, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis). Clusters of spikes were sorted using two-dimensional projections of three different features of spike waveforms (i.e., energies, peaks, and peak-to-valley differences) from four channels. Individual cells were identified as putative excitatory neurons that they had pyramidal cell-like waveform shape, at least 1ms refractory period, and their clusters were perfectly separated with other clusters or noise in at least three projections. Units with mean firing rates that were higher than 15 Hz were identified as putative fast-spiking interneurons and were excluded.</p>
<p>The turning curve of each unit was built at 90 angle bins (approximately 3.5cm per bin) on the circular track by using spikes during locomotion (running speed &gt;5 cm/s, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The field size of the main place field was defined as the size of contiguous position bins with a firing rate &gt; 10% of the peak firing rate. Only units with peak firing rates over 1 Hz and main field size over 3 angle bins (approximately 10.5cm) during trials were defined as putative neurons with spatial representation.

<title>Detection of gamma episodes</title>
<p>LFP signals from each tetrode were band-pass filtered for slow gamma (25-45Hz) and fast gamma (65-100Hz) rhythms.

To detect slow and fast gamma episodes, we z-scored the time varying power for slow and fast gamma across time within each trial. The timestamp of z-scored time varying power â¥ 3 was set as the center of a slow or fast gamma episode, and a 160ms window around this center was defined as a gamma episode. For the windows with overlapping time bins, the one with the lower gamma amplitude was discarded. Also, the slow (or fast) gamma episode with z-scored fast (or slow) gamma power â¥ 3 was removed, ensuring that fast and slow gamma episodes are mutually exclusive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>).</p>

Each spike time was matched to the closest LFP time stamp to determine its corresponding slow and fast gamma phase, and the slow and fast gamma phase distribution was established for each cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Mean vector length was quantified based on the slow and fast gamma phase distributions. Significant phase-locking to either slow or fast gamma was detected by Rayleigh test on phase distributions with at least 10 spikes in each lap. Because of a relatively high proportion of significant fast gamma phase-locked cells, we focused on these cells in this study and defined them as FG-cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Meanwhile, NFG-cells were defined as place cells which were not significantly phase-locked to fast gamma with at least 10 spikes in each lap. In addition, regarding the contribution of spike leakage to the local LFPs, we also selected an individual tetrode which located at stratum pyramidale and at the center of the drive bundle for each rat.

For each trial, a memoryless Bayesian decoder was built at 90 angle bins (ranging from 0 to 2pi) by using spikes during locomotion (running speed &gt;5 cm/s) in this trial. Decoding was performed using a 20ms sliding time window with 5ms stepping.

<title>Theta sequences detection</title>
<p>Theta rhythms were detected from a central tetrode of all recording tetrodes which located in the stratum pyramidale of hippocampus. We cut sequences at each theta phases (0Â°, 10Â°, 20Â°, â¦, 350Â°) and quantified averaged weighted correlation corresponding to these 36 possible phases (see âWeighted correlation of theta sequencesâ below). Then, the optimal cutting phase of the theta cycle was determined when the weighted correlation of theta sequences was maximal, whereby the sequences were separated within each theta cycle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Raw theta sequences were detected by the following criteria: (1) during the sequence, the animal was running between the starting point and ending point of the track, with running speed higher than 5 cm/s; (2) the duration of the sequence ranged from 100 to 200 ms; (3) more than 3 place cells which emitted at least 5 spikes within each sequence. In order to investigate the role of FG and NFG cells in theta sequence development, we decoded sequences without either FG or NFG cells and cut out the sequences using the same theta cycles as above, defined as âexFG-sequencesâ and âexNFG sequencesâ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>

A negative slow gamma phase difference value indicates phase precession, while a positive value indicates phase procession.</p>
<p>In order to test if the negatively biased distribution was robust for slow gamma phase precession, we generated surrogate data and compared their distribution with the real data. A random slow gamma phase within the same cycle was assigned to each spike to keep its firing location constancy, and the distribution of slow gamma phase difference was obtained for this mock data. This procedure was repeated 1000 times to get 1000 distributions and the 95% confident interval of their median (black lines in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-E</xref>). In the analysis, we calculated one-sided, corrected empirical p-values [(r+1)/(n+1)] by comparing real data to its corresponding shuffle data. Where r is the number values from the shuffled distribution that are either smaller or larger (depending on the hypothesis) than the observed value and n=1000 is the number of shuffling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-E</xref>).</p>

<title>Correlation between slow gamma phase precession and weighted correlation</title>
<p>FG-cell sequences and NFG-cell sequences were included in this analysis (see âTheta sequences detectionâ section). For each type of sequences, a scatter plot was made to visualize the relationship between slow gamma phase precession and theta sequence structure, with slow gamma phase shift of each sequence on x-axis and its weighted correlation on y-axis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A,D</xref>,G). Meanwhile, a 2-dimensional histogram was measured to show the distribution of sequences in four quadrants (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B,E</xref>,H). We summed up the probability in Quadrant 1 (Q1) and compared it with that of the mock data generated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. The statistical significance was determined by calculating the one-sided, corrected empirical p-value, with lower p-value indicating significantly higher probability in Q1 of real data than that of the mock data (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C,F</xref>,I).</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>At the end of the experiment, histological sections were prepared as follows to verify the tetrodes position. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with a lethal dose of urethane solution. The heart was subsequently perfused with phosphate buffer and formalin to fix the brain tissue. Rat brains were then cut into 30-Î¼m coronal sections and Nissl Staining was performed to determine the location of tetrode in CA1.</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM), custom Matlab (the Math Work) and R scripts. Paired t-test was performed to compare weighted correlation for exFG-sequences and exNFG-sequences during early and late development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Studentâs t test was performed to compare the mean firing rate, spike counts, place fields size and spatial information for the FG-cell and NFG-cell (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-G</xref>). One-sample t test was used to test whether the slow gamma phase shift was significantly lower than 0 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to test the MVL for FGâ and NFG-cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), weighted correlation of theta sequences (, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E,G</xref>), and running speed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>) across laps. Generalized linear mixed model was performed to compare weighted correlation among the Raw-, exFG-, and exNFG-sequence. Chi-squared test was performed to compare the proportion of neurons had significant theta phase precession in FG-cells and NFG-cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 3). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to test the distribution of place field COM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) on the track using the Matlab function âkstest2â. Watson-Williams multi-sample test (circular one-way ANOVA test) was performed to test the for differences in head directions across laps (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1) using the âcirc_wwtestâ function from the CircStat Toolbox. Multi-sample Mardia-Watson-Wheeler test was performed to test the slow gamma phase shift of place cells across successive slow gamma cycles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) using the R âcircular-packageâ.</p>

<p>Using electrophysiological recordings in freely moving rats, this <bold>valuable</bold> study investigates the role of gamma oscillations in the development of spatial representations in the hippocampus. Specifically, <bold>solid</bold> evidence supports the claim that distinct gamma oscillatory inputs contribute to the emergence of 'theta sequences', which encode the animal's ongoing trajectory. This study will be of interest to neuroscientists working in the fields of spatial navigation and neuronal dynamics.</p>

<p>This manuscript addresses an important question which has not yet been solved in the field, what is the contribution of different gamma oscillatory inputs to the development of &quot;theta sequences&quot; in the hippocampal CA1 region. Theta sequences have received much attention due to their proposed roles in encoding short-term behavioral predictions, mediating synaptic plasticity, and guiding flexible decision-making. Gamma oscillations in CA1 offer a readout of different inputs to this region and have been proposed to synchronize neuronal assemblies and modulate spike timing and temporal coding. However, the interactions between these two important phenomena have not been sufficiently investigated. The authors conducted place cell and local field potential (LFP) recordings in the CA1 region of rats running on a circular track. They then analyzed the phase locking of place cell spikes to slow and fast gamma rhythms, the evolution of theta sequences during behavior and the interaction between these two phenomena. They found that place cell with the strongest modulation by fast gamma oscillations were the most important contributors to the early development of theta sequences and that they also displayed a faster form of phase precession within slow gamma cycles nested with theta.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>Several important shortcomings were noted in the original manuscript. These have been addressed in this revised version with the addition of multiple new analysis, controls and clarifications. The revised manuscript has been significantly improved and its conclusions are adequately supported by the results presented.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This study presents evidence that a special group of place cells, those tuned to fast-gamma oscillations, play a key role in theta sequence development. How theta sequences are formed and developed during experience is an important question, because these sequences have been implicated in several cognitive functions of place cells, including memory-guided spatial navigation. The revised version of this paper has been significantly improved. Major concerns in the previous round of review on technical and conceptual aspects of the relationship between gamma oscillations and theta sequences are addressed. The main conclusion is supported by the data presented.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors have conducted new analysis to address the issues I and the other reviewers raised in our original revision. As a result, the revised manuscript has been substantially improved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the two reviewers for their positive comments.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>There are, however, still a few remaining issues that need further clarification.</p>
<p>- Despite the authors explanation and comparison with Kitanishi et al., 2015, Neuron, I still find that the reduced number of significantly gamma phase-locked cells is at odds with most previous reports (e.g., Csicvari et al., 2003; Colgin et al., 2009; Belluscio et al., 2012; Schomburg et al., 2014; Cabral et al., 2014; Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2017; Lopes dos Santos et al., 2018). There can be several issues to explain this difference, like the choice of LFP reference channel. The authors should at least acknowledge this difference in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.  We discussed the potential reasons causing the different proportion of gamma phase locked cells in the Discussion (lines367-380).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The new Figure R2 is very useful and should be included in the manuscript. It would be even better to expand the frequency range to higher frequencies to show where the maximum peak is. Still, the potential contribution of spike leakage should be acknowledged. While I agree that it will not account for all fast gamma spike modulation, it is certainly a contributing factor. A further evidence of this is that the coupling strength seems to keep increasing towards supra gamma frequency range in Fig R2. This is to be expected given that the authors have used the local LFP from the same tetrode where cells were recorded, which is never a good practice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Now the Fig R2 has been moved to the manuscript as a part of Figure 2-figure supplement 2 (lines133-135). In terms of the contribution of spike leakage by using the local LFP, we also detected FG-cells by using LFP from a different tetrode, i.e. the central one of the bundle that located in the cell body layer, and found approximate proportion of FG-cells which phase locked to ~75Hz (Fig R3, now the Figure 2-figure supplement 2C-F). Thus, we think using the local LFP would not affect the main conclusion and we decide to keep the original results. We also acknowledged the potential contribution of spike leakage in the Discussion (lines 372-377).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- From the authors answer I understand that recordings were almost exclusively conducted from the deep CA1 pyramidal layer. This would preclude any meaningful interpretation of the deep/ superficial differences in the distribution of FG and NFG cells. This is not a crucial point for the paper but needs to be acknowledged.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.  We acknowledged the meaningful interpretation of the deep/ superficial differences in the distribution of FG- and NFG-cells in the Discussion (lines 380-386).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- I am afraid that the authors interpreted my comment about authorship in the opposite way that I intended. I meant that the usual practice is that the last author of the manuscript is the person who has been the main intellectual driver of the work, not the most senior one necessarily. I guess that is Dr. Zheng not Dr. Ming. However, I leave this decision to the discretion of the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this rigorous consideration.  Dr. Ming and Dr. Zheng were both the main intellectual drivers of this work.  Therefore, we decide to keep the current authors in the manuscript.</p>
