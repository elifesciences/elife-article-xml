<title>Abstract</title><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by external mechanical forces is a major health burden worldwide, but the underlying mechanism in glia remains largely unclear. We report herein that <italic>Drosophila</italic> adults exhibit a defective blood-brain-barrier (BBB), elevated innate immune responses, and hypertrophy of astrocytes upon consecutive strikes with a high-impact trauma device. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of these astrocytes revealed upregulated expression of genes encoding PDGF and VEGF receptor-related (Pvr, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)), adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1, a transcription factor complex of the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway) composed of Jun-related antigen (Jra) and kayak (kay), and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Mmp1) following TBI. Interestingly, Pvr is both required and sufficient for AP-1 and Mmp1 upregulation, while knockdown of AP-1 expression in the background of Pvr overexpression in astrocytes rescued Mmp1 upregulation upon TBI, indicating that Pvr acts as the upstream receptor for the downstream AP-1–Mmp1 transduction. Moreover, dynamin-associated endocytosis was found to be an important regulatory step in downregulating Pvr signaling. Our results identify a new Pvr–AP-1–Mmp1 signaling pathway in astrocytes in response to TBI, providing potential targets for developing new therapeutic strategies of TBI.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes for adult disability due to limited neurological recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Joy et al., 2019</xref>). About 43% of people discharged after hospitalization for acute TBI develop long-term locomotor disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). TBI triggers primary neural injuries via rapid physical forces that damage axons, glia and blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chodobski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Daneshvar et al., 2015</xref>), followed by diverse secondary damage such as Wallerian axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Büki and Povlishock, 2006</xref>) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chodobski et al., 2011</xref>) in the central nervous system (CNS). The outcome of TBI is affected by various factors including age and diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Byrns et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Katzenberger et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, glial cells are critical mediators in response to TBI in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mira et al., 2021</xref>). During TBI, astrocytes become active, a process characterized by swelling, scar tissue formation, and engulfment of neuronal debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liddelow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010</xref>), while microglia rapidly transform to their active state to phagocytose cell debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Davalos et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is an ideal model organism for discovering new gene networks and investigating the molecular and cellular responses to CNS injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ayaz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bier, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hoopfer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> astrocyte-like glia (henceforth astrocytes), the conserved counterparts for mammalian astrocytes, and ensheathing glia (ENG) constitute the major glial subclasses in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Stork et al., 2014</xref>). A previous study revealed that <italic>Drosophila</italic> ENG perform the phagocytic function by the engulfment receptor Draper which interacts with downstream signaling components, including ced-6, Shark, Src42a, c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), and Mmp1 in the glial engulfment process in response to axotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Awasaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Doherty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Purice et al., 2017</xref>). Although ENG function upon axotomy has been well characterized, the response of other types of glia such as astrocytes to neural injury remains unclear.</p>
<p>In mammals, signaling by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) directs cell migration, alters cell shape, and plays a role in wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hoch and Soriano, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sil et al., 2018</xref>). Meanwhile, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling is critical for cell proliferation and survival, and vascular endothelial cell mitogenesis and permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Apte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sakurai et al., 2005</xref>). Pvr, short for PDGF- and VEGF receptor-related, is the sole <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of the PDGF and VEGF receptor families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cho et al., 2002</xref>). Pvr interacts with different signaling molecules in a context-dependent manner. For example, Pvr regulates thorax closure during metamorphosis via the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ishimaru et al., 2004</xref>), but the Pvr-mediated wound-induced epidermal cell migration does not depend on JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). The JNK Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) signaling pathway is involved in different cellular processes, including cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Pastor-Pareja et al., 2004</xref>), organ size control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Willsey et al., 2016</xref>), and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Moreno et al., 2002</xref>). The JNK effector AP-1 complex, composed of heterodimeric Jun/Jun-related antigen (Jra) and Fos/kayak (kay), promotes transcription of genes including matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Mmp1) that functions in tissue remodeling, regulation of inflammatory processes, and metastasis of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Egeblad and Werb, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Page-McCaw et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Parks et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have implicated a role for ensheathing glia, Draper pathway, and the innate immune pathway in response to TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Purice et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>). However, whether astrocytes also play a role in TBI response remains elusive. Herein, using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> TBI model induced with a high-impact trauma (HIT) device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>), we found that TBI caused multiple defects including upregulated expression of innate immune genes and astrocyte hypertrophy. To uncover the molecular pathways activated by TBI, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of astrocytes sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to profile TBI-induced genes. Interestingly, we showed that the expression of Pvr, AP-1, and Mmp1 was upregulated following TBI. Knockdown of Pvr or AP-1 expression in astrocytes rescued TBI-induced Mmp1 upregulation, while Pvr overexpression promoted Mmp1 expression via AP-1 upon TBI. Our findings identify a new Pvr–AP-1–Mmp1 signaling pathway that acts predominantly in astrocytes in response to TBI, and shed light on the mechanisms of astrocyte responses following TBI.</p>

<title>Dye penetration assay</title>
<p>Dye penetration experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bainton et al., 2005</xref>). 10 kD Texas red-conjugated dextran (Molecular Probes) at 2.5 mM was injected into the soft tissue between two abdominal segments of the exoskeleton of flies with and without TBI. Flies were allowed to recover in fresh food tubes and photographed 2 h later on a Zeiss microscope to detect the integrity of brain-eye barrier (BEB). To detect the integrity of BBB, fly brains were dissected at 2 h after injection and examined under an Olympus FluoView FV1000 microscope.</p>

<title>MARCM analysis</title>
<p>Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) analysis in astrocytes was carried out largely following previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>). Specifically, newly laid eggs were collected for a 4–5 h interval and cultured at 18°C. Clones were induced by heat shock at 24 h after larval hatching in a 37°C water bath for 15 min and flies were raised at 25°C after heat shock until immunohistochemistry analysis of adult brain.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry analysis and confocal microscopy</title>
<p>Brain tissues were dissected out from adult after specific treatments. Fixation and staining of adult brains were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jia et al., 2019</xref>). Brains were mounted on slides in Vectashield mounting media (Vector Labs). Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: chicken anti-GFP (ab13970, Abcam) at 1:1000, mouse anti-Repo (8D12, DSHB) at 1:100, mouse anti-Elav (9F8A9, DSHB) at 1:100, mouse anti-Mmp1 (3A6B4, 3B8D12, and 5H7B11, DSHB) each at 1:20 for all three antibodies, rabbit anti-Pvr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">McDonald et al., 2003</xref>) at 1:1000, rabbit anti-Dcp-1 (Asp216, Cell Signaling Technology (CST)) at 1:100, rabbit anti-pH3 (06-570, Millipore) at 1:1000, and mouse anti-β-gal (40-1a, DSHB) at 1:100. All secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 568 or 633 labeled; Molecular Probes) were used at a dilution of 1:1000. The nuclei dye To-Pro-3 Iodide (T3605, ThermoFisher) was also used at a dilution of 1:1000. The cell-permeant Mitotracker (M22426, ThermoFisher) was used at a concentration of 100 nM. For soma diameter analysis, we measured the average of long and short axes of astrocytes. All images were collected using an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope and processed with ImageJ. Serial images of 25–30 μm (one image per 1 μm slice) were projected for presentation and statistical analysis.</p>

<title>Astrocyte preparation for RNA-seq analysis</title>
<p>Flies were collected at 3 days after eclosion and treated with TBI. Brains from adult flies (<italic>R86E01-Gal4</italic>/<italic>UAS-Redstinger</italic>) with no injury, 4 h after injury and 24 h after injury were dissected out in freshly prepared adult hemolymph saline (AHS) buffer, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, a total of ∼50 brains for each group was immediately transferred to an Eppendorf tube (1.5 mL) containing 200 µL AHS with Pronase (1 mg/mL; P5147, SigmaAldrich) and Dispase (1 mg/mL; LS02104, Worthington Biochemical Corporation). After tissue digestion for 30 min at 25°C, the enzyme medium was removed, followed by two brief, gentle washes with fresh AHS containing 2% PBS. Brain samples were then triturated by gently pipetting in 1 mL AHS through four fire-polished Pasteur pipettes with descending pore sizes (400 μm, 300 μm, 200 μm, and 100 μm) for a total of ∼20 min. Next, the dissociated cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 100 × <italic>g</italic> and the AHS was replaced with the same buffer to minimize any RNA content released from damaged cells during the trituration process. Finally, dissociated tissues were filtered through 45 μm filter and then put on ice. FACS sorting was performed according to the following gating procedure with 70 μm nozzle by BD FACS Aria: (1) an initial SSC-A/FSC-A gate to minimize debris; (2) a SSC-A/pe-Texa Ted-A gate to choose only red fluorescence positive cells. At this step, 1600 cells were sorted directly into ice-cold cell lysis buffer (oligo-dT<sub>30</sub>VN primer, ribonuclease inhibitor, dNTP mix) and stored at -80°C until all samples were ready for RNA extraction and cDNA amplification.</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>cDNA library preparation</title>
<p>A total of 5 biological replicates were collected for each condition (no injury, 4 h after injury, and 24 h after injury). Cell samples were sent to the Anoroad Company for RNA extraction. An Oligo-dT primer was introduced to the reverse transcription reaction for first-strand cDNA synthesis, followed by PCR amplification to enrich the cDNA and magbeads purification step was used to purify the products. Briefly, Smart-Seq2 method was used to amplify cDNA. Concentration and integrity of cDNA was assessed using Qubit 3.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) to ensure the cDNA length was around 1-2 kbp. After quality control, 40 ng cDNA was used to be fragmented at 350 bp by Bioruptor® Sonication System (Diagenode Inc.). To construct Illumina library, end repair, 3’ ends A-tailing, adaptor ligation, PCR amplification and library validation were performed. PerkinElmer LabChip® GX Touch and Step OnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System were used for library quality inspection. Qualified libraries were loaded on Illumina Hiseq platform for PE150 sequencing.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>RNA-seq and data analysis</title>
<p>A total of 539 million reads (average 35.9 million reads per sample) was obtained. The fastq data were first processed with Trimmomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) to remove Illumina adaptor. The remaining data was aligned against the UCSC <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome (dm6) using Hisat2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pertea et al., 2016</xref>) with the annotation file of the same version. On average, 92% of the initial reads were mapped to dm6. HTSeq was used to calculate the raw read counts of genes for each sample. DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was used to normalize the data. Transcripts were considered as significantly differentially expressed if their adjusted <italic>p</italic> values were less than 0.01 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) by the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Following normalization of the data, DESeq2 was used to perform pairwise comparisons between the control and experimental groups using parametric tests. Genes with absolute value of logarithmic fold change (log<sub>2</sub>FC) &gt; 1.0 were qualified for the final set of DEGs. Volcano plots and heatmap were constructed for visualization of the resulting expression intensity data following the identification of DEGs and RNA-Seq data normalization by the adjusted <italic>p</italic> value calculations.</p>

<sec id="s2i">
<title>Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis</title>
<p>RT-qPCR was performed largely based on previous protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Flies were treated with the same conditions as the RNA-seq experiment. RNA for antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) analysis was extracted from whole fly brains by TriZol. RNA for confirming RNA-seq findings was isolated from more than 10000 astrocytes sorted by FACS using the PicoPure RNA isolation kit (KIT0204, Life Technologies). cDNA was generated with SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (11752250, Invitrogen). For each gene, at least three pairs of qPCR primers were screened by standard curve analysis, and the best primer pairs were chosen based on their efficiency and specificity. Real-time qPCR was carried out by KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KR0389, KAPA Biosystems). Primer sequences are provided in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>.</p>

<title>TBI is induced in <italic>Drosophila</italic> adults by a high-impact trauma (HIT) device</title>
<p>To analyze how brains respond to TBI, we applied consecutive strikes to adult flies using a HIT device to induce brain injury as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Katzenberger et al., 2015</xref>). To quantify the degree of injury, we analyzed the mortality index at 24 h after TBI (MI<sub>24</sub>), defined as the percentage of dead over the total flies tested. Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>), MI<sub>24</sub> of 3-day-old adult flies was 20 ± 3.18% after 4 HIT strikes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). MI<sub>24</sub> after 6 strikes was 71.88 ± 7.44%, suggesting that increasing the number of strikes results in a higher MI<sub>24</sub> rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Given that TBI has been shown to disrupt the formation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in mammals and flies and blood-eye barrier (BEB) in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rodríguez-Baeza et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sangiorgi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Katzenberger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Saikumar et al., 2020</xref>), we examined BBB/BEB integrity 2 h after injecting tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated dextran (molecular weight = 10,000 Da) into adult fly abdominal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bainton et al., 2005</xref>). The dye crossed the barrier and penetrated the retina and brain, indicating that both BBB and BEB were disrupted after HIT strikes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>−G). The percentage of flies exhibiting dextran-permeable BBB increased as the number of strikes increased from 0 to 6, with six strikes resulting in severe BBB disruption (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) but maintaining a moderate viability providing enough samples for phenotypic analysis. Based on these results, six HIT strikes administered at 5 min intervals were applied to induce TBI throughout the present study.</p>

<p>In addition to disruption of BBB/BEB integrity, we also analyzed TBI-induced secondary damage such as local and systemic immune responses. Given that Toll and immune deficiency (Imd) are the two crucial innate immune response pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Valanne et al., 2011</xref>), and their common downstream genes encode antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that protect flies from TBI injury (Alphen et al., 2022), we analyzed the expression of AMPs in adult fly brains at different time points after TBI. As shown by the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results, expression of the AMP genes <italic>AttC</italic>, <italic>DiptB</italic> and <italic>Mtk</italic> was significantly upregulated at 1 h and reached a peak at 4 h after injury (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barekat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that HIT strikes induce TBI reflected by BBB/BEB disruption and elevated expression of innate immune response genes.</p>

<title>TBI induces neuronal but not glial apoptosis in adult fly brains</title>
<p>Given that neurons and glia have been shown to undergo cell death during both primary and secondary injury responses upon TBI in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ng and Lee, 2019</xref>), we performed immunostaining with an antibody against Death caspase-1 (Dcp-1), the homolog of human caspase-3, to detect apoptotic cells in our TBI model. Interestingly, the number of Dcp-1<sup>+</sup> puncta was significantly increased in adult fly brains at 24 h after TBI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1I</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">J</xref>), with a 2.47-fold increase compared to the number in uninjured controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>). Furthermore, we found that almost all Dcp-1<sup>+</sup> puncta were co-localized with Elav rather than Repo, suggesting that neurons but not glia are apoptotic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1L−M</xref>’’). These results suggest that, as in mammals, TBI also induces neuronal apoptosis in fruit flies.</p>
<p>In addition, we analyzed cell proliferation following TBI using an antibody against phospho-histone H3 (pH3), a marker for the M stage of the cell cycle, and fly lines expressing the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) fused with GFP (PCNA-GFP), a reporter for the G1-S transition of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Thacker et al., 2003</xref>). As a control, 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larval brains exhibited numerous GFP<sup>+</sup> and pH3<sup>+</sup> cells, suggesting that larval brain cells proliferate vigorously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figures S1A−A’’</xref>). Interestingly, essentially no GFP<sup>+</sup> or pH3<sup>+</sup> cells were detected in either uninjured or TBI-treated adult fly brains at various time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figures S1B−I</xref>). These results indicate that adult fly brain cells do not divide in response to TBI, whereas neurons and glia in adult vertebrate brains proliferate after nervous system injury, such as stab injury and TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yu and He, 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>TBI leads to astrocyte activation</title>
<p>In addition to the TBI-induced neuronal apoptosis mentioned above, glial cells also become reactive after nervous system injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>). It has been shown that ENG phagocytose neuronal debris upon axotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>), but whether astrocytes respond to TBI remains unknown. To explore the potential role of astrocytes in the TBI response, <italic>R86E01-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kremer et al., 2017</xref>), an astrocyte-specific driver, was used to express <italic>UAS-mCD8::GFP</italic> to label astrocyte plasma membrane. In uninjured fly brains, GFP intensities in the cell bodies and processes of astrocytes were widely distributed throughout the brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). While no significant change in GFP intensity was detected in brains at 4 h after TBI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), the GFP intensity was significantly increased and the cell bodies of astrocytes were significantly enlarged at 24 h after TBI in the central brain region, especially in the antennal lobes (ALs) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Of note, these results were not affected by the presence of one or two UAS transgenes as the efficiency of <italic>R86E01-GAL4</italic> in driving the expression of either was comparable as shown by the similar GFP levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A−C, I</xref>, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">J</xref>).</p>

<p>In mammals, the hallmarks of astrocyte activation are hypertrophy of astrocytes and upregulated level of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Pekny et al., 2004). Given that there’s no GFAP homolog in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>), we examined morphological changes in astrocytes at single-cell resolution following TBI by mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) on adult fly brains at 3– 4 days after eclosion. The cell bodies of these astrocytes were located at the interface between neuropil and cortex regions, or in neuropils, and their cellular processes infiltrated into neuropils (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, astrocytes in injured brains exhibited bright and distinct GFP<sup>+</sup> accumulations associated with their cellular processes at 24 h after TBI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). Quantitatively, the number of these accumulations per square nanometer in the cellular processes was significantly increased at 24 h after TBI; the increase in the number of accumulations might be responsible for the increase in GFP intensity triggered by TBI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Importantly, the diameter of astrocytes cell bodies was also increased at 24 h after injury (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Taken together, these results show that astrocytes become hypertrophic and reactive in adult brains at 24 h after TBI.</p>
<p>Axotomy induces expression of injury-related proteins such as extracellular proteases the matrix metalloprotease (MMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Purice et al., 2017</xref>).

<title>Transcriptional profiling of astrocytes in adult flies reveals elevated expression of injury-related genes upon TBI</title>
<p>To further investigate how astrocytes respond to TBI, we analyzed transcriptional changes in astrocytes by RNA-seq (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Due to the tiny soma and morphological complexity, the analysis of a purified population of glial cells has been difficult and technically challenging. We have optimized a protocol for purifying astrocytes from adult Drosophila of <italic>R86E01-Gal4</italic>&gt;<italic>UAS-Redstinger</italic> by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (see details in Materials and Methods). As FACS removes most cell masses and RFP-negative cells, the remaining RFP<sup>+</sup> cells are mostly viable, as shown by MitoTracker staining, and purity was 92.96% (RFP<sup>+</sup> and MitoTracker<sup>+</sup> cells/total cells) in uninjured brains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2 A-C</xref>’). Further analysis of the RNA-seq data showed that the astrocyte markers <italic>Eaat1</italic> (110359 reads) and <italic>alrm</italic> (186413 reads) were highly expressed, while <italic>nSyb</italic>, a neuronal marker, was hardly detected (125 reads) at 4 h after TBI, verifying the purity of FACS-sorted astrocytes. A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the variance between different groups (no injury vs. 4 h and 24 h after injury) was greater than the variance within groups (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>). From analysis on five biological replicates for each time point (no injury, 4 h, and 24 h after injury), we obtained 539 million reads (an average of 36 million reads per sample) and aligned the RNA-seq reads to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. We found that 93.67 ± 0.89% of reads mapped to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (dm6 version). Using a cutoff of ≥ 2-fold differential expression (adj. <italic>p</italic> value &lt;0.01, Benjamini-Hochberg procedure), we identified 522 and 357 genes with altered expression at 4 h (416 upregulated and 106 downregulated) and 24 h (229 upregulated and 128 downregulated) after injury, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B−D</xref>; Table S2).</p>

<p>Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of these upregulated genes revealed that a significant proportion were associated with endosomal transport, actin cytoskeleton, and wound healing (Figure S3). Furthermore, we detected upregulated expression of components functioning in the innate immune response after TBI. For instance, expression of the components Relish and Dif of the Toll and Imd pathways was upregulated in astrocytes after TBI (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), in agreement with a previous finding that Relish is necessary for TBI-induced secondary injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Swanson et al., 2020</xref>).

Subsequent RT-qPCR experiments confirmed the upregulation of all six genes tested at 4 h and/or 24 h after TBI (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), supporting the robustness of the RNA-seq analysis.

<title>Pvr and AP-1 are required for the upregulation of Mmp1 after TBI</title>
<p>Among the candidates exhibiting upregulated expression in astrocytes upon TBI, three receptors (Pvr, AdoR and Draper), all acting upstream of and activating the JNK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ishimaru et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Macdonald et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Poernbacher and Vincent, 2018</xref>), emerged as new factors with uncharacterized functions in astrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNA interference (RNAi) Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT) identified orthologs of these three receptors, subunits of transcriptional factor AP-1 (composed of Jra and kay) of the JNK pathway, Mmp1, and endocytic trafficking genes in mouse and human (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). These proteins mediate essential injury responses in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Borea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Motz and Coukos, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shi et al., 2021</xref>). To examine a potential role of the receptors and their downstream signaling components in astrocytes after TBI, we quantified the immunostaining intensity of these proteins from projected images of the whole brain (including 20-30 slices with 1 µm per slice). As our RNA-seq analysis revealed elevated expression of JNK-related injury genes such as <italic>AP-1</italic> and <italic>Mmp1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we analyzed the expression of Mmp1, a transcriptional target of AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Purice et al., 2017</xref>), as a readout for the activity of JNK signaling in response to TBI. We found that upregulated Mmp1 expression induced by TBI was potently suppressed by knocking down the expression of Pvr, Jra or kay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A−D, 4F</xref>), indicating that Mmp1 upregulation is mediated by Pvr and AP-1, and predominantly occurrs in astrocytes. We note that the location and intensity of Mmp1 signals are variable among different individuals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), probably because the brain damage caused by HIT is not stereotypical.</p>

<p>Even though flies with Draper knockdown in astrocytes exhibited high mortality, analysis of escapers indicated that Mmp1 upregulation upon TBI was not completely inhibited by Draper knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Knockdown of the other receptor AdoR in astrocytes caused a weak inhibition of AP-1 and Mmp1 upregulation (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A–A’’, S4G–H’’, S4I</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4J</xref>); <italic>TRE-dsRed</italic> that expresses the red fluorescent protein dsRed under the control of 4 × AP-1 motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chatterjee and Bohmann, 2012</xref>) was used as a reporter for AP-1 activity. As Pvr showed the strongest regulation on Mmp1 expression among the three receptors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>), we focused on the potential role of Pvr in astrocytes following TBI in the present study. We observed substantial Pvr expression predominantly in astrocytes as RNAi knockdown of Pvr in astrocytes showed greatly reduced level of Pvr in the whole brain at 24 h after TBI (Figure S5). Conversely, TBI further increased the Pvr level in brains when Pvr was overexpressed under the control of <italic>R86E01-Gal4</italic> (Figure S5). It is noteworthy to mention that although Draper expression was upregulated upon axotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>) and TBI (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), inhibiting Draper expression in astrocytes did not suppress the Mmp1 upregulation after TBI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>).

<title>Pvr positively regulates AP-1 signaling and Mmp1 expression in astrocytes after TBI</title>
<p>We next investigated the genetic pathway by which Pvr functions in astrocytes in response to TBI.

In uninjured brains, we detected low TRE-dsRed levels, suggesting a basal AP-1 activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A–A</xref>’’). Similar to Mmp1, TRE-dsRed levels were robustly upregulated at 24 h after TBI, suggesting activation of JNK/AP-1 signaling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B–B</xref>’’). Importantly, TBI-induced expression of TRE-dsRed and Mmp1 was suppressed or further upregulated when inhibiting or overexpressing Pvr expression in astrocytes, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C−F</xref>’’). Overexpression of Jra or kay alone did not affect expression of TRE-dsRed or Mmp1 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A–F’’, 5I</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5J</xref>), suggesting that overexpressing a single subunit of the AP-1 complex is not sufficient to upregulate AP-1 activity. While Pvr overexpression caused an increase in TRE-dsRed and Mmp1 expression levels, <italic>Jra</italic> or <italic>kay</italic> RNAi knockdown in the background of Pvr overexpression suppressed the increase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G–L</xref>), indicating that Jra and kay act downstream of Pvr to mediate the injury response upon TBI. These results together show that Pvr is a receptor acting upstream of AP-1 signaling that promotes Mmp1 expression during the injury response in astrocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5M</xref>).</p>

<title>Disruption of endocytosis and endocytic trafficking enhances Pvr, AP-1, and Mmp1 upregulation upon TBI</title>
<p>How was the Pvr signalling induced by TBI regulated? It has been shown that VEGFR2 endocytosis proceeds in a clathrin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Simons et al., 2016</xref>). During clathrin-dependent endocytosis, scission needs Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (Cip4) to recruit dynamin and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp), the activator of the Arp2/3 complex that mediates actin polymerization and promotes the movement of newly-formed clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brüser and Bogdan, 2017</xref>). VEGFRs are transmembrane RTKs that are activated when they locate at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Simons et al., 2016</xref>). We first investigated whether endocytosis is involved in Pvr signaling upon TBI. <italic>Shibire</italic> (<italic>shi</italic>) encodes a GTPase called dynamin which is responsible for fission of the vesicle from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">van der Bliek and Meyerowitz, 1991</xref>). We analysed the effect of endocytosis on Pvr signaling by blocking the activity of dynamin with a temperature sensitive mutant, <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic>, in astrocytes. Interestingly, both Pvr (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A, 6B</xref>, and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>) and TRE-dsRed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C, 6D</xref>, and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>) intensities were increased at 4 h after TBI when dynamin activity was blocked at the non-permissive 32°C. As a control, expression of nLacZ under the same conditions as mutated dynamin did not exhibit a significant difference in the intensities of Pvr and TRE-dsRed at the permissive 23°C and the non-permissive 32°C after TBI (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A, 6B, 6E</xref>, and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). These results suggest that Pvr signaling is facilitated when endocytosis is blocked.</p>

<p>In addition to Pvr, results from our transcription profiling analysis also revealed upregulation of the expression of actin dynamics and endocytic trafficking genes including <italic>Arpc2</italic>, <italic>cpa</italic>, and <italic>cpb</italic> following TBI (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). To explore whether endocytic trafficking genes are involved in the injury response in astrocytes, we analyzed Mmp1 and TRE-dsRed expression when inhibiting the expression of Arpc2, cpa, or cpb. Interestingly, TBI-induced Mmp1 levels were further increased after knockdown of each of the three (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A–D, 7O</xref>); consistently, TRE-dsRed expression was also increased after knockdown of <italic>cpa</italic> or <italic>cpb</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7H–K, 7P</xref>). These results indicate that genes involved in endocytosis and endocytic trafficking normally inhibit induction of AP-1 and Mmp1 by TBI in astrocytes.</p>

<p>In addition, we also observed upregulated expression of a set of endosomal sorting genes, including <italic>Stam</italic>, <italic>Chmp1</italic>, and <italic>Vps24</italic> that encode components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)in astrocytes in response to TBI (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). These genes are implicated in the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) from multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Inhibiting expression of the ESCRT-0 subunit Stam and the ESCRT-III subunits Chmp1 or Vps24 in astrocytes however did not result in a significant difference in Mmp1 or TRE-dsRed expression levels compared with controls following TBI (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E–G, 7L-N, 7O</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7P</xref>), suggesting that endosome sorting in MVB may not affect Pvr signaling activity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a previously established a <italic>Drosophila</italic> TBI model, we found that TBI causes neuronal apoptosis, BBB/BEB disruption, and astrocyte hypertrophy. Astrocytes respond to TBI by elevated Pvr expression, which in turn enhances the expression of the downstream effectors AP-1 and Mmp1. Our findings identify a new signaling pathway upregulated in astrocytes following TBI.</p>
<p>Unlike vertebrates, in which astrocytes become reactive (reactive astrogliosis) and actively clear neuronal and synaptic debris via phagocytosis upon axon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liddelow and Barres, 2017</xref>), axon transection in <italic>Drosophila</italic> shows no immediate astrocytic response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Purice et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, <italic>Drosophila</italic> ENG express key components of the phagocytic machinery and engulf neuronal debris in response to axotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we examined for the first time the molecular and cellular changes of astrocytes after TBI. Although no astrocytes-mediated phagocytosis was detected upon axotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>) and TBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6</xref>), astrocytes exhibited apparent damage response including enlarged soma (hypertrophy) and altered cellular processes containing more membrane-bound GFP<sup>+</sup> accumulations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A−J</xref>). These findings suggest that astrocytes are activated upon TBI, demonstrating a critical role for astrocytes in the injury response.</p>
<p>The innate immune response in <italic>Drosophila</italic> relies on the activation of multiple signaling pathways including NF-κB/Relish-mediated Imd and Doral/Dif-mediated Toll signaling pathways. Interestingly, our RNA-seq data revealed elevated expression of genes <italic>Relish</italic> and <italic>Dif</italic> in both pathways upon TBI (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). However, the expressions of <italic>AMPs</italic> were minimum in astrocytes before TBI and no AMPs genes were identified in differentially expressed genes. Thus, AMPs genes were not activated in astrocytes, though upregulated <italic>AMP</italic> expressions were detected by bulk RNA-seq after TBI. In addition, expression of AP-1 (composed of Jra and kay) and Mmp1 was also upregulated, indicating that the AP-1signaling pathway is activated in astrocytes following TBI. Even though upregulated Mmp expression in reactive glial responses is an evolutionarily conserved feature of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cunningham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Purice et al., 2017</xref>), transmembrane receptors on astrocytes that regulate Mmp1 expression have not been identified. In mammals, knockdown of VEGF signaling in keratinocytes reduced angiogenesis and delayed wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rossiter et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> studies of wound healing showed that Pvr likely acts upstream of actin regulatory proteins that promote actin polymerization to lead cells migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wu et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Through a combination of RNA-seq and genetic analyses, we identified Pvr as a new receptor in astrocytes; Pvr promotes Mmp1 expression via the transcription factor complex AP-1. At present, we do not know how Pvr promotes expression of AP-1 and Mmp1. But previous findings show that Pvr phosphorylates JNK to trigger the downstream signaling containing AP-1 during thorax closure in metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ishimaru et al., 2004</xref>). During development, the midline glia survival and migration are regulated by the ventral unpaired median (VUM) and the midline precursor 1 (MP1) midline neurons, the sources of Pvr ligands, i.e., PDGF- and VEGF-related factor 1-3 (Pvf1-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Learte et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, epidermal cell-derived Pvf1 may be sequestered in the blood and exposed upon injury to bind Pvr receptors on wound-edge epidermal cells and initiate the extension of cell processes into the wound gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, Pvr ligands bind to Pvr receptor to induce autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues, leading to JNK phosphorylation. Phosphorylated JNK (Bsk) then phosphorylates Jun/Jra transcription factors, triggering Jun/Jra association with Fos/kay, to form the AP-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bogoyevitch and Kobe, 2006</xref>). In addition, glial AP-1 is essential for recovery, ensuring brain integrity and animal survival in the early post-TBI period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Byrns et al., 2021</xref>). Given that Pvr and AP-1 genetically interact in astrocytes upon TBI, it is likely that Pvr acts upstream of AP-1 and regulates its activity via JNK phosphorylation following brain injury. We speculate that Pvr ligands that may secret from injured cells to activate Pvr-positive astrocytes after TBI; activated Pvr then increases Mmp1 expression via AP-1 and secretion to the intercellular space to participate in injury response.</p>
<p>In addition to Pvr, our RNA-seq data also identified other receptors potentially functioning in astrocytes in response to TBI. Specifically, AdoR expression was upregulated after TBI (Table S2), and knockdown of AdoR expression in astrocytes led to inhibition of AP-1 after TBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4G–J</xref>), though at a weaker extent compared with Pvr knockdown. In mammals, A<sub>2B</sub>R, a subtype of AdoR, was shown to stimulate VEGF production in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Borea et al., 2016</xref>). Pvr promotes the expression of adenosine deaminase-related growth factor A (Adgf-A) which inactivates extracellular adenosine, the ligand of AdoR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zurovec et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, Pvr and AdoR collaborate in differentiating cells to maintain the expression of Adgf-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Pvr and AdoR act independently or in a coordinated manner to regulate the injury response to TBI in astrocytes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>
<p>Our RNA-seq profiling also revealed upregulation of Draper. Previous studies revealed a role for Draper-mediated phagocytosis of axonal debris in ENG after axotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>); axotomy induces Wallerian-like degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Büki and Povlishock, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tang-Schomer et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) proteins released from injured neurons bind to Draper and activate the JNK and JAK/STAT pathways in ENG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Doherty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Freeman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">MacDonald et al. 2013</xref>). Here, our findings showed that Draper does not affect Mmp1 expression in astrocytes upon TBI. Although an increase in Draper expression was detected in astrocytes by RNA-seq, knockdown of its expression did not significantly suppress Mmp1 upregulation after TBI. Thus, Draper activates JNK/AP-1 and JAK/STAT signaling in ENG in response to axotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Doherty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">MacDonald et al. 2013</xref>), whereas astrocytes respond to TBI via Pvr-mediated AP-1 signaling. Despite different pathways are activated in different types of glia upon brain injury, they may cooperate in response to TBI.</p>
<p>Endocytosis and trafficking of VEGFR, the mammalian Pvr homolog, regulate the specificity as well as the duration and strength of the signaling output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Simons et al., 2016</xref>). Once activated on the plasma membrane and translocated into the cytoplasm, VEGFRs are either shuttled to lysosomes for degradation or recycled back to the plasm membrane to replenish the receptor pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Simons et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings showed that disruption of endocytosis by disrupting dynamin activity and inhibiting the expression of Arpc2, cpa, or cpb that regulate endocytic transport into early endosomes enhanced the AP-1 and Mmp1 upregulation in astrocyte following TBI (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A–D, 7H–K, 7O, 7P</xref>). As receptor endocytosis attenuates the strength or duration of many signaling processes by physically reducing the concentration of cell surface receptors accessible to the ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jékely et al., 2005</xref>), blocking dynamin-mediated endocytosis and endocytic trafficking potentially results in accumulated Pvr receptors on the plasma membrane to activate the downstream effector AP-1, thereby enhancing the astrocytes response to TBI. On the other hand, ubiquitinated RTKs are recognized by ESCRT-0, followed by sequential recruitment of ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and ESCRT-III onto the membranes of MVBs to form intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Goh and Sorkin, 2013</xref>). Knockdown of the ESCRT-0 subunit Stam and the ESCRT-III subunits Chmp1 and Vps24 did not affect the expression of Pvr downstream signaling components (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E–G, 7L–N, 7O</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7P</xref>), suggesting that Pvr signal transduction was not regulated by endosomal sorting.</p>
<p>Considering the importance of VEGF signaling in a variety of cellular processes, including wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Folkman and Klagsbrun, 1987</xref>), elucidating the downstream signaling mechanisms, as well as defining the full array of Pvr targets in healthy and diseased brains, will be critical for dissecting the protective or detrimental roles of VEGF in the context of brain injury. Given that the Pvr receptor, AP-1, and the MMP family of secreted proteases are all highly conserved across species, our work provides new insights into how VEGF signaling in glia mechanistically contributes to the TBI response in mammals.</p>

<p>Li et al report that upon traumatic brain injury (TBI), Pvr signalling in astrocytes activates the JNK pathway and up-regulates the expression of the well-known JNK target MMP1. The FACS sort astrocytes, and carry out RNAseq analysis, which identifies pvr as well as genes of the JNK pathway as particularly up-regulated after TBI. They use conventional genetics loss of function, gain of function and epistasis analysis with and without TBI to verify the involvement of the Pvr-JNK-MMP1 signalling pathway.</p>
<p>The strengths are that multiple experiments are used to demonstrate that TBI in their hands damaged the BBB, induced apoptosis and increased MMP1 levels. The RNAseq analysis on FACS sorted astrocytes is nice and will be valuable to scientists beyond the confines of this paper. The functional genetic analysis is conventional, yet sound, and supports claims of JNK and MMP1 functioning downstream of Pvr in the TBI context.</p>
<p>However, the weaknesses are that novelty and insight are both rather limited, some data are incomplete and other data do not support some claims. Some approaches used lacked resolution and some experiments lacked rigour. The authors may wish to improve some of their data as this would make their case more convincing. Alternatively, they should remove unsupported claims.</p>
<p>Novelty and insight:</p>
<p>
Others had previously published that both JNK signalling and MMP1 were activated upon injury, in multiple contexts (as well as the articles cited by the authors, they should also see Losada-Perez et al 2021). That Pvr can regulate JNK signalling was also known (Ishimaru et al 2004). And it was also known that astrocytes can respond to injury by proliferating, both in larval ventral nerve cords and adult brains (Kato et al 2011; Losada-Perez et al 2016; Harrison et al 2021; Simoes et al 2022). The authors argue that the novelty of the work is the investigation of the response of astrocytes to TBI. However, this is of somewhat limited scope. The authors mention that Mmp1 regulates tissue remodelling, the inflammatory process and cancer. Exploring these functions further would have been an interesting addition, but the authors do not investigate what consequences the up-regulation of Mmp1 after injury has in repair or regeneration processes.</p>
<p>Incomplete or unconvincing data:</p>
<p>
The authors failed to detect PCNA-GFP and pH3 in brains after TBI and conclude that that TBI does not induce astrocyte proliferation. However, this is a surprising claim, as it would be rather different from all previous prevalent observations of cell proliferation induced by injury. Cell proliferation can be notoriously difficult to detect (ie due to timing and sample size), thus instead this raises doubts on the experimental protocol or execution.</p>
<p>
Others have previously reported: cells in S- phase using PCNA-GFP and other reporters (eg BrdU, EdU, FUCCI) in the intact adult brain (Kato et al 2009; Foo et al 2017; Li et al 2020; Fernandez-Hernandez et al 2013; Simoes et al 2022); that injury to the adult brain and VNC induces cell proliferation that can be detected with cell proliferation markers like BrdU, Myc, FUCCI and the mitotic marker pH3 (Kato et al 2009; Fernandez-Hernandez et al 2013; Losada-Perez et al 2021; Simoes et al 2022); and that injury to the brain and CNS induces glial proliferation in adult and larval brains/CNS, specifically of astrocytes (Kato et al 2011; Losada-Perez et al 2016; Fernandez-Hernandez et al 2013; Simoes et al 2022). Thus, the fact that they did not observe PCNAGFP+ cells in control, intact adult brains nor after TBI could suggest that they had technical, experimental difficulties. Detecting mitotic cells with anti-pH3 is difficult because M phase is very brief, but others have succeeded (Simoes et al 2022). Given that in all previous reports mentioned above cells were seen to proliferate after injury in the CNS, it would be rather surprising if no cell proliferation occurred after TBI. Resolving this conflicting result is important, as it could imply that TBI induces very different cellular responses from various other lesions or injury types. It is conceivably not impossible, but the most parsimonious start point would be that multiple injury types could cause equivalent responses in cells. Thus, the authors ought to consider whether technical or experimental design problems affected their experimental outcome instead.</p>
<p>Other claims not supported by data:</p>
<p>
(1) astrocyte hypertrophy, as the tools used do not have the resolution to support this claim;</p>
<p>(2) localisation of anti-Pvr to specific cells, as the images show uniform signal or background instead;</p>
<p>(3) astrocytes do not engulf cell debris after TBI, as the tools and images do not have the resolution to make this claim.</p>
<p>The authors could improve these data with alternative experiments to maintain the claims; alternatively, these unsupported claims should be removed.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis:</p>
<p>
The statistical analysis needs revising as it is wrong in multiple places. Revising the statistics will also require revision of the validity of the claims and adjusting interpretations accordingly.</p>
<p>Altogether, this is an interesting and valuable addition to the repertoire of articles investigating neuron-glia communication and glial responses to injury in the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). It is good and important to see this research area in Drosophila grow. This community together is building a compelling case for using Drosophila and its unparalleled powerful genetics to investigate nervous system injury, regeneration and repair, with important implications. Thus, this paper will be of interest to scientists investigating injury responses in the CNS using Drosophila, other model organisms (eg mice, fish) and humans.</p>

<p>In this study, Li et al. examined the involvement of astrocyte-like glia in responding to traumatic brain injury in Drosophila. Using a previously-established method that induces high-impact, whole-body trauma to flies (HIT device), the authors observed increased blood-brain-barrier permeabilization, neuronal cell death, and hypertrophy of astrocyte-like cells in the fly brain following injury. The authors provide compelling evidence implicating a signaling pathway involving the PDGF/VEGF-like Pvr receptor tyrosine kinase, the AP-1 transcription factor, and the matrix metalloprotease Mmp1 in the astrocytic cell response to TBI. The authors' data was generally high-quality data and combined multiple experimental approaches (microscopy, RNA sequencing, and transgenic), increasing the rigor of the study. The identification of injury-induced gene expression changes in astrocytic cells helps increase our limited understanding of roles this glial subtype plays in the adult fly brain. Limitations of the study include a reliance on RNAi-mediated gene silencing without validation via genetic mutants and a limited examination of how astrocyte-like and ensheathing glia could interact following TBI, especially given that several genes identified in this study are known to mediate ensheathing glial responses to axotomy. The conclusions are generally well-supported by the presented data, however some further clarification of quantitative methods and analyses will help to strengthen the findings:</p>
<p>1. The significance and quantification method for the astrocytic cell body sizes in Fig. 2C, D and appearance of GFP+ accumulations in Fig. 2F should be better defined - how were cell bodies and GFP+ puncta identified relative to other astrocytic cell structures, are they homogeneous in size/intensity in different brain regions following injury, and what could the GFP+ puncta represent?</p>
<p>
2. The relative contributions of astrocyte-like and ensheathing glia in the brain's response to TBI is unclear. RNA sequencing identified Mmp1 and Draper as genes upregulated following TBI, however, these genes have previously been implicated in ensheathing glial (and not astrocytic) responses to acute nerve injury. The authors provide convincing evidence that their transcriptomic data is devoid of neuronal genes, but what about the possibility of ensheathing glial contaminants? Figures 2I-Q suggest that the majority of Mmp1 protein co-localizes with ensheathing rather than astrocytic glial membranes following TBI. Does knockdown of Pvr, Jra, or kay in ensheathing glia affect Mmp1 upregulation following injury? A closer examination of how these two glial subtypes contribute to and interact-and what proportion of Mmp1 is cell autonomous to astrocytes-during injury responses would be valuable.</p>
<p>
3. The authors rely on RNAi and overexpression methods to manipulate expression of candidate genes in Figures 4, 5, and 7. In most cases, only a single RNAi line is used to reduce expression of a candidate gene, increasing the possibilities of off-target effects or insufficient gene knockdown. These data could be strengthened by using multiple RNAi lines as well as mutants to validate findings for Pvr, Jra, and kay knockdown in Figures 4 and 5, and perhaps confirmation of knockdown efficiency, particularly in Fig. 7.</p>
<p>
4. Single channel images should be included in Fig. 1L and M to help strengthen the conclusion that Dcp-1+ puncta are elav+ and repo-.</p>
<p>
5. Sample sizes and a description of power analysis should be included in figure legends/methods. Based on the graphs, some sample sizes appear low (e.g., Fig. 1H+K and 2D+Q).</p>

<p>In this study, authors used the Drosophila model to characterize molecular details underlying traumatic brain injury (TBI). The authors used the transcriptomic analysis of astrocytes collected by FACS sorting of cells derived from Drosophila heads following brain injury and identified upregulation of multiple genes, such as Pvr receptor, Jun, Fos, and MMP1. Additional studies identified that Pvr positively activates AP-1 transciption factor (TF) complex consisting of Jun and Fos, of which activation leads to the induction of MMP1. Finally, authors found that disruption of endocytosis and endocytotic trafficking facilitates Pvr signaling and subsequently leads to induction of AP-1 and MMP1.</p>
<p>Overall, this study provides important clues to understanding molecular mechanisms underlying TBI. The identified molecules linked to TBI in astrocytes could be potential targets for developing effective therapeutics. The obtained data from transcriptional profiling of astrocytes will be useful for future follow-up studies. The manuscript is well-organized and easy to read. However, I would like to request the authors to address the following issue to improve the quality of their study.</p>
<p>It is unclear why the authors did not explore the involvement of the JNK pathway in their study. While they described the potential involvement of the JNK pathway based on previous literature, they did not include any evidence on the JNK pathway in their own study.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the mechanism by which JNK activates AP-1 is primarily through phosphorylation, not the quantitative control of amounts, as much as I know. This raises questions about the authors' proposed hierarchical relationship between Pvr and AP-1 and the potential involvement of the JNK pathway in mediating this relationship.</p>
<p>Given the significance of the mechanistic link between Pvr and AP-1 in solidifying the authors' conclusion, it would have been beneficial for them to explore the involvement of the JNK pathway in their study, even if only minimally. The lack of such exploration may weaken the overall strength of their findings and the potential implications for understanding TBI.</p>
