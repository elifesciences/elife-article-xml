<title>Abstract</title><p>Tendon injury occurs at high frequency and is difficult to repair. Identification of human stem cells being able to regenerate tendon will greatly facilitate the development of regenerative medicine for tendon injury. We identified CD29+/CD56+ human muscle stem/progenitor cells having tendon differentiation potential both in vitro and in vivo. Transplantation of human myogenic progenitor cells contributes to injured tendon repair and thus improves locomotor function. Interestingly, the tendon differentiation potential in mouse muscle stem cells is minimal and the higher TGFβ signaling level in human myogenic progenitor cells may be the key for the distinct feature of human myogenic progenitor cells. These findings reveal that CD29+/CD56+ human muscle stem/progenitor cells are bi-potential adult stem cells and can serve as a new source for tendon regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Skeletal muscle is a tissue with great regeneration ability due to the existence of muscle stem cells (MuSCs). MuSCs are adult stem cells located at the periphery of myofibers between the basal lamina and the plasmalemma of the myofibers and responsible for muscle regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. MuSCs have been considered to be unipotent stem cells to have a sole differentiation potential to myofibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. MuSCs undergo expansion and differentiate to multinuclei myofibers after injury in vivo. MuSCs have remarkable abilities to support muscle regeneration. After transplantation, the engrafted mouse MuSCs go through active expansion and regenerate myofibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Isolation by FACS and expansion of MuSCs have been reported from several species including mouse, pig, and human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Single cell sequencing analysis from human skeletal muscles have also revealed the existence of Pax7+ MuSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Due to the different motion patterns, the regeneration capacity may be different between human and rodents. Current investigations have suggested that human myogenic progenitor cells didn’t share same markers as that in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and the expression pattern of oxidative enzymes and cytokines between these two species are also different<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, suggesting that human muscle progenitor cells may have distinct features from mice.</p>
<p>FACS method to isolate cells with myogenic differentiation potential from human muscle biopsies has been established. CD56 (NCAM)+ and CD56+ CD29+ cells from skeletal muscle display myogenic differentiation potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The CD56+ CD34+ progenitor cells isolated from human skeletal muscle biopsies have been reported to have chondrogenic, adipogenic, and osteogenic potentials besides myogenic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. CD56+CD34-progenitor cells are free of adipogenic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The differentiation potential of human muscle progenitor cells remains to be further explored.</p>
<p>Skeletal muscle directly connects to tendons which is responsible for transmitting forces from skeletal muscle to bone to generate active movement. Tendinopathy affects more than 10% of the population under 45 and compromises the tendon functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Tendon injury healing is slow and incomplete due to the low number of cells in tendon and the hypovascular and anaerobic environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Tendon stem/progenitor cells (TDSCs) are a cell population derived from tendon and considered to be a subgroup of mesenchymal stem cells that have abilities to improve tendon injury healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. However, the number of TDSCs in tendon is low and retrieving TDSCs is invasive and exacerbates tendon injury. Morphology and proliferation ability loss in the culture system also hampers the efforts to obtain sufficient amounts of active TDSCs. To find more cell types supporting tendon regeneration will facilitate the development of regenerative medicine to treat tendon injury.</p>
<p>The activity of tenogenesis is tightly regulated by many signaling pathways, while TGFβ/SMAD2/3 is a crucial molecular axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. TGFβ signaling is indispensable for tendon development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and it could systematically promote the tenogenic differentiation of stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The downstream effectors SMAD2 and SMAD3 are able to activate the transcription of tendon-specific genes which further facilitates tendon development and tenogenic differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. After tendon injury, TGFβ/SMAD2/3 promotes the proliferation, migration and differentiation of TDSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, increases tendon collagen synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and contributes to matrix anabolism for tendon remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we found that CD56+ CD29+ human myogenic progenitor cells can be differentiated to tendon cells both in vitro and in vivo. Transplantation of human myogenic progenitor cells to injured tendon in mice improved the tendon regeneration, suggesting that human muscle myogenic progenitor cells are bipotential adult stem cells. Interestingly, the tendon differentiation potential in mouse muscle stem cells is minimal and the higher TGFβ signaling level in human myogenic progenitor cells may be the key for the distinct feature of human myogenic progenitor cells.</p>

<title>Potential tenogenic differentiation potential of myogenic progenitor cells identified by single cell sequencing</title>
<p>To analyze the cell components of human skeletal muscle, single cell sequencing analysis was performed using skeletal muscle biopsy. A total of 15,102 cells were included for analysis. The cells were grouped to 8 cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">b</xref>). Consistent with the previous single cell sequencing results from human muscles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, Fibro/Adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), endothelial cells, muscle cells, and myogenic progenitor cells were among the identified cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">b</xref>).</p>

<p>A population of tenocytes was identified in human muscle biopsies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a and b</xref>). Surprisingly, when we performed unsupervised trajectory analysis using the single cell sequencing data, two branches were identified by the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">d</xref>), while one branch linked muscle progenitor cells and tenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">d</xref>). RNA FISH of skeletal muscle section revealed that SCX, a key transcription factor determining tendon lineage, could be expressed in muscle stem/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">f</xref>). These analysis results suggest that muscle stem cells could have tenocyte differentiation potential.</p>
<p>To confirm the single cell analysis results, we first isolated myogenic progenitor cells from human muscle biopsy using FACS as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. CD45-CD31-CD56+ CD29+ cells were collected from the single cell suspension dissociated from muscle tissue. The collected cells were stained with anti-PAX7, anti-MYOD1 and anti-MYF5 antibody to confirm the purity of isolated myogenic progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">h</xref>). When induced to differentiate by 0.4% Ultroser G, human myogenic progenitor cells differentiate to myotubes robustly. Approximately 90% of nuclei were present in Myosin heavy chain (MyHC) positive myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">j</xref>). Consistently, the expression of PAX7, MYF5 and MYOD1 were enriched in the myogenic progenitor cells, their expression decreased after differentiation as shown by RT-qPCR assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1k</xref>). In contrast, the expression of genes marking differentiation such as Myogenin (MYOG), Myosin heavy chain 1 (MYH1), and Myosin heavy chain 3 (MYH3) were up-regulated in differentiated myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1l</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the myogenic progenitor cells isolated from human muscle biopsies have robust myogenic differentiation potential.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Human myogenic progenitor cells display tenogenic differentiation potential in vitro</title>
<p>The isolated primary human myogenic progenitor cells were induced to differentiate to tenocytes by 100ng/ml GDF5, 100ng/ml GDF7 and 0.2mM ascorbic acid for 12 days. After 12 days of tendon differentiation, the morphology of cells display dramatic differences from those undergoing myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">SFig. 1a</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of tendon markers such as TNC and SCX was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">c</xref>). Moreover, some other tendon related genes, such as COL I, MKX, THBS4, and COMP, were also enriched after tendon differentiation induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In contrast, the expression of these genes was not enriched upon myogenic induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">c</xref>). The expression of genes marking myogenic differentiation such as MYOG and MyHC were only detected in a small portion of cells after tenogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">SFig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">c</xref>). Compared to the over 90% of differentiation efficiency upon myogenic differentiation induction, only about 20% of cells showed MYOG and MyHC expression after 12 days of tenogenic induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">SFig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">c</xref>). The genes marking differentiated myotubes such as MYH1, MYH3, DESMIN, and MYL1 showed moderate elevation after tenogenic differentiation, while dramatic upregulation of these genes was observed after myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">SFig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">e</xref>). These results combined suggest that human myogenic progenitor cells are capable of tendon differentiation in vitro.</p>

</fig>
<p>To further confirm the results, we next performed clonal analysis. The freshly isolated primary human myogenic progenitor cells were seeded to 96 well plate with the concentration of 1 cell/well. The wells of single cell were allowed to proliferate for 10 days followed by tenogenic or myogenic induction. The plates with myogenic induction were differentiated for 4 days and immunofluorescence staining of MyHC was performed to determine muscle differentiation. The plates with tenogenic induction were differentiated for 12 days and immunofluorescence staining of SCX was performed to determine tenocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The number of wells showing positive MyHC staining was counted and the myogenic differentiation efficiency was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">g</xref>). MyHC+ myotubes was observed in over 95% of wells with alive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Similarly, the number of wells displaying positive SCX staining was counted and the tenogenic differentiation efficiency was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">g</xref>). Approximately 40% of myogenic progenitor cells displayed tenogenic differentiation ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2g</xref>), suggesting that human myogenic progenitor cells have tenogenic differentiation potential. Taken together, these results suggest that human myogenic progenitor cells have dual differentiation potentials towards muscle or tendon in vitro.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Tenocytes differentiated from human myogenic progenitor cells display similar expression profile to primary tenocytes</title>
<p>RNA sequencing was then performed to further determine the lineage of the tenocytes differentiated from myogenic progenitor cells. Myogenic progenitor cells were induced towards myogenic or tenogenic differentiation respectively. We also isolated primary human tenocytes as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. These cells were subjected for RNA sequencing analysis. The differentiated myotubes and tenocytes displayed distinct expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The differentiated tendon cells share high similarity to fresh isolated tenocytes from human tendons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>), suggesting that human muscle stem/progenitor cells are capable of tendon differentiation. Consistently, two distinct sets of genes were up-regulated after myogenic induction and tenogenic induction, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">c</xref>). These results suggest that human myogenic progenitor cells are capable of dual direction differentiation</p>

<p>Further GO analysis also displayed the activation of two distinct sets of cell features. Upon the skeletal muscle differentiation induction, terms related to skeletal muscle functions such as skeletal muscle thin filament assembly, skeletal muscle contraction, muscle organ development, and sarcomere organization were enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>), suggesting the muscular identity of the differentiated cells. In contrast, terms related to tendon formation, tendon development, and tendon cell differentiation were enriched after tenogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3e</xref>), suggesting that tendon identity is achieved in the differentiated cells. Together, these results suggest that human myogenic progenitor cells are capable of both myogenic and tenogenic differentiation in vitro.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Murine MuSCs display poor tenogenic differentiation ability</title>
<p>We next investigated whether the tenogenic differentiation ability is present in rodent muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Mouse MuSCs were isolated by positive marker of Vcam1 as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and induced for tenogenic differentiation. In sharp contrast to human myogenic progenitor cells, murine MuSCs failed to be induced to tendon cells upon the same induction condition as that for human myogenic progenitor cells, though the myogenic differentiation is as efficient as the human myogenic progenitor cells. After myogenic differentiation, 93.9% of nuclei were present in MyHC+ myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">b</xref>). In sharp contrast, no Scx+ cells were observed after 12 days of induction for tenogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Consistent with the immunofluorescence staining results, RT-qPCR results revealed that myogenic differentiation marker genes such as MyoG, Myh1, and Myh3 were up-regulated under both myogenic and tenogenic differentiation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4c</xref>), suggesting that murine MuSCs predominantly commit myogenic differentiation under induction. Different from human myogenic progenitor cells, the expression of genes indicating tendon cell fate such as Scx, Tnc, Col I, Mkx, and Thbs4 did not increase after tenogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d</xref>), suggesting the failure to induce tenogenic cell fate from murine MuSCs. To further rule out the bias caused by different FACs strategies between human and mouse myogenic progenitor cells, mouse muscle CD29+/CD56+ cells were isolated for tenogenic induction. However, very few mouse muscle CD29+/CD56+ cells expressed myogenic progenitor cell marker Pax7, MyoD1 and Vcam1, indicating the failure strategy to purify mouse myogenic progenitor cells by gating CD29+/CD56+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">SFig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2b</xref>). Furthermore, RT-qPCR results of tendon related markers Scx, Tnc, Mkx, and Thbs4 revealed that there was also no tenogenic or myogenic differentiation potential of mouse muscle CD29+/CD56+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">SFig. 2c</xref>). Together, these results suggest that murine MuSCs display almost no tenogenic differentiation potential in vitro.</p>

<p>We next performed the lineage tracing experiments in mice to further examine the tenogenic potential of mouse MuSCs in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Pax7CreERT2 mice were crossed to flox-Stop-flox-tdTomato mice. MuSCs and the descendants of MuSCs will be labeled by tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">SFig. 2d</xref>). Tendon injury in mice was generated by mimicking the peroneus longus tendon removal surgery in human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">SFig. 2e</xref>). In human, it has been reported that the tendon could be regenerated to some extent after the peroneus longus tendon removal surgery based on MRI imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In this surgery, injury of the skeletal muscle adjacent to the removed tendon was inevitable. The accompanied skeletal muscle injury could activate MuSCs and make them available for tendon regeneration. To further activate MuSCs to guarantee that sufficient amount of activated MuSCs were available around the tendon injury site, we also injected cardiotoxin (CTX) at the muscle adjacent to the sites where the tendon was removed to induce more muscle injuries and further activate MuSCs. If MuSCs can participate tendon regeneration, tdTomato+ tendon cells would be observed after the reparation of tendon injury. As a control, muscle injury was induced by muscular injection of CTX at the muscles adjacent to the removed tendon.</p>
<p>Expectedly, large amount of tdTomato+ myofibers were observed after muscle injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">SFig. 2f-g</xref>), suggesting that the tracing system works well. Nevertheless, less than 0.2% tendon cells originated from mouse MuSCs were observed even four months after tendon removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4f-g</xref>). These results suggest that murine MuSCs have poor tendon differentiation abilities.</p>

<p>We next went on to investigate whether the transplantation of human myogenic progenitor cells to mouse can improve tendon regeneration.

<p>In mice transplanted with human myogenic progenitor cells, continuous cryosections containing muscle and tendon tissues were generated. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect tendon and muscle markers with two cryosections adjacent to each other, respectively. The two sets of images obtained on continuous cryosections were superimposed on each other to pinpoint the position of tendons. Immunofluorescence staining of antibody specifically recognizing human TNC indicated the position of regenerated tendon-like tissue from human cells in the harvested tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The presence of human cells was also illustrated by the immunofluorescence staining with the antibody specifically recognizing human Lamin A/C. In the control PBS injection group, where the mixture of PBS and hydrogel instead human myogenic progenitor cells was injected to the incision sites, no human Lamin A/C was detected. These results confirmed the specificity of human TNC and Lamin A/C antibody. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that over 75% of the human cells showed TNC expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">d</xref>), suggesting that the majority of the transplanted human myogenic progenitor cells differentiate to tendon cells in vivo. The immunofluorescence staining of MyHC and human Lamin A/C was performed to detect the muscle cells originated from the transplanted human myogenic progenitor cells. Only about 12.8% of the human cells detected expressed MyHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">d</xref>). Moreover, the human cells were predominantly enriched at the tendon region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Only a few MyHC+ cells originated from the transplanted human myogenic cells scattered in the muscle region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5c</xref>). To further confirm the tendon differentiation potential of the transplanted human myogenic progenitor cells, immunofluorescence staining of SCX and TNMD was also performed. The majority (80.0% and 74.6%) of transplanted human myogenic progenitor cells also express SCX and TNMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">SFig. 3a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">c</xref>). Furthermore, Col I was predominantly expressed in the regenerated tendon-like tissue rather than Col III after human cells transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5e</xref>), indicating human myogenic progenitor cells contributes to structural repair of injured tendon and facilitates the healing process. Taken together, these results suggest that human myogenic progenitor cells are capable of tendon differentiation in vivo and contributing to tendon regeneration.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to human myogenic progenitor cells, when 50,000 murine MuSCs constitutively expressing tdTomato were transplanted to pre-injured tendon in NOD/SCID mice under the same condition, less than 0.3% of tdTomato+ TNC+ cells were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">g</xref>). However, the myogenic differentiation potential of human myogenic progenitor cells and mouse MuSCs was similar. Muscle injury was induced by muscular injection of CTX in tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in NOD/SCID mice. TA muscles were irradiated to kill the local MuSCs as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Transplantation of human myogenic progenitor cells and mouse MuSCs to the irradiated pre-injured recipient mice was performed, respectively. TA muscles were harvested after 28 days. Transplantation of both human myogenic progenitor cells and murine MuSC displayed robust engraftment efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">SFig. 3d-i</xref>). These results suggest that human myogenic progenitor cells and murine MuSCs have similar myogenic differentiation potential.</p>
<p>Combined, the above results suggest that human myogenic progenitor cells have dual differentiation potentials towards myogenesis or tenogenesis in vivo, while murine MuSCs predominantly commit myogenesis.</p>

<p>We next checked whether the human myogenic progenitor cell transplantation improves tendon functions.

Larger and denser collagen fibrils of the tendons were identified in transplanted group than control group with PBS injection, although the maturation level of collagen fibrils could still not reach uninjured tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">b</xref>).

<p>Whether the improved tendon regeneration could facilitate the whole organism locomotor function was next investigated. Since the Achilles tendon transmits the plantarflexion force from gastrocnemius muscle to calcaneus, the plantarflexion force of involved leg was also performed two months after tendon injury. Expectedly, transplantation of human myogenic progenitor cells for injured tendon also contributed to improving both twitch and tetanus plantarflexion force when compared with PBS injection control group, although the plantarflexion force could still not reach to level of uninjured leg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Consistent with the improved plantarflexion force, the endurance time and max fatigue speed of the mice transplanted with human myogenic progenitor cells was better in treadmill test when compared to no transplantation group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Since immunofluorescence staining with human Lamin A/C revealed that only a small number of human myogenic progenitor cells engrafted in muscle sporadically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">d</xref>), these results suggest that the transplanted human myogenic progenitor cells can improve locomotor function by directly repairing injured tendon.</p>

<title>TGFβ signaling pathway contributes to tenogenic differentiation of human myogenic progenitor cells</title>
<p>Since the human myogenic progenitor cells and murine MuSCs shared the same strain of recipient mice and the same tendon injury while being transplanted, they had the similar microenvironment. Therefore, the distinct differentiation potentials are due to the cell intrinsic differences between species. We further compared the expression profiles of human myogenic progenitor cells and murine MuSCs. Interestingly, TGFβ signaling were identified in KEGG enrichment analysis of upregulated genes in human myogenic progenitor cells when compared with mouse muscle stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7a</xref>), indicating that TGFβ signaling could be the key node for maintaining the tendon differentiation potential. Furthermore, SMAD2 and SMAD3 were identified in upregulated gene set which was enriched in TGFβ signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Since TGFβ/SMAD2/SMAD3 axis plays a crucial role in tendon development and tenogenic differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we next investigated the potential function of TGFβ signaling for tenogenic differentiation of human myogenic progenitor cells.

TGFβ signaling inhibitor SB-431542 was used to significantly impaired TGFβ/SMAD2/SMAD3 signaling during tenogenic induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7c</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we show that human myogenic progenitor cells have dual differentiation potentials towards muscle and tendon. Transplantation of human myogenic progenitor cells contributes to injured tendon repair and thus improves locomotor function. Thus, the human myogenic progenitor cells could be served as a new source for tendon regeneration.</p>
<p>Tendon disorders widely occur in people of all ages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. It disrupts the stability and mobility of joint, which deeply affects their locomotor function and quality of life. However, the natural healing of injured tendon is very slow due to hypocellularity and hypovascularity of tendon. The biomechanical property and structural integrity could be hardly completely recovered even with surgical treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. It is still a great challenge in clinical work to treat tendon injury.</p>
<p>The relative inefficient outcome of routine therapy for tendon injury sparked the exploration of stem cell treatment. Seed cells with the ability to differentiate into tenocytes and secrete paracrine factors to repair tendon injury are preferred. Thus, tendon derived stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and mensenchymal stem cells have been introduced as seed cells to treat tendon injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. However, inadequate sources of tendon derived stem cells, ethical issue and risk of teratoma formation of embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cell, and heterogeneity of mensenchymal stem cells limit the development of these seed cells for tendon injury treatment. As for muscle progenitor cells, it is high in proliferation and abundant in sources, and donor site morbidity after muscle harvest was low. Thus, muscle stem cell might be a promising candidate as seed cells for tendon repair.</p>
<p>Here we also find that the differentiation potential of muscle stem cells is species dependent. Human muscle myogenic progenitor cells are bipotential adult stem cells. In contrast, murine muscle stem cells barely have tendon differentiation potential. The species difference might be due to the higher TGFβ/SMAD2/SMAD3 signaling level in human myogenic progenitor cells. TGFβ/SMAD2/SMAD3 axis plays a crucial role in tendon development and tenogenic differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. SMAD2/3-dependent TGFβ signaling also acts as a crucial molecular brake for myogenesis. It could suppress myogenic regulatory factors Myod1 and Myogenin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, as well as inhibit myotube fusion and muscle regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The elevated TGFβ/SMAD2/SMAD3 signaling may help inhibit the myogenic differentiation ability and stimulate the tenogenic differentiation potential of human myogenic progenitor cells under specific microenvironment.</p>
<p>Studies using mouse models contributed to the majority of our knowledge about muscle stem cells and laid the foundation for our understanding of mammalian muscle stem cells. However, human is dramatically different from mouse in many aspects such as size, life span, and manners of motions. It is more demanding for humans to maintain the homeostasis of the locomotion system and the whole organism locomotion ability in much longer life span and bigger body size. Though our knowledge about human muscle regeneration is limited, the current studies have revealed multiple differentiation potentials of Pax7+ human progenitor cells in skeletal muscles. CD56+ CD34+ progenitor cells in human skeletal muscle have been reported to have myogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The CD56+ CD34-progenitor cells in human skeletal muscle have been shown to be free of adipogenic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that the progenitor cells in skeletal muscles also have tenogenic differentiation ability besides their myogenic differentiation ability. It seems that there are multiple subpopulations of myogenic progenitor cells in skeletal muscle. They are all capable of muscle regeneration, while with potentials to regenerate other components of the motion system such as bone, tendon, and adipocytes. This could be an economic method to maintain the functions of the motion system for the longer life span and more complicated motion manner in human beings.</p>

<p>Through a combination of in vitro and in vivo analyses, the authors demonstrate that CD56/CD29 positive progenitor cells from human muscle can be driven towards muscle or tendon fate in vitro and are able to contribute to muscle and tendon fates following transplantation in injured mice. This is in contrast to Pax7-lineage cells from mice which do not contribute to tendon repair in vivo. While the data strongly support that a subset of cells captured by this sorting strategy has tenogenic potential, their claims of progenitor bi-potency are not fully supported by the data as currently presented.</p>
<p>As discussed below, some aspects of the data analysis and sample preparation are incomplete and should be clarified to fully support the claims of the paper.</p>
<p>For the colony analysis, it is unclear from the methods and main text whether the initial individual sorted colonies were split and subject to different conditions to support the claim of bi-potency. The finding that 40% of colonies displayed tenogenic differentiation, may instead suggest heterogeneity of the sorted progenitor population. The methods as currently described, suggest that two different plates were subject to different induction conditions. It is therefore difficult to assess the strength of the claim of bi-potency.</p>
<p>This group uses the well-established CD56+/CD29+ sorting strategy to isolate muscle progenitor cells, however recent work has identified transcriptional heterogeneity within these human satellite cells (ie Barruet et al, eLife 2020). Given that they identify a tenocyte population in their human muscle biopsy in Figure 1a, it is critical to understand the heterogeneity contained within the population of human progenitors captured by the authors' FACS strategy and whether tenocytes contained within the muscle biopsy are also CD56+/CD29+.</p>
<p>The bulk RNA sequencing data presented in Figure 3 to contrast the expression of progenitor cells under different differentiation conditions are not sufficiently convincing. In particular, it is unclear whether more than one sample was used for the RNAseq analyses shown in Figure 3. The volcano plots have many genes aligned on distinct curves suggesting that there are few replicates or low expression. There is also a concern that the sorted cells may contain tenocytes as tendon genes SCX, MKX, and THBS4 were among the genes upregulated in the myogenic differentiation conditions (shown in Figure 3b).</p>

<p>This work describes a novel bipotent differentiation capacity of human muscle progenitors marked by CD56 and CD29. In addition to previously well-known myogenic differentiation potential, the authors discovered these progenitors could also be induced into tenocyte-like cells. They describe the sorted CD56+/CD29+ cells not only differentiate into tenocytes in vitro; they were also able to engraft into injured tendons and repair damaged tendons when transplanted into nude mice. Human MuSC transplantation improved the locomotor function and physiological strength of the tendon-injured mice. The authors further observed that this bipotent differentiation potential was specific to human MuSC, the same cell population isolated from mice remains unipotent to myogenic differentiation and not capable of tenocytic differentiation.</p>
<p>The discovery of the tenocyte differentiation potential of human CD56+/CD29+ MuSCs provides a potential cell therapeutic option for tendon injury. This work may have a significant clinical impact on improving treatment outcomes for patients suffering from tendon injury.</p>
<p>Strength of the paper:</p>
<p>Multimodal experimental approach using both in vitro and in vivo experiments provided strong proof for the differentiation capacity of the human MuSCs into tenocytes, and the potential clinical implication of these cells in the treatment of tendon injury in patients by in vivo transplantation assay. Using RNA sequencing to characterise the differentiated myocytic and tenocytic populations proved global expression profile data which have shown non-biased efficiency information to the in vitro differentiated cells.</p>
<p>The comparison of differentiation potentials of human and mouse MuSCs is interesting and clinically meaningful. This work illustrates that animal studies may not always be clinically relevant in studying human diseases and treatment modalities.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>scRNAseq assay using total mononuclear cell population did not provide meaningful insight that enriched knowledge on CD56+/CD29+ cell population. CD56+/CD29+ cells information may have been lost due to the minority identity of these cells in the total skeletal muscle mononuclear population, especially given the total cell number used for scRNAseq was very low and no information on participant number and repeat sample number used for this assay. Using this data to claim a stem cell lineage relationship for MuSCs and tenocytes may not convincing, as seeing both cell types in the total muscle mononuclear population does not establish a lineage connection between them.</p>
<p>The TGF-b pathway assay uses a small molecular inhibitor of TGF-b to probe Smad2/3. The assay conclusion regarding Smad2/3 pathway responsible for tenocyte differentiation may be overinterpretation without Smad2/3 specific inhibitors being applied in the experiments.</p>

<p>
Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors present compelling evidence that CD29+/CD56+ stem/progenitor cells from human muscle biopsies show tenogenic differentiation ability both in vitro and in vivo, alongside their myogenic potential.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The methodology and results are convincing. CD29+/CD56+ stem/progenitor cells were transplanted into immunodeficient mice with a tendon injury, and human cells expressing tenogenic markers contributed to the repair of the injured tendon. Furthermore, the authors also show better tendon biomechanical properties and plantarflexion force after transplantation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This dual differentiation capability was not observed in mouse muscle stem cells.</p>

<p>For the colony analysis, it is unclear from the methods and main text whether the initial individual sorted colonies were split and subject to different conditions to support the claim of bi-potency. The finding that 40% of colonies displayed tenogenic differentiation, may instead suggest heterogeneity of the sorted progenitor population. The methods as currently described, suggest that two different plates were subject to different induction conditions. It is therefore difficult to assess the strength of the claim of bi-potency.</p>

<p>Thanks for your valuable comment. We are sorry for the confusing illustration of colony assay. In fact, we first obtained CD29+/CD56+ cells by FACs. Then these freshly isolated cells were randomly seeded to 96-well plate with density of 1 cell/well. Subsequently, the single cell in each plate was cultured with growth medium to form colonies for ten days. Then myogenic induction was performed in three 96-well plates and tenogenic induction was performed in another three 96-well plates for subsequent analyses. Thus, we agree with your point that the sorted progenitor population could be heterogeneous. Almost all the cells highly expressed myogenic progenitor genes PAX7/MYOD1/MYF5 (Figure 1g) and over 95% colonies successfully differentiated into myotubes (Figure 2g). Thus, we believe these obtained CD29+/CD56+ cells were myogenic progenitor cells, while a subgroup of these cells obtained bi-potency.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comment. Each group consisted of three samples for RNAseq analyses. We are sorry there exist a minor analysis mistake in Figure 3b and Figure 3c, which will be reanalyzed in the revised version. As for contamination of tenocytes, almost all the obtained cells highly expressed myogenic progenitor marker PAX7/MYOD1/MYF5 (Figure 1g-h). Low expression levels of tendon markers were identified in these cells (Figure 2a-c). Furthermore, although tendon genes slightly upregulated in myogenic differentiation conditions, these markers dramatically upregulated in tenogenic differentiation conditions (Figure 2c). Thus, we believe the tenogenic differentiation ability of sorted cells were mainly ascribed to CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitor cells.</p>

<p>Comment: This dual differentiation capability was not observed in mouse muscle stem cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comment. We have explored the tenogenic differentiation potential of mouse MuSCs both in vivo and in vitro. However, low tenogenic differentiation ability was revealed (Figure 4), which might be due to species diversity. Maybe it is more demanding for humans to maintain the homeostasis of the locomotion system and the whole organism locomotion ability in much longer life span and bigger body size. Thus, the current study also indicated that anima studies may not clinically relevant when investigating human diseases.</p>
