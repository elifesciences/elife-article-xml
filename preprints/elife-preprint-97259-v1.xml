<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The ability to distinguish strangers from familiar individuals is crucial for the survival of most mammalian species. In humans, an inability to recognize kin and familiar individuals and engage in appropriate behaviors is associated with several types of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. Mice preferentially spend more time investigating a novel individual relative to a familiar individual. Yet, how social novelty related information drives increased investigation of the novel animal remains poorly understood. Recent evidence has implicated the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) as a key node in encoding information about conspecific identity. Of particular interest are vHPC projections to the lateral septum (LS), a region that has been implicated in driving a wide range of motivated social behaviors. In this study using chemogenetics, optogenetics and monosynaptic rabies tracing, we identified a novel vHPC-LS-ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathway that is necessary for mice to preferentially investigate novel conspecifics. Using monosynaptic rabies tracing, we established that LS neurons make direct monosynaptic connections onto dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. Thus, we have identified a potential pathway via which conspecific identity could be transformed to drive motivated social behaviors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most animals make daily calculations to approach or avoid a conspecific based on the quality of prior interactions. Yet, how we recognize who we interact with and how that information is transformed to guide subsequent behavior remains poorly understood. For instance, mice readily discriminate between novel and familiar conspecifics, preferentially spending more time investigating a novel individual relative to a familiar individual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. However, it remains unknown how social novelty drives increased approach and investigation.</p>
<p>The ventral hippocampal (vHPC) and dorsal CA2 neurons are known to be causally involved in allowing mice to distinguish between novel and familiar conspecifics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Specifically, studies have shown that manipulating the activity of ventral CA1 but not dorsal CA1 neurons in the hippocampus disrupts the ability of mice to discriminate between novel and familiar conspecifics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Notably, individual vHPC neurons are known to preferentially fire in the proximity of conspecifics but not objects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Additionally, experiments have shown that ensembles of neurons in the vHPC encode the identity of a conspecific and that this representation changes as a function of familiarity with the conspecific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. However, it is unclear how this social memory information in the vHPC is transformed to preferentially drive increased investigation of a novel conspecific. Moreover, there remains debate regarding which regions downstream of the vHPC play a role in promoting differential investigation of novel and familiar conspecifics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>This study focused on ventral hippocampal projections to the lateral septum (LS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The LS, a subcortical structure primarily composed of GABAergic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, receives dense projections from the vHPC and is well situated to orchestrate social novelty-related approach behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. For instance, LS neurons in rat pups differentially respond to sibling and non-sibling odors and are necessary for the expression of non-sibling preference in older pups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Also, disrupting vasopressin receptor function in the LS modulates the ability of rodents to discriminate between novel and familiar conspecifics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Most importantly, the LS is thought to directly project to the ventral tegmental area (VTA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, a region previously implicated in social novelty-related behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, the lateral septum is well suited to act on social memory-related information from the ventral hippocampus to, in turn, regulate motivated social behaviors.</p>
<p>To determine if the vHPC-LS circuit is causally involved in preferentially investigating a novel conspecific over a familiar conspecific, we chemogenetically silenced vHPC-LS neurons and found that mice then spent equal amounts of time investigating a novel and familiar conspecific. Furthermore, we found that optogenetically inhibiting the activity of vHPC-LS neurons in a temporally and spatially specific manner caused the mice to investigate the conspecific paired with the inhibition. We hypothesized that this increased social investigation with vHPC-LS inhibition might arise from disinhibition of the VTA. Using monosynaptic rabies tracing technology, we determined that LS-VTA neurons receive dense ventral hippocampal inputs. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that chemogenetically silencing LS-VTA neuron activity caused mice to no longer prefer the novel conspecific. Finally, using monosynaptic rabies tracing experiments in Th-Cre<sup>+</sup> mice, we found that the LS makes direct monosynaptic connections onto dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. Taken together, we have identified a vHPC-LS-VTA circuitry that appears to play a key role in transforming social memory-related information in the ventral hippocampus to subsequently drive social novelty-related approach behaviors.</p>

<title>Inhibiting vHPC-LS neurons disrupts the preference for social novelty</title>
<p>To determine whether vHPC-LS neurons played a causal role in allowing animals to discriminate between novel and familiar mice, we chemogenetically silenced vHPC-LS neurons while evaluating the effects on behavior in the social discrimination task (SDT). To selectively silence vHPC-LS neurons, we injected C57/BL6 mice in the LS with a retrogradely transporting Cre virus and an AAV5 virus expressing Cre-dependent inhibitory DREADD (hM4Di)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> tagged with mCherry (or a control virus expressing only mCherry) in the vHPC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Three weeks after surgery, we injected mice (i.p.) with either saline or CNO 30 minutes prior to the SDT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In the SDT, mice were allowed to explore an arena containing age- and sex-matched novel and familiar conspecifics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Typically, mice spend more time in the proximity of a novel conspecific relative to the familiar conspecific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of vHPC-LS neurons by administration of CNO but not saline in hM4Di expressing mice (male and female) disrupted the ability of mice to preferentially spend more time in the proximity of the novel animal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>; two-factor ANOVA with drug condition and conspecific identity as factors; interaction: p = 8.4E-04, main effect of conspecific identity: p = 0.003; post hoc Sidak multiple comparison tests: Saline: p = 2E-05, CNO: p = 0.971; discrimination score: one sample t-test, Saline: p = 0.0009, CNO: p = 0.9222; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 1</xref>). CNO administration in mCherry expressing control mice did not affect their natural preference for the novel conspecific (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; two-factor ANOVA with drug condition and conspecific identity as factors; interaction: p = 0.638, main effect of conspecific identity: p = 6.40E-06; post hoc Sidak multiple comparison tests: Saline: p = 1.10E-04, CNO: p = 1.90E-05). In both saline and CNO conditions, the discrimination scores of the mCherry mice show that mice preferentially spend more time investigating the novel conspecific relative to familiar conspecific (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>; one sample t-test, Saline: p = 0.0103, CNO: p = 0.0013) while inhibition of vHPC-LS neurons disrupts the preference for the novel mouse (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>; one sample t-test, Saline: p = 0.0009, CNO: p = 0.9222).</p>

<p>To determine if the effects observed with vHPC-LS inhibition are socially specific, we ran the mice through a food discrimination assay in which mice were allowed to explore an arena containing novel and familiar foods. Unlike with conspecifics, mice are neophobic and do not prefer novel foods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, we expected mice would spend less time around the novel food in comparison to the familiar food. All mice exhibited a preference for the familiar food regardless of virus or drug condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H-K</xref>; two-factor ANOVA with food identity and drug condition as factors; mCherry: interaction: p = 0.254, main effect of food preference: p = 0.003, post hoc Sidak multiple comparison tests: Saline: p = 0.0323, CNO: p = 9E-04; discrimination score: one sample t-test, Saline: p = 0.0134, CNO: p = 0.008; hM4Di: interaction: p = 0.508, main effect of food preference: p = 3.2E-05, post hoc Sidak multiple comparison tests: Saline: p = 1.7E-04, CNO: p = 0.003; discrimination score: one sample t-test, Saline: p = 0.0016, CNO: p = 0.0419). This finding suggests that the effects observed with vHPC-LS inhibition are socially specific.</p>
<p>To determine if the reduction in preference for a novel conspecific in the SDT could arise from anxiety-like behaviors, we ran mice through an open field assay. We found that chemogenetic silencing of vHPC-LS neurons had no effect on the time spent in the center of the arena (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L, N</xref>; paired t-test, mCherry: p = 0.3167, hM4Di: p = 0.1837). Additionally, chemogenetic inhibition of vHPC-LS neurons had no effect on locomotion, as evidenced by the absence of any changes in the velocity of the animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M, O</xref>; paired t-test, mCherry: p = 0.2694, hM4Di: p = 0.7886). Thus, ruling out the possibility that altered locomotion could be contributing to the ability of mice to discriminate between novel and familiar conspecifics is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of their behavior.</p>
<p>Taken together, vHPC-LS chemogenetic inhibition disrupted the ability of mice to preferentially investigate a novel conspecific over a familiar conspecific while not affecting their ability to discriminate between novel and familiar foods. However, it is unclear whether chemogenetic inhibition increases the preference for a familiar mouse or decreases preference for a novel mouse. To distinguish between these possibilities, we next optogenetically silenced the activity of vHPC-LS neurons in a temporally and spatially restricted manner.</p>

<title>vHPC-LS neuron inhibition increases investigation of a mouse paired with inhibition</title>
<p>To determine whether inhibition of vHPC-LS neurons differentially influences the investigation of a novel versus a familiar mouse, we used halorhodopsin (NpHR) to silence vHPC-LS neurons in a temporally and spatially specific manner. We injected wild-type mice with a retrogradely transporting Cre virus in the LS and a Cre-dependent NpHR-EYFP or EGFP-only virus in the vHPC and then implanted fibers in the vHPC to target vHPC-LS cell bodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 2</xref>). Using a closed-loop optogenetic manipulation (See Methods), we selectively inhibited vHPC-LS neurons when a conspecific entered a previously defined social zone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Interestingly, we found that inhibition of vHPC-LS neurons in the proximity of a familiar mouse abolished the natural preference mice have for novel conspecifics (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F, G</xref>; two-factor ANOVA with light condition and conspecific identity as factors; interaction: p = 0.024, main effect of conspecific identity: p = 0.006, Sidak post hoc test; OFF: p = 0.006, N-ON: p = 0.037, F-ON: p = 0.949; discrimination score: one sample t-test, OFF: p = 0.002, NON: p = 0.19, FON: p = 0.719). Significantly, light stimulation did not affect the preference for the novel mouse in the control-EGFP group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, E</xref>; two-factor ANOVA with light condition and conspecific identity as factors; interaction: p = 0.898, main effect of conspecific identity: p = 2.8E-05, Sidak post hoc test; OFF: p = 0.032, N-ON: p = 0.012, F-ON: p = 0.032; discrimination score: one sample t-test, OFF: p = 0.008, NON: p = 0.009, FON: p = 0.028). These findings raise the possibility that inhibiting vHPC-LS neurons in the proximity of the familiar mouse could drive increased investigation of that mouse, thus decreasing the time spent in the proximity of a novel mouse.</p>
<p>To determine if silencing of vHPC-LS neurons increased investigation of the mouse paired with stimulation, we inhibited vHPC-LS neurons of test mice in the proximity of one of two novel mice in an arena (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H-K</xref>). We found that NpHR injected mice spent more time in the proximity of the novel mouse that was paired with inhibition than the other novel animal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J, K</xref>; two-factor ANOVA with light condition and conspecific identity as factors; interaction: p = 0.040, main effect of conspecific identity p = 0.005; post hoc Sidak tests; N-OFF: p = 0.961, N-ON: p = 0.001; discrimination score: one sample t-test, OFF: p = 0.796, NON: p = 0.029). The control-EGFP group showed an equal preference for both novel animals regardless of the light condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H, I</xref>; two-factor ANOVA with light condition and conspecific identity as factors; interaction: p = 0.006, no main effect of conspecific identity: p = 0.608; discrimination score: one sample t-test, OFF: p = 0.535, NON: p = 0.128).</p>
<p>Importantly, we found that the increased investigation observed with inhibition of vHPC-LS neurons were socially specific. Inhibition of vHPC-LS activity in the proximity of a novel object did not increase the time spent in the proximity of the object (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N, O</xref>; two-factor ANOVA with light condition and object identity as factors; interaction: p = 0.871, no main effect of conspecific identity: p = 0.505; discrimination score: one sample t-test, OFF: p = 0.720, NON: p = 0.905). Light stimulation also did not change preferences in the control EGFP group when presented with two novel objects (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L, M</xref>; two-factor ANOVA with light condition and object identity as factors; interaction: p = 0.878, no main effect of object identity: p = 0.220; discrimination Score: one sample t-test, OFF: p = 0.697, NON: p = 0.422). These findings suggest that the increased investigation of a mouse paired with vHPC-LS inhibition was not simply a result of the inhibition being appetitive.</p>
<p>To determine if changes in locomotion or anxiety-related behaviors could drive increased investigation of the mouse paired with inhibition, we compared both the time spent in the center and velocity of the animals with and without inhibition of the vHPC-LS neurons while mice explored an open field. We found that inhibition of vHPC-LS neurons did not affect either the velocity or the time spent in the center of the arena in the open field assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2R, S</xref>; one-way ANOVA, time spent: p = 0.254; velocity: p = 0.775). Light stimulation also had no effect on time spent in the center of the open field arena and the velocity of the animals in the control-EGFP group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2P, Q</xref>; one-way ANOVA, time spent: p = 0.094; velocity: p = 0.259).</p>
<p>Together, these results suggest that vHPC-LS inhibition likely disrupts preference for a novel conspecific by increasing investigation of a familiar conspecific. Thus, demonstrating that intact activity in the vHPC-LS pathway is necessary for mice to engage in social novelty-related behaviors. These findings raise the possibility that inhibition of the vHPC-LS neurons could disinhibit downstream regions that have been implicated in promoting approach of novel conspecifics, like the VTA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, by decreasing the inhibitory drive that GABAergic LS projection neurons exert on their downstream targets.</p>

<p>Next, we determined if LS-VTA neurons received monosynaptic inputs from the vHPC using a modified monosynaptic rabies tracing technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Three weeks after injecting a retrogradely transporting Cre virus in the VTA and a Cre-dependent rabies helper virus in the LS, we injected the modified delta-G deleted rabies virus into the LS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref>). Using the semi-automated WholeBrain software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, we mapped brain wide monosynaptic inputs onto LS-VTA neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). We quantified the proportion of total neurons from each region that directly synapse onto LS-VTA neurons. The hippocampal formation was the largest source of inputs to LS-VTA neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>; one-way ANOVA: p = 0.0107, Post hoc multiple comparison Dunnett’s test; HPF vs IC: p = 0.1579, HPF vs HY: p = 0.0206, HPF vs TH: p = 0.0056). Within the hippocampus, the CA1 and CA3 neurons projected most densely onto LS-VTA neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>; one-way ANOVA: p = 0.0096, Post hoc multiple comparison Dunnett’s test; CA1 vs DG: p = 0.0411, CA1 vs SUBd: p = 0.0511, CA3 vs DG: p = 0.0134, CA3 vs SUBd: p = 0.0166, CA3 vs SUBv: p = 0.0325.). When looking at the organization of inputs along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus, we observed that significantly more vCA1 than dCA1 neurons project to LS-VTA neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>; paired t-test: p = 0.0496).

<p>From rabies tracing experiments, we have established that the vHPC neurons, specifically neurons from the vCA1 and vCA3 subregions, make dense and direct monosynaptic connections onto LS neurons that in turn project to the VTA.

<title>LS-VTA neurons play a role in social discrimination and food discrimination</title>
<p>After establishing that LS-VTA neurons do receive monosynaptic inputs from the vHPC, we next asked if LS projections to the VTA played a causal role in allowing mice to preferentially investigate a novel conspecific. To test this possibility, we chemogenetically silenced LS-VTA neurons while mice explored the SDT arena containing a novel and familiar conspecific. We injected a retrogradely transporting Cre virus in the VTA of C57BL/6 mice and a Cre-dependent inhibitory (hM4Di) DREADD virus or an mCherry virus in the LS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>).

<p>Interestingly, inhibition of hM4Di expressing LS-VTA neurons with CNO strongly disrupted the ability of mice to preferentially investigate the novel conspecific in the SDT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, G</xref>; two-factor ANOVA with drug condition and conspecific identity as factors; interaction: p = 5.1E-04, post hoc Sidak tests: Saline: p = 001, CNO: p = 0.091; discrimination score: one sample t-test, Saline: p = 0.012, CNO: p = 0.208). Importantly, control (mCherry) mice exhibited a strong preference for the novel conspecific over the familiar conspecific in both saline and CNO conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E</xref>; two-factor ANOVA with drug condition and conspecific identity as factors; interaction: p = 0.307, main effect of conspecific identity p = 6.8E-04, post hoc Sidak tests; Saline: p = 2.2E-04, CNO: p = 0.0031; discrimination score: one sample t-test, Saline: p = 0.045, CNO: p = 0.032).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we found that, unlike with vHPC-LS inhibition, inhibiting LS-VTA neurons appears to cause a trend towards disrupting the mice’s normal preference for familiar foods. Inhibiting the activity of LS-VTA neurons caused mice to trend towards spending equal amounts of time in the proximity of novel and familiar foods (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J, K</xref>; two-factor ANOVA with drug condition and food identity as factors; interaction: p = 0.076; discrimination score: one sample t-test, Saline: p = 0.065, CNO: p = 0.863).

<p>Additionally, we were able to confirm that these effects observed with LS-VTA inhibition were not driven by non-specific effects on anxiety-related behaviors. We observed that CNO administration had no effect on the time spent in the center of the open field arena in both control and hM4Di animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L, N</xref>; paired t-test, mCherry: p = 0.2196, hM4Di: p = 0.2182). We also observed that CNO administration did not affect speed of the animals in both control and hM4Di animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M, O</xref>; paired t-test, mCherry: p = 0.0733, NpHR: p = 0.7193).</p>
<p>These findings provide compelling evidence that the increased investigation observed with vHPC-LS inhibition is mediated via its projection onto the VTA. Dopamine neurons in the VTA show increased activity while mice investigate a novel conspecific and are known to be involved in causally driving increased investigation of a novel conspecific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Together, these findings raise the intriguing possibility that silencing vHPC-LS neurons could disinhibit dopamine neurons in the VTA, which, in turn, could drive increased approach and investigation of a conspecific. Although we have established LS projects to the VTA, it is unclear if LS projects to the dopaminergic neurons in the VTA.</p>

<title>LS neurons synapse directly onto dopamine neurons in the VTA</title>
<p>To determine if LS neurons synapse directly onto dopamine neurons in the VTA, we mapped monosynaptic inputs onto dopaminergic neurons in the VTA ( VTA<sub>DA</sub>) by applying the modified rabies tracing method in Th-Cre<sup>+</sup> mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we show that chemogenetically and optogenetically silencing vHPC-LS neurons disrupts the ability of mice to preferentially investigate a novel conspecific. Furthermore, closed-loop, spatially constrained optogenetic inhibition of vHPC-LS neurons increased investigation of the mouse paired with inhibition. These findings led us to hypothesize that inhibiting vHPC-LS neurons could increase preference for a conspecific by disinhibiting the VTA, a region heavily implicated in social novelty and social approach behaviors. Consistent with this hypothesis, through monosynaptic rabies tracing experiments, we found that vHPC-LS neurons project heavily to the VTA. We next discovered that chemogenetic silencing of LS-VTA neurons also disrupted the ability of mice to preferentially engage with a novel conspecific. Finally, using monosynaptic rabies tracing technology in Th-Cre+ mice, we found that dopaminergic neurons in the VTA receive direct monosynaptic inputs from the LS. Given that LS neurons synapse directly onto VTA dopamine neurons, inhibiting vHPC-LS neurons could disinhibit VTA dopamine neurons, thus driving increased social approach and investigation. We have identified a circuit necessary for mice to differentially investigate novel and familiar conspecifics.</p>
<p>Rodents, including mice, behave differently around novel and familiar conspecifics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. When given a choice, mice preferentially spend more time near a novel mouse than a familiar mouse. In rodents, optogenetic and imaging experiments have identified the vHPC to be causally involved in distinguishing between familiar and novel conspecifics. However, how information about the conspecific identity thought to be primarily encoded in the vHPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> is transformed to drive increased approach and investigation of a novel individual remains poorly understood. In particular, it remains unclear which structures downstream of the hippocampus play a role in regulating differential investigation of a novel over a familiar conspecific. The vHPC sends dense projections onto the nucleus accumbens (NAc), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the LS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Recent studies have suggested a key role for hippocampal projections to the mPFC and the NAc in discriminating between novel and familiar conspecifics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. However, some questions remain. While optogenetic inhibition of vHPC-NAc neurons disrupted the ability of mice to discriminate novel and familiar conspecifics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, chemogenetic manipulation of vHPC-NAc neurons did not affect preference for a novel conspecific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, while chemogenetic manipulation of vHPC-mPFC activity disrupted the formation of social memory, its effects on modulating social preference for the novel mouse during acute recall in wildtype mice remains less obvious<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, raising the possibility that an alternative pathway from the vHPC could help mice engage in differential social behavior when presented with a novel and familiar conspecific. In our study, using optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations, we have found that the vHPC-LS pathway plays a key role in modulating preference for a novel conspecific.</p>
<p>vCA1 neurons respond robustly in the proximity of conspecifics and subsets of vCA1 neurons are known to preferentially respond in the proximity of familiar conspecifics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Additionally, a larger fraction of vCA1 neurons respond in the proximity of a familiar conspecific compared to a novel conspecific in a social discrimination assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Thus, raising the possibility that lowering the levels of vCA1 neuron activity could create a perception of social novelty and could result in increased investigation of a mouse. Consistent with this idea, we found that optogenetically silencing vHPC-LS neurons increased investigation of the mouse paired with investigation. Findings from our rabies tracing findings show that both vCA1 and vCA3 neurons project to the LS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J, K</xref>). The viral injections in our study were set up to target the vHPC broadly, labeling both vCA1 and vCA3 neurons projecting to the LS. Therefore, the behavioral effects observed with the chemogenetic and optogenetic experiments cannot be localized to only the vCA1 or the vCA3 neurons specifically. A recent study showed that vCA1 and vCA3 neurons differentially modulate approach avoidance conflict task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. While silencing vCA1 neurons induced increased avoidance of a conflict cue, silencing vCA1 neurons resulted in increased approach of the conflict cue. Additionally, recent data suggests that vCA1 and vCA3 neurons form parallel septal pathways that play differential roles in modulating approach avoidance behaviors in response to conflict cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Given that vHPC-LS inhibition did not have any effect on object (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N, O</xref>) or food preference (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J, K</xref>) in our study, it is unclear if the same vHPC-LS circuits involved in conflict approach/avoidance are also involved in mediating the preference and approach elicited by a novel conspecific. Thus, future studies specifically targeting and manipulating only vCA1 or vCA3 inputs to the LS are necessary to determine if these parallel pathways play differential roles in mediating preferential investigation of a novel conspecific over a familiar conspecific.</p>
<p>The LS, with connections to downstream regions that are heavily implicated in mediating social behaviors, like the NAc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, VTA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (vmH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, is well positioned to translate the social recognition related information it receives from the vHPC into motivated behaviors. In this study, we focused on the LS projections to the VTA, a region that has been shown to play a key role in modulating social novelty. Dopamine neurons in the VTA have been shown to be differentially modulated by novel and familiar conspecifics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Chemogenetic inhibition of dopamine neurons in the VTA attenuates investigation of a novel conspecific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We therefore hypothesized that the LS could regulate social novelty preference by modulating the activity of dopamine neurons in the VTA. Using transsynaptic rabies tracing, we identified direct monosynaptic inputs from the LS onto dopamine neurons in the VTA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, we found that inhibiting LS-VTA neurons disrupted the ability of mice to preferentially investigate a novel conspecific.</p>
<p>Unlike the socially specific effects observed with vHPC-LS inhibition, LS-VTA inhibition also disrupted the natural preference that mice exhibit towards investigating familiar foods (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J, K</xref>). These findings suggest that LS-VTA neurons are more broadly involved in mediating preference for a variety of ethologically relevant stimuli. Consistent with this idea, VTA dopamine neurons are known to play a key role in mediating the motivation to seek both food rewards and social investigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Additionally, a large proportion of individual VTA<sub>DA</sub> neurons respond to both food and social stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. VTA<sub>DA</sub> neurons are active during both the consumption of familiar palatable food and during increased investigation of a novel conspecific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Thus, inhibiting LS neurons that project to the VTA (including VTA<sub>DA</sub> neurons) could disrupt both social and food seeking behaviors.</p>
<p>Although our data support the view that inhibition of LS-VTA neurons could be exerting an effect on social novelty preference behaviors by directly modulating the activity of dopamine neurons in the VTA, it remains unknown if LS-VTA neurons also act on GABAergic neurons in the VTA. Local infusions of GABA into the caudodorsal LS was shown to both increase and decrease the responses of VTA neurons in response to stimulation of vCA3 neurons, raising the possibility that LS neurons could project to GABAergic neurons in the VTA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, it remains to be determined if GABAergic neurons in the VTA receive direct monosynaptic input from the LS. Additionally, future recording and imaging experiments are needed to determine what information LS-VTA neurons encode. For instance, sibling and non-sibling odor representations are anatomically organized along the dorsoventral axis of the LS neurons in rat pups and lesions to the LS disrupt the ability of rat pups to distinguish between kin and non-kin odors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. These findings raise two interesting questions. First, are social familiarity and novelty information differentially represented in the dorsal and ventral populations of LS neurons? Second, are the dorsally located LS-VTA neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) necessary for kin recognition? Addressing these questions might provide insight into whether different kinds of recognition information (kin/non-kin, novel/familiar) and context information are integrated and transformed into approach and avoidance behaviors at the level of the LS.</p>
<p>In line with the above ideas, neurons from other hippocampal compartments, besides vCA1 and vCA3. including the dCA3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>) and dCA2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> project to the lateral septum. These hippocampal projections have also been implicated in mediating social novelty behaviors. For example, activating dCA3-LS neurons was sufficient to restore social novelty preference deficits induced by chronic social defeat stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Interestingly, another study found that silencing the vCA3 neurons but not dCA3 neurons disrupted the ability of mice to differentially investigate familiar versus novel animals in control mice (not defeated/stressed)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. This raises the intriguing possibility that, first, social recognition information is represented in a distributed fashion across the various hippocampal compartments and that parallel hippocampal-septal pathways are differentially recruited in a context and internal state-dependent fashion to transform social novelty/ familiarity information into decisions to approach or avoid a conspecific.</p>
<p>Mounting evidence suggests a key role for the lateral septum in modulating a broad range of motivated social behaviors. In addition to the role we are suggesting for the vCA1-LS pathway in modulating social novelty preference, a recent study demonstrated that corticotropin-releasing hormone released by infralimbic (IL) neurons projecting to the rostral LS acts to suppress investigation of a familiar conspecific, thus promoting a relative increase in investigation of a novel conspecific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Beyond social novelty/familiarity behaviors, the lateral septum plays a key role in modulating aggression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> and in modulating social reward seeking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Dorsal LS neurons are known to inhibit ventral LS neurons via local collaterals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Based on this evidence, it has been hypothesized that lateral inhibition between various LS populations could allow for selecting one behavioral output while suppressing the other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. For example, increased activity in the ventral LS could suppress dorsal LS and disinhibit regions downstream of the dorsal LS, such as the NAc and the VTA thus promoting increased social approach and investigation while simultaneously suppressing aggression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Thus, providing an exciting framework in which the LS could play a key role in regulating mutually exclusive social behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although we focused largely on social novelty seeking behavior, there is evidence that the hippocampal-septal circuitry plays a role in context-dependent modulation of behavior in a variety of contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Although, we saw no effects in the ability of the mice to discriminate between novel and familiar foods with vHPC-LS inhibition in a discrimination assay in which the mice could smell but not access the food, a study found that activation of glutamatergic vHPC-LS neurons suppressed food intake in the home cage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Additionally, a recent study suggests that vHPC-LS neurons are necessary for mice to learn food reward - location associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. It is unclear if this finding extends to socially rewarding stimuli. It also remains to be seen if the same vHPC-LS neurons/subcircuits that are involved in mediating social preference also modulate other motivated behaviors.</p>
<p>In summary, we identify a novel vHPC-LS-VTA pathway that regulates social novelty preference. Our study provides insight into how social memory related information is transformed into motivated social behaviors. Our study lays the groundwork for future experiments that could help us understand how these circuits might be disrupted in neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer’s disease, in which the ability of individuals to recognize and engage in appropriate social behaviors is dramatically affected.</p>

<p>Mice were anesthetized with Euthasol (0.1 mg/kg) then transcardially perfused using PBS (0.5X) followed by 4% PFA. Brains were extracted, left in PFA overnight, then transferred to a 30% sucrose solution the following day. A microtome (Leica Biosystems) was used to slice the coronal sections (50 um) and validate viral targeting. Slices were mounted using DAPI Fluoromount (Southern Biotech). All mounted sections were imaged using a high throughput automated stitching fluorescent microscope (Keyence BZ-X810).

<title>Behavioral Assays</title>

<sec id="s5j">
<title>Social Discrimination Task (SDT)</title>
<p>All mice used in this assay were ∼ 8 weeks old. The social discrimination chamber (58.42 cm x 25.4 cm x 22.86 cm) contains two cages housing age and sex-matched stimulus mice (cage diameter = 7.62 cm) at opposite ends of the chamber. Prior to being run on the social discrimination assay, the test mouse was co-housed with a same sex, age-matched conspecific for 72 hours to familiarize. The test mice were then allowed to explore the chamber containing both a novel and familiar stimulus mouse for 5 minutes. The location of the novel and familiar mice (left and versus right) was counterbalanced to eliminate side preferences. Behavior was tracked using an overhead camera and the position of the mouse in the arena was tracked using the open-source software Bonsai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Percent time spent was calculated by measuring the amount of time the test mouse spent around each encaged social target (diameter of the social zone - 60 mm) relative to the entire assay duration.</p>
<p>For chemogenetic experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), ∼ 3−4 weeks after viral injection, mice expressing either the inhibitory DREADDs or mCherry received intraperitoneal injections of either Clozapine-N-Oxide (HelloBio, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline (0.2 mL, i.p.) 30 minutes prior to being run on the behavioral assay. Mice were not given more than one CNO injection per day.</p>
<p>For vHPC-LS cell body optogenetic inhibition experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), we used the Bonsai software to track the position of the test mouse in real-time and used this information to specifically inhibit the activity of vHPC-LS neurons only in the proximity of a particular conspecific (social zone diameter: 60mm). The real-time tracking data from Bonsai was used to gate a green laser source via a TTL driver (Pulse Pal, Sanworks). Thus, the green laser source connected to the implanted fibers (532 nm, 6 mW, constant light - at the fiber tip) was turned on when the animal moved into only one of the social zones (either novel or familiar) and remained on until the animal moved out of the zone. The other social zone remained as a control zone and was not paired with light. Time spent by the mice in each zone was later estimated as described above.</p>
<p>For the novel versus familiar comparisons, both NpHR and EGFP mice were run on this assay across several conditions. Condition 1 - control condition-no stimulation paired with either the novel or the familiar mouse. Condition 2 - stimulation around the novel but not familiar animals. Condition 3 - stimulation around the familiar but not novel animal.</p>
<p>The same NpHR and EGFP mice were also run through a novel vs novel mouse experiment. In this experiment, the zone around one of the two novel mice was randomly designated as the stimulation zone, and entry into this zone was paired with green light illumination (light conditions same as above). Time spent by the mice in each of the two zones was estimated using Bonsai.</p>

<sec id="s5k">
<title>Food Discrimination Task</title>
<p>Arena and handling procedures are identical to SDT. Familiar food was the chow (3g, LabDiet), while the novel food was a 3g of fruit-flavored cereal. Food was placed under wired cages, such that mice could sniff but not taste the food. Mice were given 5 minutes to explore the arena containing the novel and familiar food. Percent time spent around the novel and familiar food was calculated by measuring the amount of time the test mouse spent around the cage containing the food (diameter of food zone - 6 cm) relative to the entire assay duration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5l">
<title>Object Discrimination Task</title>
<p>Arena and handling procedures are identical to SDT. An object was placed into the home cage of test mice for 72 hours of familiarization. The objects were placed on the opposite ends of the discrimination chamber (without wired cages), and mice were given 5 minutes to explore the novel and familiar objects. For chemogenetic manipulation, procedures were performed identically to the SDT. Novel and familiar objects were placed on either the left or the right side of the chamber in a counterbalanced fashion.</p>
<p>For spatially-restricted optogenetic manipulation, mice were allowed to investigate two novel objects in an arena for 5 minutes. In the light ON condition, one of the two objects picked randomly was paired with green light stimulation (532nm, 6mW at the fiber tip constant light stimulation). Behavior recording conditions and laser conditions were identical to SDT.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5m">
<title>Open Field</title>
<p>Mice were allowed to freely explore a large square chamber (46.64 cm x 46.64 cm) for 10 minutes. We determined the amount of time mice spent in the middle of the arena (11.14 cm x 11.14 cm) using Bonsai and MATLAB. For chemogenetic experiments, mice were injected with either saline or CNO 30 minutes prior to the test. For the vHPC-LS cell body inhibition experiment, the open field task was 9 minutes long. Mice performed the assay for 3 minutes with no light stimulation, followed by 3 minutes of green light stimulation (532 nm, 6 mW at the tip of the optical fiber; constant light illumination) and terminated with an additional 3 minutes of no light.</p>

<title>Discrimination Score</title>

<p>The velocity of animals within the Open Field task was determined by calculating distance traveled per unit of time and centroid positioning using Bonsai, an open source tracking software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Velocity was determined by change in centimeters moved over change in seconds.</p>

<title>Whole Brain</title>
<p>The open source WholeBrain software package in R allows for the annotation, analysis, and visualization of cellular resolution tracing in an interactive brain atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The Whole Brain software was used specifically to register individual brain sections from animals onto the Allen common coordinate framework. It was used to map input neurons in rabies tracing experiments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p>

<p>In the projection-specific inactivation experiments, all mice received CNO (Sigma; 1 mg/kg, i.p., in 2% DMSO and saline, 1 ml/ 100 g), regardless of virus condition, to equally expose animals to any unintended consequences of CNO. CNO was always administered 30 min prior to the behavioral experiment.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Analyses were performed using PRISM GraphPad, MATLAB, and RStudio. One-way ANOVA or unpaired t-tests were used to compare discrimination scores and velocity. Two-factor ANOVAs were used for social discrimination scores and open field analyses. In the case of unequal variances, Welch’s ANOVA was used. Tukey’s post hoc tests or paired t-tests were used in the case of significant interactions or main effects with &gt;2 groups and are indicated in the figure with p-value annotations being * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001. Unless otherwise indicated, all tests are two-tailed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study investigated the neural circuits underlying social novelty preference in mice. Using viral circuit tracing, chemogenetics, and optogenetics in the vHPC, LS, and VTA, the authors found that vHPC to LS projections may contribute to the salience of social novelty investigations. In addition, the authors identify LS projections to the VTA involved in social novelty and familiar food responses. Finally, via viral tracing, they demonstrate that vHPC-LS neurons may establish direct monosynaptic connections with VTA dopaminergic neurons. The experiments are well-designed, and the conclusions are mostly very clear. The manuscript is well-written and logically organized, and the content will be of interest to specialists in the field and to the broad readership of the journal.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The vHPC has been involved in social memory for novel and familiar conspecifics. Yet, how the vHPC conveys this information to drive motivation for novel social investigations remains unclear. The authors identified a pathway from the vHPC to the LS and eventually the VTA, that may be involved in this process.</p>
<p>(2) Mice became familiar with a novel conspecific by co-housing for 72h. This represents a familiarization session with a longer duration as compared to previous literature. Using this new protocol, the authors found robust social novelty preference when animals were given a choice between a novel and familiar conspecific.</p>
<p>(3) The effects of vHPC-LS inhibition are specific to novel social stimuli. The authors included novel food and novel object control experiments and those were not affected by neuronal manipulations.</p>
<p>(4) For optogenetic studies, the authors applied closed-loop photoinhibition only when the animals investigated either the novel conspecific or the familiar. This optogenetic approach allowed for the investigation of functional manipulations to selective novel or familiar stimuli approaches.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The abstract and the overall manuscript pose that the authors identified a novel vHPC-LS-VTA pathway that is necessary for mice to preferentially investigate novel conspecifics. However, the authors assessed the functional manipulations of vHPC-LS and LS-VTA circuits independently and the sentence could be misleading. Therefore, a viral strategy specifically designed to target the vHPC-LS-VTA circuit combined with optogenetic/chemogenetic tools and behavior may be necessary for the statement of this conclusion.</p>
<p>(2) The authors combined males and females in their analysis, as neural circuit manipulation affected novelty discrimination ratios in both sexes. However, supplementary Figure 1 demonstrates the chemogentic inhibition of vHPC-LS circuit may cause stronger effects in male mice as compared to females.</p>
<p>(3) In most experiments, the same animals were used for social novelty preference, for food or object novelty responses but washout periods between experiments are not mentioned in the methods section. In this line, the authors did not mention the time frame between the closed-loop optogenetic experiments that silenced the vHPC-LS only during familiar and then only novel social investigations. When using the same animals tested for social experiments in the same context there may be an effect of context-dependent social behaviors that could affect future outcomes.</p>
<p>(4) All the experiments were performed in a non-cell-type-specific manner. The viral strategies used targeted multiple neuronal subpopulations that could have divergent effects on social novelty preference. This constraint could be added in the discussion section.</p>
<p>(5) The authors' assumptions were all based on experiments of necessity. The authors could use an experiment of sufficiency by targeting for instance the LS-VTA circuit and assess if animals reduce novel social investigations with LS-VTA photostimulation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Rashid and colleagues demonstrate a novel hippocampal lateral septal circuit that is important for social recognition and drives the exploration of novel conspecifics. Their study spans from neural tracing to close-loop optogenetic experiments with clever controls and conditions to provide compelling evidence for their conclusion. They demonstrate that downstream of the hippocampal septal circuit, septal projections to the ventral tegmental area are necessary for general novelty discrimination. The study opens an avenue to study these circuits further to uncover the plasticity and synaptic mechanisms regulating social novelty preference.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Chemogenetic and optogenetic experiments have excellent behavioral controls. The synaptic tracing provides important information that informs the narrative of experiments presented and invites future studies to investigate the effects of septal input on dopaminergic activity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are unclear methodological important details for circuit manipulation experiments and analyses where multiple measures are needed but missing. Based on the legends, the chemogenetic experiment is done in a within-animal design. That is the same mouse receives SAL and CNO. However, the data is not presented in a within-animal manner such that we can distinguish if the behavior of the same animal changes with drug treatment. Similarly, the methods specify that the optogenetic manipulations were done in three different conditions, but the analyses do not report within-animal changes across conditions nor account for multiple measures within subjects. Finally, it is unclear if the order of drug treatment and conditions were counterbalanced across subjects.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback. We are excited that both reviewers thought that the manuscript was of “interest to specialists in the field and to the broad readership of the journal”, that the paper was “well-written and logically organized” and that the “study opens an avenue to study these circuits further to uncover the plasticity and synaptic mechanisms regulating social novelty preference.” Additionally, the reviewers wrote that the experiments were “well-designed”  “with clever controls and conditions to provide compelling evidence for their conclusion.” The reviewers additionally provided constructive feedback, which we address in our responses below.</p>

<p>The study investigated the neural circuits underlying social novelty preference in mice.

In addition, the authors identify LS projections to the VTA involved in social novelty and familiar food responses. Finally, via viral tracing, they demonstrate that vHPC-LS neurons may establish direct monosynaptic connections with VTA dopaminergic neurons. The experiments are well-designed, and the conclusions are mostly very clear. The manuscript is well-written and logically organized, and the content will be of interest to specialists in the field and to the broad readership of the journal.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The vHPC has been involved in social memory for novel and familiar conspecifics. Yet, how the vHPC conveys this information to drive motivation for novel social investigations remains unclear.

<p>(3) The effects of vHPC-LS inhibition are specific to novel social stimuli. The authors included novel food and novel object control experiments and those were not affected by neuronal manipulations.</p>
<p>(4) For optogenetic studies, the authors applied closed-loop photoinhibition only when the animals investigated either the novel conspecific or the familiar. This optogenetic approach allowed for the investigation of functional manipulations to selective novel or familiar stimuli approaches.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The abstract and the overall manuscript pose that the authors identified a novel vHPC-LS-VTA pathway that is necessary for mice to preferentially investigate novel conspecifics. However, the authors assessed the functional manipulations of vHPC-LS and LS-VTA circuits independently and the sentence could be misleading. Therefore, a viral strategy specifically designed to target the vHPC-LS-VTA circuit combined with optogenetic/chemogenetic tools and behavior may be necessary for the statement of this conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an important point. Although Figure 3 shows that vHPC (vCA1 and vCA3) is the source of the greatest number of monosynaptic inputs onto LS-VTA neurons, we did not perform any experiments that specifically manipulated vHPC neurons that project to LS-VTA neurons. While these experiments would be extremely interesting, they are technically challenging and beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors combined males and females in their analysis, as neural circuit manipulation affected novelty discrimination ratios in both sexes. However, supplementary Figure 1 demonstrates the chemogentic inhibition of vHPC-LS circuit may cause stronger effects in male mice as compared to females.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer makes an interesting point. We can confirm that we found no significant differences in the effectiveness of our vHPC-LS inhibition between the males and females (2-factor ANOVA with sex (male/female) and drug condition (saline/CNO) as factors on the discrimination scores of hM4Di expressing animals: interaction p=0.2241, sex: p=0.1233, drug condition: p=0.0166). These data suggest that there are no significant sex differences in the effectiveness of inhibition of the vHPC-LS neurons.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important clarification. We apologize for not including these crucial details in our Methods section. For both the chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibition experiments, all conditions were separated by a minimum of 24 hours. In the chemogenetic inhibition experiments, saline and CNO conditions were counterbalanced between animals. Similarly, we counterbalanced the order of light ON vs light OFF conditions across animals during our optogenetic inhibition experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) All the experiments were performed in a non-cell-type-specific manner. The viral strategies used targeted multiple neuronal subpopulations that could have divergent effects on social novelty preference. This constraint could be added in the discussion section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an important point. In our study, while we specifically manipulate projection populations (either vHPC-LS or LS-VTA), it is possible that these projection populations themselves are composed of heterogeneous cell types. It would be an interesting direction of study to pursue in the future.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewers that it would be interesting to determine if LS-VTA neurons are sufficient, in addition to being necessary, to drive social novelty. These will be interesting experiments to pursue in the future.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Rashid and colleagues demonstrate a novel hippocampal lateral septal circuit that is important for social recognition and drives the exploration of novel conspecifics. Their study spans from neural tracing to close-loop optogenetic experiments with clever controls and conditions to provide compelling evidence for their conclusion. They demonstrate that downstream of the hippocampal septal circuit, septal projections to the ventral tegmental area are necessary for general novelty discrimination. The study opens an avenue to study these circuits further to uncover the plasticity and synaptic mechanisms regulating social novelty preference.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Chemogenetic and optogenetic experiments have excellent behavioral controls. The synaptic tracing provides important information that informs the narrative of experiments presented and invites future studies to investigate the effects of septal input on dopaminergic activity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are unclear methodological important details for circuit manipulation experiments and analyses where multiple measures are needed but missing. Based on the legends, the chemogenetic experiment is done in a within-animal design. That is the same mouse receives SAL and CNO. However, the data is not presented in a within-animal manner such that we can distinguish if the behavior of the same animal changes with drug treatment. Similarly, the methods specify that the optogenetic manipulations were done in three different conditions, but the analyses do not report within-animal changes across conditions nor account for multiple measures within subjects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this important point. We agree that a repeated measures ANOVA would be ideal, but there is sufficient behavioral variability that such analyses will be difficult without very large sample sizes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, it is unclear if the order of drug treatment and conditions were counterbalanced across subjects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned in the above response to Reviewer 1, for both the chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibition experiments, all conditions were separated by a minimum of 24 hours and we counterbalanced the order of chemogenetic (saline/CNO) and optogenetic (light ON/light OFF) experimental manipulations across animals.</p>
