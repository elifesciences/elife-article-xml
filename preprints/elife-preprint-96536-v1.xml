<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Mitochondrial biogenesis requires the expression of genes encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. However, aside from a handful transcriptional factors regulating specific subsets of mitochondrial genes, the overall architecture of the transcriptional control of mitochondrial biogenesis remains to be elucidated. The mechanisms coordinating these two genomes are largely unknown. We performed a targeted RNAi screen in developing eyes with reduced mitochondrial DNA content, anticipating a synergistic disruption of tissue development due to impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and mtDNA deficiency. Among 638 transcription factors annotated in Drosophila genome, 77 were identified as potential regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis. Utilizing published ChIP-seq data of positive hits, we constructed a regulatory network, revealing the logic of the transcription regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Multiple transcription factors in core layers had extensive connections, collectively governing the expression of nearly all mitochondrial genes, whereas factors sitting on the top layer may respond to cellular cues to modulate mitochondrial biogenesis through the underlying network. CG1603, a core component of the network, was found to be indispensable for the expression of most nuclear mitochondrial genes, including those required for mtDNA maintenance and gene expression, thus coordinating nuclear genome and mtDNA activities in mitochondrial biogenies. Additional genetics analyses validated YL-1, a transcription factor upstream of CG1603 in the network, as a regulator controlling CG1603 expression and mitochondrial biogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mitochondria respiration, carried out by the electron transport chain complexes (ETC), converts the energy in chemical fuels to the electrochemical potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane (Δψ<sub>m</sub>) that drives the synthesis of ATP. Deficient ETC not only impairs energy metabolism, but may also disrupt cellular redox balance and various biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Shen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Spinelli and Haigis, 2018</xref>), and is associated with various human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gorman et al., 2016</xref>). Mitochondria are under dual genetic control. Their own genome, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes 13 core subunits of ETC, alongside 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs that are required for the translation of these protein-coding genes inside the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of more than 1000 mitochondrial proteins including the remaining ETC subunits, factors for mtDNA replication and transcription, and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are all encoded on the nuclear genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hock and Kralli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Taylor and Turnbull, 2005</xref>). The mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) compacts mtDNA into nucleoids and is a key regulator of mtDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scarpulla, 2008</xref>). TFAM, together with other auxiliary factors including mtTFB1 and mtTFB2, promotes the transcription of mtDNA by mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) into long polycistronic precursor RNAs, which are further processed into individual RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Falkenberg et al., 2002</xref>). POLRMT can also generate short RNA oligos, owning to its exoribonuclease activity, to prime mtDNA replication by polymerase γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in cytoplasm and imported into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wiedemann and Pfanner, 2017</xref>). Hence, mitochondrial biogenesis is influenced by the abundance and activities of mitochondrial translocases as well. The intricate interplay between mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded components demands coordinate activities of these two genomes, to maintain the efficiency and integrity of oxidative phosphorylation system and other critical mitochondrial processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hock and Kralli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scarpulla, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Mitochondrial respiration, particularly, the contents and the activity of ETC, is fine tuned to cope with the developmental and tissue-specific metabolic demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fernandez-Vizarra et al., 2011</xref>). Various transcriptional cascades have emerged as effective and adaptable mechanisms regulating ETC biogenesis. The nuclear respiration factors, NRF1 and NRF2 activate the expression of many nuclear-encoded ETC subunits and genes essential for mtDNA replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scarpulla, 2008</xref>). This regulation allows NRFs to indirectly control the expression of mtDNA-encoded genes, and hence coordinate the activities of both genomes in ETC biogenesis. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), upon activation by diverse lipid ligands, induce the expression of nuclear genes in fatty acids oxidation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berger and Moller, 2002</xref>). Another family of nuclear receptors, the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) regulate nuclear genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, including ETCs and the citric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Deblois and Giguere, 2011</xref>). Notably, all forementioned transcription factors share a common co-activator, PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) that directly stimulates the basal transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Finck and Kelly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hock and Kralli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Scarpulla et al., 2012</xref>). PGC-1α and related coactivators are dynamically regulated in responses to various physiological or environmental cues, to adjust metabolic program and energy metabolism accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hock and Kralli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Scarpulla <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Members of PPARs or ERRs families often show tissue-specific expression and regulate subsets of mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Deblois and Giguere, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hock and Kralli, 2009</xref>). However, given the large number and diverse evolution origins of mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kurland and Andersson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rath et al., 2021</xref>), the current understanding on transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial biogenies appears incomplete. Additionally, mechanisms coordinating nuclear genome and mtDNA activities in ETC biogenesis remain unclear.</p>
<p>Recently, the ModERN (model organism Encyclopedia of Regulatory Networks) project generated genome-wide binding profiles of a large set of transcription factors in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kudron et al., 2018</xref>). The global mapping of transcription factor (TF)-DNA interactions could potentially be applied to identify the transcriptional network governing mitochondrial biogenesis. However, the DNA binding profiles of TFs have their limitations in understanding the true biological functions of TFs in gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jiang and Mortazavi, 2018</xref>). Gene expression is, in most cases, subject to the combined influences of multiple TFs. Additionally, an individual TF may have either activating or repressive roles based on the local chromatin environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jiang and Mortazavi, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, despite the substantial progress in bioinformatics analyses, the interpretation of genome-wide omics data still has its limitations due to a lack of robust statistical algorithms, variations in biological contexts, and intrinsic experimental variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Angelini and Costa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). The integration of the DNA binding profiles with functional genetic and genomic studies is ideal to study gene expression regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jiang and Mortazavi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Park, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye is an excellent model for genetic analyses due to its ease of assessment and minimal impact on other physiological processes in the presence of developmental abnormalities. The cell proliferation and differentiation during eye development require robust mitochondrial respiration, and adult eyes are severely disrupted by mutations affecting nuclear ETC subunits or mitochondrial translation apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Owusu-Ansah et al., 2008</xref>). We previously developed a genetic scheme to generate mtDNA deficiency by expressing a mitochondrially targeted restriction enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we performed a RNAi screen, targeting 638 transcription factors annotated in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome, in the presence of mtDNA deficiency in developing eyes. We recovered 77 TFs, RNAi against which had synergistic effects with the mtDNA deficiency in causing the small-eye phenotype. We further followed up on CG1603, one of the strongest hits from the initial modifier screen and revealed that it was essential for coordinating nuclear genome and mtDNA for ETC biogenesis. Additional network analyses on the recovered hits using published DNA binding profiles illustrated potential regulatory connections and a complex hierarchy of the transcription regulations on mitochondrial biogenesis. The combination of genetic and bioinformatic analyses also facilitated the identification of YL-1 as an upstream regulator of CG1603.</p>

<title>The design of a genetic modifier screen for genes regulating mtDNA maintenance and expression</title>
<p>Mutations on nuclear-encoded ETC genes block cell cycle and disrupt the differentiation and morphogenesis of developing eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mandal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Owusu-Ansah <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). RNAi against <italic>tfam</italic> or <italic>myc</italic>, which promotes the expression of ETC genes encoded on mtDNA and nuclear genome, respectively, also reduced adult eye size (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic>). These observations prompted us to use fly eye as a model to identify transcription factors regulating ETC biogenesis. However, inhibitions of any genes essential for cell viability, proliferation, or differentiation, exemplified by RNAi targeting a mitotic cyclin, <italic>CycB</italic> (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic>), would disrupt eye development. Therefore, assaying eye morphology alone is not sufficient to enrich candidates regulating ETC biogenesis.</p>

<p>The mitochondrial genome of wt <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> contains a single XhoI site. The expression of a mitochondrially targeted restriction enzyme, XhoI (MitoXhoI) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary effectively selects for escaper progeny carrying mtDNA mutations that abolish the XhoI site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). In a heteroplasmic background containing both wild type and XhoI resistant genome (<italic>XhoI<sup>-</sup></italic>), the expression of MitoXhoI can effectively remove the wild type genome and hence generate mtDNA deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). As a result, the adult eyes were slightly smaller than the control (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic>). Considering that mtDNA encodes core components of ETC, we reasoned that inhibiting a gene related ETC biogenesis would have synergistic effect with the mtDNA deficiency on eye development, and the combination of these two genetic manipulations should lead to a stronger disruption of eye development than either of these conditions individually <italic>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>)</italic>. On this basis, we devised a scheme of modifier screen in eye for genes involved in ETC biogenesis <italic>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>)</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>The RNAi modifier screen identifying transcription factors regulating ETC biogenesis</title>
<p>To assess the efficacy of this scheme, we carried out a pilot RNAi screen, covering 124 nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and 58 non-mitochondrial genes annotated in various cellular processes (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-E</xref></italic>, and <italic>Supplementary file 1</italic>). In practice, male flies carrying a <italic>UAS-IR</italic> transgene were crossed with <italic>Sco/CyO, mitoXhoI; eyeless-GAL4</italic> heteroplasmic female flies (carrying both wild type and <italic>XhoI<sup>-</sup></italic> mtDNA). This cross generated two groups of offspring, RNAi-only and RNAi together with MitoXhoI expression (RNAi+MitoXhoI) that were cultured in a same vial, thereby minimizing any potential discrepancy caused by environmental factors. Most RNAi flies survived to adult stage but had reduced eye size. A few RNAi flies were lethal at pupae stage, due to a lack of head capsule that is derived from the eye antenna disc.</p>
<p>For most genes tested in the pilot screen, eyes of RNAi+MitoXhoI flies were smaller than the corresponding RNAi-only flies. To rule out a simple additive effect between RNAi and MitoXhoI expression, we carried out additional analyses to semi-quantify a potential synergy between RNAi intervention and mtDNA deficiency caused by MitoXhoI expression. The eye size of progeny was arbitrarily scored on a scale from 0 to 5 (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></italic>). The indexes of eye size reduction (Index-R) of RNAi and RNAi+MitoXhoI flies were calculated by normalizing the mean eye size scores of each genotype to the corresponding values of control RNAi or control RNAi+MitoXhoI, respectively, and were subsequently plotted against each other on a linear graph (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></italic>). If a RNAi intervention had synergistic effect with mtDNA deficiency, it would lie below the diagonal line. We also included <italic>ewg</italic>, the fly homolog of <italic>NRF-1</italic>, in the pilot screen to set the threshold for calling out positive hits. Of total 40 genes that are related to ETC biogenesis (Mito-EBR) including ETC subunits, mitochondrial protein import and membrane insertion machinery, ETC assembly factors, and proteins related to the expression of mtDNA-encoded ETC subunits, 82.5% (33 genes) emerged as enhancers (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></italic>). The proportions of synergistic enhancers were much lower in the group of genes involved in other mitochondrial processes (20.2%) or groups of other essential genes not related to mitochondria (8.6%), indicating the efficacy of this modifier screen in enriching genes related to ETC biogenesis (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>To understand transcriptional regulations of ETC biogenesis, we screened 1264 RNAi lines that cover 638 genes annotated as transcriptional regulators in <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. Total 77 enhancers were identified (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F, G</xref></italic> and <italic>Supplementary file 1</italic>), including all known factors involved in ETC biogenesis such as Myc, TFAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scarpulla, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). We also recovered 20 suppressors, of which, eyes of RNAi+MitoXhoI flies were larger than the corresponding RNAi-only flies.</p>

<title>Regulatory network of mitochondrial biogenesis</title>
<p>Among 77 TFs identified in the initial modifier screen, 49 TFs have ChIP-seq data available in modREN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kudron <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). To further understand the transcriptional regulation of ETC biogenesis, we performed the network analysis on these 49 TFs using the “<italic>vertex sort”</italic> algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jothi et al., 2009</xref>), and constructed a regulatory network (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic> and <italic>Supplementary file 2</italic>). All 49 TFs had binding sites on the promoter region of at least one nuclear mitochondrial gene (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>,</italic> <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure <italic>2—figure supplement</italic></xref> and <italic>Supplementary file 3</italic>). Respectively, 89% nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (851), including nearly all Mito-EBR genes (<italic>Supplementary file 3),</italic> were bound by at least one TF. Given that 28 hits were not included in the analyses due to a lack of ChIP-seq data, the actual coverage of total 77 TFs on nuclear mitochondrial genes would be more comprehensive. Six TFs bound to more than half of mitochondrial genes (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>,</italic> <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure <italic>2—figure supplement</italic></xref> and <italic>Supplementary file 3</italic>). However, not a single TF covered all mitochondrial genes, or all genes in a specific mitochondrial process, which is consistent with the diverse evolution origin of mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kurland and Andersson, 2000</xref>). It also indicates that there is no such a “master” regulator controlling all aspects of mitochondrial genesis. Forty-seven TFs were identified as strongly connected component due to their extensive connections and were classified in the core or bottom layer of the hierarchical structure, suggesting complexed co-regulations and potential redundancy among these TFs in controlling mitochondrial biogenesis (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic> and <italic>Supplementary file 2</italic>). Through this interconnected network, every single node can link to all 851 mitochondrial genes in the coverage. Two transcription factors, Crg-1 and CG15011 were identified as the top-layer TFs with no upstream regulators in the network (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic> and <italic>Supplementary file 2</italic>). Crg-1 is a circadian regulated gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rouyer et al., 1997</xref>).

<title>CG1603 promotes ETC gene expression and mitochondrial biogenesis</title>
<p>To validate the efficacy of this integrated genetic and bioinformatic approach, we next followed up on <italic>CG1603</italic>, one of the strongest hits from the primary screen (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, G</xref></italic>) and exhibited binding to a diverse array of genes associated with ETC biogenesis (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>,</italic> <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure <italic>2—figure supplement</italic></xref> and <italic>Supplementary file 3</italic>). <italic>CG1603</italic> RNAi slightly reduced eye size. However, the combination of <italic>CG1603</italic> RNAi with MitoXhoI expression in the heteroplasmic background resulted in markedly smaller eyes, indicating a clear synergy between the inhibition of <italic>CG1603</italic> and the mtDNA deficiency. We next asked whether CG1603 was involved in mtDNA maintenance. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut is essentially a monolayer epithelium and composed of intestine stem cells, enteroblasts, enteroendocrine cells and enterocytes (EC). The large, flattened enterocytes allow high-resolution imaging of mitochondria and mitochondrial nucleoids. Additionally, the simple organization and distinct cell types, containing both proliferative and terminally differentiated cells, render the midgut an ideal model to evaluate the impact of mitochondrial disruptions on cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). We used a “flip-out” method to activate <italic>CG1603</italic> RNAi in a subset of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Prober and Edgar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), and imaged TFAM-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), a marker for mitochondrial nucleoids in midgut clones. Both the total TFAM-GFP level and the number of mtDNA nucleoids (TFAM puncta), were markedly reduced in <italic>CG1603</italic> RNAi clones (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref></italic>), suggesting that CG1603 is necessary for maintaining the steady-state level of mtDNA. We constructed a <italic>SDHA-mNG</italic> reporter line by inserting the <italic>mNeonGreen (mNG)</italic> cDNA in-frame, downstream of the endogenous locus of <italic>SDHA</italic>, a subunit of ETC Complex II that are entirely encoded by the nuclear genome. SDHA-mNG level was notably reduced in <italic>CG1603</italic> RNAi clones (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D, E</xref></italic>), suggesting that CG1603 is also required for the expression of nuclear-encoded ETC subunits. Different from TFAM-GFP that marks mitochondrial nucleoids and appears as puncta in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), SDHA-mNG uniformly distributed in the mitochondrial matrix (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></italic>).

Collectively, these results demonstrate that CG1603 promotes the expression of both nuclear and mtDNA-encoded ETC genes and boosts mitochondrial biogenesis in general. <italic>CG1603</italic> RNAi produced very few EC clones, consistent with the notion that mitochondrial respiration is necessary for ISCs differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>).</p>

A PiggyBac transgene, <italic>PBac[SAstopDSRed]LL06826</italic> is inserted between the exons 2 and 3 of <italic>CG1603</italic> locus. This modified Piggybac mutator transgene contains splicing donors and stop codons in all 3 reading frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schuldiner et al., 2008</xref>), and thereby would disrupt the translation of the full length CG1603 protein. Homozygous <italic>PBac[SAstopDSRed]LL06826</italic> was lethal, arrested at the 2<sup>nd</sup> instar larval stage and eventually died after 10 days (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>)</italic>. Both the steady state level of mtDNA, and total mitochondrial mass assessed by the levels of several mitochondrial proteins were reduced in these larvae (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E</xref></italic>). The lethality of this PiggyBac transgene was mapped to a genomic region spanning the <italic>CG1603</italic> locus (<italic><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement A, B</xref></italic>).

Using FLP/FRT-mediated recombination, we generated homozygous <italic>CG1603<sup>PBac</sup></italic>mutant clones in both germline and follicle cells in adult ovaries.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The dual genetic control of mitochondria presents a fundamental challenge: how are the nuclear genome and mitochondrial DNA coordinated to ensure the efficiency and integrity of oxidative phosphorylation system and other critical mitochondrial processes? In <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, the mitochondrial A-kinase-anchor-protein, MDI promotes the translation of a subset of nuclear mitochondrial proteins by cytosolic ribosomes on the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). MDI’s targets are predominantly ETC subunits and proteins essential for mitochondrial genome maintenance and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). This mechanism coordinates the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes to augment the ETC biogenesis that takes place in differentiating germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Cytosolic and mitochondrial translation are up-regulated in concert to boost ETC biogenesis in budding yeast undergoing a metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Couvillion et al., 2016</xref>), further supporting the synchronized expression of ETC components from dual genetic origins at the translational level. Nevertheless, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial ETC subunits often exhibited a concordant expression pattern at the RNA level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eisen et al., 1998</xref>), and mtDNA-encoded ETC RNAs consistently exhibited similar trends, albeit with a more gradual increase compared to their nuclear-encoded counterparts accompanying the metabolic shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Couvillion <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). These observations suggest a potential coordination at the transcriptional level as well. We uncovered a zinc-finger protein encoded by the <italic>CG1603</italic> locus as a core regulator in a transcription network regulating mitochondrial biogenesis. CG1603 promoted the expression of more than half of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins and the inhibition of CG1603 severely reduced mitochondrial mass and mtDNA contents. CG1603 targets were highly enriched in nuclear-encoded ETC subunits and essential factors required for mitochondrial DNA genome maintenance and gene expression. Thus, CG1603 not only promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in general, but also affords a transcriptional coordination of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in ETC biogenies.</p>
<p>The modifier screen in the developing eyes took advantage of the mtDNA deficiency resulted from the expression of MitoXhoI in a heteroplasmic background. Besides 77 enhancers, we also recovered 20 suppressors, of which “RNAi + MitoXhoI” flies had larger eyes than “RNAi-only” (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></italic> and <italic>Supplementary file 1</italic>). Knockdown of these genes alone severely reduced eye size (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></italic> and <italic>Supplementary file 1</italic>). Noteworthy, 5 of them were lethal due to the lack of head capsule that is developed from the eye antenna disc, but the viability of these RNAi flies was restored by MitoXhoI expression. Given that MitoXhoI expression also disrupts eye development, it is perplexing that the combination of RNAi and MitoXhoI expression, two genetic conditions causing the same phenotype, led to a milder phenotype. Perhaps, mitochondrial DNA deficiency caused by MitoXhoI expression triggers a retrograde signal, which boosts cellular stress responses and thereby mitigates the cell growth defects in these RNAi backgrounds.</p>
<p>The CG1603 belong to a large family of C2H2 Zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) transcription factors that contains 272 genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flybase.org/reports/FBgg0000732.html">https://flybase.org/reports/FBgg0000732.html</ext-link>). It has one N-terminus C2H2-ZF, followed by two MADFs and a cluster of six C2H2-ZFs at the C-terminus (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></italic>). In addition to the C2H2-ZF cluster, which predominantly mediates sequence-specific DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Persikov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wolfe et al., 2000</xref>), C2H2-ZF transcription factors often possess additional N-terminal protein-protein interaction domains, such as KRAB, SCAN and BTB/POZ domains in vertebrates, ZAD and BTB/POZ in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, for binding to transcription co-regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fedotova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Perez-Torrado et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sobocinska et al., 2021</xref>). These interactions allow them to either activate or repress gene expression. CG1603 binds to the genomic regions of 4687 genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. Among these genes, 602 and 562 genes were, respectively, decreased or increased more than two folds in <italic>CG1603</italic> mutant (<italic>Supplementary file 6)</italic>. Thus, CG1603 is likely a dual-function transcription factor, capable of both activating and repressing transcription depends on the chromosomal environment of its targets. Ying Yang 1, a well characterized dual-function transcription factor in mammals, contains both a transcription activation domain and a repression domain, in addition to four C2H2-ZFs at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Verheul et al., 2020</xref>). The N-terminus C2H2-ZF and the first MADF domain of CG1603 are negatively charged, thus have a low likelihood of binding to DNA that is also negatively charged (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></italic>). In the predicted 3-D structure of CG1603, the positively charged C-terminal zinc fingers and MADF-2 domain cluster in the center, while the negatively charged N-terminal C2H2-ZF and the MADF-1 extend outward to the opposite directions (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></italic>), resembling the domain arrangement of Ying Yang 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Verheul <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). MADF domains share significant similarity with Myb/SANT domains that may bind to either DNA or proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Maheshwari et al., 2008</xref>). Some MADF domains, due to their negative charge, have been proposed to interact with positively charged histone tails, similar to the Myb/SANT domain in a well-known chromatin remodeler ISWI, suggesting a potential role in chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Maheshwari et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, some chromatin remodelers possess tandem Myb/SANT domains that can directly interact with histones and DNA or histone remodeling enzymes like ISWI and SMRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boyer et al., 2004</xref>). It is plausible that CG1603 may play a role in chromatin remodeling directly or by recruiting nucleosome remodeling factors to its binding sites, thereby modulating gene transcription in those regions.</p>
<p>Notably, CG1603 had no impact on the expression of one third of its binding genes (<italic>Supplementary file 6)</italic>, highlighting that DNA binding profiling along is not sufficient to predict the function of a transcription factor. Nonetheless, the network analyses on TFs’ ChIP-seq data allowed us to construct a potential regulatory network among these transcription factors, which subsequently served as a blueprint for genetic analyses to verify potential regulations. Total 7 transcription factors were upstream of CG1603 in the network and emerged as positive hits in the initial screen in the eye. RNAi against 5 of them led to reduced TFAM level in the midgut, while the other two had no noticeable phenotype, suggesting that these two TFs may regulate mitochondrial biogenesis in a tissue specific manner. Only YL-1 was confirmed to act upstream of CG1603 based on the genetic epistasis analysis, further indicating the necessity of combining genomic, bioinformatic, and genetics analyses to gain more reliable and comprehensive understanding on transcriptional regulations. YL-1 is one of DNA binding subunits of the SRCAP complex, which is essential for histone H2A.Z incorporation and replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that both SRCAP complex and H2A.Z are necessary for the transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lowden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). Our work offers a mechanistic insight into how CG1603 and its upstream regulator, YL-1 may regulate mitochondrial biogenesis at nucleosome and chromatin level. Currently, most known transcription paradigms controlling mitochondrial biogenesis are centered on transcription factors and co-activators that stabilize or directly stimulate the core transcription machinery. The YL-1 to CG1603 cascade may represent a previously underappreciated layer of transcriptional regulation on ETC biogenesis and could act in concert with NRF1 and other transcription factors to coordinate both the nuclear and mitochondrial genome in ETC biogenesis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Zhang et al. report a genetic screen to identify novel transcriptional regulators that could coordinate mitochondrial biogenesis. They performed an RNAi-based modifier screen wherein they systematically knocked down all known transcription factors in the developing Drosophila eye, which was already sensitised and had decreased mitochondrial DNA content. Through this screen, they identify CG1603 as a potential regulator of mitochondrial content. They show that protein levels of mitochondrial proteins like TFAM, SDHA, and other mitochondrial proteins and mtDNA content are downregulated in CG1603 mutants. RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq further show that CG1603 binds to the promoter regions of several known nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and regulates their expression. Finally, they also identified YL-1 as an upstream regulator of CG1603. Overall, it is a very important study as our understanding of the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis remains limited across metazoans. Most studies have focused on PGC-1α as a master regulator of mitochondrial biogeneis, which seems a context-dependent regulator. Also, PGC-1α mediated regulation could not explain the regulation of 1100 genes that are required for mitochondrial biogenesis. Therefore, identifying a new regulator is crucial for understanding the overall regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors aim to identify the nuclear genome-encoded transcription factors that regulate mtDNA maintenance and mitochondrial biogenesis. They started with an RNAi screening in developing Drosophila eyes with reduced mtDNA content and identified a number of putative candidate genes. Subsequently, using ChIP-seq data, they built a potential regulatory network that could govern mitochondrial biogenesis. Next, they focused on a candidate gene, CG1603, for further characterization. Based on the expression of different markers, such as TFAM and SDHA, in the RNAi and OE clones in the midgut cells, they argue that CG1603 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression of ETC complex genes. Then, they used a mutant of CG1603 and showed that both mtDNA levels and mitochondrial protein levels were reduced. Using clonal analyses, they further show a reduction in mitochondrial biogenesis and membrane potential upon loss of CG1603. They made a reporter line of CG1603, showed that the protein is localized to the mitochondria, and binds to polytene chromosomes in the salivary gland. Based on the RNA-seq results from the mutants and the ChIP data, the authors argue that the nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes that are downregulated &gt;2 folds in the CG1603 mutants and that are bound by CG1603 are related to ETC biogenesis. Finally, they show that YL-1, another candidate in the network, is an upstream regulator of CG1603.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a valuable study, which identifies a potential regulator and a network of nucleus-encoded transcription factors that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. Through in-vivo and in-vitro experimental evidence, the authors identify the role of CG1603 in this process. The screening strategy was smart, and the follow-up experiments were nicely executed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some additional experiments showing the effects of CG1603 loss on ETC integrity and functionality would strengthen the work.</p>
