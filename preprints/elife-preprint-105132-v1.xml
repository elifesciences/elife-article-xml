<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Teichoic acids (TA) are linear phospho-saccharidic polymers and important constituents of the cell envelope of Gram-positive bacteria, either bound to the peptidoglycan as wall teichoic acids (WTA) or to the membrane as lipoteichoic acids (LTA). The chemical composition of TA varies greatly but the presence of both WTA and LTA is highly conserved, hinting at an underlying fundamental function that is distinct from their numerous specific roles in diverse organisms. We report here the observation of a periplasmic space in the Gram-positive <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> by cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous section. The thickness and appearance of this region change upon deletion of genes involved in the attachment of teichoic acids, supporting the role of TA in the maintenance of a periplasmic space in Gram-positive bacteria as their main universal function. Consequences of these mutations were further examined by super-resolved microscopy (dSTORM), following metabolic and fluorophore coupling by click-chemistry in pulse and pulse-chase experiments. This novel labeling method also enabled the titration the actual amount of TA per cell and to determine the ratio of WTA to LTA, to follow the change of TA length during growth phases, and to discover that a mutant devoid of LTA accumulates the membrane-bound TA precursor, that may compensate the absence of LTA. Most importantly, the possibility to follow TA during cell fractionation led to the discovery that LTA containing membranes sediment at low centrifugal forces, allowing easy separation.</p>

<title>Significance</title>
<p>The existence of a periplasmic space in Gram-positive has long been debated. The finding that compromising the attachment of teichoic acids changes the appearance and thickness of the periplasm in the pneumococcus indicates a role of these polymers in the maintenance of this space between the membrane and the cell wall. Using metabolic labeling and electrophoresis showed that LTA-containing membranes are easily sedimented. This finding casts doubts on previous results, since most LTA were likely unknowingly discarded in these studies. Our method of TA analysis opens a new era in the investigation of these important and poorly known bacterial polymers and their role in the periplasmic space of Gram-positive organisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Teichoic acids (TA) are major components of the cell envelope of Gram-positive bacteria. TA are complex linear polysaccharides attached either to the plasma membrane (lipoteichoic acids, LTA) or to the peptidoglycan (PG) (wall teichoic acids, WTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Although generally non-essential, LTA and WTA participate in numerous cellular processes such as cell wall elongation and hydrolysis, cell division, transport processes, cation homoeostasis, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, and interactions with the environment or the host.</p>
<p>In studies of Gram-positive bacteria (<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus gallinarum</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus gordonii</italic>) by cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>)), a region between the cytoplasmic membrane and the cell wall was proposed to be a periplasmic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). A most interesting speculation is the possible role of TA in maintaining this periplasmic space, so that it would be isotonic with the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In most organisms, LTA and WTA have different compositions and are assembled and exported by different pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). TA of streptococci of the <italic>mitis</italic> group, such as <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, are particular in two ways: LTA and WTA are products of the same biosynthetic pathway and are therefore of very similar composition, and they are uniquely decorated by phosphocholine residues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of TA in the pneumococcus is also critical because 13 to 16 different proteins (choline- binding proteins) are anchored to the cell envelope by the interaction of their choline-binding domain to phosphocholine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The functions of the choline-binding proteins are diverse, several of them are acting on the cell wall itself as hydrolases such as LytA and LytB, others are virulence factors mediating interactions with the host and its immune system.</p>
<p>The pneumococcus has a strict nutritional requirement for choline, which is solely incorporated in its TA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). However, numerous derivatives can substitute for choline, as long as the hydroxyl group is present and the amine substituents are not too bulky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Nutritional shift between choline and ethanolamine had been used in early studies of the localization and composition of nascent cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). More recently, we have used the incorporation of alkyne- and azido-choline (aCho) derivatives to label TA with clickable-fluorophores and investigate the spatial and temporal relationship between TA and PG assembly by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>The pneumococcal repeating unit of TA consists of a pseudo-pentasaccharide ((→4)-6-O-P-Cho- α-D-Gal<italic>p</italic>NAc-(1→3)-6-O-P-Cho-β-D-Gal<italic>p</italic>NAc-(1→1)-Rib-ol-5-P-(O→6)-β-D-Glc<italic>p</italic>-(1→3)- AATGal<italic>p</italic>-(1→)) (SI <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The glucose (D-Glc<italic>p</italic>) and the ribitol (Rib-ol) are joined by a phosphodiester bond. The two N-acetylgalactosamine (D-Gal<italic>p</italic>NAc) are substituted on position 6 with a phosphocholine, as mentioned above. The phosphocholine is sometimes lacking on the proximal Gal<italic>p</italic>NAc of some subunits, as well as from both Gal<italic>p</italic>NAc from the terminal unit. Subunits are linked together by α-(1→6) bonds. In LTA, the acetamido-4-amino-6-deoxygalactopyranose (AATGal<italic>p</italic>) of the first subunit is β-(1→6)-linked to the glucose of a mono-glucosyl-diacyl-glycerol (DGlc<italic>p</italic>-DAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). In WTA, the first AATGal<italic>p</italic> is thought to be α-linked via a phosphodiester to position 6 of the PG N-acetyl muramic acid, as in WTA of other species, although this labile linkage has never been experimentally observed in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>Like other surface polysaccharides such as the PG or the capsule, the basic unit is intracellularly synthesized at the plasma membrane onto the carrier lipid undecaprenyl pyrophosphate by a succession of glycosyl- and phosphotransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The basic unit precursor is then thought to be flipped across the membrane by the flippase TacF (<italic>spr1150</italic>) to allow elongation of the TA polymers at the cell surface by the polymerase TarP (<italic>spr1222</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Once on the external surface of the membrane, the polymerized precursors can undergo two fates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). A phosphotransferase can anchor the polymer onto the PG to yield WTA. Alternatively, a glycosyltransferase can transfer the polymer to DGlc<italic>p</italic>-DAG to form LTA. The phosphotransferase attaching WTA is thought to be LytR (<italic>spr1759</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), although LytR and the two homologous enzymes Cps2A (<italic>spr 0314</italic>) and Psr (<italic>spr1226</italic>) that form the LCP (LytR- Cps2A-Psr) family may exhibit some redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The glycosyltransferase producing LTA was found to be TacL (<italic>spr1702</italic>), since the purification procedure normally yielding LTA produced no detectable TA compounds from a Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>Some fundamental aspects of the pneumococcal biology have recently been proposed to rely on shifting the ratio of WTA to LTA. Notably, competence, the process allowing incorporation of DNA from the extracellular environment, was found to be accompanied by an increase of the amount of WTA dependent on the presence of the phosphotransferase LytR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). In contrast, autolysis, which occurs during the stationary phase of planktonic cultures and is mostly driven by the PG amidase and choline- binding protein LytA, was shown to depend on the amount of WTA, modulated by the phosphodiesterase WhyD that releases TA from the PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>In this work, using CEMOVIS (cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous thin section), we report the existence of a periplasmic space in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> WT, Δ<italic>tacL</italic> and Δ<italic>lytR</italic> strains. The observed differences in the appearance and thickness of the periplasmic space supports a participation of TA to its maintenance. The sites of TA incorporation in the cell wall were examined by the metabolic incorporation of aCho and subsequent secondary fluorescent labeling that allowed imaging by super- resolved microscopy, to reveal consequences of the absence of TacL and LytR. In addition, the discovery of the unexpected and previously unreported sedimentation property of the LTA containing- membranes of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> allows the simple separation and analysis by gel electrophoresis of labeled LTA and WTA in different strains and conditions. This novel simple method of TA analysis will prompt the reassessment of previous findings, notably regarding the ratio of LTA to WTA in various cellular processes.</p>

<title>Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> cell envelope</title>
<p>CEMOVIS is a cellular cryo-electron microscopy method that previously provided evidence for a periplasmic space in several Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). To investigate the contribution of TA to the architecture of the cell envelope of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, we applied the CEMOVIS (SI <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>) to the WT (wild-type) strain and two mutants thereof thought to be deficient in the attachment of TA to the cell wall (Δ<italic>lytR</italic>) or to the plasma membrane (Δ<italic>tacL</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>As in other bacterial species, CEMOVIS reveals the existence of a periplasm in WT <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, as evidenced by a light region observed between the plasma membrane and the PG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Within this light region, a single dark line runs parallel to the membrane. This observation in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> supports the idea that a periplasmic space exists in Gram-positive bacteria, and that this space contains organized material, which was previously described as a granular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>).</p>

<p>If a Gram-positive periplasm filled with TA exists, it must contain LTA, which are anchored in the plasma membrane, and possibly WTA protruding from the inner face of the PG layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). This hypothesis predicts that variations in LTA and/or WTA incorporation should modify the architecture of the cell envelope. Strikingly, the granular layer present in the WT strain completely disappears in Δ<italic>lytR</italic> and Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells, (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In the absence of TacL, the thickness of the periplasmic space is significantly reduced by (34 ± 5)% (SE) compared to that of the WT strain (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), supporting the idea that LTA occupy the periplasmic space. Similarly, the absence of LytR induces a significant reduction of the periplasm thickness ((29 ± 5)% (SE), <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that WTA also participate in the maintenance of this region. The thickness of the periplasmic spaces in Δ<italic>tacL</italic> and Δ<italic>lytR</italic> strains does not differ significantly from each other. In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of our cryo-EM images, we took advantage of the exceptional grid adhesion of one vitreous ribbon of Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells (SI <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>) to perform CETOVIS (cryo-electron tomography of vitreous sections). The reconstructed cryo-electron tomogram confirmed the absence of the granular layer throughout the entire volume of a Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cell section (SI <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figs S2A-B</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Interestingly, CEMOVIS data obtained from the WT, Δ<italic>lytR</italic> and Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strains also showed that the thickness of the PG layer itself is affected when WTA or LTA assembly is impaired (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, we observed a significant reduction of the cell wall thickness of (17 ± 5)% (SE) or (36 ± 4)% (SE) in the absence of TacL or LytR, respectively. Consistent with the fact that WTA are covalently linked to the PG, the reduction in the cell wall thickness is more pronounced in Δ<italic>lytR</italic> cells compared to Δt<italic>acL</italic> cells. In contrast to the CEMOVIS method, transmission electron microscopy analysis of sectioned stained freeze-substituted resin-embedded samples (SI <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>) did not reveal measurable differences between the cell wall of the WT and mutant strains. The differing appearance of Gram-positive cell envelope using the CEMOVIS and freeze-substitution methods, and the difficulty of evidencing the periplasmic space with the latter, was observed an discussed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>

<title>Cellular localization of TA insertion</title>
<p>Intrigued by the effect of the absence of TacL or LytR on the ultrastructure of the cell envelope, we examined how the deletion of <italic>tacL</italic> or <italic>lytR</italic> impacts the localization of TA assembly in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> cells. To localize newly synthesized TA, an excess of aCho was added for 5 min to exponentially growing cell cultures. Cells were then fixed prior to secondary labeling by strain-promoted azide-alkyne cyclo-addition (SPAAC) click reaction with the DBCO-linked fluorophore Alexa Fluor 647 (DBCO- AF647), following a protocol adapted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). As expected, TA insertion occurs at the division site (SI <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Although the morphology of Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells is altered, with pointy poles and some expanded and shrunk cells, enriched aCho incorporation was also detected at midcell. In the Δ<italic>lytR</italic> strain, in contrast to the WT parental and Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strains, the 5-min incubation with aCho yielded only a weak midcell labeling in few cells (SI <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). The weak labeling of Δ<italic>lytR</italic> cells may reflect one or a combination of the following: TA are less abundant, cells incorporate less aCho into TA, cells grow more slowly, so that the 5 min pulse represents a shorter fraction of their cell cycle.</p>
<p>The photophysical properties of AF647 are amenable to direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), which allowed the reconstruction of super-resolved images as presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, showing the localization of fluorescent TA after a 5-min labeling pulse experiment. Corresponding images in conventional fluorescence and bright field mode are shown in SI <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>. In the three strains, TA were mostly inserted at the division site, where the PG is assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). However, some localizations were also detected elsewhere at the cell surface in all three strains. This heterogenous labeling was similar in all three strains, rendering the weak labeling at the division site of Δ<italic>lytR</italic> cells difficult to identify. This is in contrast to what is observed with PG insertion, where very little signal is observed outside of the cell division zone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and Trouve et al. 2021). The localization patterns of newly incorporated TA observed in these experiments are mostly that of WTA, since this distribution is preserved in sacculi preparations (SI <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). The bright spots that were often seen in sacculi likely correspond to aggregated material that is trapped inside unbroken sacculi.</p>

<p>While there is no discernible difference between the WT and Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells in the distribution of TA labeled during a 5-min pulse, the evolution of this distribution following a chase, when growth is pursued for up to 35 min (about one WT generation time) without aCho, is markedly different between the two strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In the WT strain, the separated banded pattern expected from the insertion of unlabeled TA at the division site is observed, mirroring the patterns produced by PG labeling. After 35 min of chase, most WT cells show polar or equatorial labelings following completion of their division. In contrast, in Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells, labeled TA can be seen over the whole new cell surface that is generated during the pulse and the first 15 min of chase. An unlabeled region is visible at midcell in Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells only after 35 min of chase. The chased pattern of labeled PG in the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain is not affected and is similar to that in WT.</p>
<p>In dSTORM imaging of the Δ<italic>lytR</italic> strain, the patterns are difficult to discern and many cells show no specific midcell labeling. When visible, the labeled area extends during the chase, as described above for the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain.</p>

<title>Separation of labeled LTA and WTA by low-speed centrifugation</title>
<p>In previous studies, unlabeled TA from the pneumococcus have been analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS (SDS-PAGE). Purified WTA were revealed in gel by an Alcian blue staining procedure, whereas LTA from crude membrane fractions were revealed by immune-blotting with anti-phosphocholine antibodies (e. g. (Flores-Kim et al. 2019; 2022)). The standard preparative purification of TA from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> starts with the sedimentation of mechanically broken cell walls, which contain the WTA, with the concomitant detergent solubilization of LTA (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>)). Alternatively, for analysis of LTA by immuno-blotting for example, protoplasts prepared by PG enzymatic digestion would be osmotically lysed, cellular debris would be sedimented by low-speed centrifugation and discarded, and LTA-containing membranes would finally be collected by ultracentrifugation (e. g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)). On the other hand, WTA can be released from cell wall fragments by thorough digestion of the PG (e. g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>)) or alkaline hydrolysis (e. g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)).</p>
<p>Since we were able to fluorescently label TA, we thought it would allow simpler in-gel analysis. WT cells were cultured over two generations in C-medium devoid of choline but supplemented with 200 µM aCho. Cells having thus metabolically incorporated aCho were lyzed by overnight digestion of the cell wall with lysozyme, mutanolysine and recombinant LytA. The aCho was coupled to a DBCO- fluorescent Alexa dye (AF488) by strain-promoted azide-alkyne click reaction during the lysis incubation. The lysates were then cleared of debris by a low-speed centrifugation at 10,000 <italic>g,</italic> and ultracentrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 <italic>g</italic> was subsequently performed to separate the membrane from the soluble fraction. Since at this stage the TA were fluorescently labelled, we were surprised to find more fluorescence in the low-speed pellet than in the pellet resulting from the ultracentrifugation. Analysis of the soluble fraction (the supernatant) by SDS-PAGE showed the pattern expected from labeled WTA migrating as a set of poorly resolved bands with low electrophoretic mobility, as in typical Alcian blue-stained gels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The pattern expected from labeled LTA, a ladder of well-resolved bands with a greater electrophoretic mobility than the WTA, was observed chiefly in the low-speed pellet. Centrifugation of cells lysates with labeled TA at different speeds confirmed that 2 min at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> were sufficient to sediment most of the LTA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<title>Titration of cellular TA</title>
<p>The fluorescent labeling of TA by click chemistry and separation of LTA and WTA allowed the titration of the different species in cells. For this, we incubated varying quantities of the aCho-labeled cell lysate with fixed amounts of DBCO-AF488. Samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and the relative amount of the various fluorescent species was determined by densitometry and plotted against the concentration of cells. The gels and quantifications are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4B-C</xref> and SI <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figs S11A-B</xref> for two concentrations of DBCO-AF488. For intermediate amounts of lysate, the concentrations of clickable groups were too low to reach reaction completion during the incubation time. Only with the highest amount of lysate could the fluorophore be nearly consumed. However, for low amounts of lysate, when the fluorophore is in large excess, the reaction is also expected to have neared completion. Therefore, the fraction of unreacted DBCO-AF488 was linearly extrapolated to zero from the measurements at low lysate concentrations, to obtain the amount of lysate that would titrate the fluorophore in an infinite reaction time. Thus, 1.9 µM DBCO-AF488 would titrate the metabolized aCho from (0.24 ± 0.01) × 2.8⋅10<sup>8</sup> cells⋅mL<sup>-1</sup> and 3.7 µM would titrate aCho from (0.45 ± 0.01) × 2.8⋅10<sup>8</sup> cells⋅mL<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4B-C</xref> and SI <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figs S11A-B</xref>), which is equivalent to (17 ± 2)⋅10<sup>6</sup> incorporated aCho molecules per cell. Since about 55% of labeled choline are incorporated into TA, the rest being found in the form of phosphocholine, there are about (9.4 ± 1.1)⋅10<sup>6</sup> labeled TA choline per cell. Over two generations grown in the exclusive presence of labeled choline, at most 75% of TA choline residues are expected to be labeled, as measured previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The total amount of TA choline residues per cell can therefore be estimated to be about (12.5 ± 1.5)⋅10<sup>6</sup>. As the major species of TA consists of 6 repeating units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), with each unit comprising about two choline residues, the number of TA molecules per cell is about 10<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>Although the electrophoretic mobility of the longest species of LTA overlaps that of the shortest WTA species, the major species are well separated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4B-C</xref> and SI <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figs S11A-B</xref>) and allowed their relative quantification. Labeled choline residues incorporated into LTAs were found to account for 15 ± 5 % of the TA choline residues. Assuming a similar size distribution of LTA and WTA, LTA and WTA represent roughly 15 and 85% of pneumococcal TA, respectively.</p>

<title>Evolution of TA along <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> growth phases</title>
<p>Using TA labeling and sedimentation separation, we examined whether changes in the distribution of TA could be detected during growth. WT and Δ<italic>lytA</italic> cells were grown with aCho over two generations. LytA is the main autolysin of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, and culture of cells lacking this PG hydrolase show an extended stationary phase with minimal lysis. Cells were harvest during the exponential phase of growth, at the onset of the stationary phase, and when the WT cells started to lyse. Remarkably, longer species of LTA can be observed at later stages of growth (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs 5A-B</xref> and SI <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Fig. S12A</xref>). Assuming that the most abundant form consists of 6 repeating units, the 5- and 7-unit species are the next most abundant species, and traces of the 8- and 9-unit species can be detected during the exponential phase of growth. Later during the culture, although the 6-unit species remains the most abundant and the 5-unit is detected at level comparable as earlier in the culture, longer species become more abundant with up to 17 identifiable units. Surprisingly, the size distribution appears to be bimodal with a first group of species consisting of 5 to 11 units, and a second group of longer forms where the most abundant one contains 15 units. When considering the electrophoretic pattern, it should be considered that the signal of the different species is proportional not only to their amount, but also to their length, since longer species harbor more labeled choline residue. Therefore, long species are less abundant than they appear.</p>

<p>The pyrophosphate linkage in the PG precursor lipid II is labile at low pH and high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Reasoning that the same should be true for the TA precursor, we incubated the sedimented fraction from the WT and Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain at 110°C at either pH 8 or pH 4.2. The TA sedimented from the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> lysate were degraded at both pH, whereas those from the parental strain were still detected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). This observation suggested that the previously reported failure to isolate TA from the membrane fraction of a Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain could be due to the process that involves boiling at pH 4.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we submitted resuspended pellets of labeled TA from the WT and Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strains to the initial steps of the reported isolation procedure for LTA: boiling in SDS at pH 4.7, lyophilization and ethanol wash of the lyophilizate followed by butanol extraction and retention of the aqueous fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Although material was lost at each step, LTA from WT cells survived the procedure unscathed, whereas pelleted TA from the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain was lost at the first step, which involves boiling at low pH (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). In that case, labeled material with a lower electrophoretic mobility appeared as a smear like that of solubilized WTA.</p>
<p>To confirm that TA sedimented from a lysate of cells devoid of TacL are membrane bound through a pyrophosphate, we incubated these TA with recombinant colicin M from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Colicin M are toxins that kill bacteria by hydrolyzing the ester bond between the undecaprenol and the pyrophosphate of the PG precursors lipid I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Colicin M from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was shown to be the most active <italic>in vitro</italic> and to display some activity on undecaprenyl-pyrophosphate without saccharide, thus being less stringent regarding its substrates than other colicin M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> colicin M could indeed hydrolyze labeled sedimented TA from Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells, whereas it was inactive on labeled LTA from WT cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). The colicin M hydrolytic activity was inhibited by chelation of divalent cation by EDTA, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>).</p>
<p>The combined results show that TacL is indeed the glycosyltransferase responsible for the attachment of TA to the membrane glycolipids. However, in the absence of TacL, membrane-bound TA remain present in abundance in the form of undecaprenyl-pyrophosphate-attached precursors.</p>
<p>To evaluate if the membrane-bound TA precursors accumulating in the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain are on the inside or outside of the plasma membrane, cells were grown in C-medium in the presence of 0.2 µM aCho, and the secondary labeling with DBCO-AF488 was performed by a 2 h incubation at room temperature either before, or after cell lysis. Samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). LTA in the WT strain or membrane-bound precursors in the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain were equally labeled before and after lysis, like WTA. In contrast, cytoplasmic azido-phosphocholine was only labeled after lysis, demonstrating that the DBCO-AF488 probe is membrane impermeant.</p>

<title>LytR is the main WTA phosphotransferase</title>
<p>WTA and LTA were also observed in strain Δ<italic>lytR</italic> which is devoid of one of the three phosphotransferases involved in the attachment of surface polysaccharides (the LCP enzymes), although WTA are less abundant and LTA appear to be longer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). In the WT strain, labeled choline in WTA in this particular experiment was found to represent ∼ 80% of the total labeled cholines in TA, whereas in the Δ<italic>lytR</italic> strain, this proportion was decreased to ∼ 51%. Relative to LTA, the amount of WTA is decreased about four-fold in the absence of LytR.</p>
<p>In C-medium, the Δ<italic>lytR</italic> strain grew more slowly and reached a lower cell density than its parental strain (SI <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Fig. S13</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Multiple roles have been found for TA in various bacteria. These varied functions, however, fail to explain why the presence LTA and WTA with different compositions is conserved in Gram-positive organisms. An underlying common function based on the attributes shared by TA in different species must lie at the root of the conservation of these cell wall polymers through evolution. The hypothesis proposed by Erickson posits that TA are necessary to maintain a periplasmic space at an osmotic pressure that counter balances that of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). TA being maintained for this reason may then have been coopted by evolutionary process to carry out additional functions, like evolutionary spandrels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). This attractive hypothesis is however difficult to test, not least because data supporting the existence of a periplasmic space in Gram-positive bacteria are scarce.</p>
<p>Here, our CEMOVIS images of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1</xref> and SI <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figs S3A-B</xref>) reveal the presence of a region of lower electron density between the membrane and the PG, as reported previously with other Gram-positive organisms and defined as periplasmic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). About halfway between the PG and the membrane, this periplasmic space appears to be partitioned by a thin layer of more electron dense material, termed the granular layer in a previous study of <italic>S. gordonii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). By contrast, freeze-substitution and osmium staining produced thin section of cells with no visible periplasm (SI <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>). Since high-pressure frozen cells are directly sectioned for CEMOVIS but undergo numerous subsequent treatments for freeze-substitution and contrasting, it is tempting to consider that the CEMOVIS images yield more truthful representations of the cellular architecture. The thinning of the periplasmic space and disappearance of the granular layer in strains with diminished amounts of either WTA (Δ<italic>lytR</italic>) or LTA (Δ<italic>tacL</italic>) support Erickson’s hypothesis that a periplasmic space is maintained by the physical properties of WTA emanating from the PG layer and LTA springing from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In this framework, it is also striking that the appearance of the cell envelope of <italic>S. gordonii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> are so similar, despite the fact that the composition of their TA are very different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), lending credence to a fundamental function of TA stemming from their general physico-chemical properties, rather than from specific molecular interactions.</p>
<p>Erickson listed four physical mechanisms of the polyelectrolyte brush model of TA that could explain the formation of a periplasmic space where TA chains closely packed on a surface of the plasma membrane generate a pressure when pushed against another TA covered surface (the PG layer). These four contributing factors are: “(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) excluded volume, where the chains cannot occupy the same space; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) electrostatic repulsion within and between chains; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) reduced entropy of the chains as they are confined to a narrow cylinder; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) reduced entropy of the counterions as they are concentrated near the anionic charges” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Although generally applicable, the electrostatic repulsion experienced by most anionic TA cannot apply to TA from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, since these are zwitterionic and polyampholytes. Indeed, the phosphocholine side chains carry both a positive and a negative charge at physiologically relevant pH (zwitterionic), while the main chain repeated unit also carry one negative chain from its phosphodiester linkage and one positive charge from the amino-group of its AATGal<italic>p</italic> ring (polyampholyte character). Being globally neutral, pneumococcal TA may not attract counterions, which therefore would not contribute to the osmolality and pressure of the periplasmic compartment. Consequently, the excluded volume and reduced entropy of TA due to confinement, of the neutral brush polymer theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), could be the main drivers of the maintenance of a periplasmic space in streptococci of the <italic>mitis</italic> group. Since <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. gordonii</italic> display similar periplasmic spaces when observed by CEMOVIS, despite having TA with different electrostatic properties, future comparisons of these species in different pH, osmolality and ionic strength regimen may provide clues about the physico-chemical interactions of these polymers.</p>
<p>The brush polymer model of TA function in forming a periplasmic space applies only if they are present at a density at which volume exclusion occurs. Our metabolic labeling method using aCho that can be titrated with a clickable fluorescent probe has allowed to evaluate the amount of TA chains per cell to about 10<sup>6</sup>. Since WTA may be distributed throughout and on both sides of the PG layer, let us concentrate on the LTA which are less abundant but are all expected to be in the periplasmic space with about 1.5⋅10<sup>5</sup> chains per cell. A single pneumococcal cell could be approximated by a sphere with a diameter of 1 µm and surface area of 3⋅10<sup>-12</sup> m<sup>2</sup>. Pneumococcus exists mostly as diplococci, so let us assume an average surface area per cell of 5⋅10<sup>-12</sup> m<sup>2</sup>. The surface density of LTA would therefore be 3.3⋅10<sup>16</sup> molecule⋅m<sup>-2</sup> or one LTA chain per 30 nm<sup>2</sup>. This density value is lower than that of one chain per 5 nm<sup>2</sup> calculated for LTA from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> based on the ratio of LTA to membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Although both density values are rough estimates, they require volume exclusion to accommodate TA chains at the membrane surface and are therefore compatible with the polymer brush model.</p>
<p>The morphogenesis and cell division of Gram-positive bacteria rely on the carefully orchestrated assembly of the cell envelope, which includes the membrane, the PG layer and the TA. To gain a better understanding of the incorporation of TA in the cell wall, TA were metabolically labeled with aCho that allowed the subsequent grafting of fluorescent probes. Cells labeled during short pulses of incubation could be observed by dSTORM, revealing the regions of TA insertion in unprecedented details. In parallel, labeled TA, after short pulses or continuous growth in labeling media, could be analyzed by gel electrophoresis after cell wall digestion by PG hydrolases. As expected from an earlier study with conventional microscopy (Bonnet et al. 2018), TA are incorporated in the cell wall at the division site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and SI <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs S4</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figs S5</xref>). Patterns after a 5-min labeling pulse are very similar to those obtained when the PG is pulse-labeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and do not differ in the absence of the glycosyltransferase TacL. In contrast, the absence of the phosphotransferase LytR markedly reduce the fluorescence signal. These observations are consistent with the role attributed to TacL of anchoring the less abundant LTA, and to LytR of attaching the more abundant WTA. The electrophoretic analysis of labeled TA confirmed that WTA are less abundant in the Δ<italic>lytR</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The amount of LTA appeared comparable in WT and Δ<italic>lytR</italic> cells, but LTA seem to contribute little to the dSTORM localization patterns, since cell wall sacculi that lacks LTA show patterns identical to that of whole cells (SI <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>).</p>
<p>The notable difference with TA compared to PG is the presence of some heterogenous surface localization after a labeling pulse. This surface signal is not due to non-specific binding of the fluorophore to the surface, since it is not observed in labeling studies of the PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Since the same level of heterogenous surface labeling was observed with the three strains investigated, the most likely reason is some non-specific adsorption of aCho at the cell surface. It is also possible that some LTA or membrane-bound precursors, which are not covalently bound to the cell wall, can diffuse from the division site across the plasma membrane during the pulse and prior the fixation. Finally, it is possible that hitherto unidentified choline-containing compounds at the cell surface are also labeled.</p>
<p>When imaging was performed after a chase time during which cells are allowed to grow in the absence of probes following the labeling pulse, patterns of labeled TA in Δ<italic>tacL</italic> and Δ<italic>lytR</italic> cells appeared different from those produced when the PG was labeled (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In WT cells, in contrast, TA and PG labeling patterns were similar throughout the chase time. Although the appearance of pulse labeled Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells resemble that of WT cells, the labeling patterns are strikingly different after a chase period. In Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells, all the cell wall generated during the chase is labeled, resulting in a wide contiguous fluorescent region, whereas it is not labeled in WT cells, producing separated bands. It is most likely that in WT cells, production of WTA and LTA are competing pathways as the two polymers share the same composition, that rapidly consumes the undecaprenyl-linked polymerized TA precursors, whereas these precursors accumulate in the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs 6B-E</xref>). The slower turnover of the undecaprenyl- linked TA in the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain allows the cell wall incorporation of labeled WTA during the chase, several minutes after the aCho has been removed from the medium. This phenomenon could be observed in an electrophoretic analysis of a pulse-chase labeling experiment of the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain, where membrane bound TA precursors disappear over a 15-min course (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Patterns are difficult to discern in the Δ<italic>lytR</italic> strain due to the weak labeling signal, however, they appear to resemble those of Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells.</p>
<p>In streptococci of the <italic>mitis</italic> group, TA serve as moorings for the attachment of a variety of surface proteins termed choline-binding proteins, because the interaction occurs between the choline residues of TA and protein domains made of repeated choline-binding motifs. The functions of these proteins are varied, playing roles in virulence, competence, or cell wall metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The localization of some choline-binding protein can be highly restricted, such as that of the autolysin LytA, which is found at mid-cell to hydrolyze the PG to promote lysis, or the other cell wall hydrolase LytB that localizes to the new poles to complete cell separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Since the choline-binding domains of these proteins participate in their localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), it probably requires that TA at different places of the cell surface display some compositional or size differences, that could arise from some maturation process.</p>
    <p>To investigate this possibility, we analyzed metabolically labeled TA at different stages of cell culture (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs 5A-B</xref> and SI <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figs S12A</xref>). Interestingly, longer LTA are present when the culture enters its stationary phase. One can speculate that the same may be true with WTA, although this could not be determined in our experiment. Surprisingly, when pulse labeling is performed at the onset of stationary phase, the LTA that are synthesized during that phase of the culture do not differ from those produced earlier during the exponential phase, despite the observation of longer LTA are present in late phase culture (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs 5A-B</xref> and SI <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figs S12A</xref>). How could these long LTA arise? Since their length distribution is bi-modal and the longer (12-16 units) are about twice the size of the short ones (5-7 units), it is tempting to imagine that they may arise from the coupling of pre-existing TA.</p>
<p>The finding that undecaprenyl-attached TA accumulate in the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain to a level that is lower, but comparable to that of LTA in a WT strain raises the question of whether these precursors can fulfill the function of mature LTA, at least partially. The observation by CEMOVIS that the cell envelope architecture is altered in Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells, with a thinner periplasmic space devoid of granular layer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), indicates that if some functional replacement occurs, it is not complete. It has been proposed previously that the physical properties of the undecaprenyl chain underlie the localization of the PG precursor lipid II at the sites of cell wall assembly, which occurs at sites of maximal membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). The same reasoning would restrict the presence, and thus the function, of the undecaprenyl-linked TA precursors to sites of cell wall assembly were they can be incorporated into WTA or true LTA. In the absence of TacL, undecaprenyl-linked TA accumulate to a greater extent, so that their turn over is slower than in a WT strain, resulting in the incorporation of labeled WTA during a chase after the labeling pulse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p>The propensity of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> membrane to sediment at low centrifugal speed, discussed in the SI, is not without experimental consequences in the study of TA. A number of recent studies have sought to investigate the possible role of changes in the relative proportion of WTA and LTA in physiological processes such as the autolysis or the competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). However, it is likely that most of the LTA-containing membranes were unknowingly discarded in these experiments during a clarification step of cell lysates, casting doubts on the reported ratio of WTA to LTA and the associated conclusions. The metabolic labeling and electrophoretic analysis methods reported here will certainly help to reappraise several aspects of the biology of TA in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.</p>

<title>Freeze substitution and ultramicrotomy at room temperature</title>
<p>The freeze substitution and ultramicrotomy protocols were derived from (Bauda et al., 2023). Briefly, following high pressure freezing, the vitrified pellets were freeze-substituted at -90°C for 80 h in acetone supplemented with 2 % OsO<sub>4</sub> (AFS2; Leica Microsystems). The samples temperature was increased slowly to -60°C (2°C⋅h<sup>-1</sup>). The temperature was further raised to -30°C (2°C⋅h<sup>-1</sup>) after 8 to 12 h, and finally to 0°C within 1 h. The temperature was decreased to -30°C within 30 min, and rinsed in pure acetone 4 times.

<p>Cultures in exponential phase (25 mL, OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.3) were centrifuged at 3220 <italic>g</italic> at room temperature for 15 min. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1/25<sup>th</sup> original volume of pre-warmed BHI supplemented with either 2 mM azido-D-Ala-D-Ala for PG labeling or 1.5 mM aCho for labeling of the TA, and incubated for 5 min at 37°C water bath (the “pulse” period).</p>
<p>Cells were then pelleted (10,000 <italic>g</italic>, 1 min) and washed with 1 mL BHI before being resuspended in 20 mL of pre-warmed BHI without probe.

The rest of the bacterial culture was allowed to continue growing at 37°C (“chase” period). At 5 min, 15 min and 35 min into the “chase” period, 2 mL were pelleted as described earlier. The pellets were resuspended in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde for overnight fixation at 4°C.</p>
<p>For the preparation of sacculi, the “pulse” period was conducted as above. After cells were washed and resuspended in fresh medium, they were allowed to grow further for 15 min.

Cells were then resuspended in 1 mL of 10% SDS and incubated at 100°C for 1 h, vortexed every 15 min. Sacculi were washed twice with 500 µL of 80 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 and incubated in 500 µL of a solution containing 20 µg⋅mL<sup>-1</sup> DNAse and 20 µg⋅mL<sup>-1</sup> RNAse, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 80 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 at 37°C with agitation for 1 h, prior to addition of Proteinase K (final concentration 200 µg⋅mL<sup>-1</sup>), 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 80 mM Tris-HCl pH 7, and further incubation overnight. Finally, sacculi were washed once with 200 µL of water.</p>
<p>For coupling of fluorophores, cells or sacculi were pelleted (10,000 <italic>g</italic>, 1 min) and resuspended into 50 µL (for fixed cells) or 150 µL (for sacculi) of PBS containing 30 µM DBCO-AF647 (JenaBiosciences). After 45 min at room temperature, samples were washed 3 times with 300 µL PBS. For dSTORM imaging, fluorophore-labeled cells or sacculi were resuspended in a solution containing 100 mM β-mercaptoelthylamine and an oxygen-depleting system consisting of a GLOX enzyme mix (40 µg⋅mL<sup>-1</sup> catalase, 0.5 mg⋅mL<sup>-1</sup> glucose oxidase) in 75 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 25 mM NaCl, and 10% glucose.</p>
<p>Samples were mounted between a microscopy slide and a high-precision coverslip pre-treated with UV light for 20 min. To coax the cells or sacculi into lying on the slide along their longitudinal axis, a heavy weight was applied on top of the cover slip as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). The edges of the cover slip were sealed with colorless nail polish.</p>
<p>Observations were made with an Abbelight SAFe 360 commercial STORM microscope. For fluorescence signal acquisition, the field was first excited with a 640-nm scanning laser at low power (1%) to capture a low-resolution conventional fluorescence image of the AF647 signal. The laser intensity was then steadily raised to 100%. ASTER technology, implemented in the microscope, provides for a homogeneous sample excitation. In our experiments, the gaussian beam at the power density of 10 kW⋅cm<sup>-</sup>² (average, FWHM 50 µm, power 200 mW, measured at the sample) scans the region of interest of 160<sup>2</sup> µm² resulting in 800 W⋅cm<sup>-</sup>² of average effective power density. AF647 dye molecules went through cycles of fluorescent state and dark state. When most AF647 fluorophores had displayed this transition (estimated visually by the frequency and density of fluorescence blinking, a set of 15,000 consecutive frames were taken with 50-ms exposure time. A bright-field image of the field was captured afterwards.</p>
<p>The 15,000-frame sets were processed with the FIJI plugin ThunderSTORM, which localizes the center of a Gaussian function fitted to each individual fluorescence signal and returns a data table containing the localization coordinates of all labeled molecules.

The concentration of the stock solution of DBCO-AF488 was determined by its absorbance at 494 nm using ε = 73000 M<sup>-1</sup>⋅cm<sup>-1</sup> to be 93 ± 5 µM (sd).</p>
<p>The cell lysate and dilutions thereof were mixed with an equal volume of DBCO-AF488 in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl to final concentrations of 3.7 ± 0.2 and 1.9 ± 0.1 µM of DBCO- AF488 and a maximum of 2.8⋅10<sup>8</sup> cells mL<sup>-1</sup>. After 24 h of incubation at room temperature, 1 µL of 100 mM aCho were added to block unreacted DBCO-AF488 and incubation was continued for 2 h.</p>
<p>Samples were then analyzed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel (17%, acrylamide:bis- acrylamide 29:1) in the presence of 1% SDS with a Tris/tricine buffer system. The gels were imaged by trans-illumination with UV light without saturation on a BioRad Chemidoc imager. Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ.</p>

<title>Notes on CEMOVIS data quality</title>
<p>Some crevasses can be observed but the section is devoid of cracks and very low ice contamination is present on the surface (SI <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). Knife marks along the cutting direction of the knife cannot be avoided, although compression artifact is rather limited as the cells preserve a round shape. Thus, it can be said reasonably that the sections are exploitable and that artifacts induced by cryo- sectioning do not impair image interpretation and ultrastructure measurement.</p>

<title>Notes on the fractionation of LTA and WTA</title>
<p>Although sedimentation of LTA was observed even at relative centrifugal force as low as 2,000 <italic>g</italic>, the pelleting was not always complete, even after prolonged centrifugation at 20,000 <italic>g</italic>. Incomplete cell lysis cannot account for the incomplete pelleting of LTA, since intact cells or large fragments would be expected to add to the pellet material. We found out that the quality of the separation of LTA from solubilized WTA by sedimentation depended on the amount of recombinant LytA used during the lysis (SI <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). This parameter was difficult to adjust since the exactly adequate amount appeared to depend on the particulars of the experiment (strain, cell density). We think that the multivalent choline- binding domain of LytA crosslinks LTA bounds to membrane vesicles, leading to the formation of large aggregates that sediment more easily. In support of this explanation, the presence recombinant LytA also impacts the migration of the solubilized TA, causing species with lower electrophoretic mobilities to be more abundant at the top of the gels.</p>

<label>Figure S6.</label>
<caption><p>Effect of the concentration of added recombinant LytA on the sedimentation of LTA.

Fluorescently labeled compounds were revealed by UV trans-illumination.</p></caption>

<title>Notes on the electrophoresis</title>
<p>Several points should be made regarding the electrophoretic system. We used gels with acrylamide concentrations of either 12% or 17%. Although the acrylamide concentration had little consequence on the separation of WTA and LTA, we observed that the migration of small soluble compounds was greatly affected (SI <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figs S7A-B</xref>). Thus, the phospho-choline-triazole-AF488 migrates a lesser distance than the choline-triazole-AF488 or the DBCO-AF488 in 12% acrylamide gels, whereas the opposite occurs in 17% gels. The separation of the choline-triazole-AF488 and the DBCO-AF488 is not sufficient in 17% gels.</p>
<p>Also, we found that thiol reducing agents such as DTT routinely included when loading the gels do react with DBCO-AF488 to yield a mixture of species, denoted with * in SI <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figs S7A-B</xref>. The extent of this reaction appeared to depend on the length and conditions of the storage of the samples prior to analysis and therefore was not controlled.</p>
    <p>In some cases, such as in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs 6A, 6B or 6E</xref>, one or multiple additional weak but sharp bands of fluorescently labeled material appear on the gels above the LTA bands. These bands can be correlated to Coomassie-stained protein bands (SI <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figs S8D-F</xref>) and they are likely products of the reaction of DBCO-AF488 with protein thiols or primary amines. As stated above for the modification of DBCO- AF488, this side reaction was not controlled and not always present. A weak non-specific fluorescent labeling of cellular proteins by DBCO-AF488, which was not a problem when TA were labeled during the whole culture, contributed to a significant smear bluring the TA bands when labeling was performed only during a short pulse time such as in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion of the sedimentation of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> LTA</title>
<p>Finally, a technical point requires discussion. The use of fluorescent labeling allowed to track the TA during cell fractionnation and revealed that membranes from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> sediment at low relative centrigugal force (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). This was a surprise to us, since we were used, as many other laboratories, to pellet membranes from <italic>E. coli</italic> for the preparation of recombinant proteins at 100,000 <italic>g</italic> after a clarification step at 40,000 <italic>g</italic>. However, considering the membrane composition could have predicted this outcome. The sedimentation coefficient <italic>s</italic> is proportional to 1 − <italic>ρν̅</italic> were <italic>ρ</italic> is the density of the solvent (close to 1 for aqueous biochemical solutions) and ν̅ is the partial-specific volume of the particle (the reciprocal of the density). For a complex particle such a membrane, ρ̅ is the weighted sum of its components <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="619035v2_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, glycolipids are absent of the plasma membrane, which consists mostly of phosphatidylethanolamine (∼78%), phosphatidylglycerol (∼12%) and cardiolipin (∼6%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The partial-specific volume ν̅<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of the various phospholipids is comprised between 0.93 and 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), so that the partial-specific volume ν̅ of the <italic>E. coli</italic> membrane is also close to 1 and its sedimentation coefficient <italic>s</italic> is very small. In <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in contrast, the glycolipids mono-glucosyl-diacylglycerol (∼35%) and galactosyl-glucosyl-diacylglycerol (∼45%) are the major constituent of the membrane, with minor contributions of phosphatidylglycerol (∼13%) and cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Since the partial-specific volume ν̅<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of glucose and galactose is 0.622 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and 80% of the pneumococcal lipids carry one or two hexoses, the resulting partial-specific volume ν̅ of the membrane should be around 0.8, and consequently the membranes of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> have a larger sedimentation coefficient s than those of <italic>E. coli</italic>. Note that the LTA themselves further increase the sedimentation coefficeint by contributing additional saccharidic units to the membrane composition.</p>

<p>The bacterial cell wall is crucial to maintain viability. It has previously been suggested that Gram-positive bacteria have a periplasmic region between the cell membrane and peptidoglycan cell wall that this is maintained by the presence of teichoic acids. In this <bold>valuable</bold> study, Nguyen et al. make clever use of electron microscopy and metabolic labelling to interrogate the role of teichoic acids in supporting the maintenance of the periplasmic region in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The findings are potentially significant but <bold>incomplete</bold> to fully support the conclusions drawn.</p>

<p>The authors set out to analyse the roles of the teichoic acids of Streptococcus pneumoniae in supporting the maintenance of the periplasmic region. Previous work has proposed the periplasm to be present in Gram positive bacteria and here advanced electron microscopy approach was used. This also showed a likely role for both wall and lipo-teichoic acids in maintaining the periplasm. Next, the authors use a metabolic labelling approach to analyse the teichoic acids. This is a clear strength as this method cannot be used for most other well studied organisms. The labelling was coupled with super-resolution microscopy to be able to map the teichoic acids at the subcellular level and a series of gel separation experiments to unravel the nature of the teichoic acids and the contribution of genes previously proposed to be required for their display. The manuscript could be an important addition to the field but there are a number of technical issues which somewhat undermine the conclusions drawn at the moment. These are shown below and should be addressed. More minor points are covered in the private Recommendations for Authors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses to be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) l. 144 Was there really only one sample that gave this resolution? Biological repeats of all experiments are required.</p>
<p>(2) Fig. 4A. Is the pellet recovered at &quot;low&quot; speeds not just some of the membrane that would sediment at this speed with or without LTA? Can a control be done using an integral membrane protein and Western Blot? Using the tacL mutant would show the behaviour of membranes alone.</p>
<p>(3) Fig. 4A. Using enzymatic digestion of the cell wall and then sedimentation will allow cell wall associated proteins (and other material) to become bound to the membranes and potentially effect sedimentation properties. This is what is in fact suggested by the authors (l. 1000, Fig. S6). In order to determine if the sedimentation properties observed are due to an artefact of the lysis conditions a physical breakage of the cells, using a French Press, should be carried out and then membranes purified by differential centrifugation. This is a standard, and well-established method (low-speed to remove debris and high-speed to sediment membranes) that has been used for S. pneumoniae over many years but would seem counter to the results in the current manuscript (for instance Hakenbeck, R. and Kohiyama, M. (1982), Purification of Penicillin-Binding Protein 3 from Streptococcus pneumoniae. European Journal of Biochemistry, 127: 231-236).</p>
<p>(4) l. 303-305. The authors suggest that the observed LTA-like bands disappear in a pulse chase experiment (Fig. 6B). What is the difference between this and Fig. 5B, where the bands do not disappear? Fig. 5C is the WT and was only pulse labelled for 5 min and so would one not expect the LTA-like bands to disappear as in 6B?</p>
<p>(5) Fig. 6B, l. 243-269 and l. 398-410. If, as stated, most of the LTA-like bands are actually precursor then how can the quantification of LTA stand as stated in the text? The &quot;Titration of Cellular TA&quot; section should be re-evaluated or removed? If you compare Fig. 6C WT extract incubated at RT and 110oC it seems like a large decrease in amount of material at the higher temperature. Thus, the WT has a lot of precursors in the membrane? This needs to be quantified.</p>
<p>(6) L. 339-351, Fig. 6A. A single lane on a gel is not very convincing as to the role of LytR. Here, and throughout the manuscript, wherever statements concerning levels of material are made, quantification needs to be done over appropriate numbers of repeats and with densitometry data shown in SI.</p>
<p>(7) 14. l. 385-391. Contrary to the statement in the text, the zwitterionic TA will have associated counterions that result in net neutrality. It will just have both -ve and +ve counterions in equal amounts (dependent on their valency), which doesn't matter if it is doing the job of balancing osmolarity (rather than charge).</p>

<p>The Gram-positive cell wall contains for a large part of TAs, and is essential for most bacteria. However, TA biosynthesis and regulation is highly understudied because of the difficulties in working with these molecules. This study closes some of our important knowledge gaps related to this and provides new and improved methods to study TAs. It also shows an interesting role for TAs in maintaining a 'periplasmic space' in Gram positives. Overall, this is an important piece of work. It would have been more satisfying if the possible causal link between TAs and periplasmic space would have been more deeply investigated with complemented mutants and CEMOVIS. For the moment, there is clearly something happening but it is not clear if this only happens in TA mutants or also in strains with capsules/without capsules and in PG mutants, or in lafB (essential for production of another glycolipid) mutants. Finally, some very strong statements are made suggesting several papers in the literature are incorrect, without actually providing any substantiation/evidence supporting these claims. This work pioneers some new methods that will definitively move the field forward.</p>
