<title>Abstract</title><p>Sensorimotor beta band oscillations are known to modulate during normal movement control and abnormal beta modulation is linked to pathological bradykinesia. However, the functional differences between beta localized to one brain area versus beta synchronized across brain areas remains unclear. We monitored beta bursts in non-human primates, both neurotypical and stroke- impaired, during the performance of complex motor tasks. Across both groups of animals, we identified two distinct beta burst types: global bursts that tend to be synchronized across cortical and subcortical areas, and local bursts that tend to be confined to cortex. These two types exhibited distinct neural dynamics, with global bursts linked to reduced firing variability and overall slowed movements. In contrast, local bursts often occurred during the execution of complex behaviors, particularly during prehension. We found evidence for changes in the distribution of global and local bursts during recovery after stroke. In impaired animals early after stroke, global bursts predominated and were associated with reduced speed and impaired grasping. Notably, recovery of grasping was associated with a reduction in global bursts and an increase in local bursts, suggesting that local bursts may play an important role during prehension. Our findings reveal distinct roles of global and local beta bursts and indicate that the normalization of global and local burst timing tracks recovery of dexterity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Beta band oscillations (∼13-30 Hz, hereafter “beta”) are ubiquitous throughout the sensorimotor primate brain. They are associated with normal movement control and somatosensory processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and are also implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Beta in both the cortex and the subcortex (e.g., basal ganglia and thalamus) is well known to undergo a coordinated suppression during simple, isolated, fast movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In PD, abnormal increases in beta in both cortical and subcortical areas are linked to bradykinesia and akinesia. Causal experiments have further shown that increases in beta result in slowing of movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, after stroke, incomplete beta suppression is linked with impaired movement control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Together, this implies that coordinated cortical-subcortical “global” beta is an anti-kinetic signal, reflecting neural firing patterns that are incompatible with movement generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, there are a few studies that appear to contradict the notion that beta always occurs globally and that it exclusively reflects an anti-kinetic state. For example, during complex movements – sequential or grasping actions – cortical and subcortical beta can become uncoupled such that each brain area has its own “local” beta dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, and cortical beta has been shown to persist throughout dynamic movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. This raises the possibility, evident only through studying complex movements, that local and global beta oscillations may signal two distinct neural computations.</p>
<p>In this study, we sought to characterize the cortical and subcortical beta dynamics that occur during complex behaviors in both stroke-impaired and neurotypical non-human primates. Leveraging recent findings that beta-band activity is better represented by brief, transient ’bursts’ rather than sustained oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, we discovered two distinct categories of beta bursts: global beta bursts that tend to occur synchronously across cortex and subcortex, and local beta bursts that tend to occur in a spatially limited area of cortex. Previous modeling and experimental evidence indicates that cortex can generate beta oscillations just with its own local circutry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, or in response to inputs from subcortical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, supporting this separation. By focusing on temporally precise beta burst events, we were able to study beta dynamics on a single trial level, enabling us to study the roles of global and local beta events during variable, complex behavior.</p>
<p>Our results from both stroke-impaired and healthy non-human primates performing complex movement tasks indicate that global and local bursts represent distinct neural computations: global bursts are associated with movement-inhibiting neural patterns while local bursts are associated with neural variability supporting the execution of complex behaviors. In post-stroke animals with impaired reach-to-grasp movement, mid-movement global beta bursts occurred frequently and were linked to slower movement speeds and impaired grasping. With the recovery of fast and reliable reach-to-grasp movements, we observed a reduction in mid-movement global beta bursts, but a striking increase in local cortical beta bursts. Analysis of cortical single-unit recordings revealed distinct roles: global bursts were associated with strong single-unit entrainment, and reduced firing rates and firing variability, whereas local bursts were spatially clustered in cortex and were associated with weak single-unit entrainment and preserved firing variability. Similar global and local patterns were observed in intact animals during complex sequential movement tasks. Altogether, these results highlight that global bursts are associated with constrained neural firing that is incompatible with fast movement, while local bursts are associated with greater neural variability and the ongoing execution of complex behaviors. These findings provide new insights into beta oscillations and their potential to understand recovery of motor control after stroke.</p>

<title>Recovery of dexterity from an M1 stroke</title>
    <p>To study cortical and subcortical signals during complex movement in impaired and recovered primates, we first trained rhesus macaques to perform a reach-to-grasp task (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). Animals initiated trials by pressing a button, then reached out, grasped an object through a slot, and lifted and held it above a designated height for a designated duration. Grasp difficulty depended on slot shape, where the precision slot was the most difficult and often required multiple manipulation attempts and the power slot was the easiest (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Animals were trained until performance plateaued. Next, animals underwent a stroke induction in which the one hemisphere’s primary motor cortex (M1) arm and hand area was targeted with surface vessel occlusion followed by subpial aspiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In the same surgery, microwire electrode arrays were implanted into ventral premotor cortex, i.e., part of the perilesional cortex, and a depth electrode was inserted to target subcortical motor thalamus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Post-operative CTs were fused with pre-operative CTs and MRIs to localize subcortical probe location. Location was determined to be sensorimotor thalamus for Monkey N (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>) and the internal capsule just outside sensorimotor thalamus for Monkey H (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>

Upon successfully holding, a door covering the slot and object retracted allowing access to the object. Animals reached through the slot (one of four possible slot shapes on a given trial) to grasp and lift the object. The object had to be lifted a height of approximately 1.5 cm for at least 0.267 seconds (object hold time) to trigger a juice reward. The time period from reach onset to grasp start was designated as “reach duration” and from grasp start to reward start as “grasp duration”.</p><p>B.

</fig>
    <p>As expected, behavior improved over time as animals recovered from the stroke (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-G</xref>). Also as expected from prior work, there was variability in recovery timeframes despite the same lesioning approach used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. While Monkey H exhibited a typical recovery within ∼2 weeks, Monkey N took longer. He exhibited a typical, though incomplete, recovery up to day 18, after which he had an atypical worsening in behavioral performance (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Following a period of worsening, Monkey N then exhibited a full recovery of behavior over time. In order to ensure we compared periods with an initial grasping impairment and periods with largely recovered function consistently in both animals, we chose to analyze Monkey N’s recovery up to day 18 and then compared the fully recovered days (day 73 onwards). Our choice of sessions did not significantly change the overall estimate of recovery rate in Monkey N (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
<p>To study the recovery of reaching and grasping separately, trials were segmented into reaching and grasping epochs. Each trial’s reach and grasp times were normalized by the pre-stroke mean of trials to that slot such that a value of “1” indicates performance on-par with pre-stroke data. Reaching behavior, grasping behavior, and percentage of trials performed correctly significantly improved with recovery in both animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-G</xref>). To assess how neural signals change as a function of recovery, we developed a “recovery index” where a value of 0 indicated minimal recovery as recorded on the first behavioral session after the stroke and a value of 1 indicated behavior on-par with pre-stroke behavior (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Identifying global and local beta bursts</title>
    <p>We first assessed field potential activity from cortex and subcortex recordings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H,I</xref>). We consistently saw power spectrums with peaks in the beta band frequency range of ∼10-40 Hz on both the cortical and subcortical array over the course of recovery. We next studied how beta band activity was coordinated between cortex and subcortex during animal behavior. We customized beta frequency ranges for each animal based on a data-driven approach (Monkey H: 15-35 Hz, Monkey N: 10-30 Hz)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and extracted beta burst events from all cortical and subcortical channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In general, we found that early after stroke beta burst events were strikingly coordinated both within cortex and across cortex and subcortex regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). Later after some recovery from stroke, we noticed that beta events were more isolated to groups of a few cortical channels and were often not as coordinated with subcortical beta bursts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
<p>This observation motivated us to segment beta burst events into two different categories based on the fraction of cortical channels that were simultaneously bursting together. We observed that when pooling over behavioral sessions across recovery that there was a bimodal distribution of the fraction of cortical channels in each burst (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To separate the bimodal distribution of bursts into two categories, we fit a Gaussian mixture model with two Gaussians to a session- averaged distribution. The crossing point between the two fit Gaussians was used a threshold for determining whether a particular burst event was in the category of “few isolated cortical channels bursting” or “many simultaneous cortical channels bursting”. As observed by the examples in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1JK</xref>, the fraction of burst events that were categorized as “few isolated cortical channels bursting” significantly increased with recovery from stroke (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Note that our segmentation of bursts into “isolated” and “simultaneous” was based solely on cortical channel bursting, though we observed that “simultaneous” cortical bursts often coincided with subcortical bursts whereas “isolated” ones did not. We confirmed that “isolated” events were significantly less likely to co- occur with subcortical bursts compared to “simultaneous” events (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). For this reason, we called the “isolated” events “local beta burst events” referring to their restriction to few channels in cortex, and the “simultaneous” events as “global beta burst events” referring to their inclusion of a large fraction of cortical channels and a high likelihood of the co-occurrence of subcortical bursting.</p>

<p>Local and global beta bursts exhibited distinct burst characteristics. We found that global burst events had significantly higher amplitudes, significantly longer durations, and significantly slower frequencies than local bursts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-F</xref>), suggesting that these bursts may have distinct mechanisms of generation.</p>
<p>One possibility we considered was that local beta bursts are just random, noisy events occurring on the cortical microelectrode array that are subthreshold global beta events. If this were the case, we would expect local bursts to involve cortical recording channels that are randomly distributed throughout the recording array (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). As we see in the single trial example (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), local beta bursts tend to be more spatially clustered on the array than what would be expected by random chance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) both during reaching and grasping local burst events. In addition, local bursts are significantly more spatially clustered than global beta bursts, which would not be expected if local bursts were weak, subthreshold global beta events (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Overall, we find that local bursts are unlikely to be subthreshold global bursts, but are their own distinct type of beta burst that is lower amplitude, more transient, higher in frequency, and more spatially clustered than global beta bursts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2DEF</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3CD</xref>). Below we further explore how local and global bursts differ in their task occurrence and in their relationship to spiking neural dynamics.</p>

<title>Global but not local beta bursts are associated with slow movement</title>
    <p>Global and local burst events occurred during different phases of the task and showed different dynamics with recovery from stroke. Early in stroke when animals were the most impaired, global beta bursts occurred frequently around grasp start (red box <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>). Grasp start is a behavioral marker that indicates the time point at which the animals have completed transporting their hand towards the slot and the grasping phase of the task is beginning. This occurrence of global beta bursts around grasp start significantly reduced with recovery (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Global beta burst events did not exhibit consistent significant changes when aligned to other task behavioral events. In contrast, local beta events did not show significant changes aligned to particular behavioral events, but did show significant increases throughout the trial period spanning from reach start to juice reward (red box <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>We can gain more insight into the relationship between beta burst events and behavior at the single-trial level. In single trials, we found that the fraction of the time between reach start and last object lift that is part of a global burst event was significantly correlated with the amount of time that a trial takes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-F</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). In other words, when trials were dominated by global burst events, they took significantly longer to complete. This relationship did not hold up for local beta burst events (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-F</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). This single trial analysis implies that global beta burst events reflect slowed movement periods. We confirmed that hand speed was significantly slower during global bursts events than local burst events for both the reaching epoch (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-H</xref>, <italic>left</italic>) and grasping epoch (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-H</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Overall, we found that global beta events occurred early after stroke during grasping periods and were associated with slower trial times and slower reach and grasp movements. On the other hand, local beta events emerged during movement as animals recovered from stroke but were not significantly linked to trial duration.</p>

<title>Recovery is associated with increases in grasp-epoch firing rate and firing variation</title>
    <p>We next sought to assess how local and global beta bursts interacted with single unit and population level firing properties over the course of recovery. Single units were detected on individual behavioral sessions and were analyzed as a group for changes in reaching and grasping epoch firing properties over the course of recovery. Due to poor unit yield in sessions early after stroke in one animal (monkey H) and diminishing unit yield in sessions with recovery in the second animal (monkey N), we divided sessions into “early” and “late” categories to pool units across sessions for each animal for a more balanced comparison (see <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). Representative trial-averaged z-scored single unit patterns aligned to reach start (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) and grasp start (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) show the general trend that reach-related single units are relatively equally modulated during early and late sessions whereas grasp-related single units show increases in modulation with recovery (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5AB</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). This was not surprising given that animals exhibited mild reaching deficits that recovered relatively quickly in comparison to animals’ more severe grasping deficits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F</xref>). To quantify this observation, we measured each recorded units’ firing rate and firing rate variation during reaching epochs and grasping epochs. We found that there were no significant differences in mean firing rate and firing rate variation in units during reaching epochs from early to late sessions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-D</xref>, <italic>gray</italic>), but there were significant increases in mean firing rate and firing rate variation in units during grasping epochs from early to late sessions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-D</xref>, <italic>purple</italic>). Overall, units significantly increased their grasp-epoch firing rates and firing rate variation from early to late recovery sessions.</p>

<title>Entrainment of single units to global bursts slow firing rate and firing variation</title>
<p>Given the changes in grasp-epoch firing properties of units, we next focused on how the presence of global and local beta burst events influenced grasp-epoch firing properties of units. We found that the grasp-epoch mean firing rate and firing rate variability were significantly lower during global burst events compared to no beta bursting events and compared to local burst events (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Firing variability was significantly lower during local burst events compared to no burst events, while firing rate was lower in one animal (Monkey H) and higher in the second animal (Monkey N) during local burst events compared to no burst events.</p>
<p>To link beta bursts more tightly to reductions in firing rate and firing variation, we sought to quantify the influence of beta bursts on individual units through measurements of phase entrainment. Example single unit waveforms and entrainment to local and global beta burst events are illustrated in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>. Entrainment is quantified by calculating each units’ phase histogram resultant vector length (<italic>r</italic>), and normalizing this by the mean and standard deviation of a shuffle distribution of <italic>r</italic> for that unit yielding a “modulation z-score”. In the representative units, the top unit shows stronger entrainment to global beta events whereas the bottom unit shows stronger entrainment to local beta events. Although individual units occasionally exhibit stronger entrainment to local beta events than to global beta events, the overall modulation z-scores of significantly entrained units (z-score &gt; 95th percentile of the shuffle distribution) are significantly higher for global beta bursts compared to local beta bursts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, we link each units’ entrainment to global and local burst events during grasp epochs to their change in firing rate and firing rate variation during grasp epochs.

<p>Altogether, both global and local beta bursts entrain units during the grasp epoch. Entrainment to global bursts but not local bursts is significantly correlated with reductions in firing rate and firing variability that might impede the increases in grasp-epoch firing rate and variability needed for grasp execution. Entrainment to local bursts does not significantly predict changes in firing rate or variability, suggesting that local bursts may reflect a fundamentally different neural computation than global bursts.</p>

<title>Interruption of population neural dynamics during global but not local beta bursts</title>
<p>In our previous work, we established that spatiotemporal patterns of neural populations become more temporally predictable as animals recover from stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Specifically, when fitting a linear model that predicts the future neural population activity pattern from the current pattern (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>), the predictability of the model has been shown to increase as animals recover, supporting that population neural patterns become more stereotyped with recovery. Here, we ask how the occurrence of local and global beta events influence the predictability of neural patterns. True and model-predicted population spiking patterns during grasping periods were collated during non- bursting bins, global bursting bins, and local bursting bins. The variance explained by the model- predicted bins was calculated for all three groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). Variance explained by model- predicted bins occurring during global bursts was significantly lower than variance explained by non-bursting bins. Variance explained by local bins was not significantly different from non- bursting bins or global bursting bins. Overall, this supports that predictable spatiotemporal patterns of spiking that have been shown to become more predictable with recovery are interrupted during global but not local bursts.</p>

<p>When assessing the fraction of cortical channels simultaneously bursting, there was a clear bimodal distribution in both animals (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). We used the same Gaussian mixture model approach to identify a threshold between local and global events. We found that global beta events tended to occur during non-movement periods between reaches whereas local beta events could occur during movements if they were low speed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). As in the stroke recovery data, hand speeds were significantly lower during global beta bursts compared to local beta bursts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, in stroke and neurotypical non-human primates performing complex behaviors, we find that beta burst events are dissociable into local events that are limited to few spatially clustered channels in cortex and global events that involve many simultaneously bursting cortical channels that tend to co-occur with subcortical beta bursts. Global bursts occur more frequently in movement-impaired animals, occur mid-movement, and are associated with slow movement speeds. On the other hand, local bursts occur more frequently in recovered animals throughout behavior. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> summarizes these findings.</p>

<title>Dichotomy of global versus local beta bursts</title>
<p>The identification of separate global and local beta bursts required a focus on beta burst events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> instead of continuous, channel-averaged beta power. If we had only analyzed channel- averaged beta power, we would have missed the local beta bursts due to their lower amplitude and fewer number of involved channels. This finding also required an electrophysiology preparation with a cortical multi-electrode array and a subcortical recording probe. Multiple contacts in a single cortical area were required for detecting synchronous beta bursts, and the subcortical probe was required to associate the synchronous bursts with subcortical bursts. Previous studies in humans undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery or with a chronically implanted DBS device plus cortical ECoG strip have such a preparation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, but the density of recording sites in a single cortical area is limited. In non-human primate movement control research, there are few labs that simultaneously record from cortical and subcortical sites. A further impediment to the observation of global versus local beta bursts may be certain referencing schemes used to pre-process the LFP signal -- bipolar signal acquisition, or common average referencing on a cortical array would subtract away substantial segments of the global beta oscillations.</p>
<p>While the specific dichotomy of global and local beta bursts has not been previously reported, other studies point towards the findings of synchronous and isolated beta bursts in motor cortex. A recent study from Denker et. al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> focuses on beta phase patterns across an intracortical array during movement preparation. While the focus of their study is on their findings of traveling waves in planar, circular, radial, and rotating configurations, they also find synchronous and random phase patterns. Since their study does not use a beta amplitude threshold to determine which channels are engaged in bursting, it is not directly comparable to the classification scheme in our study. However, based on when the different spatiotemporal patterns tend to occur during a reach- to-grasp behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, it seems likely that the synchronous waves correspond to global beta events as they tend to both occur prior to and following movement. The random waves likely correspond to local beta events as they both tend to occur throughout behavior, especially during grasping movements. Note here that “random” refers to random beta phase patterns, not random channels.</p>

<title>Global bursts and slowed movement</title>
<p>Here, the occurrence of global beta oscillations corresponded to periods of slowed movement in both stroke-impaired and intact animals. Given that global beta oscillations tend to co-occur with subcortical beta oscillations, this observation is consistent with the Parkinson’s disease literature that finds increased subcortical beta in PD movement-impaired patients compared to non-PD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. We also find that global beta oscillations entrain cortical neurons, consistent with findings in PD patients that the amplitude of high gamma signals, a possible proxy for multi-unit spiking activity, in sensorimotor cortical ECoG phase-lock to beta much more than in non-PD patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Here we find that the degree of entrainment to global beta predicts how strongly neural activity firing rates and firing rate variability will decrease during global beta events. Since recovery from stroke is associated with increased firing rate modulation around grasp periods (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5CD</xref>), this evidence supports the possibility that over-entrainment of cortical neurons to global beta impairs the neural modulation needed for effectively generating signals for control of movement. This phenomenon is consistent with theories of how exaggerated subcortical beta in PD disrupts cortical neural patterns needed to generate movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Lastly, we find that global beta bursts that seem to impair movement are longer duration than local beta bursts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), consistent with the finding in PD that movement impairment is associated with longer duration beta bursts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. More recent work has designed adaptive deep brain stimulation in PD patients to shorten beta burst duration and has demonstrated clinical improvement greater than conventional deep brain stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. This is suggestive of an intervention post-stroke that specifically targets long-duration global beta bursts.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Mechanisms resulting in excessive global beta after stroke</title>
<p>Overall, we find high global beta early in stroke when animals exhibit movement impairment. In PD, a lack of dopamine in the striatum is thought to compromise its ability to attenuate beta oscillations, resulting in the excessive subcortical beta observed in PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. However, in stroke, the origin of the excessive global beta is less clear. One candidate mechanism is the known increase in GABA following an infarct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Increases in GABAA-currents have been demonstrated to increase the power of beta oscillations and slightly reduce their peak frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In our study, we do observe an increase in the peak frequency of beta with recovery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref> HI), possibly mirroring the reduction in excess GABA. Another possible mechanism is related to the commonly observed post-stroke increase in resting state low frequency oscillations in cortex and subcortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Low frequency oscillations are thought to emerge due to the disconnection of cortex from subcortical nodes, a phenomenon that drives subcortex into an autonomous oscillatory mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. A recent neural network model of cortical beta oscillations demonstrates that external inputs into cortex that have a high autocorrelation (i.e. are low frequency) tends to drive longer duration beta bursts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Supp. 3, Panel G, P). Thus, it is possible that the exacerbated post-stroke non-task related low frequency oscillations may contribute to driving intermittent global beta bursts.</p>
<p>Another possibility emerges from the view that beta oscillations in cortex, whether local or global, reflect an output from the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loop that helps stabilize cortical patterning. In the neurologically-intact brain, coordinated cortical co-firing patterns spatiotemporally modulate the putamen, a key basal ganglia structure involved in motor control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Coordinated cortical-putamen patterns emerge with skill learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and are filtered through the rest of basal ganglia and thalamus, and conveyed back to cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Beta oscillations output from the basal ganglia have been hypothesized to contribute to the inhibition of unselected actions or effectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, or the stabilization of motor plans to prevent interference from competing actions or other salient cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. For precise reach-to-grasp behaviors, transient, spatially specific local beta bursts may then reflect a finely tuned circuit that enables accurate grasping in response to sensory feedback while stabilizing the proximal arm.</p>
<p>After an M1 stroke, the loss of cortical-striatal coordination may lead to the breakdown of the network’s ability to output fine-tuned, localized beta bursting and result in the emergence of more global, less specific beta bursts. Recovery of skilled prehension in rodents is associated with the restoration of coordinated activity between the perilesional cortex and striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Perhaps consistent with this model, we find that increased grasp-related firing and neural variability in ventral premotor cortex is associated recovery of prehension control and more localized beta bursts.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Global versus local beta bursts during grasping</title>
<p>Why global beta oscillations tended to occur at grasp start could be due to a few different reasons. First, spiking modulation around grasp start was very weak early after stroke (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) This observation is corroborated by other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. It has been hypothesized that strong beta signals tend to occur during periods of weak spike co-firing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Thus, the unusually weak neural co-firing at grasp start could allow global beta signals to intrude. A second possibility is that, after stroke, movements have been observed to be more fragmented and less smoothly executed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. As the reach-to-grasp task consists of a reaching movement to transport the hand, followed by a grasp, it is possible that the movement is being segmented into two separate “reach” and “grasp” movements. The global beta observed at grasp start may then just be the classic post movement beta resynchronization following the reaching component. With recovery then, the two movements may have been fused back into a single reach-to-grasp movement.</p>
<p>In contrast to global beta, a spatially clustered, lower amplitude, higher frequency, local-to-cortex beta was characterized. Local beta increased in prevalence with recovery from stroke (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), and tended to occur during grasping phases of the reach-to-grasp movement (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). This finding contrasts with the general notion that beta bursts are not present during movement. However, there are exceptions to this rule: beta bursting is high in cortex during object grasps when animals must output non-zero muscular force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, as well as during tactile exploration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. This reach-to-grasp task was indeed more of a tactile exploration task since animals had to reach into a slot to retrieve an object that they might not always be able to view. Multiple attempts to grasp the object were often needed. Previous work has demonstrated that neurons in the grasping network, involving parietal cortex, premotor cortex, and primary motor cortex have been shown to communicate at beta frequencies during reach-to-grasp tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Somatosensory and motor cortices have also been shown to communicate at beta frequencies during object manipulation tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Within premotor cortex, previous work has distinguished between low frequency beta oscillations that are anti-correlated with movement such that more low frequency beta delays movement onset, and higher frequency beta oscillations that occur prior to fast movement onset times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. As our local beta bursts are higher frequency than the global beta bursts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), it is possible they may reflect this pro-kinetic signal.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that since the grasping behavior in this study consisted of multiple grasping segments such as object contact, object pinch, re-attempted object pinches, object lift, and object hold, local beta oscillations could occur intermittently during the pinch and hold phases of this task. In addition, it is possible that beta occurring in between grasping movement phases potentially reflects future grasp plans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Finally, the spatial focality of the local beta bursts suggests that these bursts may encode information in a somatotopically relevant manner. Indeed, it has been shown that focal stimulation in somatosensory cortex will drive a somatotopically corresponding site in motor cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Thus, particular somatosensory events experienced by specific fingers such as object contact, object slip, or object holds may drive perilesional motor cortex beta oscillations at sites that are somatotopically matched. Further adding to this notion is evidence that somatosensory stimulation can drive beta desynchronizations and subsequent synchronizations, and that the strength of these synchronizations increase with recovery from stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. In summary, local beta may reflect grasp planning inter-movement epochs, object pinch and/or hold epochs, or responses to salient somatosensory feedback.</p>

<title>Biomarker of impairment</title>
<p>Previous studies have developed biomarkers of movement impairment based on beta desynchronization and resynchronization dynamics during simple movements or beta levels at rest. For example, a lack of full cortical beta desynchronization characterizes impaired movement following stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Excessive subcortical beta power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, excessive coupling between high frequency signals and beta signals in cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and excessive cortico-cortical coherence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> predict an impaired state in PD. Overall, our findings that excessive global beta during movement predict slower movement speeds and greater movement impairment are consistent with trends observed in previous stroke studies and Parkinson’s disease literature.</p>
<p>What is particularly novel in this study is that we find <italic>increased</italic> prevalence of local beta events during movement as animals recovered from stroke and showed behavioral improvement. As described above, we hypothesize these increases could reflect planning, object holding/pinching, or beta rebounds following the communication of salient somatosensory feedback. It is possible then, that detection of local beta during grasping may serve as an additional biomarker of sensorimotor function. While global beta may reflect a brain state that impedes movement execution, perhaps due to excess synchrony, in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loop, local beta may reflect cortico-cortical communication necessary for execution of complex movements that require planning and corrections based on feedback. As suggested previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, in order for motor area beta oscillations to be successfully driven by other cortical areas, cortical network connectivity may need to recover. The increased prevalence of local beta events following recovery of complex movement could then reflect progress of this cortico-cortical reconnection.</p>
<p>Overall, we were able to discover distinct categories of global and local beta burst dynamics during complex behavior in movement-impaired and neurologically intact non-human primates. Global bursts are largely consistent with previous reports of beta as an anti-movement signal, while local bursts are a novel finding that may reflect cortico-cortical communication needed for complex movement. Future work will determine the utility of separately tracking global and local signals in movement disorders.</p>

<title>Subcortical electrode array implantation</title>
<p>A vector array consisting of a stainless steel support body (419 um outer diameter) with a thin silicon shank (50uM thickness) with 32 electrode contacts (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, Michigan) was used to target subcortical sites. Specifically, a V1x32-Edge-15mm-100-177-CVZ32 with a 24mm support body, a 10cm flex cable, and 32 electrode contacts with 100 uM spacing spanning the last 3.1 mm of the silicon shank was used in Monkey H. The array was identical for Monkey N except the connector was different (Omnetics instead of ZIF clip) and the support body was 18mm instead of 24 mm.</p>
<p>For Monkey H, stereotaxic coordinates were used to plan the electrode trajectory to target the VL nucleus of motor thalamus. Before surgery, the site of insertion for the electrode trajectory was identified on the MRI and was measured with respect to visually identifiable landmarks such as the precentral dimple and central sulcus. During surgery, the electrode array was placed in a micromanipulator using a 3D printed adaptor designed to hold the array straight up and down and attached to the stereotax. The electrode was moved to stereotaxic coordinates. This insertion location was then verified by measuring its distances from the visually identifiable landmarks and confirming that they were as expected based on the pre-surgical measurements. The electrode was then lowered 24mm and secured in place.</p>
<p>Based on the imperfect insertion of the electrode array into motor thalamus in Monkey H, we used a different technique for the insertion of the array for Monkey N. Specifically, we adapted the following fiducial approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> to ensure excellent alignment between surgical stereotaxic coordinates and MRI coordinates for more accurate targeting of the subcortical nuclei. We almost completely followed the approach outlined in Bentley et. al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> with the following changes: Instead of using bone screws as fiducial markers, we used multi-modal fiducial markers (IZI Medical, Owings Mills, MD) that were placed on the skin during the subject’s MRI. Since these markers have a hole in the middle of them, skin tattoos were placed at the center of the fiducials for later measurement. In surgery, we measured the tattoos in stereotaxic coordinates. These measurements were used to align MRI coordinates to the surgical space’s stereotaxic coordinates. Surface landmarks that were pre-identified on the MRI (such as start of arcuate sulcus spur, anterior and posterior most aspects of the precentral dimple, anterior most point of the central sulcus) were measured in stereotaxic space to validate the coordinate transform. Our code and methodology for this realignment approach is described further <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/smg211/NHP_Imaging">https://github.com/smg211/NHP_Imaging</ext-link>.</p>
<p>An electrode trajectory that would reach the VL thalamic nucleus was then planned by converting the pre-identified MRI target coordinate to the surgical space stereotaxic coordinate. An angled trajectory was planned to increase the probability of hitting the target even considering errors of 1-2 mm. The surface entry location of the electrode and the electrode entry angle was selected. Electrophysiological recordings were monitored during the lowering of the probe, and spiking activity was observed while the electrode contacts were in cortex, midway through the lowering of the trajectory (likely recordings from caudate nucleus), and at the end of the trajectory.</p>

<title>Reach-to-grasp Behavior</title>
<sec id="s5b1">
<title>Task</title>
<p>Prior to surgery, macaques were trained to perform a reach-to-grasp task that allowed us to automatically assess grasping behaviors of different difficulties throughout the course of behavioral recovery. Briefly the behavior required animals to reach out to grasp an object, and lift it to a certain height for a designated hold period in order to receive a juice reward. The animals had to fit their fingers through a “slot” to grasp the object, and the slot could be one of four shapes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). The shape of the slot changed the difficulty of the grasping task. This behavior is an adaptation of our previous “pinch-and-lift” task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, animals initiate a trial by depressing a button for a designated hold time (Monkey H: 0.2 sec, Monkey N: 1.5 sec). Upon successful hold, a door blocking access to the slot and the object retracts (Supp. Fig. 2B-C), signaling the start of the trial. Animals then reached toward the task’s object. To successfully grasp the object, they had to shape their fingers to fit through a particular slot. On every trial, the slot could either be a “precision” slot, a “pinch” slot, a “tripod” slot, or a “power” slot (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Each of these slot types constrained the grasp in different ways, making grasping easy (e.g. power slot in which a whole-handed grasp could be used to grab the object), more moderate (e.g. pinch or tripod slots in which only the index and thumb or index, middle finger, and thumb could fit into the slot to grasp the object), or very difficult (e.g. precision slot in which the index and thumb could fit into the slot in a particular configuration and in which the object had to be lifted out of the slot at a very particular angle). The slots were cut into a piece of acrylic that was shaped like a wheel, and were controlled by a motor that rotated the wheel such that the slot for that trial was aligned with the object (Supp. Fig. 2D-E). The wheel was rotated into the correct position prior to the start of each trial. Finally, animals lifted a 3D printed object that was a tall rectangle. The object was 12.5mm in width, 7mm in thickness, and 45mm in height. The object needed to be lifted approximately 15mm to trigger the completion of an infrared (IR) beam break sensor (3mm LED, Adafruit.com). Animals had to hold the device at the lifted height for 0.267 sec, following which they received a juice reward through a chair- mounted juice tube. Animals had 10 seconds from the time of the door opening to complete the object lift. If the object was lifted high enough to allow the IR beam sensor to complete, but did not maintain that hold for long enough (i.e, “hold error”), the 10 second timer was restarted. If animals did not complete the lift by the timeout time, the trial would end and the door would gently close. Animals performed 10-100 trials per day, depending on impairment. Which slot types were used on which day and their relative ratios of presentation were selected based estimates of impairment.</p>
<p>Two cameras (CM3-U3-13Y3C-CS, Point Grey, Richmond, BC, Canada) were mounted to a stainless steel platform providing a side and top view of the animal performing the reach-to-grasp task. Camera frames were captured at 50 Hz. Camera frames and task sensor activity were synchronized using the electrophysiology recordings system (Tucker-Davis Technology, Alachua FL).</p>

<p>The time at which the IR beam break sensor was lifted above the 15mm height criteria for 0.267 seconds was designated as “<italic>reward time”.</italic> We note that due to slight imprecision in the task code apparatus (each task cycle was not exactly the same length of time), some trials that were designated as reward trials by post-processing analysis of the beam break sensor were not actually rewarded during the behavior, and some trials that were rewarded during the behavior were not designated as reward trials by post-processing analysis. For consistency, we use the post-processing analysis of the beam break sensor to assign trials to as rewarded versus unrewarded.</p>

<title>Calculation of behavioral metrics</title>
<p>Reach duration is defined as the time between <italic>reach start</italic> and <italic>grasp start</italic>. Grasp duration is defined for rewarded trials only, and is the time between <italic>grasp start</italic> and <italic>reward time</italic>. Normalized reach duration and grasp duration is used in order to combine reach and grasp durations across trials types of different difficulty. Normalized reach duration or normalized grasp duration for a particular trial is defined as reach or grasp duration divided by the average reach or grasp duration of all the pre-stroke trials that were executed to that trial’s particular slot. For example, the normalized reach duration of a trial performed with the “pinch” slot would be calculated as the reach duration of the trial divided by the mean reach duration for all pre-stroke trials completed on the pinch slot. When normalized times are &gt; 1, this indicates reach or grasp durations that are much slower than pre-stroke behavior. When normalized times ∼= 1, this indicates reach or grasp duration that are similar to the pre-stroke behavior. In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E, F</xref>, only rewarded trials are used to calculate normalized reach duration and normalized. grasp duration.</p>
<p>Normalized trial times are also calculated using the time between <italic>reach start</italic> and <italic>last lift</italic> and normalizing using pre-stroke baseline data as outlined above (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4EF</xref>)</p>
<p>Percent correct is calculated as the fraction of rewarded trials for a particular day.</p>
<p>To combine the normalized reach and grasp durations and the percent correct metrics, a “recovery index” metric was developed. The recovery index was defined by first calculating the total “trial time” for each trial. Trial time for rewarded trials was defined as the time between the reach start and reward time. Trial time for unrewarded trials was defined as 10 seconds (the timeout time). Then, the normalized trial time was calculated by dividing each trial’s trial time by the average pre-stroke trial time for that trial’s slot. The normalized trial times were then averaged over all trials on each day to yield an average normalized trial time for that day. Note that normalized trial times will typically vary between 1 (indicating similar performance to pre-stroke) and a larger number (indicating longer durations compared to pre-stroke). The day-averaged normalized trials times were then all decremented by 1 (such that now values varied between zero and a larger number), and then divided by the first post-stroke day’s value (such that now values varied between 0 and 1 where 0 indicated pre-stroke baseline, and 1 indicated deficits as large as the first day of behavioral testing after stroke). Finally, the values were subtracted from 1, such that a value of 0 indicated a deficit as large as the first day post-stroke, and a value of 1 indicated behavior similar to the pre-stroke baseline. The average recovery index over all trials on a particular session is used as that day’s recovery index. Recovery indices are plotted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>.</p>
<p>In some analyses involving spiking activity, recovery curves are split into “early” and “late” segments. For monkey N, “early” sessions are designated as sessions where the recovery index is &lt; 0.5, and “late” sessions are designated as sessions where the recovery index is &gt; 0.5. For monkey H, only two sessions (and only one with useable neural data) would have fallen in the “early” category if a threshold of 0.5 was used. Thus, the threshold for “early” and “late” was set to 0.8. See supplementary table 1 for which days are early vs. late.</p>

<p>The sequential target-reaching task (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>) was implemented on a 15-inch touchscreen tablet (Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra, Samsung). Touchscreen input was sampled at 120 Hz and recorded on the task workstation. At the start of each trial, the screen displayed 9 yellow unfilled circles (diameter = 3.8 cm), arranged in a symmetrical 3 × 3 grid (inter-row and inter-column spacing = 6.5 cm). To initiate a trial, animals held their hand on an external start button positioned below the screen for 1 s. Then, one of the yellow circles on the screen would become filled, representing the first target. Immediately after the animal touched the target, that target would become unfilled and the next target would be filled. This process repeated until the animal touched the fifth target. A tone was played when each target was presented. Immediately after the animal touched the fifth target, a separate tone was played, the screen color changed to all white, and a juice reward was automatically dispensed. After juice was dispensed, the screen color changed to all black, and the inter-trial interval (ITI) started. The ITI duration was randomly selected from a normal distribution with <italic>μ</italic> = 1.0 s and <italic>σ</italic> = 0.2 s.

The angle and the final electrode position dictated the electrode trajectory shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <bold>C</bold>.</p><p>These slices reveal that the final electrode positions were either in (Monkey N) or just outside in the white matter (Monkey H), the VL nucleus of the motor thalamus. For the purposes of this study, we simply refer to these electrode recording locations as “subcortical”.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Reach-to-grasp task The CAD model of the reach-to-grasp task.</title><p>A) Appearance of the fully assembled reach-to-grasp task from the perspective of the side camera at the start of a trial. The button is highlighted in white. The button houses two square force sensitive resistors (Sparkfun.com, SEN-09376) with wires that are routed to the back of the task (indicated by dashed black lines). The wires are covered by a “wire protector” piece. Animals must first depress the button for a designated hold period in order to open the door to the slot and object to start the trial.</p><p>B) Removal of “backsplash” for better visualization of the slot door apparatus (shown in white). A linear slide potentiometer (Bourns PSM60-081A-103B2) is seated behind the backsplash and has a lever that is fixed to a 3D printed door.</p><p>C) After the button has been depressed for the designated hold period, the door slides open, revealing the object and the slot that must be reached through in order to grasp the object.</p><p>D) Removal of the door and the structural pieces of the task apparatus for better visualization of the “wheel” that has the slot cutouts. The wheel is fixed to a DC motor through a coupler (shown in E). Prior to each trial, the motor spins the wheel such that the correct slot is aligned with the object. A magnetic solenoid’s (Adafuit.com, Product ID = 3992) piston is released through holes on the outside of the wheel to lock the wheel in place and prevent the animal from moving the wheel during a trial. The tripod slot is shown in the current trial.</p><p>E) The wheel and other structural pieces of the task have been removed to visualize the DC motor (Adafuit.com, Product ID 4416), the DC motor coupler (Pololu Robotics and Electronics, Pololu item # 1079, Pololu Universal Aluminum Mounting Hub for 3mm Shaft, #2-56 Holes (2-Pack), and the housing that was 3D printed to attach the motor to the task apparatus.</p><p>F) Removal of the wheel motor and other structural parts to reveal the “object” (green), and the custom 3D printed apparatus that houses the object (red) and the IR beam break sensors that detect the object height. The object has a threaded rod that twists through its body, and through vertical slots on the housing. This rod and the track for the rod in the housing constrains the motion of the object to be up and down. The housing also contains cutouts for the IR beam break sensors (Adafruit.com, Product ID 2167) that detect if the object has been lifted above the 15mm height (shown in black).</p><p>G) View of the re-assembled task with the door open revealing the slot and the object to be lifted. The black horizontal line indicates a line used in behavioral analysis (Methods, Reach-to-grasp behavior, automatic extraction of behavioral timepoints, relevant to identification of the “crossing frame”)</p></caption>

<caption><title>Monkey N full recovery curve</title><p>Monkey N underwent an unusual recovery curve. Initially, from days 7 to 18 after stroke, Monkey N exhibited a typical recovery with a reduction in reach-to-grasp time and an increase in percent correct. At Day 21 (red arrow), we noticed a return of his arm and hand impairment concomitantly with a significant reduction in cortical array spiking quality. We performed neuroimaging (CT) but were unable to see evidence of an obvious secondary brain injury or of an infection. We continued attempting to test Monkey N using the reach-to-grasp task outlined in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1AB</xref>, but he continued to exhibit an inability to perform the task and poor cortical array spiking signals. At Day 35 (orange arrow) we introduced a new “object” within the same reach-to-grasp task format. The new object had a large ball on top of the existing rectangular object, which made finding the object and grasping it much easier. We continued testing Monkey N on this task until Day 53 at which point he was able to begin performing the original reach-to-grasp task again. We are still investigating the possible causes of his secondary decline.</p><p>Because of this unusual recovery curve and because we have been unable to pinpoint the cause of the secondary decline, we have chosen to focus on the initial albeit incomplete recovery curve (days 7- 20) augmented by a few days at the end of his recovery once his performance was back at pre-stroke baseline. Since the purpose of our study is to examine how global and local beta dynamics change with recovery from stroke, it was important to us that our choice of sessions did not modify the overall dynamics of Monkey N’s recovery curve. To test this, we fit a linear regression to behavioral data from all days (gray lines in A, B) and fit a regression to only the sessions we analyzed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1EFG</xref> (black lines in A, B). We tested whether the slopes of these regressions differed significantly (F-test). For both normalized reach-to- grasp time and normalized percent correct there was no significant difference between the slopes of the gray and black lines (A: normalized reach-to-grasp time, p = 0.548, B: normalized percent correct, p = 0.681). See Table S1 for more details about exactly which days of data were used in each analysis.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study investigates changes in oscillatory activity across cortical and subcortical areas during stroke recovery in a nonhuman primate model. The authors distinguish between global and local oscillatory bursts, providing <bold>solid</bold> evidence that these two types of bursts correlate with distinct aspects of movement; additionally, they show that the likelihood of these bursts occurring follows opposing trends during recovery. The study could be further improved by accounting for inter-individual differences and by some technical improvements, such as employing more robust burst detection methods and more stringent analyses.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates beta burst dynamics in the primate motor cortex during movement and recovery from stroke. The authors differentiate between &quot;global&quot; beta bursts, which are synchronous across cortical and often subcortical regions, and more spatially confined &quot;local&quot; bursts. Global bursts are associated with reduced spiking variability, slower movements, and are more frequent after stroke, while local bursts increase during recovery and grasp execution. The study provides compelling evidence that beta bursts with different spatial and temporal characteristics may play distinct roles in motor control and recovery.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strength of this paper lies in its conceptual advance: the identification and characterization of distinct global and local beta bursts in the primate motor cortex. This distinction builds upon and considerably extends previous work on the heterogeneity of beta bursts. The paper is methodologically rigorous, using simultaneous cortical and subcortical recordings, detailed behavioral tracking, and thorough analyses of spike-LFP interactions. The use of stroke models and neurotypical animals provides converging evidence for the functional dissociation between burst types. The observation that local bursts increase with motor recovery and occur during grasping is particularly novel and may prove valuable for developing biomarkers of motor function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several conceptual and methodological limitations that should be addressed. First, the burst detection method relies on an amplitude threshold (median + 1 SD), which is susceptible to false positives and variability (Langford &amp; Wilson, 2025). The classification into global or local bursts then depends on the number of co-bursting channels, compounding the arbitrariness. Second, the imposition of a minimum of three co-bursting cortical channels may bias against the detection of truly local bursts. Third, the classification is entirely cortical; subcortical activity is considered post hoc rather than integrated into the classification, despite the key role of subcortical-cortical synchrony in motor control. Fourth, the apparent dissociation between global and local bursts raises important questions about their spatial distribution across areas like M1 and PMv, which are not thoroughly analyzed. Finally, while the authors interpret local bursts during grasping as novel, similar findings have been reported (e.g., Szul et al., 2023; Rayson et al., 2023), and a deeper discussion of these precedents would strengthen the argument.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>This work is likely to have a substantial impact on the field of motor systems neuroscience. The distinction between global and local beta bursts offers a promising framework for understanding the dual roles of beta in motor inhibition and sensorimotor computation. The findings are relevant not only for basic research but also for translational efforts in stroke rehabilitation and neuromodulation, particularly given the emerging interest in beta burst-based biomarkers and stimulation targets. The dataset and analytical framework will be useful to researchers investigating beta dynamics, spike-field relationships, and recovery from neural injury.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper by Khanna et al. describes global vs local beta synchrony between a cortical premotor area (PMv) and subcortical structures during motor tasks in the non-human primate, specifically investigating the progression following M1 injury. They found that increases in global beta synchrony between PMv and subcortical structures during the sub-acute phase of injury, and that global synchrony was associated with relatively slower motor movements. As recovery progressed, they report a shift from global synchrony to local synchrony and a subsequent reduction in the movement time. The authors suggest that global changes in subcortical and cortical beta synchrony may generally underpin a variety of movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease, and that shifting from global to local (or reducing global synchrony) might improve functional outcomes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Ischemic insults and other acquired brain injuries have a significant public health impact. While there is a large body of clinical and basic science studies describing the behavioral, neurophysiological, and mechanistic outcomes of such injury, there is a significant lack studies looking at longitudinal, behaviorally-related neurophysiological measures following cortical injury, so any information has outsized contribution to understanding how brain injury disrupts underlying neural activity and how this may contribute to injury presentation and recovery.</p>
<p>A significant percentage of pre-clinical stroke studies tend to focus on peri-infarct or other cortical structures and their role in recovery. The addition of subcortical recordings allows for the investigation of the role of thalamo-basal gangliar-cortical loops that may be contributing to the degree of impairment or to the recovery process is important for the field. Here, there are longitudinal (up to 3 months post-injury) recordings in the ventral premotor area (PMv) and either the internal capsule or sensorimotor thalamus that can be synchronized with phases of behavioral recovery.</p>
<p>The methods are well described and can act as a framework for assessing synchrony across other data sets with similar recording locations. Limitations in methodology, recordings, and behavior were noted.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A major limitation of this paper is that it is a set of case studies rather than a well-designed, well-controlled study of beta synchrony following motor cortex injury. While non-human primate neurophysiological studies are almost always limited by extremely low animal numbers, they are made up for by the fact that they can acquire significant numbers of units or channels, and in the case of normal behavior, can obtain many behavioral trials over months of individual sessions. Here, there were two NHPs used, but they had different subcortical implant locations (thalamus vs internal capsule). They had different injury outcomes, with one showing a typical recovery curve following injury while one had complications and worsening behavior before ultimately recovering. Further, there were significant differences in the ability to record at different times, with one NHP having poor recordings early in the recovery process while one had poor recordings late in the process. Due to the injury, the authors report sessions in which they were not able to record many trials (~10). Assuming that recovery after a cortical injury is an evolving process, breaking analysis into &quot;Early&quot; and &quot;Late&quot; phases reduces the interpretation of where these shifts occur relative to recovery on the task, especially given different thresholds for recovery were used between animals. Because of this, despite a careful analysis of the data and an extensive discussion, the conclusions derived are not particularly compelling. To overcome this, the authors present data from neurotypical NHPs, but with electrodes in M1 rather than PMv, doing a completely different task with no grasping component, again making accurate conclusions about the results difficult. Even with low numbers, the study would have been much stronger if there were within-animal longitudinal data prior to and after the injury on the same task, so the impact of M1 injury could be better assessed.</p>
<p>It is unclear to what extent the subpial aspiration used is a stroke model. While it is much more difficult to perform a pure ischemic motor injury using electrocoagulatory methods in animal models that do not have a lissencephalic cortex, the suction ablation method that the authors use leads to different outcomes than an ischemic injury alone. For instance, in rat models, ischemic vs suction ablation leads to very different electrophysiological profiles and differences in underlying anatomical reorganization (see Carmichael and Chesselet, 2002), even if the behavioral outcomes were similar. There is a concern that the effects shown may be an artifact of the lesion model rather than informing underlying mechanisms of recovery.</p>
<p>The injury model leads to seemingly mild impairments in grasp (but not reach), with rapid and complete recovery occurring within 2-3 weeks from the time of injury. Because of the rapid recovery, relating the physiological processes of recovery to beta synchronization becomes challenging to interpret - Are the global bursts the result of the loss of M1 input to subcortical structures? Are they due to the lack of M1 targets, so there is a more distributed response? Is this due to other post-injury sub-acute mechanisms? How specific is this response - is it limited to peri-infarct areas (and to what extent is the PMv electrode truly in peri-infarct cortex), or would this synchrony be seen anywhere in the sensorimotor networks? Are the local bursts present because global synchrony wanes over time as a function of post-injury homeostatic mechanisms, or is local beta synchrony increasing as new motor plans are refined and reinforced during task re-acquisition? How coupled are they related to recovery - if it is motor plan refinement, the shift from global to local seemingly should lag the recovery? While the study has significant limitations in design that reduce the impact of the results, it should act as a useful baseline/pilot data set in which to build a more complete picture of the role of subcortical-cortical beta synchrony following cortical injury.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Khanna et al. use a well-conceived and well-executed set of experiments and analyses primarily to document the interaction between neural oscillations in the beta range (here, 13-30 Hz) and recovery of function in an animal model of stroke. Specifically, they show that cortical &quot;beta bursts&quot;, or short-term increases in beta power, correlate strikingly with the timeline of behavioral recovery as quantified with a reach-to-grasp task. A key distinction is made between global beta bursts (here, those that synchronize between cortical and subcortical areas) and local bursts (which appear on only a few electrodes). This distinction of global vs. local is shown to be relevant to task performance and movement speed, among other quantities of interest.</p>
<p>A secondary results section explores the relationship between beta bursts and neuronal firing during the grasp portion of the behavioral task. These results are valuable to include, though mostly unsurprising, with global beta in particular associated with lower mean and variance in spike rates.</p>
<p>Last, a partial recapitulation of the primary results is offered with a neurologically intact (uninjured) animal. No major contradictions are found with the primary results.</p>
<p>Highlights of the Discussion section include a thoughtful review of atypical movements executed by individuals with Parkinson's disease or stroke survivors, placing the current results in an appropriate clinical context. Potential physiological mechanisms that could account for the observed results are also discussed effectively.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this is a very interesting paper. The ultimate impact will be enhanced by the authors' choice to analyze beta bursts, which remain a relatively under-explored aspect of neural coding.</p>
<p>The reach-and-grasp task was also a well-considered choice; the combination of a relatively simple movement (reaching towards a target in the same location each time) and a more complex movement (a skilled object-manipulation grasp) provides an internal control of sorts for data analysis. In addition, the task's two sub-movements provide a differential in terms of their likelihood to be affected by the stroke-like injury: proximal muscles (controlling reach) are likely to be less affected by stroke, while distal muscles (controlling grasp) are highly likely to be affected. Lastly, the requirement of the task to execute an object lift maximizes its difficulty and also the potential translational impact of the results on human injury.</p>
<p>The above comments about the task exemplify a strength that is more generally evident: a welcome awareness of clinical relevance, which is in evidence several times throughout the Results and Discussion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study's weaknesses are mostly minor and, for the most part, correctable.</p>
<p>One concern that may not be correctable in this study: the results about the spatial extent of beta activity seem constrained by relatively poor-quality data. It seems half or more of the electrodes are marked as too noisy to provide useful data in Figure 3. If this reflects the wider reality for all analyses, as mentioned, it may not be correctable for the present study. In that case, perhaps some of the experiments or analyses can be revisited or expanded for a future study, when better electrode yields are available.</p>
<p>Other concerns:</p>
<p>In some places, there is a lack of clarity in the presentation of the results. This is not serious but should be addressed to aid readers' comprehension.</p>
<p>Lastly, given the central role of beta oscillations within the study, it would be better for completeness to include even a brief exploration of sustained beta power (rather than bursts), and the modulation of sustained beta (or lack thereof) in the study's areas of concern: behavioral recovery, task performance, etc.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. First, because the different animals had subcortical recording sites in different locations, we hesitate to use subcortical activity in the classification of bursts since we were not sure we would be identifying the same burst-phenomenon (e.g. thalamo-cortical bursts vs. capsule-cortical bursts may differ). Second, we believe that having a cortical-only criteria allows the designation of local vs. global bursts to be more widely applied in preparations that only have access to cortical data (e.g. surface ECoG recordings, EEG, Utah array recordings). Thus, in this study we chose to analyze the subcortical data post-hoc (after burst detection and classification) to support our “global” vs. “local” designation of burst types</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In our study’s stroke animals, we chose to study PMv due to its role in compensating for damage to M1, thus we hesitate to make any comparisons between PMv (which was recorded in stroke animals) and M1 (recorded in healthy unimpaired animals). Furthermore, animals are doing different tasks (e.g. reaching vs. reaching and grasping) which may also influence the spatial distribution. We agree that future work should certainly investigate the spatial distribution of global vs. local beta bursts across areas of sensorimotor cortex and subcortex, and that this comparison would be best done in healthy animals with both reaching and grasping behaviors.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A major limitation of this paper is that it is a set of case studies rather than a welldesigned, well-controlled study of beta synchrony following motor cortex injury. While non-human primate neurophysiological studies are almost always limited by extremely low animal numbers, they are made up for by the fact that they can acquire significant numbers of units or channels, and in the case of normal behavior, can obtain many behavioral trials over months of individual sessions. Here, there were two NHPs used, but they had different subcortical implant locations (thalamus vs internal capsule). They had different injury outcomes, with one showing a typical recovery curve following injury while one had complications and worsening behavior before ultimately recovering. Further, there were significant differences in the ability to record at different times, with one NHP having poor recordings early in the recovery process while one had poor recordings late in the process. Due to the injury, the authors report sessions in which they were not able to record many trials (~10). Assuming that recovery after a cortical injury is an evolving process, breaking analysis into &quot;Early&quot; and &quot;Late&quot; phases reduces the interpretation of where these shifts occur relative to recovery on the task, especially given different thresholds for recovery were used between animals. Because of this, despite a careful analysis of the data and an extensive discussion, the conclusions derived are not particularly compelling. To overcome this, the authors present data from neurotypical NHPs, but with electrodes in M1 rather than PMv, doing a completely different task with no grasping component, again making accurate conclusions about the results difficult. Even with low numbers, the study would have been much stronger if there were within-animal longitudinal data prior to and after the injury on the same task, so the impact of M1 injury could be better assessed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. Below we address some of these in more detail:</p>
<p>Different subcortical implant locations: We would like to clarify that the subcortical recordings were only used to confirm that global beta bursts (as characterized by cortical recordings alone) did indeed occur on subcortical sites coincidentally with cortical site more frequently than local beta bursts. Neither the beta burst categories nor the beta bursts themselves were influenced by the subcortical recordings.</p>
<p>Different injury outcomes: There is difficulty in creating strokes that result in identical deficits across animal as we and others have noted in previous work[1.3]. As a field, we are still understanding what factors give rise to variability in recovery curves. For example, one recent study noted that biological sex is a factor in predicting differences in recovery rates[4], and another noted that baseline white matter hyperintensities is also predictive of post-stroke recovery [5]. Overall, our methodology that creates structurally-consistent lesions can still result in very different functional outcomes depending on a variety of factors. Given this state of the field, we have done our best to match the recovery curves between our two animals, especially the initial recovery curves before Monkey H’s secondary decline.</p>
<p>Differences in ability to record at different times: We note this as a strength. One concern with these studies that induce stroke at the same time as implanting electrode arrays is that it is well appreciated that single-unit neuron yield right after array implantation is low and then improves in the following weeks [6]. There is always that concern that having more units later in recovery may drive results, but in this case, since one animal showed the opposite trend we are more confident that results are not driven by increases in unit-yield. We also note that we broadly see similar unit quality metrics in the early and late stages in both animals (Fig. S7).</p>
<p>Breaking continuous recovery curve into early and late: We note that this division was only made for one main analysis in the paper (Fig. 5CD): assessment of mean firing and variance of single-unit firing rates.  Without this split our analyses would be underpowered and inconclusive, thus we would not be able to provide any comment on how firing rates change, even coarsely, with recovery.</p>
<p>Presentation of data from M1 of healthy animals doing a different task: We agree that the strongest data would be longitudinally recorded from the same animals/brain areas pre-stroke and then post-stroke. However, we also view our inclusion of separate healthy animals doing a different task as evidence that our global vs. local segregation of beta bursts generalizes beyond the reach-to-grasp task to reaching-only tasks.</p>
<p>Overall, we appreciate the reviewer pointing out these notes about our data. In some cases we do not think these notes are concerning, in others, we acknowledge that have done the best we can given the state of the neurophysiology stroke recovery field.</p>

<p>It is unclear to what extent the subpial aspiration used is a stroke model. While it is much more difficult to perform a pure ischemic motor injury using electrocoagulatory methods in animal models that do not have a lissencephalic cortex, the suction ablation method that the authors use leads to different outcomes than an ischemic injury alone. For instance, in rat models, ischemic vs suction ablation leads to very different electrophysiological profiles and differences in underlying anatomical reorganization (see Carmichael and Chesselet, 2002), even if the behavioral outcomes were similar. There is a concern that the effects shown may be an artifact of the lesion model rather than informing underlying mechanisms of recovery.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this up.</p>
<p>Clarification of our stroke model methodology: We wish to highlight that when we create stroke, we first do surface vessel occlusion as the first step. This is designed to match true ischemic injury. After a waiting period, the injured tissue is then aspiration to reduce the effects of edema and secondary mass effect in the model.</p>
<p>Carmichael and Chesselet 2002: The rodent work cited did show differential effects of a suction ablation method (without any surface vessel occlusion first) versus an ischemic method. The effects observed in this work were in the first 5 days following stroke. In our case, we started recording on day 7 and examined recovery over extended periods (weeks to months).</p>
<p>Effects of acute insult on rehabilitation: From a rehabilitation perspective, it remains unclear how the acute insult affects outcomes weeks and months later. One line of evidence to suggest that the manner that the acute insult occurs may not matter for rehabilitation is the observation that one therapeutic approach (vagus nerve stimulation) has been found to successfully improve rehabilitation outcomes in a range of injury models (intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, spinal cord injury). We agree that additional work is required in this area.</p>
<p>Human stroke data shows similar results reported: Lastly, we note that neurophysiology performed in humans with clinical strokes supports the results we seek here (e.g.[7], see discussion section for full elaboration) suggesting that our stroke model methodology is similar enough to clinical stroke to result in similar results.</p>

<p>The injury model leads to seemingly mild impairments in grasp (but not reach), with rapid and complete recovery occurring within 2-3 weeks from the time of injury. Because of the rapid recovery, relating the physiological processes of recovery to beta synchronization becomes challenging to interpret - Are the global bursts the result of the loss of M1 input to subcortical structures? Are they due to the lack of M1 targets, so there is a more distributed response? Is this due to other post-injury sub-acute mechanisms? How specific is this response - is it limited to peri-infarct areas (and to what extent is the PMv electrode truly in peri-infarct cortex), or would this synchrony be seen anywhere in the sensorimotor networks? Are the local bursts present because global synchrony wanes over time as a function of post-injury homeostatic mechanisms, or is local beta synchrony increasing as new motor plans are refined and reinforced during task re-acquisition? How coupled are they related to recovery - if it is motor plan refinement, the shift from global to local seemingly should lag the recovery?</p>

<p>We think these are all wonderful questions that could be addressed in follow-up studies!</p>

<p>While the study has significant limitations in design that reduce the impact of the results, it should act as a useful baseline/pilot data set in which to build a more complete picture of the role of subcortical-cortical beta synchrony following cortical injury.</p>

<p>We agree that this is a study that should be treated as a starting point for further investigation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Khanna et al. use a well-conceived and well-executed set of experiments and analyses primarily to document the interaction between neural oscillations in the beta range (here, 13-30 Hz) and recovery of function in an animal model of stroke. Specifically, they show that cortical &quot;beta bursts&quot;, or short-term increases in beta power, correlate strikingly with the timeline of behavioral recovery as quantified with a reach-to-grasp task. A key distinction is made between global beta bursts (here, those that synchronize between cortical and subcortical areas) and local bursts (which appear on only a few electrodes). This distinction of global vs. local is shown to be relevant to task performance and movement speed, among other quantities of interest.</p>
<p>A secondary results section explores the relationship between beta bursts and neuronal firing during the grasp portion of the behavioral task. These results are valuable to include, though mostly unsurprising, with global beta in particular associated with lower mean and variance in spike rates.</p>
<p>Last, a partial recapitulation of the primary results is offered with a neurologically intact (uninjured) animal. No major contradictions are found with the primary results.</p>
<p>Highlights of the Discussion section include a thoughtful review of atypical movements executed by individuals with Parkinson's disease or stroke survivors, placing the current results in an appropriate clinical context. Potential physiological mechanisms that could account for the observed results are also discussed effectively.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this is a very interesting paper. The ultimate impact will be enhanced by the authors' choice to analyze beta bursts, which remain a relatively under-explored aspect of neural coding.</p>
<p>The reach-and-grasp task was also a well-considered choice; the combination of a relatively simple movement (reaching towards a target in the same location each time) and a more complex movement (a skilled object-manipulation grasp) provides an internal control of sorts for data analysis. In addition, the task's two sub-movements provide a differential in terms of their likelihood to be affected by the stroke-like injury: proximal muscles (controlling reach) are likely to be less affected by stroke, while distal muscles (controlling grasp) are highly likely to be affected. Lastly, the requirement of the task to execute an object lift maximizes its difficulty and also the potential translational impact of the results on human injury.</p>
<p>The above comments about the task exemplify a strength that is more generally evident: a welcome awareness of clinical relevance, which is in evidence several times throughout the Results and Discussion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study's weaknesses are mostly minor and, for the most part, correctable.</p>
<p>One concern that may not be correctable in this study: the results about the spatial extent of beta activity seem constrained by relatively poor-quality data. It seems half or more of the electrodes are marked as too noisy to provide useful data in Figure 3. If this reflects the wider reality for all analyses, as mentioned, it may not be correctable for the present study. In that case, perhaps some of the experiments or analyses can be revisited or expanded for a future study, when better electrode yields are available.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. We note that we have chosen to be particularly conservative with which channels we considered noise-free and acceptable for analysis as our animals were not head-posted (see methods: “On each day, trials were manually inspected alongside camera data for any movement or chewing artifacts (note that animals were not head-posted) and were discarded from neural data analysis if there were any artifacts”). After re-visiting our analysis, we note that the data shown in Fig. 3 (spatial distribution of local bursts) is <bold>not</bold> representative from a data quality perspective – this data was from a session that had a particularly large number of channels discarded due to artifacts. We plan to correct this to show a more representative figure.</p>

<p>Other concerns:</p>
<p>In some places, there is a lack of clarity in the presentation of the results. This is not serious but should be addressed to aid readers' comprehension.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and for their numerous suggestions in the notes to the authors. We plan to address as many of these as we can to improve clarity and comprehension.</p>

<p>Lastly, given the central role of beta oscillations within the study, it would be better for completeness to include even a brief exploration of sustained beta power (rather than bursts), and the modulation of sustained beta (or lack thereof) in the study's areas of concern: behavioral recovery, task performance, etc.</p>
