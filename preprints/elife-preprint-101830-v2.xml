<title>Abstract</title><p>Chronic inflammation via dysregulation of T cell immune responses is critically involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Improving the balance between proinflammatory T cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) may be an attractive approach for treating atherosclerosis. Although C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) has been shown to mediate the recruitment of T cells to inflamed tissues, its role in atherosclerosis is unclear. Here, we show that genetic deletion of CCR4 in hypercholesterolemic mice accelerates the development of early atherosclerotic lesions characterized by an inflammatory plaque phenotype. This was associated with the augmentation of proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) cell responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues, para-aortic lymph nodes, and atherosclerotic aorta. Mechanistically, CCR4 deficiency in Tregs impaired their suppressive function and migration to the atherosclerotic aorta and augmented Th1 cell-mediated immune responses through defective regulation of dendritic cell function, which accelerated aortic inflammation and atherosclerotic lesion development. Thus, we revealed a previously unrecognized role for CCR4 in controlling the early stage of atherosclerosis via Treg-dependent regulation of proinflammatory T cell responses. Our data suggest that CCR4 is an important negative regulator of atherosclerosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Severe cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease and stroke, occur in patients with atherosclerosis and are major causes of mortality worldwide. Despite state-of-the-art intensive treatment, patients at high risk of atherosclerotic diseases have considerable residual risk, which could be partly related to vascular inflammatory responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Notably, recent clinical trials have provided evidence that anti-inflammatory therapies could be potentially novel approaches for preventing cardiovascular diseases in patients with the past disease history, although overall mortality has not improved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chronic aortic inflammation via T cell-mediated immune dysregulation has been shown to be critically involved in the development of atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic approaches have revealed that activated and differentiated T cells are the major immune cells infiltrating human carotid artery plaques,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> indicating the involvement of T cell-mediated immunoinflammatory responses in atherosclerotic plaque development in humans. A recent clinical trial provided evidence for the increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> confirming the critical role of effector T cell (Teff) immune responses in the development of human atherosclerotic disease. Teffs including T helper type 1 (Th1) cells play a proatherogenic role by producing proinflammatory cytokines including interferon (IFN)-Î³.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> A recent translational study demonstrated that anti-CXC-motif-chemokine receptor 3 autoantibodies, which reflect Th1 cell-mediated responses, can be a novel biomarker and an inflammatory risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality beyond traditional risk factors, indicating the possible proatherogenic role of Th1 cells in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> On the other hand, several subsets of regulatory T cells (Tregs) including forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)-expressing Tregs play an anti-atherogenic role by suppressing Teff-mediated immunoinflammatory responses or reducing plasma atherogenic lipoprotein levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> A number of approaches to dampening proatherogenic Th1 cell responses or augmenting atheroprotective Treg responses have been reported to be effective for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis in experimental mouse models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Despite accumulating evidence for the critical role of the Th1 cell/Treg balance in atherosclerosis, how the balance of these T cell populations is regulated in lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions to control atherosclerosis is unclear.</p>
<p>Various immune cells including T cells and monocytes migrate to the aorta via interactions between chemokines and their specific chemokine receptors and are critically involved in the process of atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> However, few reports have identified a chemokine system that prevents atherosclerosis by improving the Th1 cell/Treg balance in lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions. C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) is expressed on several T cell subsets, including T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, T helper type 17 (Th17) cells, skin-homing T cells, and Tregs, but not on proatherogenic Th1 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> CCR4 is a highly specific receptor for two CC chemokine ligands CCL17 (thymusâ and activation-regulated chemokine) and CCL22 (macrophage-derived chemokine)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> which were shown to be expressed in mesenteric lymph nodes (LNs) in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and lung tissues affected by allergic airway inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> These chemokines play a role in guiding CCR4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the inflammatory sites with abundant expression of these chemokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Previous experimental studies have suggested that the CCL17/CCL22âCCR4 axes protect against inflammatory autoimmune diseases partly by promoting Treg accumulation in target tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> The expression of CCL17 and CCL22 was also observed in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Although the disruption of the CCL17/CCL22âCCR4 axes did not affect the development of advanced atherosclerotic lesions or the proportion of Tregs in peripheral lymphoid tissues in atherosclerosis-prone mice fed a high-cholesterol diet,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> its effect on the early stage of atherosclerosis and Treg responses has not been investigated.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated the role of CCR4 in the development of early atherosclerotic lesions and the underlying mechanisms in CCR4-deficient (<italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup>) mice on an apolipoprotein E-deficient (<italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup>) background fed a standard chow diet, with a particular focus on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell immune responses.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>CCR4 is predominantly expressed on CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs, and the ligands CCL17 and CCL22 are expressed in peripheral LNs and atherosclerotic lesions</title>
<p>To evaluate the expression levels of CCR4 on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells under normocholesterolemic or hypercholesterolemic conditions, we performed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral LNs, spleen, and para-aortic LNs from wild-type, <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup>, and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice. Notably, CCR4 expression was expressed on approximately 15-25% of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs from wild-type or <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (Supplementary Figure 1A through 1C), while CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>â</sup> non-Tregs from these mice expressed CCR4 at markedly lower levels, suggesting that CCR4 is predominantly expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and that hypercholesterolemia does not affect CCR4 expression. We also examined CCR4 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in the atherosclerotic aorta of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, and consistently found that CCR4 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs was much higher than that in CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>â</sup> non-Tregs (Supplementary Figure 1D).</p>
<p>As CCL17 and CCL22, known as specific ligands for CCR4, are highly expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) in LNs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> we examined their expression in the peripheral LNs of wild-type, <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup>, and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice by immunohistochemistry. As expected, clear expression of these chemokines was observed in the peripheral LNs of wild-type, <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup>, and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (Supplementary Figure 2). We also examined the expression of CCL17 and CCL22 in the aorta of these mice by immunohistochemistry. CCL17 expression was detected in the atherosclerotic lesions of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, and some lesional MOMA-2<sup>+</sup> macrophages expressed this chemokine (Supplementary Figure 3A). However, CCL17 expression was not detected in the aorta of wild-type mice without atherosclerotic plaques (Supplementary Figure 3A). Another ligand CCL22 was modestly expressed in atherosclerotic lesions and partially colocalized with lesional MOMA-2<sup>+</sup> macrophages in <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> or <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, while its expression was not detected in the aorta of wild-type mice (Supplementary Figure 3B).</p>
<p>Together, these findings suggest that Tregs may migrate to peripheral LNs and atherosclerotic lesions partly via the CCL17/CCL22âCCR4 axes under hypercholesterolemia.</p>

<title>CCR4 deficiency accelerates the development of early atherosclerotic lesions characterized by an inflammatory plaque phenotype</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of CCR4 deficiency on the development of early atherosclerosis, we analyzed the atherosclerotic lesions of 18-week-old <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice fed a standard chow diet. <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice developed normally without any spontaneous inflammatory disease.

<p>To determine the effect of CCR4 deficiency on plaque components, we performed immunohistochemical studies of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic sinus. Notably, compared with those of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, the atherosclerotic lesions of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice showed a 20% increase in macrophage accumulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) and a marked 42% increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in atherosclerotic lesions using an anti-Foxp3 antibody. However, few Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs were found within the plaques of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> or <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (data not shown). The proportion of collagen in the aortic sinus plaques of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice was significantly lower than that in the aortic sinus plaques of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These findings on atherosclerotic plaque size and components collectively suggest that CCR4 plays a role in preventing the development of early atherosclerotic lesions and inducing a less inflammatory plaque phenotype. To further evaluate aortic immunoinflammatory responses, we analyzed the mRNA expression of proâ and anti-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors specific for Tregs or helper T cell subsets in atherosclerotic aorta by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (<italic>Il1b</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic>), Th1-related <italic>Tbx21</italic>, and Th17-related <italic>Rorc</italic> was markedly upregulated in the aorta of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, indicating augmented proatherogenic immune responses in the atherosclerotic aorta (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The mRNA expression of the Treg-specific transcription factor <italic>Foxp3</italic> was undetectable.</p>
<p>Collectively, these data suggest that CCR4 deficiency promotes the accumulation of inflammatory cells and proinflammatory immune responses in the aorta, leading to augmented development of early atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root.</p>

<p>Similar results were obtained for normocholesterolemic wild-type mice (data not shown), suggesting that the expansion of Tregs and effector memory T cells in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice is independent of hypercholesterolemia. We evaluated the proliferative capacity of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>â</sup> non-Tregs by analyzing Ki-67 expression using flow cytometry and found that the proportions of Ki-67-positive Tregs and non-Tregs were markedly higher in the peripheral LNs and spleen of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice than in those of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>).

<p>In contrast to the results on CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, the expression of activation marker CTLA-4 in peripheral LN CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>â</sup> non-Tregs was higher in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice than in <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, although the expression of another activation marker CD103 was not altered by CCR4 deficiency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>).

<p>Given that CCR4 plays a crucial role in attenuating immunoinflammatory responses in autoimmune or allergic disease via the modulation of Treg function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> we speculated that despite the expansion and unaltered expression of activation-or function-associated molecules in Tregs, these cells might be dysfunctional. To determine whether CCR4 deficiency affects the suppressive function of Tregs in hypercholesterolemia, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> suppression assay. Interestingly, CCR4 deficiency significantly impaired the suppressive function of Tregs isolated from hypercholesterolemic mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that CCR4 expression on Tregs may be important for the regulation of proinflammatory immune responses and the development of early atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Interaction with DCs is well-known as one of the core suppressive mechanisms by which Tregs control excessive immune responses. A previous report demonstrated that the cellâcell contacts between Tregs and CCL22-deficient DCs are impaired.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Tregs limit the CD80/CD86âCD28-dependent activation of T cells through CTLA-4-dependent downregulation of CD80 and CD86 expression on DCs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> which may contribute to the reduction in atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> Therefore, we examined the interactions between CCR4-intact or CCR4-deficient Tregs and DCs by a coculture experiment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). As expected, the upregulation of CD80 and CD86 expression on DCs mediated by conventional T cells was markedly suppressed by coculture with Tregs from <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> or <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Notably, the suppressive effect of CCR4-deficient Tregs was significantly attenuated compared with that of CCR4-intact Tregs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). To assess the involvement of CCR4 expression on Tregs in regulating the production of proatherogenic IFN-Î³ by conventional T cells, we stimulated conventional T cells with an anti-CD3 antibody and DCs in the presence or absence of CCR4-intact or CCR4-deficient Tregs and analyzed IFN-Î³ production by ELISA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). IFN-Î³ production by conventional T cells was markedly suppressed by coculture with CCR4-intact Tregs, while it was not significantly affected by coculture with CCR4-deficient Tregs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Importantly, there was a marked difference in the ability to suppress the production of IFN-Î³ from conventional T cells between CCR4-intact Tregs and CCR4-deficient Tregs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). These results suggest that the augmented Th1 cell responses in the peripheral lymphoid tissues of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice are partly due to impaired Treg-dependent regulation of DC function.</p>
<p>As described above, CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg accumulation in the atherosclerotic aorta of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice was not altered despite the marked expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in peripheral lymphoid tissues. Based on these findings and previous reports showing the impaired migratory capacity of CCR4-deficient Tregs to inflammatory tissues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> we hypothesized that CCR4-deficient Tregs might have less capacity to migrate to atherosclerotic lesions. To address this issue, we performed a Treg transfer experiment using <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> or <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice on a Kaede-Tg background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> which provided us with the opportunity to faithfully track transferred Tregs by monitoring the fluorescent Kaede protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). There was no difference in the migratory capacity of CCR4-intact or CCR4-deficient Kaede-expressing Tregs to the peripheral LNs, spleen, or para-aortic LNs of recipient <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref> through 5H). To promote the accumulation of T cells in atherosclerotic aorta, we fed recipient <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice with a high-cholesterol diet and analyzed the migration of transferred Tregs in the aorta.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found a significant reduction in the proportion of CCR4-deficient Kaede-expressing Tregs in the aorta of recipient <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>), suggesting that CCR4-deficient Tregs have a reduced ability to migrate to the atherosclerotic aorta, but not to the peripheral lymphoid tissues, under hypercholesterolemia.</p>
<p>Taken together, these data demonstrate that CCR4 expression on Tregs plays a critical role in regulating Th1 cell responses in lymphoid tissues and mediating Treg migration to the atherosclerotic aorta under hypercholesterolemia, which cooperatively contributes to the reduction in early atherosclerosis by efficiently mitigating aortic inflammatory immune responses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that genetic deletion of CCR4 in hypercholesterolemic <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice accelerates the development of early atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root which exhibit an inflammatory phenotype, associated with the augmentation of proatherogenic Th1 cell responses in the peripheral lymphoid tissues, para-aortic LNs, and atherosclerotic aorta. Furthermore, T cell-DC coculture and Treg transfer experiments revealed that CCR4 expression on Tregs regulates the development of early atherosclerosis by suppressing Th1 cell responses in lymphoid tissues and mediating Treg migration to the atherosclerotic aorta. Thus, we identified a novel role for the CCL17/CCL22âCCR4 axes in controlling early atherosclerosis via favorable modulation of the Th1 cell/Treg balance.</p>
<p>Emerging experimental and clinical data obtained by single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry have clearly shown that CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are the dominant populations in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> atherosclerotic plaques. Recent experimental and clinical evidence has demonstrated that dysregulation of the balance of proatherogenic Th1 cells and anti-atherogenic Tregs has adverse effects on atherosclerotic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> In the present study, we found that the formation of early atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root was markedly accelerated by CCR4 deficiency, which was associated with the upregulation of various helper T cell immune responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues and augmented Th1 and Th17 cell-mediated responses in the atherosclerotic aorta. Given the proatherogenic nature of Th1 cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> our data indicate that augmented Th1 cell responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues, especially in atherosclerotic lesions, substantially contributed to atherosclerotic lesion formation in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that augmented immune responses of other helper T cell subsets might also contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice.</p>
<p>As Th2 cells and some Th17 cells, but not Th1 cells, are known to express CCR4,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> the augmented Th1 cell responses observed in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice do not seem to be direct effects of CCR4 deficiency and may involve other mechanisms. Given our recent report showing the augmented immune responses related to Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells in CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg-depleted atherosclerosis-prone mice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> augmentation of these helper T cell responses may be caused by dysregulated CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg responses in our <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice. In line with experimental studies in mouse models of inflammatory diseases showing a pivotal role for CCR4 in mediating Treg migration to inflammatory tissues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> we found that CCR4 expression on Tregs is critical for regulating atherosclerosis by mediating their migration to the atherosclerotic aorta. Another interesting finding is that CCR4 deficiency markedly upregulated Th1 cell responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues as well as in atherosclerotic lesions under hypercholesterolemia. T cell-DC coculture experiments clearly demonstrated that CCR4 expression on Tregs is critical for attenuating DC-dependent stimulation of Th1 cell responses by maintaining interactions between Tregs and DCs and Treg suppressive function, which is supported by the findings of a previous report showing a crucial role of the CCL22âCCR4 axis in the contact of Tregs with DCs and regulation of inflammatory responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Based on these findings, we propose that CCR4 deficiency in Tregs interrupts their contact with DCs in lymphoid tissues and impairs their suppressive function despite their unaltered activation status, leading to augmented Th1 cell responses and accelerated atherosclerosis. We speculate that the increased frequency of Tregs in the peripheral lymphoid tissues of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice may be a compensatory effect in response to augmented Th1 cell-mediated proinflammatory responses due to dysfunctional Tregs.</p>
<p>T cell costimulatory signals such as the CD28âCD80/CD86<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and CD27âCD70<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> pathways protect against atherosclerosis by systemically shifting the Th1 cell/Treg balance toward Treg responses. Several approaches involving treatment with cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, an active form of vitamin D<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, or ultraviolet B irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> have been reported to mitigate atherosclerosis via modulation of the Th1 cell/Treg balance in the peripheral lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions of atherosclerosis-prone mice. Despite these reports, the mechanisms that regulate the T cell balance in lymphoid tissues, particularly in atherosclerotic lesions, have not been fully elucidated. The chemokine system plays an important role in the differentiation and migration of various subsets of T cells including Tregs and has been shown to be involved in the process of atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> We revealed that CCR4 protects against early atherosclerosis by mediating Treg migration to the aorta and mitigating Th1 cell responses in lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions, indicating a previously unrecognized role of the chemokine system in regulating the Th1 cell/Treg balance to limit atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>We observed the accelerated development of early atherosclerotic lesions in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice fed a standard chow diet. However, previous studies showed that neither hematopoietic nor systemic CCR4 deficiency affected the development of advanced atherosclerotic lesions or Treg frequency in severely hypercholesterolemic mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> These findings suggest that the role of CCR4 may vary depending on the stages of atherosclerosis. Given that Treg responses affected by CCR4 deficiency in mice with early atherosclerotic lesions may be different from those in mice with advanced atherosclerotic lesions, we speculate that the difference in Treg responses may be responsible for the inconsistent findings on the role of CCR4 deficiency in atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Our data show that interactions between CCR4 and CCL17/CCL22 may promote Treg-skewed responses in lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions. However, studies in hypercholesterolemic mice demonstrated that genetic deficiency of CCL17 ameliorated atherosclerotic lesion development by promoting Treg accumulation in lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions independently of the CCL17âCCR4 axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> This suggests that CCL17 restrains Treg homeostasis and accelerates atherosclerosis, although the role of the CCL17âCCR4 axis in the regulation of Treg homeostasis and atherosclerosis remains elusive. A study in mouse models of myocardial injury showed that CCL17 deficiency increased Treg recruitment to the heart and attenuated myocardial inflammation and injury, which may be attributed to the cancelation of competitive inhibition of CCL22-mediated Treg chemotaxis by CCL17,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> suggesting that CCL17 may impair Treg homeostasis via the inhibition of the CCL22âCCR4 axis. Given the crucial role of the CCL22âCCR4 axis in meditating the Treg suppressive function described above,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> we propose that the CCL22âCCR4 axis plays a dominant role in the prevention of atherosclerosis by promoting Treg function, which may be inhibited by stimulating the CCL17âCCR4 axis. However, the specific roles of the CCL17âCCR4 and CCL22âCCR4 axes in the various stages of atherosclerosis have not been fully elucidated and further studies are needed.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. Although Treg transfer experiments revealed a critical role for CCR4 in Tregs in protecting against early atherosclerosis, the use of conditional knockout mice would provide additional definitive evidence. Our data were obtained from animal experiments, and investigations using human samples will be needed to translate our findings to clinical settings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that CCR4 protects against early atherosclerosis by favorably modulating the balance between proatherogenic Th1 cell responses and atheroprotective Treg responses. We showed that CCR4 expression on Tregs is critical for suppressing Th1 cell responses and mediating Treg migration to the atherosclerotic aorta. Our data suggest that CCR4 is an important negative regulator of atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Immunofluorescence staining of CCL17 and CCL22 in lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions was performed on 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed cryosections of mouse aortic roots using rabbit anti-CCL17 (1:200; abcam) or goat anti-CCL22 (1:200; R&amp;D Systems) antibodies, followed by detection with fluorescent secondary antibodies. For costaining of macrophages in the above cryosections, anti-MOMA-2 (1:400; BMA Biomedicals) and fluorescent secondary antibodies were also used. Stained sections were digitally captured using a fluorescence microscope (BZ-X810; KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan).</p>
<p>For the detection of macrophages or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, immunohistochemistry was performed on 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed cryosections of mouse aortic roots using anti-MOMA-2 or anti-CD4 (1:100; BD Biosciences) antibodies, followed by detection with biotinylated secondary antibodies and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Staining with Massonâs trichrome (Muto Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) was used to delineate the fibrous area. Stained sections were digitally captured using a microscope (BZ-X810; KEYENCE), and the percentage of the stained area (the stained area per total atherosclerotic lesion area) was calculated as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were quantified as described previously by counting the number of positively stained cells, which was divided by the total plaque area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> The primary and secondary antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 4.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>For flow cytometric analysis of lymphoid tissues, peripheral LN cells and splenocytes were isolated and stained in PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum. For analysis of immune cells within the aorta, mice were anesthetized, and the aorta was perfused with cold saline. The aorta was dissected and the adventitial tissue was carefully removed. The aorta was digested with Liberase TM (Roche Diagnostics) in plane RPMI medium at 37[ for 45 min with vortexing. For the detection of CCR4 on aortic T cells, Collagenase D (Sigma-Aldrich) was used instead of Liberase TM. A cell suspension obtained by mashing the aorta through a 70-Î¼m strainer was stained with antibodies specific for CD3, CD4, CD45, CCR4, Foxp3, T-bet, RORÎ³t, and GATA3.</p>
<p>The Foxp3 staining buffer set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for intracellular staining of Foxp3. In all staining procedures, Fc receptors were blocked by anti-CD16/CD32 (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometric analysis was performed with FACSAria III (BD Biosciences) using FlowJo software version 10.8.1 (Tree Star). The antibodies used were listed in Supplementary Table 5. Gating strategy of flow cytometric analysis of aortic T cells was shown in Supplementary Figure 9.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Tanaka et al. investigated the role of CCR4 in early atherosclerosis, focusing on the immune modulation elicited by this chemokine receptor under hypercholesterolemia. The study found that Ccr4 deficiency led to qualitative changes in atherosclerotic plaques, characterized by an increased inflammatory phenotype. The authors further analyzed the CD4 T cell immune response in para-aortic lymph nodes and atherosclerotic aorta, showing an increase mainly in Th1 cells and the Th1/Treg ratio in Ccr4-/-Apoe-/- mice compared to Apoe-/- mice. They then focused on Tregs, demonstrating that Ccr4 deficiency impaired their immunosuppressive function in in vitro assays. Authors also states that Ccr4-deficient Tregs had, as expected, impaired migration to the atherosclerotic aorta. Adoptive cell transfer of Ccr4-/- Tregs to Apoe-/- mice mimicked early atherosclerosis development in Ccr4-/-Apoe-/- mice. Therefore, this work shows that CCR4 plays an important role in early atherosclerosis but not in advanced stages.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Several in vivo and in vitro approaches were used to address the role of CCR4 in early atherosclerosis. Particularly, through the adoptive cell transfer of CCR4+ or CCR4- Tregs, the authors aimed to directly demonstrate the role of CCR4 in Tregs' protection against early atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Flow cytometry experiments are not well controlled. Dead cells and doublets were not excluded from analysis.</p>
<p>Clinical relevance is unclear.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Tanaka and colleagues addressed the role of the C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) in early atherosclerotic plaque development using ApoE-deficient mice on a standard chow diet as a model. Because several CD4+ T cell subsets express CCR4, they examined whether CCR4-deficiency alters the immune response mediated by CD4+ T cells. By histological analysis of aortic lesions, they demonstrated that the absence of CCR4 promoted the development of early atherosclerosis, with heightened inflammation linked to increased macrophages and pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cells, along with reduced collagen content. Flow cytometry and mRNA expression analysis for identifying CD4+ T cell subsets showed that CCR4 deficiency promoted higher proliferation of pro-inflammatory effector CD4+ T cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues and accumulation of Th1 cells in the atherosclerotic lesions. Interestingly, the increased pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cell response occurred despite the expansion of T CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory cells (Tregs), found in higher numbers in lymphoid tissues of CCR4-deficient mice, suggesting that CCR4 deficiency interfered with Treg's regulatory actions. In addition, CCR4 deficiency induced an augmented Th1/Treg ratio in the aortic lesions. The CCR4-mediated mechanisms underlying the control of early inflammation and atherosclerosis development were not completely elucidated. In vitro studies suggest that CCR4 expression in Tregs plays a role in controlling DC activation and, in turn, the extent of CD4+T cell activation and proliferation. Dependence on CCR4 expression for Treg migration to the atherosclerotic aorta was not proved. The findings contrast with earlier studies in a murine model of advanced atherosclerosis, where CCR4 deficiency did not alter the development of the aortic lesions. The authors included a thoughtful discussion about hypothetical mechanisms explaining these contrasting results, including putative differences in the role played by the CCL17/CCL22-CCR4 axis along the stages of atherosclerosis development in this murine model.</p>
<p>Major strengths:</p>
<p>â¢ Demonstration of CCR4 deficiency's impact on early atherosclerosis. CCR4 deficiency effects on the early atherosclerosis development in the Apoe-/-mice model were demonstrated by a quantitative analysis of the lesion area, inflammatory cell content and the expression profile of several pro- and anti-inflammatory markers.</p>
<p>
â¢ Analysis of the T CD4+ response in various lymphoid tissues (peripheral and para-aortic lymph nodes and spleen) and the atherosclerotic aorta during the early phase of atherosclerosis in the Apoe-/-mice model. This analysis, combining flow cytometry and mRNA expression, showed that CCR4 deficiency enhanced T CD4+ cell activation, favouring the amplification of the typical biased Th1-mediated inflammatory response observed in the lymphoid tissues of hypercholesterolemic mice.</p>
<p>
â¢ Treg transference experiments. Transference of Treg from Apoe-/- or Ccr4-/- Apoe-/- mice to Apoe-/- mice under a standard chow diet was useful for addressing the relevance of CCR4 expression on Tregs for the atheroprotective effect of this regulatory T cell subset during early atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Major weaknesses:</p>
<p>â¢ The effect of CCR4 deficiency on the Th1/Th17 balance was not evaluated. Although the role of Th17 cells in atherosclerosis remains controversial, RORÎ³t+ cells constituted, on average, more than 10% of the effector TCD45+CD3+CD4+ lymphocytes in the aorta of Apoe-/- mice (Fig 4H). Changes in the Th1/Th17 balance in lymphoid tissues and aortic lesions may influence the type and functional properties of inflammatory cells recruited to the atherosclerotic aorta.</p>
<p>â¢ Lack of in vivo evidence for Treg suppressive effects on DC activation. The proposed CCR4 requirement for the Treg suppressive activity on DC activation is supported by in vitro co-culture assays, in which CCR4-deficiency partially reverted Treg regulatory actions. Higher expression of CD86, a DC activation marker, was found in spleen DCs from Ccr4-/- Apoe-/- mice compared to Apoe-/- mice (Supplementary Fig 5), which would be worth commenting on and discussing.</p>
<p>â¢ Methodological limitations. Controls in flow cytometry analysis were suboptimal (no viability and doublets were checked) which may have introduced artefacts, especially when measuring less-represented cell populations within complex samples. In addition, assessing Treg migration to the aorta in atherosclerotic mice faced methodological limitations that hindered statistical comparisons between Tregs from Apoe-/- and Ccr4-/- Apoe-/- mice, leading to inconclusive results. The dependence on CCR4 expression for Treg migration to the atherosclerotic aorta was not established.</p>
<p>â¢ Treg transference experiments did not allow the detection of a reduction in the aortic lesion area by transferred CCR4 expressing Tregs (comparison between saline and Apoe-/- Tregs groups). Using Apoe-/- mice as recipients, the CCR4-dependent protective effect of Tregs was mostly evidenced by analysis of aortic inflammation, which was valuable. When using Ccr4-/- Apoe-/- mice as recipients, analysis of aortic inflammation was not mentioned.</p>
<p>Study limitations:</p>
<p>This investigation has some limitations. Current tools for single-cell characterization have revealed the phenotypic heterogeneity and dynamics of aortic leukocytes, including T cells, which are among the principal aortic leukocytes found in mouse and human atherosclerotic lesions (doi:10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312513). The flow cytometry analysis applied in this study cannot distinguish the generation of particular phenotypes within T CD4+ subsets, including putative phenotypes of no-suppressive T cells expressing low levels of Foxp3, as seems could occur in other chronic inflammatory disorders (doi: 10.1038/nm.3432; doi: 10.1172/JCI79014). Limitations due to the use of a complete CCR4 knockout mouse and putative differences in CCR4-mediated mechanisms along atherosclerosis stages and in human atherosclerosis were commented on by the authors in the discussion.</p>
<p>Global Impact:</p>
<p>This work opens the way for a deeper analysis of the contribution of CCR4 and its ligands to the activation and differentiation of T CD4+ lymphocytes during atherosclerosis development, with these lymphocytes being fundamental players in the generation of pro-atherogenic and anti-atherogenic immune responses. Differences in the mechanisms mediated by the CCL17/CCL22-CCR4 axis among early and advanced atherosclerosis highlight the complex landscape to examine and validate in human samples and the need to achieve a deep knowledge for identifying genuine and safe targets capable of promoting protective anti-atherogenic immune responses.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p><bold>Response to the Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewerâs high evaluation of our paper and helpful comments. As expected, we revealed that the CCL17/CCL22âCCR4 axes play an important role in guiding Tregs to the atherosclerotic aorta. Interestingly, we also demonstrated that these axes are critical for Treg-dependent regulation of proinflammatory T cell responses in lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic aortas, which is a previously unrecognized role for CCR4 in regulating inflammatory immune responses. However, the role of the CCL17/CCL22âCCR4 axes in regulating inflammatory immune responses and atherosclerosis has not been fully elucidated and further investigation is needed.</p>
<p><bold>Response to the reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewerâs high evaluation of our paper and helpful comments and suggestions. We isolated CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells and used them as Tregs in several experiments. As the reviewer pointed out, we realize that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cell population contains some activated effector T cells. However, in consideration of the high expression levels of the most reliable Treg marker Foxp3 in isolated CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells determined by flow cytometry, we believe that our method for separating Tregs would be acceptable.</p>
<p>Regarding the role of Th17 cells in atherosclerosis, conflicting results have been reported. Therefore, it is unclear whether augmented Th17 cell immune responses contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis in <italic>Ccr4<sup>-/-</sup>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p>As the reviewer pointed out, it is important to consider the clinical relevance of our findings. We analyzed public database to determine if Ccr4 single nucleotide polymorphisms correlate with a higher incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, no evidence supporting the clinical relevance of our findings was found.</p>
<p><bold>Response to the Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewerâs high evaluation of our paper and helpful comments and suggestions. In accordance with the reviewerâs suggestion, we described the detailed methods and carefully performed data analysis regarding flow cytometry, which would strengthen the conclusion of this study.</p>
<p>We understood the importance of reviewerâs claim that CCR4 deficiency does not shift the Th1 cell/Treg balance toward Th1 cell responses in all lymphoid tissues. CCR4 deficiency promoted the accumulation of Th1 cells but did not affect the accumulation of Tregs in the atherosclerotic aorta, which led to the shift of the Th1 cell/Treg balance toward Th1 cell responses. The frequencies of both Tregs and Th1 cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues were increased by CCR4 deficiency, while these CCR4-deficient Tregs exhibited impaired suppressive function. Given this, we speculate that CCR4 deficiency may shift the Th1 cell/Treg balance toward Th1 cell responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues. However, it is difficult to clearly show this. We revised the manuscript accordingly.</p>
<p>Although the reviewer pointed out the possibility that modulation of the Th1 cell/Th17 cell balance might be responsible for the changes in aortic inflammatory cells in <italic>Ccr4<sup>-/-</sup>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, the role of Th17 cells in atherosclerosis remain controversial. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of the involvement of the Th17 response modulation in accelerated atherosclerosis in <italic>Ccr4<sup>-/-</sup>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p>As the limitation of this study, the phenotypic heterogeneity and dynamics of aortic leukocytes could not be revealed by flow cytometric analysis. Single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic approaches would provide additional important information on various aortic cells including immune cells and vascular cells.</p>

<p>Issue (1) Ideally, CCR4 could be deleted on Foxp3+ cells and some staining on double positive Rorg+Foxp3+ done. On the other side, a whole gene expression of infiltrated Foxp3 and effector could be also helpful. More challenging, it would be important to see whether those CCR4-specific Trges could or not regulate effector infiltrating cells.</p>

<p>As the reviewer suggested, single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic approaches would be helpful to reveal the phenotypic heterogeneity and dynamics of aortic leukocytes including Tregs.

In addition, there was no significant difference in the mRNA expression of this molecule in splenic Tregs between 8-week-old <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Ccr4<sup>-/-</sup>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Based on the minor effect of CCR4 deficiency on CD103 expression in Tregs, reduced CD103 expression in <italic>Ccr4<sup>-/-</sup>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice does not seem to be an important change.</p>

<p>The upregulated CD86 expression on DCs in <italic>Ccr4<sup>-/-</sup>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice might be explained by the data on a Treg-DC coculture experiment showing the impaired cellâcell contacts between CCR4-deficient Tregs and DCs. On the other hand, the expression of another important costimulatory molecule CD80 on DCs was not altered in these mice, which is not consistent with the data on the above coculture experiment.

<p>Major Suggestions:</p>
<p>Issue (1) FoxP3 expression should be evaluated post-isolation of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells, and FoxP3- CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells should be characterized. Tregs could be more effectively isolated using FoxP3eGFP mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>After isolation of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells (the purity was &gt;95%), we examined Foxp3 expression by flow cytometry and found that most of these cells express Foxp3 (Supplementary Figure 10). Therefore, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells without Foxp3 expression, which are considered contaminated effector T cells, are minor cells and would not substantially affect the results. Nonetheless, the use of Foxp3-eGFP mice would enable us to isolate Tregs more accurately.</p>

<p>Analysis of TCD4<sup>+</sup> cell populations in different tissues:</p>
<p>Issue (1) The description of flow cytometry analysis is incomplete and requires clarification.

</disp-quote>
<p>As we thought that most of the prepared cells would be viable, we did not check their viability. Based on our previous work where various immune cells including Tregs, effector memory T cells, and helper T cell subsets were clearly detected, in this study we performed flow cytometric analysis of these immune cells without preparing negative controls stained with isotype control antibodies. The gating strategy of flow cytometric analysis of various immune cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues was reported in our previous report (J Am Heart Assoc 2024; 13: e031639). We provided the gating strategy of flow cytometric analysis of helper T cells and Tregs in the aorta in Supplementary Figure 9.</p>

<p>Issue (3) Considering my observations about the effect of CCR4 deficiency on the T CD4<sup>+</sup> differentiation profile in different tissues, I suggest comparing Th1/Treg and Th17/Treg ratios in all examined tissues. The modulation of the Th17/Th1 balance could shape inflammation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Th1 cell/Treg balance is shifted toward Th1 cell responses in the atherosclerotic aorta of <italic>Ccr4<sup>-/-</sup>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, while this balance would not be altered in the peripheral lymphoid tissues. It remains unclear whether CCR4 deficiency affects the Th17 cell/Treg ratio.

<p>Issue (4) Cell numbers of recovered Treg from para-aortic lymphoid nodes and aortic tissues might not allow Treg functional assays. Analysis by flow cytometry of biomarkers of Treg activation state would be more informative than by quantifying mRNA expression levels. In particular, TGFÎ² analysis at the mRNA level does not provide much more information about the suppressive activity of Treg, and even at the protein level, the recognition of the active form of this cytokine is required. Analysis of PD1 (for exhausted cell phenotype) and Treg apoptosis along the stages of atherosclerosis could also yield useful information.</p>

<p>Issue (5) Regarding the resultÂ´s interpretation, I recommend being precise when concluding to avoid misunderstanding. A shift in the T CD4<sup>+</sup> response in lymphoid tissues might be interpreted as a modulation of the T cell differentiation process, which strongly depends on signals derived from DCs, which were not the focus of this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are two possible mechanisms for the altered CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues, which include the modulation of their differentiation and proliferation processes. These processes are substantially regulated by DCs whose function could be favorably modulated by CCR4-expressing Tregs as described in the manuscript. Therefore, we think that the interactions between Tregs and DCs are crucial for shifting the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues, though it remains unclear which process plays a major role in regulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell polarization.</p>

<p>Issue (5) The authors showed that the presence of Treg decreased CD80 and CD86 surface levels in DCs in vitro, remarking a lower capacity of Treg derived from CCR4-deficient mice (Figure 5B).

<p>Our finding of the upregulated CD86 expression on DCs in <italic>Ccr4<sup>-/-</sup>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice could be explained by the data on a Treg-DC coculture experiment showing the impaired ability of CCR4-deficient Tregs to downregulate CD80 and CD86 expression on DCs.

<p>Assays for chemokine levels and influence on T cell activation and traffic:</p>
<p>Issue (1) Considering the findings described by DÃ¶ring et al. (reference 24 in the paper), monitoring CCL22, CCL17, and CCL3 levels in the aorta and lymph nodes along atherosclerosis development would help in understanding when and how CCL17/CCL20-CCR4 might influence T cell activation and traffic. I wonder whether these chemokines were assayed by qPCR in lymphoid nodes and aorta from CCR4-deficient and sufficient <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. The authors report that CCR8 (capable also of binding CCL17) was unaltered by CCR4 deficiency in splenic and para-aortic lymph nodes Treg from 8 and 18 weeks-old mice, respectively (Supplementary Figure 5 and 6), although a trend towards a high-level was observed for splenic Treg. It would be informative to evaluate CCR8 Treg levels along with atherosclerosis progress.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As it is considered that the mRNA expression levels of chemokines do not necessarily reflect their protein expression levels, we did not analyze the mRNA expression of <italic>Ccl17</italic> or <italic>Ccl22</italic> by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Instead of this, we evaluated the protein expression of CCL17 and CCL22 not only in the aorta but also in the peripheral lymph nodes of 18-week-old wild-type, <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, and <italic>Ccr4<sup>-/-</sup>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice by immunohistochemistry. We found no marked differences in their expression levels in peripheral lymph nodes among these mice and included the data in Supplementary Figure 2.</p>
<p>As we focused on the role of the CCL17/CCL22âCCR4 axes in atherosclerosis, we did not examine the expression of CCL3 that is not directly related to these axes. The evaluation of CCR8+ Treg proportion is beyond the scope of this study, though we are interested in the change of this population by CCR4 deficiency associated with atherosclerotic lesion development.</p>

<p>Issue (2) According to IFNÎ³ and IL-17 expressing TCD4<sup>+</sup> subclasses, Th1 and Th17 cell subset levels increase in the spleen (Figure 3B-D) and para-aortic lymphoid nodes (Figure 4E) in CCR4 absence. A comparison of the CCR4 dependence for the migration of Th17 and Th1 cell subsets to the aorta was not performed in this atherosclerosis model; this study could help to understand the mechanisms associated with the aortic inflammation development.</p>

<p>The extremely low number of Kaede-expressing Tregs migrated in the aorta of <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Ccr4<sup>-/-</sup>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice may be derived from the small number of the transferred Tregs.

We did not check the viability or doublets of Kaede-expressing Tregs because we thought that such experimental procedures would not considerably affect the results.
