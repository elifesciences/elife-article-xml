<title>Abstract</title><p>Specialized chemosensory signals elicit innate social behaviors in individuals of several vertebrate species, a process that is mediated via the accessory olfactory system (AOS). The AOS comprising the peripheral sensory vomeronasal organ has evolved elaborate molecular and cellular mechanisms to detect chemo signals. To gain insight into the cell types, developmental gene expression patterns and functional differences amongst neurons, we performed single cell transcriptomics of the mouse vomeronasal sensory epithelium. Our analysis reveals diverse cell types with gene expression patterns specific to each, which we made available as a searchable web resource accessed from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scvnoexplorer.com">www.scvnoexplorer.com</ext-link>. Pseudo-time developmental analysis indicates that neurons originating from common progenitors diverge in their gene expression during maturation with transient and persistent transcription factor expression at critical branch points. Comparative analysis across two of the major neuronal subtypes that express divergent GPCR families and the G-protein subunits Gnai2 or Gnao1, reveals significantly higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated genes within Gnao1 neurons. In addition, differences in ER content and prevalence of cubic membrane ER ultrastructure revealed by electron microscopy, indicate fundamental differences in ER function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Vomeronasal organ (VNO), part of the vertebrate accessory olfactory system, is a major pheromone sensing organ, that is thought to be specialized to evoke innate social behaviors in mammals. The rodent VNO neuroepithelium consists of two major neuronal subtypes, that are defined primarily based on the expression of two distinct families of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their associated G protein alpha subunit: vomeronasal type-I GPCRs (V1R) with G⍺i2 subunit (Gnai2) neurons or vomeronasal type-2 GPCRs (V2R) with G⍺o subunit (Gnao1) neurons. V1R and V2R expressing neurons are spatially segregated within the neuroepithelium, project to distinct locations in the accessory olfactory bulb along the anterior-posterior axis. Functional evidence suggests that V1R and V2R neurons may recognize ligands that mediate different behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chamero <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Oboti <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Trouillet <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pallé <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). However, we currently lack a comprehensive mapping of receptor-ligand interactions and how these lead to distinct behaviors. Cognate ligand binding in both Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons, is thought to signal via the phospholipase-c pathway which results in the activation of the VNO specific cation channel, Trpc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liman, Corey and Dulac, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Stowers <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zufall, 2005</xref>)</p>
<p>In the main olfactory epithelium (MOE), neurons regenerate throughout life, continuously differentiating from a stem cell population into neurons and supporting cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Neuronal differentiation is also associated with the expression of a single GPCR to the exclusion of many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hanchate <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Tan, Li and Xie, 2015</xref>), leading to the hallmark feature termed as “one neuron one receptor” (ONOR) rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Malnic <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Serizawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">2003</xref>). VNO sensory neurons (VSNs) also continuously regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barber and Raisman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wilson and Raisman, 1980</xref>) from a stem cell population, and differentiating cells take on the identity of supporting cells and mature neurons of either the Gnao1 or Gnai2 sub-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Katreddi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). While Gnai2 neurons seem to largely follow the ONOR rule in expressing one V1R gene per neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Serizawa, Miyamichi and Sakano, 2004</xref>), Gnao1 neurons seemingly deviate from this rule by co-expressing a combination of GPCRs. Thus, each Gnao1 neuron expresses a single V2R gene from the ABD family as well as a member of the C family V2R genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Martini <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2011</xref>). In addition, further molecular diversification of Gnao1 neurons occurs due to combinatorial co-expression of a family of non-classical Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes, H2-M<italic>v</italic>, that are co-expressed along with V2Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ishii, Hirota and Mombaerts, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Loconto <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2008</xref>). A few combinations of V2R and H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression have been identified, indicating that these co-expression patterns are non-random and could be functionally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Martini <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ishii, Hirota and Mombaerts, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Loconto <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">2011</xref>). However, identifying the precise combinatorial expressions of V2R-ABD, V2R-C and H2-M<italic>v</italic> has been elusive, partly due to the challenges in generating RNA or antibody reagents to identify closely homologous genes, combined with the challenges with multiplexing more than three targets.</p>
<p>Starting with a common progenitor population, how do cells of the VNO sensory epithelium diversify in their gene expression patterns that define the sensory neuron types? Recent studies using single cell transcriptomic analysis have implicated Notch signaling along with downstream transcription factors, Tfap2e, Bcl11b to play a role in specifying the fates of developing VSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Enomoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Katreddi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). As the progenitor cells differentiate to mature neurons, transcriptional reprogramming downstream to Notch signaling leads to distinct neuronal populations: Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons. While these studies identified transcription factors, it is not clear whether the two major differentiated VSN subtypes expressing Gnao1-V2Rs and Gnai2-V1Rs fundamentally differ in their cellular properties.</p>
<p>Here we applied a multilevel transcriptomics approach which bundles single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) validated by low-level spatial transcriptomics to characterize gene expression of the mouse VNO sensory epithelium. Our results identified genes specifically expressed in sensory, non-sensory cell types and the divergence of gene expression between Gnao1 - Gnai2 neurons at different maturation stages. Analysis of mature neurons provided a comprehensive picture of specific co-expression patterns of VR and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes. Surprisingly, mature Gnao1 neurons revealed a significant enrichment of endoplasmic reticulum related gene transcripts and proteins, which is indicative of a fundamental divergence in the cellular function between these cell types. Electron microscopy further revealed a hypertrophic ER ultrastructure consisting of highly sinusoidal cubic membrane morphology, more prevalent in Gnao1 neurons.</p>

<title>Single cell transcriptome of vomeronasal neuroepithelium</title>
<p>We standardized VNO neuroepithelium dissociation to obtain a single cell suspension along with optimizing cell viability. We performed single cell droplet-based capture coupled with scRNA seq, using the 10X genomics platform on four biological replicates consisting of male and female animals. Initial quality control steps were performed (see methods) to remove cells with high or low total RNA content and red blood cell contamination, resulting in the retention of 9185 cells from all samples for further analysis. Since our comparison of gene expression obtained from male versus female mice, did not reveal appreciable differences other than known sexually dimorphic genes that include Eif2s3y, Ddx3y, Uty and Kdm5d (<bold><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>, supplementary table 2</bold>), we pooled cells from both genders for further analysis.</p>
<p>To group cells based on their gene expression profiles, we performed dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering, which resulted in 18 distinct clusters (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>), with gene expression markers specific to each cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). Major markers for each cluster were identified by differential expression analysis and the cell type identity was assigned to each cluster based on known markers for each cell type. Amongst 9185 cells, we observed that 63.7 percent (5852 cells) were neuronal cell types at different developmental stages which includes progenitor cells (Cluster 5; defined by expression of Ascl1, Neurod1, Neurog1), immature neurons (Cluster12; expression of Gap43), Gnao1 neurons (Cluster 14; based on expression of Gnao1, V2Rs), and Gnai2 neurons (Cluster 7, 16; characterized by Gnai2, V1Rs expression) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). The remaining 36.3 percent cells were classified to be of non-neuronal types which include sustentacular cells (Cluster 15; defined by Cyp2a5, Ppic), cells from non-sensory epithelium (Cluster 11; defined by Ly6d, Krt5), immune cells which include macrophages (Cluster 8, 6, 10: defined by C1qa, C1qb, H2-Aa), T cells (Cluster 9; defined by Cd3d, Cd3g), neutrophils (Cluster 2; defined by s100a8, s100a9), olfactory ensheathing cells (Cluster 3; defined by Gfap, Plp1, Sox10), endothelial cells (cluster 1 and 17; defined by Gng11, Egfl7, Eng), fibroblasts (Cluster 4; defined by Igfbp4, Dcn, Lum) and solitary chemosensory cells (Cluster 18; defined by Trpm5, Gnat3) along with a cluster that we could not attribute to a specific cell type (cluster 13; Obp2a, Gnai2 and Lcn3). A complete list of top 20 differentially expressed genes associated with each cluster and proportion of cells in each cluster are provided in <bold>supplementary table 1 and 3</bold>.</p>

<p>We performed RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (RNA-ISH) on VNO sections to confirm the spatial classification of the various non-sensory cell type clusters based on some of the genes identified in our study (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Thus, we confirmed Ppic to be expressed in sustentacular cells and Ly6d in cells of non-sensory epithelium bordering the VNO lumen. Since, Cbr2 - a known marker of sustentacular cells is also expressed in non-sensory epithelium (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>), Ppic and Ly6d are better markers to distinguish them. Plp1 and Mgp, markers of olfactory ensheathing glial cells and endothelial cells/fibroblasts, respectively, were observed to be expressed in these cell types located at the periphery of the neuro-epithelium. Macrophage cell markers C1qb and H2-Aa were observed to be specifically expressed in scattered cells throughout the neuroepithelium, with H2-Aa co-expression also seen in sustentacular cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>)</bold>, confirming the presence of these cell types within the neuroepithelium.</p>

<p>Since our study identified multiple immune cell clusters, we examined these in some detail. Three clusters (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>, clusters 6, 8, 10 termed as Mac1, Mac2, Mac3 respectively) comprised of macrophage like cells based on expression of C1qa, C1qb, C1qc and MHC class II gene -H2-Aa <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>)</bold>. Further analysis indicates that cluster 10 (Mac3) expresses classical microglial markers such as Tmem119, Aif1 (Iba1), P2ry12, Cx3cr1, Trem2, along with chemokine genes - Ccl3, Ccl4 and Ccl7 and Interleukins – Il1a, Il1b (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>)</bold>, indicating an activated macrophage subset. Cluster 8 (Mac2) is similar to Mac3 in regard to expression of classical tissue resident macrophage marker - Adgre1 (F4/80), C1qa, C1qb, C1qc but lacks the expression of chemokine and Interleukin genes mentioned earlier. In comparison to Mac3 and Mac2, the Mac 1 cluster is distinguished by the lack of C1qa, C1qb, Cd68, Adgre1(F4/80), microglial markers but possesses high levels of Napsa, Lsp1, H2-Aa <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, Supplementary table 1, 4)</bold>. In summary, the identification of discrete macrophage cell types from our data, along with experimental validation of their presence using some of the expression markers, points to the possibility of tissue resident or tissue-infiltrating macrophages within the VNO neuroepithelium. These VNO macrophage types could have functional implications towards influencing processes such as neuronal differentiation or responses to tissue repair and injury.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we did not observe evidence via RNA-ISH for the T-cell markers (Cd3d, Cd3g), raising the possibility that these immune cell types may have co-purified from blood. Lastly, we were able to identify via RNA-ISH, the expression of Trpm5 <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>)</bold> and Gnat3 genes from our dataset, that mark solitary chemosensory cells expressing taste receptors and related markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ogura <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), indicating that rare cell-populations were captured, and their markers identified in our study.</p>

<title>Transient gene expression in developing neurons</title>
<p>Our next step was to perform in depth analysis of the neuronal cell types. We pooled cells from clusters representing neuronal types of different developmental stages (clusters 5, 7, 12, 14, 16) and created a new Seurat object and performed re-clustering. This resulted in 13 clusters (labelled n1-n13), which potentially represent distinct neuronal sub-populations within the broadly defined Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). Since neurogenesis is a continuous process in VNO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barber and Raisman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wilson and Raisman, 1980</xref>), these clusters also represent a snapshot of cells at different developmental states, identified by known markers: progenitor cells (Cluster n5; defined by expression of Neurod1, Neurog1), immature neurons (Cluster n6, n7; defined by Gap43) expressing Gnao1, Gnai2. Among the mature neuronal clusters, four clusters (n1-n4) correspond to Gnao1 neurons, and 6 clusters (n8-n13) correspond to Gnai2 neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>). Since immature neurons separated into two clusters expressing Gnao1 or Gnai2, these imply a possible branch point in the developmental trajectory. To confirm this, we performed pseudo time analysis on this object using Slingshot, and the progenitor neurons (cluster n5) as a start/anchor point. The trajectory of development confirms a split of immature Gap43+ neurons into Gnao1 or Gnai2 cell clusters (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). We performed differential expression analysis between Gap43+; Gnao1+ (cluster n6) and Gap43+; Gnai2+ (cluster n7) immature neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Supplementary Table 5</bold>). To identify potential transcription factors in this developmental branch point, we manually curated genes that have molecular features associated with DNA binding domains or transcription regulation based on literature (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To our surprise, we found multiple genes that are known transcription regulators but are not previously reported to be enriched in Gnao1 neurons. These include Creb5, Prrxl1, Shisa8, Lmo4 and Foxo1. Creb5, Prrxl1 are transcription factors expressed only in immature Gnao1 neurons whereas Shisa8, Lmo4 and Foxo1 expression is enriched in immature Gnao1 neurons compared to mature ones (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). Prrxl1 was reported to auto-repress its expression which explains how its expression is limited to immature Gnao1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Monteiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).These data indicate that the developmental transition of VNO neurons to Gnao1 lineage may involve the transient expression of transcription factors within immature neurons after dichotomy is established.</p>

<title>Divergent gene expression profile of mature Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons</title>
<p>Having identified differences in gene expression of immature Gap43+; Gnai2+ and Gap43+; Gnao1+ neurons, we focused on mature Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons. We performed differential gene expression analysis of mature Gnao1 (cluster 14 from <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>) and Gnai2 neurons (cluster 7, 16 from <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>) and identified 924 differentially expressed genes with at least log2 fold change of 1 and p-value&lt;10e-6. Of these, 456 genes are enriched in Gnao1 neurons and 468 genes in Gnai2 neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>)</bold>. In agreement with previous studies, we see enrichment of V2Rs, H2-M<italic>v</italic>s, B2m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ishii, Hirota and Mombaerts, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Loconto <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), Robo2 (Prince <italic>et al</italic>., 2009), Tfap2e (Lin, Jennifer M et al., 2018), Calr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dey and Matsunami, 2011</xref>) in Gnao1 neurons and V1Rs, Meis2 (Chang &amp; Parrilla, 2016) in Gnai2 neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Supplementary Table 6</bold>). Along with such known genes, our analysis revealed new differentially expressed genes in the two neuronal subtypes.</p>

<p>To confirm the differential gene expression amongst mature neurons, we performed two-color fluorescence RNA-ISH of the top candidates from <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>, using Gnao1 or Gnai2 as co-labelling markers (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>)</bold>. Among these genes, Nrp2 and Socs2 expression is restricted to Gnai2 neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>); Tppp3 and Gm36028 expression is restricted to Gnao1 neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>)</bold>. Some of the enriched genes such as Ckb in Gnai2 and Krt18 in Gnao1 neurons, were also observed to be expressed in sustentacular cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref></bold>). Furthermore, from chromogenic RNA-ISH experiments, we observed genes such as Nsg1, Rtp1, Dner, Qpct, Pcdh7 to be either restricted to or highly expressed in Gnai2 neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>) and others such as Apmap, Selenof, Hspa5, Itm2b, Agpat5 were observed to have a gradient of high to low level expression from Gnao1 to Gnai2 zones (<bold><xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>). Two genes: Sncg and Prph specifically expressed in scattered subsets of Gnao1 or Gnai2 neurons respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref></bold>) indicating selective expression in a particular neuronal subpopulation.</p>
<p>These experiments validated that several of the candidate genes identified as differentially expressed from the scRNA seq data, are highly specific and spatially localized to one of the neuronal sub-populations. A complete list of differentially expressed genes is in <bold>supplementary table 6</bold>. Taken together our data indicate that VNO neurons that start from a common progenitor, go on to transiently express genes during immature stages that could decide their cell fate and these cells exhibit markedly different gene expression profiles in the mature stage.</p>

<title>Differential ER environment in Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons</title>
<p>Given that Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons express divergent GPCR families, we asked the question whether the differentially expressed genes indicate fundamental differences in cellular or molecular processes between these two cell types. We performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the two sets of genes. Interestingly, we observed that amongst the Gnao1 neuron genes, most of the enriched terms with p value &lt;0.05, are related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) processes, which include ‘protein folding’, ‘response to ER stress’ and ‘ERAD pathway’ (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). Conversely, a gene ontology analysis of Gnai2 neuron genes did not reveal any particular enrichment of GO terms in this neuronal subset. As more than 20% of the genes associated with protein folding <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>)</bold> are enriched in Gnao1 neurons, we sought to probe the spatial transcription pattern of some of the candidates. Fluorescence RNA in-situ hybridization confirmed the selective expression of ER genes such as Creld2, Dnajc3, Pdia6 and Sdf2l1 amongst Gnao1 neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). To test whether these findings extend to the protein level, we performed immune labelling of VNO sections using antibodies specific to a collection of ER proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref></bold>). Surprisingly, several of the antibodies such as anti-Hspa5, anti-PDI, anti-Atlastin1, anti-NogoB and anti-SEKDEL detected ER protein localization selectively amongst the basal zone Gnao1 neurons, while some others such as anti-Sec61β, anti-Calnexin, anti-Grp94, anti-Reep5, anti-Climp63 detected a pattern of Gnao1 neuron enrichment, along with lower levels in Gnai2 neurons. Amongst the ER proteins tested by immune labelling, we observed that RNA level of Atlastin1 and PDI were comparable across Gnao1, Gnai2 neurons in our dataset (<bold><xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref></bold>), indicating that enrichment of ER proteins in Gnao1 neurons could also arise due to post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.</p>

<p>Many of the Gnao1 enriched ER genes and their protein products are chaperones, while others, such as Atlastin1, Reep5, NogoB and Ckap4/Climp63 are ER structural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Goyal and Blackstone, 2013</xref>). The upregulation of both types of ER proteins prompted us to examine the cells by electron microscopy. Serial sections (70 nm thick) of ∼1 mm square regions of the VNO were collected on tape and were imaged by scanning electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baena <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Since the sections contained the entire VNO, we were able to distinguish Gnai2 from Gnao1 cells by their location as they are spatially segregated into apical or basal zones respectively within the neuroepithelium (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). In Gnao1 cells, more than half of the cytoplasm contained dense smooth ER with cubic membrane morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almsherqi, Kohlwein and Deng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Almsherqi <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), also known as organized smooth ER (OSER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Snapp <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). In the remainder of the cytoplasm, there were closely apposed parallel sheets of ER membrane that were contiguous with lamellar ER surrounding the nucleus (<bold><xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). The apical/Gnai2 neuronal cell bodies are smaller than those of Gnao1 cell bodies. They also appeared to have cubic ER membranes, but these seemed denser and occupied a smaller fraction of the cytoplasmic volume (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref></bold>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Taken together, our data indicates that mature Gnao1 neurons differ substantially from Gnai2 neurons in selectively upregulating the transcription of several ER genes. Furthermore, this neuronal subset also exhibits higher levels of ER proteins, potentially due to post-transcriptional mechanisms, as well as a hypertrophic smooth ER that is arranged in the form of organized cubic membrane ultrastructure. Collectively, these observations indicate a specialized ER environment that could play a significant functional role in the Gnao1 subset of VNO neurons.</p>

<title>Co-expression of Vomeronasal receptors</title>
<p>One of the differentiating features of vomeronasal sensory neurons from the main olfactory sensory neurons is the deviation from ‘one neuron one receptor rule’, especially in mature Gnao1 neurons. V2R receptors have been classified into families-A, B, D, E and a distinct family-C that is phylogenetically closer to calcium sensing receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Young and Trask, 2007</xref>). Several studies have established a broad pattern of co-expression amongst these V2R family members, such as members of the family ABDE co-express with family-C GPCRs and components of the family-C (Vmn2r1 -also termed -C1, Vmn2r2-Vmn2r7 -termed C2) in turn co-express with each other in specific combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Martini <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes within Gnao1 neurons also exhibit non-random co-expression patterns with the V2R GPCRs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ishii, Hirota and Mombaerts, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Loconto <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">2011</xref>). To further investigate these co-expression patterns and subpopulations within Gnao1 neurons, we took a closer look at this neuronal cell type, within our scRNA seq data. From the unsupervised clustering of neuronal cell types obtained from <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> supplement A, we separated mature Gnao1 neurons (cluster n1-n4) for further analysis. These four clusters <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>)</bold> are found to be organized majorly based on the expression of family-C V2Rs and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes, especially Vmn2r1 or Vmn2r2 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B-E</xref></bold>). Of the 4 clusters, cluster n1 and cluster n4 express Vmn2r1 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref></bold>) whereas cluster n3 neurons are distinguished by the co-expression of Vmn2r2 along with other family-C members (Vmn2r3, Vmn2r4, Vmn2r5, Vmn2r6. Vmn2r7) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref></bold>). Cluster n2 is a mixture of either Vmn2r1 or Vmn2r2 expressing neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></bold>), with Vmn2r2 being similarly co-expressed along with other family-C members in those cells. We observed that among family-ABDE members, A1-A6 V2Rs are highly expressed in cluster n2, n3 which co-express Vmn2r2 whereas A8-A10, B, D, E family V2Rs are mainly expressed along with Vmn2r1 in cluster n1 neurons <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>)</bold>. These observations of family biased expression of ABDE with Vmn2r1 or Vmn2r2 agrees with the earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">2011</xref>) that have used antibody or RNA probe based approaches.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="574704v3_fig7.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Furthermore, we observed that the expression of H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes (H2-M10.1, M10.2, M10.3, M10.4, M10.5, M10.6) is largely confined to clusters n2 and n3, where they are co-expressed selectively in Vmn2r2 positive neurons and mostly absent from Vmn2r1 expressing cluster n1, n2 neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 2A</xref></bold>). These observations align with prior reports from antibody or RNA probe-based experiments, that demonstrated a sub-division amongst Gnao1 neurons based on their expression of family-C Vmn2rs and the co-expression of H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes with the Vmn2r2 subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We then asked whether at the single neuron level, we could identify trends in co-expression patterns between ABD-family V2Rs and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes, or between members of the ABD family themselves. We performed co-expression analysis to identify specific VR and H2-M<italic>v</italic> combinations by setting an expression threshold from normalized counts. The distribution of normalized expression for VRs and H2-M<italic>v</italic>s across cells was bimodal, with the first peak near zero and a second peak likely corresponding to true expression (<bold><xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1D-F</xref></bold>). We set the starting of the second peak as a threshold to call the expression of VRs or H2-M<italic>v</italic>s in a single cell. Thus, a VR or H2-M<italic>v</italic> was considered as co-expressed in a cell only if the normalized expression value surpasses the set threshold based on the distribution (<bold><xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref></bold>). The threshold was 1.25 for V2Rs (<bold><xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1E</xref></bold>) and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes (<bold><xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1F</xref></bold>). This analysis resulted in identification of multiple co-expressing V2Rs and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes per cell. The chance that a combinatorial pattern identified can be due to a doublet is dependent on the frequency of expression of that gene. Therefore, for abundantly expressed family C V2Rs, it is possible some combinatorial patterns may be from doublets. But in the case of family ABD V2Rs, the probability of a particular combination falsely identified due to a doublet more than once is very low. Hence, we assigned a threshold for combinatorial co-expression patterns that are identified in 2 or more cells to be more reliable. These combinatorial expression patterns along with their observed frequency are listed in <bold>supplementary table 7</bold>.</p>
<p>Within the expression patterns represented by a frequency of more than two cells, we observed that the family C1 V2R (Vmn2r1) is mostly expressed alone without any other family-C members <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>)</bold> as shown earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Surprisingly a few cells (31 neurons out of 1025 Gnao1 neurons) were observed to co-express Vmn2r1 along with Vmn2r7 <bold>(Supplementary table 7)</bold>, contrary to earlier reports that Vmn2r1 does not co-express with family-C2 receptors. Most of Gnao1 neurons with family C2 V2Rs (Vmn2r2-2r7) co-express multiple members amongst them, ranging from 2 to 6 V2Rs per cell <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>In the case of family-ABD V2R expression, we observed that most of the Gnao1 neurons follow ‘one ABD-V2R, one neuron’ rule, except for few that express two ABD-V2Rs <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>).</bold> Amongst cells that express more than two ABD-V2Rs, the combination of Vmn2r20 and Vmn2r22 stood out as the highest (44 cells), followed by Vmn2r39, Vmn2r43 and Vmn2r50 (10 cells, <bold>Supplementary table 7</bold>). It is worth noting that these ABD co-expressions in each cell are observed irrespective of whether that cell expresses famly-C1 or C2 V2R <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>)</bold>. Among the Gnao1 neurons (n1-n4), 229 cells did not express family-C V2Rs <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>)</bold> and 46 cells did not express ABD-V2Rs <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>)</bold> as per our threshold.</p>
<p>In the case of H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes, each cell expresses 1-4 members mostly with famlily-C2 V2Rs <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>, 7D)</bold>. Interestingly, in deviation from this, we observed a pattern whereby H2-M1, -M9 and -M11 genes that show sequence divergence from the rest of the H2-M<italic>v</italic> cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ishii, Hirota and Mombaerts, 2003</xref>), are specifically expressed in cluster n4 and restricted cells amongst cluster n3, where they co-express with Vmn2r1 GPCR, rather than family-C2 V2Rs (<bold><xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref></bold>). Overall, 56.9% of Gnao1 cells that express either C1-V2R or C2-V2R, did not express any H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>)</bold> as per our threshold, reinforcing earlier observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2008</xref>) that their functional role maybe restricted to a subset of V2R expressing neurons. Furthermore, these H2-M1, H2-M9 or H2-M11 expressing cells along with Vmn2r1, also co-express either Vmn2r81 or Vmn2r82 (V2rf) <bold>(<xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref></bold>) as identified before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ishii, Hirota and Mombaerts, 2003</xref>). Two color RNA in situ hybridization with a common probe targeting Vmn2r81 and 82 and separate probes for H2-M1, H2-M9 and H2-M11 shows that Vmn2r81/82 cells always colocalized with the selected H2-M<italic>v</italic> probes <bold>(<xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 2E</xref>)</bold>. Overall, these data validate the co-expression analysis methodology and identify novel combinatorial co-expression patterns of V2Rs and H2Mv genes.</p>
<p>We next asked the question whether the total GPCR or H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression level is regulated or capped in a single cell? In other words, when a cell expresses multiple V2Rs, does their combined expression remain similar to cells that express one V2R or H2-M<italic>v</italic> gene? To answer this question, we calculated the total family-C-V2R, ABD-V2R and H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression in a single cell that either express one member or multiple members of each family <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7K</xref>)</bold>. The results showed that when cells express more than one V2R, the total V2R expression of either family-C or family-ABD (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7J</xref>)</bold> scales up proportional to total number of expressed V2Rs of that family. This is also true in the case of multiple H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression where, total H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression is proportional to the number of H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes expression in a cell <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref>)</bold>. As a control, we see that the levels of Gnao1 does not change with number of V2Rs or H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes expressed in a cell <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7K</xref>)</bold> indicating that these measurements are form singlet cells.</p>
<p>Lastly, we performed a similar co-expression analysis for V1Rs with a threshold value of 2.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1D</xref>)</bold>. In similarity to the pattern observed for ABD-V2Rs, most Gnai2 neurons expressed a single V1R per cell with some cells co-expressing two V1Rs <bold>(<xref rid="fig7s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, Supplementary table 8)</bold>. Some of these V1R combinations have been reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lee, Kume and Holy, 2019</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The vomeronasal organ has been a model of considerable interest for molecular sensory biology, to study the diversification of sensory neurons, uniquely evolved gene families and their patterns of expression, all of which are essential to understand how specific social chemo-signals elicit innate behaviors. In this study, using single cell and low-level spatial transcriptomics, we developed a comprehensive resource identifying cell types of the VNO neuroepithelium and studied the developmental and receptor co-expression patterns within sensory neurons. We organized our dataset as an interactive web portal resource, accessible from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scvnoexplorer.com">www.scvnoexplorer.com</ext-link>, where a gene can be queried for its expression pattern and levels amongst cell clusters.</p>
<p>The identification of distinct cell clusters and the validation of marker expression through RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, revealed a heterogeneous cellular composition of the vomeronasal neuroepithelium. In particular, we identified novel and specific gene markers, such as Ppic in sustentacular cells and Ly6d in non-sensory epithelium, which would be helpful in future to genetically tag or target these cell types and to study their developmental origins. Our study also identified specific types of macrophage cells within the neuroepithelium. Given the increasing appreciation of the role of tissue resident or infiltrating macrophages in a variety of physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nobs and Kopf, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mass <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) it is tempting to speculate that macrophages could also play an important role in VNO neuronal differentiation or the regulation of inflammatory/immune responses to external insults. Future experiments, performing targeted purification, deep sequencing, and functional manipulation of VNO macrophage types could provide deeper insights on their role in VNO function and whether they share cellular identity with MOE macrophages.</p>

<title>Development of VSNs</title>
<p>VNO sensory neurons expressing Gnao1 and Gnai2 develop continuously throughout life from a single progenitor cell population located within the VNO marginal zones and differentiate to immature and mature neurons. Recent developmental studies have demonstrated that the dichotomy is established by Notch signaling followed by the transcription factor, Bcl11b expression that marks the progenitor cells to take the Gnao1 fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Enomoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Katreddi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Most Importantly, a critical period of Notch signaling determines whether the progenitors give rise to apical, basal or sustentacular cell types. After the Gnao1/Gnai2 identity is established, the transcription factor, Tfap2e, is continuously expressed starting from Gap43+, Gnao1+ neurons and persists into mature Gnao1 neurons and has been shown to be required to maintain the Gnao1 fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Katreddi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Pseudo-time analysis on our data, confirmed a developmental trajectory that starts with progenitor cells, leading to immature neurons that take on either Gnai2 or Gnao1 fate. From our scRNA seq data, a comparison of these immature neurons revealed that apart from Tfap2e, transcription factors: Creb5, Prrxl1, Lmo4, Foxo1 also express at the same time during the immature stage of Gnao1 neurons. But unlike Tfap2e, the expression of Creb5 and Prrxl1 was observed to be restricted to immature Gnao1 neurons. Although, Foxo1 and Lmo4 continue to be expressed in mature Gnao1 neurons, their RNA levels are high in immature Gnao1 neurons and reduce upon maturation. Among the transcription factors identified, Prrxl1 has been shown to involved in the development of dorsal root ganglion neurons where it has been shown to autoregulate its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Monteiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>)</p>
<p>Our observations on the tight temporal regulation of these transcription factor related genes in the developmental trajectory of Gnao1 neurons indicates that additional molecular players might be important in further specification or maintenance of this neuronal lineage. Further experiments are needed to tease out the mechanism and precise choreography by which these transcription factors collectively specify and maintain the Gnao1 cell identity as well as the gene expression patterns unique to these neurons.</p>

<title>Receptor co-expression in Gnao1 neurons</title>
<p>One of the key features distinguishing basal zone Gnao1 VNO neurons from the apical Gnai2 or MOE neurons, is the combinatorial co-expression of two or more V2R family GPCRs along with the H2-M<italic>v</italic> class-1b MHC molecules in each cell. Our analysis of receptor expression in mature VNO neurons, revealed that members of the V1R and V2R-ABD gene families largely follow the one-neuron-one receptor rule, but with multiple exceptions. Some V1Rs were found to consistently co-express in Gnai2 neurons and the major combinations observed from our analysis (such as Vmn1r85/86, <bold><xref rid="fig7s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 3A</xref></bold>), match those identified recently from a functional single cell study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lee, Kume and Holy, 2019</xref>). leading confidence to the methodology used in our co-expression analysis. Receptors of the ABD-V2R subfamilies are also mostly expressed at one receptor per neuron, with notable exceptions being the observed combinations of Vmn2r20/22 and Vmn2r39/43/50 being co-expressed per cell.</p>
<p>In our study, the analysis of family-C, family ABD-V2Rs and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes expressed per cell, confirmed the earlier reported sub-division of the basal/Gnao1 neurons into those that express either Vmn2r1 (family-C1) or Vmn2r2-Vmn2r7 (family-C2), resulting in a broad four-part division of the mature VNO neurons: those expressing a) Gnai2/V1Rs, b) Gnao1/Vmn2r1, c) Gnao1/Vmn2r2-r7 with H2-M<italic>v</italic> and d) Gnao1/Vmn2r2-r7 without H2-M<italic>v</italic>. The co-expression of ABD-V2R sub-families A1-A5 and most of the H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes with Vmn2r2/family-C2 neurons <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-E</xref>, cluster n3, n2, Supplementary table-7)</bold> as well as the preferential co-expression of A6-A9, B, D, E sub-families with Vmn2r1 along with exclusion of H2M<italic>v</italic> genes from these neurons <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>)</bold>, points to the overall non-random logic of V2R/H2Mv co-expression. It would be interesting to see how receptor de-orphanization and future functional experiments will map onto these elaborate co-expression patterns. At the same time there were notable deviations observed from these rules, namely the restricted and sparse expression of H2-M1/M9/M11 with Vmn2r1 neurons in cluster n4 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>)</bold>, where the receptors Vmn2r81/82 are also expressed selectively in these neurons.</p>
<p>Of note, the combined expression of VR/H2-M<italic>v</italic> in a cell is not capped and is proportional to number of VRs and H2-Mv genes expressed in that cell (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7K</xref></bold>). It would be interesting to see whether the levels of co-expressing transcripts also translate to protein levels in cells and their impact on functional interactions, if any, between co-expressed proteins.</p>

<title>ER environment in VNO neurons</title>
<p>When comparing gene expression amongst Gnai2/Gnao1 mature neurons, what stood out was the unexpected enrichment of gene ontology terms associated with ER functions within Gnao1 neurons <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, E</xref>)</bold>. Most of these ER-Gnao1 enriched genes from our dataset, match the ones identified from a similar comparison from a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lin et al 2022</xref>, supporting our findings. We validated several of these ER genes via RNA-ISH to be either exclusively expressed or enriched in Gnao1 neurons. Even more puzzling was our observation that this enrichment pattern extended at the protein level to many ER proteins probed by immune labelling (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold>). In some cases, both RNA and proteins were Gnao1 enriched, whereas in others, the RNA levels were comparable across Gnai2/Gnao1 neurons, but the protein levels were biased towards Gnao1 cells. The enrichment of ER genes/proteins via transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional mechanisms presents a new feature of these cell types that could be associated with their differentiation and function. High levels of several chaperones such as Creld2, Dnajc3, Pdia6, PDI, Grp78/Bip, Grp94, Calnexin in Gnao1 neurons <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>)</bold> compared to Gnai2 neurons indicates a chaperone rich ER environment in these neurons. The chaperone Calr4 has been shown to be enriched in Gnao1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dey and Matsunami, 2011</xref>). Our observations indicate that the enrichment of chaperones is a generalized feature of Gnao1 neurons that extends to several other genes/proteins of related function and localization.</p>
<p>Since it has been proposed that the V2R family is an evolutionarily recent acquisition in rodents and marsupials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Takigami <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) and sub-family members, such as sub family-C2, A1-A6 V2Rs, as well as H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes have evolved in Muridae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Young and Trask, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), it is possible that mouse Gnao1 neurons may have required to co-evolve ER protein folding mechanisms to handle multiple GPCR/H2-M<italic>v</italic> co-expression and their putative protein interactions. In addition to our observations on the generalized upregulation of ER genes in Gnao1 neurons, it may be possible that some specific ER genes are also necessary for proper folding of vomeronasal type-2 GCPRs. These data and observations assume significance given the well-recognized fact that the functional reconstitution of these GPCRs and H2-M<italic>v</italic> molecules in heterologous cells remains a persistent challenge, with some success being reported using the chaperone Calr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dey and Matsunami, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, olfactory receptors have been shown to co-opt the ER unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway via the ER proteins PERK/CHOP and transcription factor ATF5 as a mechanism for their functional expression, setting the stage for ONOR expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dalton, Lyons and Lomvardas, 2013</xref>). This has been further extended to show that differential levels of ER chaperones help in axonal guidance of olfactory sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shayya <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). While ATF5 is expressed broadly in the VNO, across Gnai2 and Gnao1 neurons, further experiments are required to evaluate whether V2Rs and Gnao1 neurons adopt similar mechanisms and how the chaperone rich ER environment observed here might impact the expression, folding of GPCRs and the function of these neurons.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in addition to the expression of ER chaperones in Gnao1 neurons, we also observed distinctly higher levels of ER structural and membrane proteins. Levels of the membrane curvature stabilizing proteins - Reep5 and NogoB/Reticulon4B, the three-way junction formation protein - Atlastin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Goyal and Blackstone, 2013</xref>), ER sheet lumen spacer protein - Climp-63/Ckap4 as well as Sec61β - a commonly used ER membrane marker were observed to be high in Gnao1 neurons <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>).</bold> Thus, it is possible that an added layer of complexity could involve modulation of the total ER content or ER structure in Gnao1 neuronal subtypes. Our electron microcopy results <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>)</bold> revealed a strikingly higher smooth ER membrane content in Gnao1 neurons compared to Gnai2 neurons. Interestingly, ER in both neuronal types adopt a cubic membrane architecture, that is more pronounced in Gnao1 neurons, packing the cell body with sinusoidal membrane. Early electron microscopy studies in rodents, identified that smooth ER content is higher in VSNs than olfactory sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ciges <italic>et al</italic>., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Breipohl <italic>et al</italic>., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Taniguchi and Mochizuki, 1982</xref>), however, these studies preceded the discovery of Gnao1-Gnai2 dichotomy. To our knowledge, Breipohl and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Breipohl <italic>et al</italic>., 1981</xref>) reported the presence of smooth ER whorls in VSNs, later termed as cubic membranes. Future studies using serial section EM would be instrumental in reconstructing the 3D architecture of VSN ER.</p>
<p>Cubic membranes, representing highly curved periodic structures, have been observed in a variety of biological contexts, however their functional significance has been harder to pin down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almsherqi, Kohlwein and Deng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Almsherqi <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). In the context of VNO, and in particular Gnao1 neurons, we speculate that the high ER content and dense packing in the form of cubic membranes, could indicate a perpetual stress like state in these neurons, necessary to address the unique folding requirements of V2R or H2-M<italic>v</italic> proteins. For instance, the maturation of these proteins and their proper folding or multimerization may require a slower transit through the ER, necessitating the sinusoidal arrangement of ER membranes. Likewise, the V2R biosynthetic processes in Gnao1 neurons may require enhanced levels of ER chaperones, which could in turn induce the ER membranes into a homeostatic response. Can V2Rs themselves trigger the upregulation of ER chaperones and the hypertrophic ER, or are these cellular characteristics established before the onset of V2R expression? From our single cell transcriptomics data, we tried to identify at what stage ER chaperones express during the developmental trajectory of VSNs. We observed that onset of Vmn2r1 expression coincides with the upregulation of ER chaperones in cluster n6 immature Gnao1 neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 A, B</xref>)</bold>. However, some Gnao1 cells show upregulated ER gene expression without Vmn2r1/Vmn2r2 expression (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref></bold>), hence further experiments are needed to dissect the mechanism and precise relationship between neuronal differentiation, GPCR expression and ER chaperones as well as ER ultrastructure.</p>

<p>Overall, our data opens a new aspect to look at Gnao1 neurons, when understanding their function: a highly specialized ER environment that is divergent from Gnai2 neurons. The ER genes and their Gnao1 biased expression we identified, could be downstream targets of specific transcription factors and as a result of neuronal differentiation, while functionally these could be required for the proper folding and co-expression of the V2R GPCRs. The developmental trajectory of VSNs into Gnai2/Gnao1 neurons via transcription factors and their differential ER environment is summarized as a model in <bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref></bold>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the comprehensive scRNA seq analysis presented in this study contributes valuable insights into the complexity of the vomeronasal neuroepithelium, offering a roadmap for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying sensory perception and neural development in this specialized sensory organ. Vomeronasal neurons may also serve as model system to study specialized ER structure-function relationship and its role in maturation of GPCR expressing neurons.</p>

<title>VNO dissociation</title>
<p>Papain dissociation buffer (PDB) was made by reconstituting single use papain vial from Worthington Biochemical Corporation with 5 mL Earle’s balanced salt solution (EBSS) (pH 7.2) and warmed to 37°C until solution appears clear by maintaining 95% CO<sub>2</sub>, 5% O<sub>2</sub> environment. VNOs were dissected from male and female animals (6 male, 10 female) and processed separately. The sensory epithelium was separated using forceps and immediately placed in EBSS equilibrated with 95% CO<sub>2,</sub> 5% O<sub>2</sub>. 60U of DNase was added to the prewarmed PDB made earlier and 3mL of it is transferred to a single well of 12-well dish. Neuroepithelial tissue from multiple animals was transferred to this well containing the final dissociation buffer and was cut into small pieces and the suspension was transferred to 14 mL tube and was incubated with gentle shaking at 37°C for 30 minutes on a thermomixer (Eppendorf) by passing 95% CO<sub>2</sub>, 5% O<sub>2</sub> on top of the liquid headspace. During this incubation, the solution was triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipette every 10 minutes and at the end the incubation. After incubation, the suspension was passed sequentially through 70µm, 35µm filters to remove tissue debris. The filtered suspension was further layered over a mix of ovomucoid inhibitor (2.5 mg/mL) and albumin (2.5 mg/mL) in EBSS and centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature to remove subcellular debris or membrane fragments. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was used for next steps after Hank’s balanced Salt solution (HBSS) wash.</p>

Using hemocytometer and trypan blue staining, cell density was estimated at 1200 cells/μl and 1100 cell/μl for male and female samples, respectively with greater than 80% cell viability. Single-cell capture, library preparation was done using a Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ GEM, Library and Gel Bead Kit v3.1 on a 10X Chromium controller (10X Genomics). The volume of suspension to be loaded was decided as per the manufacturer recommendation to ensure the target capture of 6000 cells per well. Single cell suspension from male and female samples was loaded onto two separate wells of different chips giving a total of four libraries (2 male and 2 female samples).

<title>scRNA seq data analysis</title>
<p>Reference details of all software used for data analysis are mentioned in a tabular form below. Raw reads for each sample were trimmed as per requirements specified by 10X genomics (read 1 - 28 bps and read 2 - 91 bps) using trim galore. Trimmed reads were aligned separately to reference genome mm10 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the count matrix was generated using cellranger-5.0.1 for each sample. To avoid alignment errors, read-through transcripts were removed from the reference. Male (2) and female (2) replicates were integrated by using the cellranger’s ‘aggr’ option. Before downstream analysis stringent filtering was implemented to retain high quality cells as per the following. Ambient RNA contamination was removed using soupX software with default parameters in auto mode. The adjusted count matrix from soupX consisting of 10615 cells was used as an input to Seurat for further analysis. To remove potential doublets and low gene count cells, an additional filter was applied to select cells that express 200-7000 genes resulting in dropping 683 cells. Principal component analysis (pca) was performed, and the number of dimensions required for clustering was determined as 37 based on elbow plot and Jack Straw plot. Clustering was performed using Seurat’s FindClusters function with resolution=0.3. Markers for each cluster were identified by FindAllMarkers function. Cluster identity was assigned based on known markers of each cell type. To clean up the dataset further, cells (408) expressing Hbb-bs gene were considered as RBC contamination and a cluster (215 cells) enriched with mitochondrial genes were removed from the data. This resulted in a total of 9180 cells. Two clusters of Gnai2 were merged as they had very similar expression profile. Solitary chemosensory cells and endothelial cells were manually assigned a cluster identity by selecting the cells using the CellSelector function of Seurat.</p>
<p>To investigate sexually dimorphic gene expression at cluster level, male and female cells of each cluster were compared individually using FindMarkers function of Seurat. For neuron specific analysis, neuronal cell types representing Gnao1 neurons, Gnai2 neurons, immature neurons, and progenitor cells were separated from main seurat object using subset function to create a new ‘neurons’ object. Clustering was performed again using FindClusters function with resolution=0.4 to define neuronal subtypes. This ‘neurons’ object was used for pseudotime analysis with the SlingShot tool. To identify developmental trajectory using SlingShot, progenitor cell cluster(n5) was used as the starting cluster as it expressed Neurod1, Neurog1.</p>
<p>To compare Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons (mature and immature), differential expression analysis was done using FindMarkers function of Seurat with default parameters.

<p>VNOs were dissected from animals that were trans-cardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA in PBS buffer. Dissected VNO was embedded in 2% agarose and coronal sections of 400um were obtained on a vibratome in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Sections were fixed with Karnovsky’s fixative (3% PFA + 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate) for up to 1 week. Subsequent processing steps were similar to that described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Terasaki, Brunson and Sardi, 2020</xref>). Briefly, vibratome sections were rinsed with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate then immersed in 1% osmium, 0.8 % potassium ferricyanide in the cacodylate buffer for 1 hour. This was followed by incubation in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate 1 hr, then 30 min in lead aspartate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Walton, 1979</xref>), dehydration in graded ethanol, infiltration with epon resin then embedding and polymerization at 60 °C for 2 days. Serial 70 nm thick sections were collected using a Powertome automated tape collector (RMC Boeckeler, Tucson, AZ). The tape was mounted on a silicon wafer, carbon coated and imaged with a field emission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher / FEI Verios, Hillsboro, OR). Backscatter electrons were imaged from a 5 keV / 0.8 nanoAmp beam of electrons.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study uses single-cell transcriptomics to explore the mouse vomeronasal organ and represents an advance that enhances our understanding of neural diversity within this sensory system. Findings suggest a unique endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure in Gnao1 neurons and allow for the synthesis of a developmental trajectory from stem cells to mature vomeronasal sensory neurons. <bold>Convincing</bold> methods, data, and analyses broadly support the claims, although experiments supporting the main ER-related claim require additional quantification of co-expression and statistics on labeling intensity or coverage.

<p>Devakinandan and colleagues present a manuscript analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the mouse vomeronasal organ. The main advances in this manuscript are to identify and verify the differential expression of genes that distinguish apical and basal vomeronasal neurons. The authors also identify the enriched expression of ER-related genes in Gnao1 neurons, which they verify with in situ hybridizations and immunostaining, and also explore via electron microscopy. Finally, the results of this manuscript are presented in an online R shiny app. Overall, these data are a useful resource to the community. I have a few concerns about the manuscript, which I've listed below.</p>
<p>General Concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The authors mention that they were unable to identify the cells in cluster 13. This cluster looks similar to the &quot;secretory VSN&quot; subtype described in a recent preprint from C. Ron Yu's lab (10.1101/2024.02.22.581574). The authors could try comparing or integrating their data with this dataset (or that in Katreddi et al. 2022) to see if this is a common cell type across datasets (or arises from a specific type of cell doublets). In situ hybridizations for some of the marker genes for this cluster could also highlight where in the VNO these cells reside.</p>
<p>(2) I found the UMAPs for the neurons somewhat difficult to interpret. Unlike Katreddi et al. 2022 or Hills et al. 2024, it's tricky to follow the developmental trajectories of the cells in the UMAP space. Perhaps the authors could try re-embedding the data using gene sets that don't include the receptors? It would also be interesting to see if the neuron clusters still cluster by receptor-type even when the receptors are excluded from the gene sets used for clustering. Plots relating the original clusters to the neuronal clusters, or dot plots showing marker gene expression for the neuronal clusters might both be useful. For example, right now it's difficult to interpret clusters like n8-13.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study focuses on the vomeronasal organ, the peripheral chemosensory organ of the accessory olfactory system, by employing single-cell transcriptomics. The author analyzed the mouse vomeronasal organ, identifying diverse cell types through their unique gene expression patterns. Developmental gene expression analysis revealed that two classes of sensory neurons diverge in their maturation from common progenitors, marked by specific transient and persistent transcription factors. A comparative study between major neuronal subtypes, which differ in their G-protein sensory receptor families and G-protein subunits (Gnai2 and Gnao1, respectively), highlighted a higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated genes in Gnao1 neurons. Moreover, distinct differences in ER content and ultrastructure suggest some intriguing roles of ER in Gnao1-positive vomeronasal neurons. This work is likely to provide useful data for the community and is conceptually novel with the unique role of ER in a subset of vomeronasal neurons. This reviewer has some minor concerns and some suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study identified diverse cell types based on unique gene expression patterns, using single-cell transcriptomic.</p>
<p>(2) The analysis suggests that two classes of sensory neurons diverge during maturation from common progenitors, characterized by specific transient and persistent transcription factors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Devakinandan and colleagues have undertaken a thorough characterization of the cell types of the mouse vomeronasal organ, focusing on the vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs). VSNs are known to arise from a common pool of progenitors that differentiate into two distinct populations characterized by the expression of either the G protein subunit Gnao1 or Gnai2. Using single-cell RNA sequencing followed by unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome data, the authors identified three Gnai2+ VSN subtypes and a single Gnao1+ VSN type. To study VSN developmental trajectories, Devakinandan and colleagues took advantage of the constant renewal of the neuronal VSN pool, which allowed them to harvest all maturation states. All neurons were re-clustered and a pseudotime analysis was performed. The analysis revealed the emergence of two pools of Gap43+ clusters from a common lineage, which differentiate into many subclusters of mature Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs. By comparing the transcriptomes of these two pools of immature VSNs, the authors identified a number of differentially expressed transcription factors in addition to known markers. Next, by comparing the transcriptomes of mature Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs, the authors report the enrichment of ER-related genes in Gnao1+ VSNs. Using electron microscopy, they found that this enrichment was associated with specific ER morphology in Gnao1+ neurons. Finally, the authors characterized chemosensory receptor expression and co-expression (as well as H2-Mv proteins) in mature VSNs, which recapitulated known patterns.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>

<p>This valuable study uses single-cell transcriptomics to explore the mouse vomeronasal organ and represents an advance that enhances our understanding of neural diversity within this sensory system. Findings suggest a unique endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure in Gnao1 neurons and allow for the synthesis of a developmental trajectory from stem cells to mature vomeronasal sensory neurons. Convincing methods, data, and analyses broadly support the claims, although experiments supporting the main ER-related claim are incomplete and lack quantification of co-expression and statistics on labeling intensity or coverage. Adding these data would greatly strengthen the conclusions of the paper.</p>
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Devakinandan and colleagues present a manuscript analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the mouse vomeronasal organ. The main advances in this manuscript are to identify and verify the differential expression of genes that distinguish apical and basal vomeronasal neurons. The authors also identify the enriched expression of ER-related genes in Gnao1 neurons, which they verify with in situ hybridizations and immunostaining, and also explore via electron microscopy. Finally, the results of this manuscript are presented in an online R shiny app. Overall, these data are a useful resource to the community. I have a few concerns about the manuscript, which I've listed below.</p>
<p>General Concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The authors mention that they were unable to identify the cells in cluster 13. This cluster looks similar to the &quot;secretory VSN&quot; subtype described in a recent preprint from C. Ron Yu's lab (10.1101/2024.02.22.581574). The authors could try comparing or integrating their data with this dataset (or that in Katreddi et al. 2022) to see if this is a common cell type across datasets (or arises from a specific type of cell doublets). In situ hybridizations for some of the marker genes for this cluster could also highlight where in the VNO these cells reside.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Cluster13 (Obp2a+) cells identified in our study have similar gene expression markers to those identified with the “putative secretory” cells in Hills et al. manuscript. At the time this manuscript was available publicly, our publication was already finalized and communicated. We welcome the suggestion to integrate data, which we will attempt and address in our revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I found the UMAPs for the neurons somewhat difficult to interpret. Unlike Katreddi et al. 2022 or Hills et al. 2024, it's tricky to follow the developmental trajectories of the cells in the UMAP space. Perhaps the authors could try re-embedding the data using gene sets that don't include the receptors? It would also be interesting to see if the neuron clusters still cluster by receptor-type even when the receptors are excluded from the gene sets used for clustering. Plots relating the original clusters to the neuronal clusters, or dot plots showing marker gene expression for the neuronal clusters might both be useful. For example, right now it's difficult to interpret clusters like n8-13.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will represent the UMAPs to make the developmental trajectory clearer. How neuron clusters are affected by the presence or exclusion of receptors is an interesting question that we will address in our revision, along with showing markers of each neuronal cluster, as suggested by the reviewer.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study focuses on the vomeronasal organ, the peripheral chemosensory organ of the accessory olfactory system, by employing single-cell transcriptomics. The author analyzed the mouse vomeronasal organ, identifying diverse cell types through their unique gene expression patterns. Developmental gene expression analysis revealed that two classes of sensory neurons diverge in their maturation from common progenitors, marked by specific transient and persistent transcription factors. A comparative study between major neuronal subtypes, which differ in their G-protein sensory receptor families and G-protein subunits (Gnai2 and Gnao1, respectively), highlighted a higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated genes in Gnao1 neurons. Moreover, distinct differences in ER content and ultrastructure suggest some intriguing roles of ER in Gnao1-positive vomeronasal neurons. This work is likely to provide useful data for the community and is conceptually novel with the unique role of ER in a subset of vomeronasal neurons. This reviewer has some minor concerns and some suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study identified diverse cell types based on unique gene expression patterns, using single-cell transcriptomic.</p>
<p>(2) The analysis suggests that two classes of sensory neurons diverge during maturation from common progenitors, characterized by specific transient and persistent transcription factors.</p>
<p>(3) A comparative study highlighted differences in Gnai2- and Gnao1-positive sensory neurons.</p>
<p>(4) Higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated genes in Gnao1 neurons.</p>
<p>(5) Distinct differences in ER content and ultrastructure suggest unique roles of ER in Gnao1-positive vomeronasal neurons.</p>
<p>(6) The research provides conceptually novel on the unique role of ER in a subset of vomeronasal neurons, offering valuable insights to the community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The connection between observations from sc RNA-seq and EM is unclear.</p>
<p>(2) The lack of quantification for the ER phenotype is a concern.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to point out that the connection between scRNA-seq and EM was made in our experiments that investigated the localization of ER proteins via IHC (in Figure 5). The intriguing observation that the levels of a number of ER luminal and membrane proteins were higher in Gnao1 compared to Gnai2 neurons, led us to hypothesize a differential ER content or ultrastructure, which was verified by EM. The quantification of ER phenotype would definitely strengthen our observations, which we will add in our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Devakinandan and colleagues have undertaken a thorough characterization of the cell types of the mouse vomeronasal organ, focusing on the vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs). VSNs are known to arise from a common pool of progenitors that differentiate into two distinct populations characterized by the expression of either the G protein subunit Gnao1 or Gnai2. Using single-cell RNA sequencing followed by unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome data, the authors identified three Gnai2+ VSN subtypes and a single Gnao1+ VSN type. To study VSN developmental trajectories, Devakinandan and colleagues took advantage of the constant renewal of the neuronal VSN pool, which allowed them to harvest all maturation states. All neurons were re-clustered and a pseudotime analysis was performed. The analysis revealed the emergence of two pools of Gap43+ clusters from a common lineage, which differentiate into many subclusters of mature Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs. By comparing the transcriptomes of these two pools of immature VSNs, the authors identified a number of differentially expressed transcription factors in addition to known markers. Next, by comparing the transcriptomes of mature Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs, the authors report the enrichment of ER-related genes in Gnao1+ VSNs. Using electron microscopy, they found that this enrichment was associated with specific ER morphology in Gnao1+ neurons. Finally, the authors characterized chemosensory receptor expression and co-expression (as well as H2-Mv proteins) in mature VSNs, which recapitulated known patterns.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data presented here provide new and interesting perspectives on the distinguishing features between Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs. These features include newly identified markers, such as transcription factors, as well as an unsuspected ER-related peculiarity in Gnao1+ neurons, consisting of a hypertrophic ER and an enrichment in ER-related genes. In addition, the authors provide a comprehensive picture of specific co-expression patterns of V2R chemoreceptors and H2-Mv genes.</p>
<p>Importantly, the authors provide a browser (scVNOexplorer) for anyone to explore the data, including gene expression and co-expression, number and proportion of cells, with a variety of graphical tools (violin plots, feature plots, dot plots, ...).</p>

<p>scRNA-seq data analysis methods: We agree with the reviewer and will elaborate on the various criterion, parameters and methods in our revision. As described above, our revised manuscript will include analysis of how inclusion / exclusion of VRs affects cell clusters, as well as quantification of the ER phenotype. We will address the reviewer’s concern of over-clustering.</p>
<p>We think that the cells expressing zero as well as two V1Rs are real and cannot be attributed to debris or doublets for the following reasons:</p>
<p>a) Cells expressing no V1Rs are not necessarily debris because they express other neuronal markers at the same level as cells that express one or two V1Rs. Higher expression threshold values used in our analysis may have somewhat increased the proportion of cells with zero V1Rs. We will modify figure 7-supplement 3c to add another group showing Gnai2 level in cells expressing zero V1Rs.</p>
<p>b) Cells co-expressing V1R genes: We listed the frequency of cells co-expressing V1R gene combinations in Supplementary table - 8. Among 134 cells that express two V1Rs, 44 cells express Vmn1r85+Vmn1r86, 21 express Vmn1r184+Vmn1r185, 13 express Vmn1r56+Vmn1r57, 6 express Vmn1r168+Vmn1r177, and so on. Doublets generally are a random combination of two cells. Here, each specific co-expression combination represents multiple cells and is highly unlikely by random chance. Some of the co-expression combinations were identified earlier and verified experimentally in Lee et al., 2019 and Hills et. al. Furthermore, Figure-7 supplement 3c shows that the level of Gnai2 expression is comparable across cells expressing one or two V1Rs. If the V1R expressing cells are doublets, we expect the level of Gnai2 to be higher, as compared to cells expressing single V1R. We will elaborate on this in our revised manuscript.</p>
