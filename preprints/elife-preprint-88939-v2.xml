<title>Abstract</title><p>The defensive-offensive associations between algae and herbivores determine marine ecology. Brown algae utilize phlorotannin as their chemical defense against the predator <italic>Aplysia kurodai</italic>, which uses β-glucosidase (<italic>aku</italic>BGL) to digest the laminarin in algae to glucose. Moreover, <italic>A. kurodai</italic> employs <italic>Eisenia</italic> hydrolysis-enhancing protein (EHEP) as an offense to protect <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity from phlorotannin inhibition by precipitating phlorotannin. To underpin the molecular mechanism of this digestive-defensive-offensive system, we determined the structures of apo and tannic-acid (TNA, a phlorotannin-analog) bound form of EHEP, as well as apo <italic>aku</italic>BGL. EHEP consisted of three peritrophin-A domains formed in a triangle and bound TNA in the center without significant conformational changes. Structural comparison between EHEP and EHEP–TNA led us to find that EHEP can be resolubilized from phlorotannin-precipitation at an alkaline pH, which reflects a requirement in the digestive tract. <italic>aku</italic>BGL contained two GH1 domains, only one of which conserved the active site. Combining docking analysis, we propose the mechanisms by which phlorotannin inhibits <italic>aku</italic>BGL by occupying the substrate-binding pocket, and EHEP protects <italic>aku</italic>BGL against the inhibition by binding with phlorotannin to free the <italic>aku</italic>BGL pocket.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over millions of years of evolution, predators have successfully coevolved with their prey to maintain an ecological balance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In marine habitats, interactions between algae and marine herbivores dominate marine ecosystems. Most algae are consumed by marine herbivores <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. They produce secondary metabolites as a chemical defense to protect themselves against predators. In brown algae <italic>Eisenia bicyclis</italic>, laminarin is a major storage carbohydrate, constituting 20%–30% of algae dry weight. The sea hare <italic>Aplysia kurodai</italic>, a marine gastropod, preferentially feeds on the <italic>E. bicyclis</italic> with its 110 and 210 kDa β-glucosidases (<italic>aku</italic>BGLs), hydrolyzing the laminarin and releasing large amounts of glucose. Interestingly, such a feeding strategy has attracted attention for producing glucose as a renewable biofuel source <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. However, to protect themselves against predators, brown algae produce phlorotannin, a secondary metabolite, thereby reducing the digestion by <italic>A. kurodai</italic> by inhibiting the hydrolytic activity of <italic>aku</italic>BGLs. As the 110 kDa <italic>aku</italic>BGL is more sensitive to phlorotannin than the 210 kDa BGL <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, we focused on the 110 kDa <italic>aku</italic>BGL in this study (hereafter, <italic>aku</italic>BGL refers to 110 kDa <italic>aku</italic>BGL).</p>
<p>To counteract the antipredator adaptations of algae, herbivores use diverse approaches, such as detoxification, neutralization, defense suppression, and physiological adaptations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. <italic>A. kurodai</italic> inhibits the phlorotannin-defense of brown algae through <italic>Eisenia</italic> hydrolysis-enhancing protein (EHEP), a protein from their digestive system that protects <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity from phlorotannin inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that incubating <italic>E. bicyclis</italic> with <italic>aku</italic>BGL in the presence of EHEP results in increased glucose production because EHEP binds to phlorotannin and forms an insoluble complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The <italic>aku</italic>BGL–phlorotannin/laminarin–EHEP system exemplifies the digestion process of <italic>A. kurodai</italic> as well as the defense and antidefense strategies between <italic>E. bicyclis</italic> and <italic>A. kurodai</italic>. Although the defense/antidefense strategy has been established, the detailed molecular mechanism of this interplay remains unknown. Further, phlorotannin inhibition hinders the potential application of brown algae as feedstocks for enzymatically producing biofuel from laminarin. Thus, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms will be beneficial for the application of this system in the biofuel industry.</p>
<p>Despite the potential use of laminarin hydrolytic enzymes in the biofuel industry, only a few BGLs of glycoside hydrolases belonging to the GH3 and GH1 family are known to hydrolyze laminarin (e.g., <italic>Talaromyces amestolkiae</italic> BGL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, <italic>Ustilago esculenta</italic> BGL <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and V<italic>ibrio campbellii</italic> BGL <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> from the GH3 family and <italic>Saccharophagus degradans</italic> 2-40<sup>T</sup> BGL <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> from the GH1 family). GH3 is a multidomain enzyme family characterized by N-terminal (β/α)<sub>8</sub> (NTD) and C-terminal (β/α)<sub>6</sub> (CTD) domains, with or without auxiliary domains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>; the nucleophile aspartate and the acid/base glutamate residues exist in the NTD and CTD, respectively. In contrast, the members of the GH1 family generally share a single (β/α)<sub>8</sub>-fold domain (hereafter referred to as GH1 domain [GH1D]), and the two glutamic acid catalytic residues are located in the carboxyl termini of β-strands 4 and 7. Therefore, the two families may use different substrate-recognition and catalytic mechanisms for laminarin. Intriguingly, although <italic>aku</italic>BGL possesses laminarin hydrolytic activity and belongs to the GH1 family, its molecular weight is considerably greater than that of other GH1 members. Sequence analysis has indicated that <italic>aku</italic>BGL consists of ≥2 GH1Ds. Because no structural information of BGL active on polysaccharides is available, the catalytic mechanism toward laminarin is unclear.</p>
<p>There is limited information on EHEP, a novel cysteine-rich protein (8.2% of the amino acid content), because no structural or functional homologous protein exists in other organisms. EHEP was predicted to consist of three peritrophin-A domains (PADs) with a cysteine-spacing pattern of CX<sub>15</sub>CX<sub>5</sub>CX<sub>9</sub>CX<sub>12</sub>CX<sub>5-9</sub>C. The PADs consist of peritrophic matrix proteins, which have been proposed to play an important role in detoxifying ingested xenobiotics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. For instance, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> intestinal mucin 1 (<italic>Ae</italic>IMUC1) consists of a signal peptide followed by three PADs with an intervening mucin-like domain; its expression is induced by blood feeding. <italic>Ae</italic>IMUC1-mediated blood detoxification during digestion is completed by binding to toxic heme molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Despite the similar domain organization of EHEP and <italic>Ae</italic>IMUC1, their function and binding partner are completely different, implying their different characteristics. However, the characteristics of the EHEP-phlorotannin insoluble complex remain unknown; moreover, it remains unclear why and how EHEP protects <italic>aku</italic>BGL from phlorotannin inhibition.</p>
<p>In this study, we determined the structures of apo and tannic acid (TNA, phlorotannin-analog) bound-form of EHEP (EHEP, EHEP–TNA), as well as <italic>aku</italic>BGL; all isolated from <italic>A. kurodai</italic>. The structure of EHEP consists of three PADs arranged in a triangle shape, with TNA bound at the surface of the triangle center. A structural comparison of EHEP and EHEP–TNA revealed no significant changes in conformation upon TNA binding, implying that EHEP maintains its structure when precipitated with TNA. Then, we found the conditions to resolubilize EHEP–TNA precipitate for EHEP recycling. The obtained <italic>aku</italic>BGL structure suggests that only one GH1D (GH1D2) possesses laminarin hydrolytic activity; subsequently, ligand-docking experiments demonstrated that TNA/phlorotannin has a higher docking score than laminarin. Our results revealed the mechanisms by which EHEP protects <italic>aku</italic>BGL from phlorotannin inhibition and phlorotannin inhibits the hydrolytic activity of <italic>aku</italic>BGL, providing structural support for the potential application of brown algae for biofuel production.</p>

<title>Effects of TNA on <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity with or without EHEP</title>
<p>Phlorotannin, a type of tannin, is a chemical defense metabolite of brown algae. It is difficult to isolate a compound from phlorotannins because they are a group of polyphenolic compounds with different sizes and varying numbers of phloroglucinol units <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, such as eckol, dieckol, and so on <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Previous studies have reported that the phlorotannin-analog TNA has a comparable inhibition effect on <italic>aku</italic>BGL to that of phlorotannin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Hence, we used TNA instead of a phlorotannin to explore phlorotannin binding with EHEP and <italic>aku</italic>BGL. This activity assay system involves multiple equilibration processes: <italic>aku</italic>BGL⇋substrate, <italic>aku</italic>BGL⇋TNA, and EHEP ⇋TNA. First, we confirmed TNA inhibition of <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity and clarified the protective effects of EHEP from TNA inhibition. The inhibition experiments showed that the galactoside hydrolytic activity of <italic>aku</italic>BGL decreased with increasing TNA concentration, indicating that TNA inhibits <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Approximately 70% <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity was inhibited at a TNA concentration of 40 μM. Moreover, protection ability analysis revealed that EHEP protects <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity from TNA inhibition in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by the recovery of the inhibited <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity with increasing EHEP concentration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). Further, approximately 80% of <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity was recovered at an EHEP concentration of 3.36 μM.</p>

<title>Overall structure of EHEP</title>
<p>Considering the lack of known homologous proteins of EHEP, we determined the structure of EHEP using the native-SAD method at a resolution of 1.15 Å, with a R<sub>work</sub> and R<sub>free</sub> of 0.18 and 0.19, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The residues A21–V227 in purified EHEP (1–20 aa were cleaved during maturation) were built, whereas two C-terminal residues were disordered. The structure of EHEP consists of three PADs: PAD1 (N24– C79), PAD2 (I92–C146), and PAD3 (F164–C221), which are linked by two long loops, LL1 (Q80–N91) and LL2 (R147– G163), and arranged in a triangle shape (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These three PADs share a similar structure, with a root-mean-squared difference (RMSD) of 1.065 Å over 46 Cα atoms and only ∼20.3% sequence identity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). The three PADs share a canonical CBM14 fold consisting of two β-sheets containing three N-terminal and two C-terminal antiparallel β-strands. Additionally, two small α-helices were appended to the N- and C-terminus in PAD1 and PAD3 but not in PAD2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Although the Dali server <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> did not provide similar structures using the overall structure of EHEP as the search model, six structures showed similarities with a single PAD of EHEP. These structures were the members of the PAD family, including the chitin-binding domain of chitotriosidase (PDB ID 5HBF) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, avirulence protein 4 from <italic>Pseudocercospora fuligena</italic> [<italic>Pf</italic>Avr4 (PDB ID 4Z4A)] <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and <italic>Cladosporium fulvum</italic> [<italic>Cf</italic>Avr4 (PDBID 6BN0)] <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, allergen Der p 23 (PDB ID 4ZCE) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, tachytitin (PDB ID 1DQC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and allergen Blot 12 (PDB ID 2MFK), with Z-scores of 4.7–8.4, RMSD values of 1.2–2.8 Å, and sequence identity of 19%–37%. The highest sequence disparity was detected in PAD2, whereas the greatest structural differences were noted in PAD3. The C<sup>No1</sup>X<sub>15</sub>C<sup>No2</sup>X<sub>5</sub>C<sup>No3</sup>X<sub>9</sub>C<sup>No4</sup>X<sub>12</sub>C<sup>No5</sup>X<sub>5-9</sub>C<sup>No</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> motif (superscripts and subscripts indicate the cysteine number and number of residues between adjacent cysteines, respectively) in each PAD of EHEP formed three disulfide bonds between the following pairs: C<sup>No1</sup>–C<sup>No3</sup>, C<sup>No2</sup>–C<sup>No6</sup>, and C<sup>No4</sup>–C<sup>No5</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Such rich disulfide bonds may play a folding role in the structural formation of EHEP, with &gt;70% of the backbone in a loop conformation. A similar motif with disulfide bonds was observed in tachycitin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, <italic>Pf</italic>Avr4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, <italic>Cf</italic>Avr4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and the chitin-binding domain of chitinase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Although these proteins share a highly conserved core structure, they have different biochemical characteristics. For example, the chitin-binding domain of human chitotriosidase, Avr4 and tachycitin possess chitin-binding activity, but the critical residues for chitin-binding are not conserved <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, indicating that they employ different binding mechanisms. In contrast, EHEP and allergen Der p 23 do not possess chitin-binding activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, the PAD family may participate in several biochemical functions.</p>

<title>Modification of EHEP</title>
<p>Consistent with the molecular weight results obtained using MALDI–TOF MS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, the apo structure2 (1.4 Å resolution) clearly showed that the cleaved N-terminus of Ala21 underwent acetylation (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>), demonstrating that EHEP is acetylated in <italic>A. kurodai</italic> digestive fluid. N-terminal acetylation is a common modification in eukaryotic proteins. Such acetylation is associated with various biological functions, such as protein half-life regulation, protein secretion, protein–protein interaction, protein–lipid interaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, metabolism, and apoptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Further, N-terminal acetylation may stabilize proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. To explore whether acetylation affects the protective effects of EHEP on <italic>aku</italic>BGL, we used the <italic>E.coli</italic> expression system to obtain the unmodified recomEHEP (A21–K229). We measured the TNA-precipitating assay of recomEHEP. The results revealed that recomEHEP precipitated after incubation with TNA, at a comparable level to that of natural EHEP (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>), indicating that acetylation is not indispensable for the phlorotannin binding activity and stabilization of EHEP. Future studies are warranted to verify the exact role of N-terminal acetylation of EHEP in <italic>A.kurodai</italic>.</p>

<title>TNA binding to EHEP</title>
<p>To understand the mechanism by which TNA binds to EHEP, we determined the structure of EHEP complexed with TNA (EHEP–TNA) using the soaking method. In the obtained structure, both 2F<sub>o</sub>–F<sub>c</sub> and F<sub>o</sub>–F<sub>c</sub> maps showed the electron density of 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose, a core part of TNA missing the five external gallic acids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). Previous studies have shown that acid catalytic hydrolysis of TNA requires a high temperature of 130°C <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>; even with a polystyrene-hollow sphere catalyst, a temperature of 80°C is required <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, the five gallic acids could not be visualized in the EHEP–TNA structure most likely due to the structural flexibility of TNA.</p>

<p>The apo EHEP and EHEP–TNA structures were extremely similar, with an RMSD value of 0.283 Å for 207 Cα atoms (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). However, the superposition of the two structures showed a decrease of the loop part in EHEP–TNA. TNA binding caused a slight increase in the α-helix and β-sheet contents of PAD2 and PAD3 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). In the EHEP–TNA structure, the residues C93–Y96 of PAD2 folded into an α-helix and each β-sheet of the first β-strand in PAD3 elongated by incorporating one residue in the first (G<sup>176</sup>) and second β-sheets (S<sup>186</sup>) and three residues in the third β-sheet (H<sup>197</sup>MP<sup>199</sup>). The EHEP–TNA structure revealed that TNA binds to the center of the triangle formed by the three PADs, a positively charged surface (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>). The binding pocket on EHEP surface was formed by the C-terminal α-helix of PAD1, the N-terminal α-helix of PAD2, and the middle part (loop) of PAD3 assisted by two long linker loops (LL1 and LL2). TNA was primarily bound to EHEP via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Gallic acid1, 4, and 6 interacted with EHEP via hydrogen bonds and additional hydrophobic contacts, whereas gallic acid2 and 3 only interacted hydrophobically with EHEP. The 3-hydroxyl groups of gallic acid1 and 6 individually formed a hydrogen bond with the main chain of G74 and the side chain of N75 in PAD1. The backbone carbonyl of Y96 and P199 in PAD2 and PAD3, respectively, formed a hydrogen bond with the 3,5-hydroxyl groups of gallic acid4. Additionally, some hydrogen bonds were formed between TNA and water molecules. TNA binding was also stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the benzene rings of gallic acid and EHEP. For instance, gallic acid4 and 6 showed alkyl–π interaction with P201 and P77, respectively; moreover, gallic acid3 and 4 formed amide–π stackings with P199.</p>
<p>The EHEP–TNA structure clearly showed that TNA binds to EHEP without covalent bonds and the binding does not induce significant structural changes; thus, we attempted to recover EHEP from EHEP–TNA precipitates by adjusting the pH. As hypothesized, re-solubilization of the EHEP–phlorotannin precipitate is pH-dependent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The EHEP–TNA precipitate did not resolubilize at pH 7.0; however, after incubating for &gt;1 h at pH 7.5, the precipitate started resolubilizing. Most of the precipitate rapidly resolubilized at an alkaline pH (≥8.0) after incubation for 15 min. Further, the resolubilized EHEP had the same elution profile as that of the natural EHEP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) in SEC, suggesting that resolubilized EHEP maintained the native structure and its phlorotannin-precipitate activity (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Two domains of <italic>aku</italic>BGL</title>
<p>To reveal the structural basis of <italic>aku</italic>BGL recognition of laminarin and inhibition by TNA, we attempted to determine its structure. We soaked crystals in TNA as well as various substrate solutions but finally obtained the optimal resolution using crystal soaking in TNA. There was no electron density of TNA or something similar in the 2Fo–Fc and Fo–Fc map of the obtained structure; thus, we considered this structure as the apo form of <italic>aku</italic>BGL.</p>
<p>Two <italic>aku</italic>BGL molecules were observed in an asymmetric unit (MolA and MolB). These molecules lacked the N-terminal 25 residues (M1–D25), as confirmed using N-terminal sequencing analysis of purified natural <italic>aku</italic>BGL. This N-terminal fragment was predicted to be a signal peptide using the web server SignalP-5.0. The residues L26–P978 were constructed in both MolA and MolB with glycosylation, whereas the remaining C-terminal residues (A979–M994) could not be visualized as they were disordered. The electron density map of Fo–Fc revealed N-glycosylation at three residues, i.e., N113, N212, and N645 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs. S4A, B</xref>). N-glycosylation of GH enzymes prevents proteolysis and increases thermal stability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, a study on β-glucosidase <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic> BGL demonstrated that N-glycosylation of N224 affected the folding stability, even when it is located close to a catalytic residue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In <italic>aku</italic>BGL, all N-glycosylation sites were present on the surface, far away from the catalytic site. Therefore, we speculate that <italic>aku</italic>BGL glycosylation does not affect its activity. Except for the difference in visualized glycans resulting from glycosylation, MolA and MolB were similar, with a RMSD value of 0.182 for 899 Ca atoms; therefore, we used MolA for further descriptions and calculations.</p>
<p>The structure of <italic>aku</italic>BGL consisted of two independent GH1 domains, GH1D1 (L26–T494) and GH1D2 (D513–P978), linked by a long loop (D495–Y512) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). There was little interaction between GH1D1 and GH1D2, only in a buried surface area comprising 2% of the total surface (708.9 Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C</xref>). GH1D1 and GH1D2 have a sequence identity of 40.47% and high structural similarity with an RMSD value of 0.59 Å for 371 Cα atoms (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref> upper panel).</p>

<p>Glucosidases of the GH1 family utilize the retaining mechanism with two glutamic acids for catalyzing glucoside hydrolysis. In general, the distance between the two catalytic oxygen atoms of the side chain of two glutamic acids is approximately 5 Å <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Sequence and structure alignment of GH1D1 and GH1D2 of <italic>aku</italic>BGL with other members of the GH1 family revealed that the second glutamate is conserved (E404), but the first glutamate is replaced by D192 in GH1D1. The oxygen atoms of the side chains between D192 and E404 of GHD1 were 8.4 Å apart. In contrast, GH1D2 conserved two glutamic acids (E675 and E885) at the carboxyl termini of β-strands 4 and 7; the distance between oxygen atoms of E675 and E885 side chains was 5.1 Å (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref> bottom panel), similar to that of <italic>Neotermes koshunensis</italic> BGL (<italic>Nk</italic>BGL, PDB ID 3VIH) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, <italic>Nannochloropsis oceanica</italic> BGL (<italic>No</italic>BGL, PDB ID 5YJ7) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, and <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> BGL (PDB ID 5CG0) (3.9–4.9Å) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Furthermore, regarding the two other conserved essential regions for β-glucosidase activity, namely, glycone-binding site (GBS) and catalysis-related residues (CR), GH1D1 conserved neither GBS nor CR, whereas GH1D2 conserved both (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Altogether, we suggest that GH1D1 does not possess catalytic activity. We expressed and purified the recombinant GH1D1, which did not show any hydrolytic activity toward O-PNG (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs. S4D, E</xref>), although we could not rule out the effect of N-glycosylation.</p>
<p>Structural comparison of GH1D2 with other BGLs, including <italic>Nk</italic>BGL (PDB ID 3VIH) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, rice (<italic>Oryza sativa L.)</italic> BGL (<italic>Os</italic>BGL, PDB ID 2RGL) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, and microalgae <italic>No</italic>BGL (PDB ID 5YJ7) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, revealed the characteristics of each active pocket (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). <italic>Os</italic>BGL and <italic>No</italic>BGL have a deep, narrow, and straight pocket, whereas GH1D2 and <italic>Nk</italic>BGL have a broad and crooked pocket. Such active pocket shapes reflect the substrate preferences of <italic>Os</italic>BGL and <italic>No</italic>BGL; they hydrolyze laminaribiose with no detectable activity toward laminaritetraose <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the difference in the features of large active pockets between <italic>Nk</italic>BGL and GH1D2, wherein GH1D2 often possesses an auxiliary site with several aromatic residues bound to the carbohydrate via CH–π interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, may explain their substrate specificity. <italic>Nk</italic>BGL efficiently hydrolyzes laminaribiose and cellobiose but has weak hydrolytic activity toward laminarin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In contrast, the GH1D2 of <italic>aku</italic>BGL has similar activity levels toward cellobiose and laminarin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Therefore, the GH1D2 of <italic>aku</italic>BGL may recognize larger substrates than that of other BGLs. Laminarin typically has a curved conformation; accordingly, narrow- and straight-shaped pockets are incompatible for binding. Furthermore, we docked GH1D2 with laminaritetraose, wherein the four glucose units formed extensive contacts with GH1D2. Hydrogen bonds involved the catalytic residues E675. In addition, several aromatic residues, such as W631, F677, W681, F689, Y819, Y846, W857, and W935, formed CH–π stacking (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). Some interacting residues belonged to GBS and CR sites, such as E675, W631, Y819, and W935. Additionally, the docking structure revealed that the +3 and +4 glucose of laminaritetraose is located at the auxiliary binding site and that atom O1 of the +4 glucose is positioned outside the pocket (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>), implying that the auxiliary binding site with several aromatic residues (F677 and W681) of GH1D2 facilitates laminarin binding.</p>

<title>Inhibitor binding of <italic>aku</italic>BGL</title>
<p>As we could not obtain the complex structure of <italic>aku</italic>BGL with TNA, we performed docking calculations of <italic>aku</italic>BGL GH1D2 with TNA to explore the inhibition mechanism.

Moreover, benzene rings showed hydrophobic interactions with several hydrophobic residues. In particular, stable π–π stacking was observed between TNA and residues F547, W631, F689, Y846, W857, and W935.

<p>In addition, we performed a docking calculation of GH1D2 with the characteristic inhibitors eckol and phloroglucinol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The binding mechanisms of eckol and phloroglucinol were similar to those of TNA but with different contact residues (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). For eckol, the six hydroxyl groups formed hydrogen bonds with residues E675, D735, E737, K759, E885, and E934. Additionally, residues W631, F677, F689, Y819, W857, W935, F943, and W927 formed π–π stacking with eckol. For phloroglucinol, the three hydroxyl groups formed hydrogen bonds with E675, E885, and E934, whereas residues W631, F689, Y819, W857, W935, and W927 formed π–π stacking with the benzene ring.</p>
<p>The docking scores of the inhibitors TNA, eckol, and phloroglucinol were −8.8, −7.3, and −5.7 kcal/mol, respectively, whereas the substrate laminaritetraose had a docking score of −6.6 kcal/mol.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In marine habitats, the ecological interactions between brown algae and herbivores dominate marine ecosystems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The <italic>aku</italic>BGL–phlorotannin/laminarin–EHEP system represents the feeding defense–offense associations between <italic>A. kurodai</italic> and brown algae. We focused on this system to understand the molecular mechanism at the atomic level. In contrast to most GH1 BGLs containing one catalytic GH1 domain, <italic>aku</italic>BGL consists of noncatalytic GH1D1 and catalytic GH1D2. The noncatalytic GH1D1 may act as a chaperone of GH1D2, as we successfully overexpressed GH1D1 but failed to do the same for GH1D2. Such multi-GH1D assembly and a similar function has been suggested in β-glucosidase <italic>Cj</italic>CEL1A of <italic>Corbicula japonica</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and glycosidase <italic>LpM</italic>DGH1 of the shipworm <italic>Lyrodus pedicellatus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. <italic>Cj</italic>CEL1A has two tandem GH1Ds with a sequence identity of 43.41% <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Two catalytic glutamic acids and the residues related to substrate binding are conserved in the second GH1D, whereas the first GH1 domain lacks these conserved residues and may play a role in folding the catalytic domain. <italic>LpM</italic>DGH1 consists of six GH1Ds, among which GH1D2, 4, 5, and 6 contain the conserved residues for activity, whereas others do not contain these residues and might be involved in protein folding or substrate interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Future assay of GH1D2 and inactive mutants is the complement to validate the molecular mechanism of <italic>aku</italic>BGL.</p>
<p>BGLs have different substrate preferences in the degree of polymerization and type of glycosidic bond. In general, BGLs prefer to react with mono-oligo sugars over polysaccharides. For instance, <italic>Os</italic>BGL, <italic>No</italic>BGL, and <italic>Nk</italic>BGL hydrolyze disaccharides (cellobiose and laminaribiose) but display no or weak activity toward polysaccharides (cellulose and laminarin) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The structure of GH1D2 explained the substrate preference for the polysaccharide laminarin. GH1D2 contains an additional auxiliary site composed of aromatic residues (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>) in the substrate entrance pocket, which putatively enables it to accommodate a long substrate, contributing to <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity toward laminarin, as supported by docking calculations (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). In addition, docking analysis of <italic>aku</italic>BGL GH1D2 with inhibitors (TNA, phlorotannin, eckol, and phloroglucinol) revealed that these inhibitors bind to the substrate-binding site via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions similar to laminarin. Such binding mechanisms suggest the presence of competitive inhibition to occupy the binding site, consistent with previous research <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Future kinetic experiments are required to validate quantitatively the competitive inhibition of phlorotannin against <italic>aku</italic>BGL.</p>
<p>EHEP, expressed in the midgut of <italic>A. kurodai</italic>, was identified as an antidefense protein, protecting the hydrolysis activity of <italic>aku</italic>BGL from phlorotannin inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Such an ecological balance also exists between plants and their predatory mammals and insects. Similar to brown algae, plants use the toxic secondary metabolite tannins as their defense mechanism against predators, which constitute 5%–10% of dry weight of leaves. In vertebrate herbivores, tannins reduce protein digestion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. In phytophagous insects, tannins may be oxidized at the alkaline pH of the insect midgut and cause damage to cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. The evolution of plant–herbivore survival competition has led to the development of remarkably unique adaptation strategies. Mammals feeding on plants that contain tannin may overcome this defense by producing tannin-binding proteins, proline-rich proteins, and histatins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Proline constitutes at least 20% of the total amino acid content in proline-rich proteins; for some species, the proportion of proline reaches 40%. Histidine constitutes 25% of total amino acid content in histatins. Both proline-rich proteins and histatins are unfolding proteins with randomly coils in solution. In caterpillars, the oxidation damage of tannin is reduced by the low oxygen level. Some insects use the peritrophic membrane to transport tannins into the hemolymph, where they are excreted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Additionally, the peritrophic envelop protects insects from tannins by forming an impermeable barrier to tannins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. <italic>A. kurodai</italic> uses a similar strategy to mammals by secreting the tannin-binding protein EHEP. Although EHEP has a completely different amino acid composition with proline-rich proteins and histatins, EHEP also binds to phlorotannin. Therefore, EHEP may be a specific counteradaptation that allows <italic>A.kurodai</italic> to feed on brown algae, as there are no homologous proteins in other organisms.</p>
<p>The three PADs of EHEP are arranged in a triangle shape, forming a large cavity on the surface at the triangle center to provide a ligand-binding site. EHEP has a positively charged surface at a pH of &lt;6.0, whereas the surface becomes negatively charged at a pH of &gt;7.0 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>). Meanwhile, TNA has a pKa of 4.9–8 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, showing minor negative charges at an acidic pH and the highest negative charge at a pH of &gt;7.0 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Therefore, TNA binds to EHEP at a pH of &lt;6.0 (pH of crystallization = 4.5), but it shows charge repulsion with EHEP at a pH of &gt;8.0. Altogether, TNA is protonated and behaves as a hydrogen bond donor when the pH is below its pKa, whereas when the pH is above its pKa, TNA is deprotonated and the hydrogen bonding cannot be maintained. As losing hydrogen bonds and increasing repulsive forces at a pH &gt;8.0, the precipitated EHEP–TNA could dissolve in the buffer of pH &gt;8.0. This pH-induced reversible interaction also occurred in other proteins, such as BSA, pepsin, and cytochrome C <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. The phlorotannin members share a similar structure with TNA; thus, we speculate that the EHEP–phlorotannin complex also exhibits a pH-induced reversible interaction. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the pH of the digestive fluid of <italic>A. kurodai</italic> is approximately 5.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, which favors the binding of EHEP to phlorotannin. In the alkaline hindgut <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, the EHEP–phlorotannin disassociates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), and the phlorotannin is subsequently excreted from the anus.</p>

<p>Based on the EHEP–TNA structure and docking models of <italic>aku</italic>BGL– inhibitor/substrate, we proposed a mechanism of phlorotannin inhibition on <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity and EHEP protection from phlorotannin inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Because laminarin lacks the benzene rings essentially to form CH–π stacking interactions with EHEP, the EHEP can be considered not binding with the laminarin. In the absence of EHEP, phlorotannin occupies the substrate-binding site of <italic>aku</italic>BGL, inhibiting the substrate from entering the active site and resulting in no glucose production. In the presence of EHEP, it competitively binds to phlorotannin, freeing the <italic>aku</italic>BGL pocket. Then, the substrate can enter the active pocket of <italic>aku</italic>BGL and glucose can be produced normally. The digestive fluid of <italic>A. kurodai</italic> contains EHEP at a high concentration (&gt;4.4 µM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, which is slightly higher than the concentration of EHEP (3.36 µM) that protects <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The high concentration of EHEP allows <italic>A. kurodai</italic> feeding of phlorotannin-rich brown algae. The balance between phlorotannin inhibition and protection is controlled by the concentrations of phlorotannin and EHEP <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The <italic>aku</italic>BGL–phlorotannin/laminarin–EHEP system is the digestive–defensive– offensive associations between algae and herbivores. Our study presented the molecular mechanism of this system at the atomic level, providing a molecular explanation for how the sea hare <italic>A. kurodai</italic> utilizes EHEP to protect <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity from phlorotannin inhibition. Further, such a feeding strategy has attracted attention for producing glucose as a renewable biofuel source, so our studies provide a molecular basis for the biofuel industry applications of brown algae.</p>

<title>EHEP and <italic>aku</italic>BGL preparation</title>
<p>Natural EHEP (22.5 kDa) and <italic>aku</italic>BGL (110 kDa) were purified from <italic>A. kurodai</italic> digestive fluid as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. For crystallization, we further added one step for purification of EHEP using size exclusion chromatography (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75, GE Healthcare), for which the column was equilibrated with 20 mM MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.5). Obtained EHEP was then concentrated to 15–25 mg/mL using Vivaspin-4 10K columns (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). About <italic>aku</italic>BGL, we exchanged buffer from 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0 to 20 mM Bis-tris pH 6.0 and concentrated it to 11 mg/mL using Amicon with a cutoff of 50 kDa.</p>
<p>To verify whether the chemical modification which was indicated by previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> affects the function of EHEP, we prepared recombinant EHEP (recomEHEP) without the N-terminal signal peptide (1–20 aa) and chemical modifications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. EHEP cDNA was obtained via reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) using the total RNA of <italic>A. kurodai</italic> as a template. The reamplified fragment was digested and ligated to a plasmid derived from pET28a (Novagene, Darmstadt, Germany). We transformed the plasmid containing recomEHEP into <italic>E. coli</italic> B834(DE3) pARE2 and expressed it with a C-terminal hexahistidine-tag. The cells were cultured in lysogeny broth (LB) medium with the antibiotics kanamycin (25 mg/L) and chloramphenicol (34 mg/L) until the optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) reached 0.6. Subsequently, overexpression was induced by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl b-D-L-thiogalactopyranoside for 20 h at 20 ℃. After harvesting by centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, DNase, and lysozyme and were disrupted via sonication. The insoluble part was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 40000 ×<italic>g</italic> at 4 ℃. We loaded the supernatant onto a 5-mL Histrap HP column and the recomEHEP was eluted using increasing concentrations of imidazole (0–500 mM). The purified proteins were dialyzed against a solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 and 50 mM NaCl and subsequently loaded onto a Hitrap Q column and eluted by a linear gradient of a solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl and 1 M NaCl. Fractions containing recomEHEP were concentrated and then purified using a gel filtration column (Hiload 16/60 superdex 75 pg) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium acetate pH 6.0 and 100 mM NaCl. We collected the fractions containing recomEHEP and concentrated them to 2.1 mg/mL using Amicon (Merck, American).</p>
<p>DNA encoding <italic>aku</italic>BGL without signal peptide was codon optimized (GENEWIZ, China) for overexpress in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and cDNA encoding GH1D1 domain was subcloned to a modified pET-32a vector (Invitrogen, USA) with an N-terminal TrxA tag and a 6×His tag followed by a TEV protease recognition site. The plasmid pET-32a-GH1D1 was electorally transformed into <italic>E.coli</italic> origami2 cells. We grew the cells in LB medium supplemented with 100 µg/mL of ampicillin at 37 °C until the OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.6. Then the cultures were cooled and induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 ℃ for 16 h. After resuspending the harvested cells in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol, we disrupted the cells by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifugated at 40,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 ℃. The supernatant was filtered by 0.45 μm membrane and then loaded onto a Histrap HP column (GE, USA). After washing with lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mM imidazole, the recomGH1D1 was eluted linearly from the column with lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mM imidazole. The fractions containing recomGH1D1 were added with TEV protease at a ratio of 1:10 and dialyzed against the buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT at 4 ℃ overnight. Then, we purified the recomGH1D1 by a Histrap HP column again, and collected the flowthrough. Finally, we purified the recomGH1D1 by size exclusion chromatography on a Hiload 16/60 200 pg column (GE, USA) equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6.0). The recomGH1D1 was concentrated to 1.5 mg/mL by centrifugation using Amicon Ultra with 10 kDa. cutoff.</p>

<title>Effects of TNA on <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity with or without EHEP</title>
<p>Due to the yellow color of TNA, which affects absorbance at 420 nm of the reaction product o-nitrophenol of <italic>aku</italic>BGL, we used HPLC to measure the <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity in the reaction system involving TNA. Ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) was used as a substrate to measure <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity. The reaction system (100 μL) included 2.5 mM ONPG, 49 nM <italic>aku</italic>BGL, and different TNA concentrations in a reaction buffer (50 mM CH<sub>3</sub>COONa pH 5.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). After incubation for 10 min at 37 ℃, 100 μL of methanol was added to each sample to terminate the reaction. Then, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 15000 ×<italic>g</italic> at 4 ℃ and the supernatant was used for analyzing <italic>aku</italic>BGL activity via HPLC.

<p>A mixture of 2 mg of EHEP and 0.4 mg of eckol was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 12000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed. The sediment was dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer at different pH (7.0–9.0) and the absorbance at 560 nm was measured over time. After checking the elution peak by SDS–PAGE, the resolubilized EHEP was analyzed by a Sephacryl S-100 HR column (2.0 ×110 cm).

<title>Crystallization and data collection</title>
<p>The crystallization, data collection, and initial phase determination of EHEP were described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. As EHEP precipitates when bound to TNA, we could not cocrystallize EHEP with TNA. Therefore, we used the soaking method to obtain the EHEP–TNA complex. Owing to the poor reproducibility of EHEP crystallization, we used a co-cage-1 nucleant <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> to prepare EHEP crystals for forming the complex with TNA. Finally, we obtained high-quality EHEP crystals under the reservoir solution containing 1.0 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M imidazole (pH 6.5) with co-cage-1 nucleant. Subsequently, we soaked the EHEP crystals in a reservoir solution containing 10 mM TNA at 37 ℃ for 2 days; then, they were maintained at 20 ℃ for 2 weeks. Next, we soaked the EHEP crystals in a reservoir solution containing 10 mM phloroglucinol. For data collection, the crystal was soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol along with the reservoir solution. Diffraction data were collected under a cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K using Photon Factory BL-17 (Tsukuba, Japan) or Spring 8 BL-41XU (Hyogo, Japan).</p>
<p>For <italic>aku</italic>BGL crystallization, the initial crystallization screening was performed using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method with Screen classics and Classics II crystallization kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and PACT kits (Molecular Dimensions, Anatrace, Inc.) at 20 ℃. Crystallization drops were set up by mixing 0.5 μL of protein solution with an equal volume of the reservoir solution. The initial crystals were obtained under condition no. 41 (0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.5 and 25% polyethylene glycol [PEG] 3350) of Classics II, no. 13 (0.1 M MIB buffer [25 mM sodium malonate dibasic monohydrate, 37.5 mM imidazole, and 37.5 mM boric acid], with pH 4.0 and 25% PEG 1500), and no. 37 (0.1 M MMT buffer [20 mM DL-malic acid, 40 mM MES monohydrate, and 40 mM Tris], with pH 4.0 and 25% PEG 1500) of PACT. After optimization by varying the buffer pH and precipitant concentration and adding co-cage1 nucleant, the optimal crystals were obtained using 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.5, and 20% PEG 3350 with a co-cage1 nucleant at a protein concentration of 5.4 mg/mL. Diffraction data were collected under a cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K using Photon Factory BL-1A (Tsukuba, Japan) after cryoprotection by adding glycerol to a 20% final concentration into the reservoir solution. The optimal resolution of diffraction data was obtained by soaking a crystal with 5 mM TNA in the reservoir buffer at 37 ℃ for 4 h.</p>

<p>We determined the structure of <italic>aku</italic>BGL via the MR method using <italic>Phaser</italic> of <italic>Phenix</italic> software suite <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.

<p>Sun and co-authors have determined the crystal structures of EHEP with/without phlorotannin analog, TNA, and akuBGL. Using the akuBGL apo structure, they also constructed model structures of akuBGL with phlorotannins (inhibitor) and laminarins (substrate) by docking calculation. They clearly showed the effects of TNA on akuBGL activity with/without EHEP and resolubilization of the EHEP-phlorotannin (eckol) precipitate under alkaline conditions (pH &gt;8). Based on this knowledge, they propose the molecular mechanism of the akuBGL-phlorotannin/laminarin-EHEP system at the atomic level. Their proposed mechanism is useful for further understanding of the defensive-offensive association between algae and herbivores.</p>

<p>In this study the authors try to understand the interaction of a 110 kDa ß-glucosidase from the mollusk Aplysia kurodai, named akuBGL, with its substrate, laminarin, the main storage polysaccharide in brown algae. On the other hand, brown algae produce phlorotannin, a secondary metabolite that inhibits akuBGL. The authors study the interaction of phlorotannin with the protein EHEP, which protects akuBGL from phlorotannin by sequestering it in an insoluble complex.</p>
<p>The strongest aspect of this study is the outstanding crystallographic structures they obtained, including akuBGL (TNA soaked crystal) structure at 2.7 Å resolution, EHEP structure at 1.15 Å resolution, EHEP-TNA complex at 1.9 Å resolution, and phloroglucinol soaked EHEP structure at 1.4 Å resolution. EHEP structure is a new protein fold, constituting the major contribution of the study.</p>
<p>The drawback on EHEP structure is that protein purification, crystallization, phasing and initial model building were published somewhere else by the authors, so this structure represents incremental research.</p>
<p>One concern remains unanswered to me. If the mechanism of action of EHEP is to precipitate together with TNA in a 1:1 insoluble complex, then it does not matter if there are multiple mechanisms involved in the activity assay, the protection of 4uM EHEP against 40uM TNA simply requires a different stoichiometry.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Sun et al. reveals several crystal structures that help underpin the offensive-defensive relationship between the sea slug Aplysia kurodai and algae. These centre on TNA (a algal glycosyl hydrolase inhibitor), EHEP (a slug protein that protects against TNA and like compounds) and BGL (a glycosyl hydrolase that helps digest algae). The hypotheses generated from the crystal structures herein are supported by biochemical assays.</p>
<p>The crystal structures of apo and TNA-bound EHEP reveals the binding (and thus protection) mechanism. The authors then demonstrate that the precipitated EHEP-TNA complex can be resolubilised at an alkaline pH, potentially highlighting a mechanism for EHEP recycling in the A. kurodai midgut. The authors also present the crystal structures of akuBGL, a beta-glucosidase utilised by Aplysia kurodai to digest laminarin in algae into glucose. The structure revealed that akuBGL is composed of two GH1 domains, with only one GH1 domain having the necessary residue arrangement for catalytic activity, which was confirmed via hydrolytic activity assays. Docking was used to assess binding of the substrate laminaritetraose and the inhibitors TNA, eckol and phloroglucinol to akuBGL. The docking studies revealed that the inhibitors bound akuBGL at the glycone-binding suggesting a competitive inhibition mechanism. Overall, most of the claims made in this work are supported by the data presented.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Sun and co-authors have determined the crystal structures of EHEP with/without phlorotannin analog, TNA, and akuBGL. Using the akuBGL apo structure, they also constructed model structures of akuBGL with phlorotannins (inhibitor) and laminarins (substrate) by docking calculation. They clearly showed the effects of TNA on akuBGL activity with/without EHEP and resolubilization of the EHEP-phlorotannin (eckol) precipitate under alkaline conditions (pH &gt;8). Based on this knowledge, they propose the molecular mechanism of the akuBGL-
phlorotannin/laminarin-EHEP system at the atomic level. Their proposed mechanism is useful for further understanding of the defensive-offensive association between algae and herbivores. However, there are several concerns, especially about structural information, that authors should address.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for reviewing our manuscript. We addressed all comments below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. TNA binding to EHEP</p>
<p>The electron densities could not show the exact conformations of the five gallic acids of TNA, as the authors mentioned in the manuscript. On the other hand, the authors describe and discuss the detailed interaction between EHEP and TNA based on structural information. The above seems contradictory. In addition, the orientation of TNA, especially the core part, in Fig. 4 and PDB (8IN6) coordinates seem inconsistent. The authors should redraw Fig. 4 and revise the description accordingly to be slightly more qualitative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the mistake with the PDB file. We forgot to re-upload the final coordinate file of 8IN6, which had been modified according to the requirement of the PDB instructions. We have now re-uploaded the correct PDB file. We carefully checked Fig. 4 (Fig.3 in the revised version), which used the final coordinate file of 8IN6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Two domains of akuBGL</p>
<p>The authors concluded that only the GH1D2 domain affects its catalytic activity from a detailed structural comparison and the activity of recombinant GH1D1. That conclusion is probably reasonable. However, the recombinant GH1D2 (or GH1D1+GH1D2) and inactive mutants are essential to reliably substantiate conclusions. The authors failed to overexpress recombinant GH1D2 using the E. coli expression system. Have the authors tried GH1D1+GH1D2 expression and/or other expression systems?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>By referencing other BGLs (six samples were expressed by using E. coli, and one was expressed by using Pichia), we only tried the overexpression of akuBGL, GH1D1, GH1D2, and GH1D1+GH1D2 in E. coli expression system using several different vectors. As the reviewer mentioned that inactive mutants are essential to substantiate our conclusion reliably, it will be tried further to use yeast or cell expression systems to confirm our conclusion. We added these limitations as “Future assay of GH1D2 and inactive mutants is the complement to validate the molecular mechanism of akuBGL” in the discussion (Line 343-345)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Inhibitor binding of akuBGL</p>
<p>The authors constructed the docking structure  of GH1D2 with TNA, phloroglucinol, and eckol because they could not determine complex structures by crystallography. The molecular weight of akuBGL would also allow structure determination by cryo-EM, but have the authors tried it? In addition, the authors describe and discuss the detailed interaction between GH1D2 and TNA/phloroglucinol/eckol based on docking structures. The authors should describe the accuracy of the docking structures in more detail, or in more qualitative terms if difficult.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, it is possible to try cryo-EM for obtaining the structure of akuBGL complexed with the ligand. However, we didn’t try because 110 kDa akuBGL consists of two 55 kDa GH1Ds linked by along loop, and we worried that ligand may not be visualized using cryo-EM.</p>
<p>Following the comment, we added the description of the accuracy of the docking structures as “Those docking scores corroborated well with the inhibition activity toward akuBGL, that TNA had a more robust inhibition activity than phloroglucinol, indicating that the docking results are reasonable.” (Line 322-324)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study the authors try to understand the interaction of a 110 kDa ß-glucosidase from the mollusk Aplysia kurodai, named akuBGL, with its substrate, laminarin, the main storage polysaccharide in brown algae. On the other hand, brown algae produce phlorotannin, a secondary metabolite that inhibits akuBGL.

EHEP structure is a new protein fold, constituting the major contribution of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for reviewing our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The drawback on EHEP structure is that protein purification, crystallization, phasing and initial model building were published somewhere else by the authors, so this structure is incremental research and not new.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have published the results of protein purification, crystallization, phasing, and initial model building for determining structure but have yet to give the structure since further structural refinement is indispensable. Such published data in [Acta F] is a service for obtaining the structure.</p>
<p>We believe that the structure of the EHEP holds great importance, and it is the first time to publish.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Most of the conclusions are derived from the analysis of the crystallographic structures. Some of them are supported by other experimental data, but remain incomplete. The impossibility to obtain recombinant samples, implying that no mutants can be tested, makes it difficult to confirm some of the claims, especially about the substrate binding and the function of the two GH1Ds from akuBGL.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned by the reviewer, mutant analysis would be the best way to substantiate our conclusions. However, it is challenging to obtain recombinant samples, although we tried to overexpress them (akuBGL, GH1D1, GH1D2, and GH1D1+GH1D2). So, we did the structural comparison, and docking simulation to propose the molecular mechanism. We added these limitations as “Further assay of GH1D2 and inactive mutants is the complement to validate the molecular mechanism of akuBGL” in the discussion part (Line 343-345).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors hypothesize from their structure that the interaction of EHEP with phlorotannins might be pH dependent. Then they succeed to confirm their hypothesis, showing they can recover EHEP from precipitates at alkaline pH, and that the recovered EHEP can be reutilized.</p>
<p>A weakness in the model is raised by the fact that the stoichiometry of the complex EHEP:TNA is proposed to be 1:1, but in Figure 1 they show that 4 µM of EHEP protects akuBGL from 40 µM TNA, meaning EHEP sequesters more TNA than expected, this should be addressed in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The assay experiment in figure1 does not directly provide the stoichiometric ratio of EHEP: TNA because the activity assay system consists of substrate of akuBGL, akuBGL, TNA, and EHEP, which involves multiple equilibration processes: akuBGL⇋ substrate, akuBGL⇋TNA, and EHEP ⇋TNA. To avoid misunderstanding, we added the descriptions of ″As this activity assay system involves multiple equilibration processes: akuBGL⇋substrate, akuBGL⇋TNA, and EHEP ⇋TNA.″(Line 120-121).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors study the interaction of akuBGL with different ligands using docking. This technique is good for understanding the possible interaction between the two molecules but should not be used as evidence of binding affinity. This implies that the claims about the different binding affinities between laminarin and the inhibitors should be taken out of the preprint.</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>Solving a new protein fold, as the authors report for EHEP, is relevant to the community because it contributes to the understanding of protein folding. The study is also relevant dew to the potential biotechnological application of the system in biofuel production. The understanding on how an enzyme as akuBGL can discriminate between substrates is important for the manipulation of such enzyme in terms of improving its activity or changing its specificity. The authors also provide with preliminary data that can be used by others to produce the proteins described or to design a strategy to recover EHEP from precipitates with phlorotannin at industrial scales.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Sun et al. reveals several crystal structures that help underpin the offensivedefensive relationship between the sea slug Aplysia kurodai and algae. These centre on TNA (a algal glycosyl hydrolase inhibitor), EHEP (a slug protein that protects against TNA and like compounds) and BGL (a glycosyl hydrolase that helps digest algae). The hypotheses generated from the crystal structures herein are supported by biochemical assays.</p>
<p>The crystal structures of apo and TNA-bound EHEP reveals the binding (and thus protection) mechanism. The authors then demonstrate that the precipitated EHEP-TNA complex can be resolubilised at an alkaline pH, potentially highlighting a mechanism for EHEP recycling in the A. kurodai midgut. The authors also present the crystal structures of akuBGL, a beta-glucosidase utilised by Aplysia kurodai to digest laminarin in algae into glucose. The structure revealed that akuBGL is composed of two GH1 domains, with only one GH1 domain having the necessary residue arrangement for catalytic activity, which was confirmed via hydrolytic activity assays. Docking was used to assess binding of the substrate laminaritetraose and the inhibitors TNA, eckol and phloroglucinol to akuBGL. The docking studies revealed that the inhibitors bound akuBGL at the glycone-binding suggesting a competitive inhibition mechanism. Overall, most of the claims made in this work are supported by the data presented.</p>

<p>As mentioned by the reviewer, kinetics experiments are the best way to confirm our hypothesis derived from docking calculations.

<p>Yes, our claim would be strengthened by adding resolubilized EHEP to akuBGL assay in the presence of TNA.

It would be possible to test this mechanism through mutagenesis. If the sites where TNA packs in between chains of EHEP were mutated to prevent crosslinking, it could then be determined whether crosslink-null EHEP can still precipitate TNA.</p>
