<title>Abstract</title><p>The trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein mediates viral attachment facilitating cell entry. Most COVID-19 vaccines direct mammalian cells to express the Spike protein or deliver it directly via inoculation to engender a protective immune response. The trafficking and cellular tropism of the Spike protein <italic>in vivo</italic> and its impact on immune cells remains incompletely elucidated. In this study we inoculated mice intranasally, intravenously, and subcutaneously with fluorescently labeled recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Using flow cytometry and imaging techniques we analyzed its localization, immune cell tropism, and acute functional impact. Intranasal administration led to rapid lung alveolar macrophage uptake, pulmonary vascular leakage, and neutrophil recruitment and damage. When injected near the inguinal lymph node medullary, but not subcapsular macrophages, captured the protein, while scrotal injection recruited and fragmented neutrophils. Wide-spread endothelial and liver Kupffer cell uptake followed intravenous administration. Human peripheral blood cells B cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and myeloid dendritic cells all efficiently bound Spike protein. Exposure to the Spike protein enhanced neutrophil NETosis and augmented human macrophage TNF-α and IL-6 production. Human and murine immune cells employed C-type lectin receptors and Siglecs to help capture the Spike protein. This study highlights the potential toxicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein for mammalian cells and illustrates the central role for alveolar macrophage in pathogenic protein uptake.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2019 a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of an epidemic outbreak of an acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 used the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)—as did SARS-CoV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein mediates cell entry and is a single-pass transmembrane proteins that forms homotrimers. It has a large N-terminal ectodomain exposed to the exterior, a transmembrane helix, and a short C-terminal tail located within the virus. Each Spike monomer contains two regions termed S1 and S2. In the assembled trimer the S1 regions contain the receptor binding domain while the S2 regions forms a flexible stalk, which mediates membrane fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The S1 region is divided into a N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain, the latter interacts with the target cell ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Like other Coronavirus spike proteins SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is heavily N-linked glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) and blocking N- and O-glycans dramatically reduced viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins is activated by host cell proteases that cleave the protein at the S1-S2 boundary and subsequently at the S2’ site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Because Spike proteins are located on the surface of the virus, they are a major antigen targeted by the host immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>).</p>
<p>During natural infection host immune cells encounter Spike proteins via several different avenues. First, by direct contact with Spike protein bearing viral particles released from infected cells. Second, although the SARS-CoV-2 virions assemble in intracellular compartments of infected cells, unincorporated Spike proteins can reach the plasma membrane. Infected cells expressing Spike proteins may bind to cellular receptors present on resident or recruited immune cells. Third, extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by virally infected cells can contain Spike proteins. Mass spectrometry and nanoscale flow cytometry demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein incorporation into EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Fourth, Spike proteins are pre-processed during viral assembly utilizing the furin protease cleavage site between the S1 and S2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). When the Spike protein adopts a fusion conformation the ACE2 receptor-binding domain separates from the membrane-bound S2 subunit. Soluble S1 subunits shed from infected cells or from the virions <italic>in vivo</italic> may bind to other cells via ACE2 or other binding partners. Intriguingly 60% of the plasma samples from patients with post-acute sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (PASC) had detectable levels of Spike protein using an ultrasensitive antigen capture assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Prolonged exposure to Spike protein has been suggested to be responsible for Long-COVID syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Humans also encounter SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein via vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Serious adverse events following vaccination are rare but include vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis; myocarditis and pericarditis; and a variety of autoimmune illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Due to waning effectiveness humans require repeated immunizations to maintain immunity and protection against potentially severe disease raising some concerns about the impact of repeated exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins.</p>
<p>To better understand the localization and trafficking of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein following administration and perhaps during natural infection we prepared a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike ectodomain stabilized in a prefusion conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). This variant (S-2P) contained two consecutive proline substitutions in the S2 subunit. This double-proline substitution (SARS-CoV-2 S-2P) has allowed the rapid determination of high-resolution cryo-EM structures. Fluorescently labeled SARS-CoV-2 Spike ectodomain, a D614G variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), a high mannose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), and de-glycosylated version were injected into mice to characterize cellular uptake; were used to characterize uptake and identify human mononuclear cells that bound these proteins, and to perform functional studies. In some instances, we used viral like particles (VLPs) expressing the full-length Spike protein. Our results identified the <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular tropism of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins, delineated their human mononuclear cell targets, provided insights into their functional effects, thereby, helping afford a basis for understanding their impact on humans.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Preparation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins and VLPs expressing them</title>
<p>We purified a stabilized exodomain of the original SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) using media conditioned by transfected CHO-S or HEK293F cells. Because of higher yields most experiments used CHO-S derived protein. The strategy for producing the recombinant protein is shown (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref></bold>). Based on its mobility on size exclusion chromatography the Spike proteins spontaneously formed trimers. Kifunensine treated cultures were used to generate a high mannose version, and PNGase F treated protein generated an N-glycan deficient version, and they will be referred to as such. A D614G mutant of the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was also purified. Each of the recombinant proteins was subjected to two rounds of Triton X-114 extraction to remove any residual lipopolysaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The N-termini of the recombinant proteins were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488. In some experiments we used viral like particles (VLPs) that expressed the original Wuhan Spike protein. We produced the VLPs using HEK293T cells along with a plasmid encoding the human immunodeficiency GAG protein fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein expression vector. Mice inhaled the Spike protein or the SARS-CoV-2 VLPs, while only the Spike proteins were injected intravenously or subcutaneously.</p>

<title>Inhalation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins and Spike protein expressing VLPs affects the lung cellular composition and architecture</title>
<p>At various time points after Spike protein or VLP inhalation lungs from mice were processed for confocal microscopy. A Siglec-F antibody identified alveolar macrophages (AMs) while CD169 (Siglec-1) immunostaining delineated a subset of large airway associated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Interstitial and inflammatory macrophages do not express Siglec-F. At 3 hours post inhalation low magnification images of mouse lung sections revealed Spike protein (Trimer) uptake by Siglec-F positive cells. Due to the uneven distribution of the inhaled Spike protein the Siglec-F positive cells in the lower portion of the image lack signal (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). The Siglec-F positive macrophages located near the bronchial epithelium and in the nearby alveoli initially accumulated the labeled protein (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). Even at the 30-minute time point AMs had already accumulated it (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Most of the macrophages that acquired the Spike proteins were Siglec-F positive, lacked CD169 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>), but were wheat germ agglutinin positive, a mucin marker (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). Repeating the experiment but substituting the Spike protein with VLPs expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein revealed a similar pattern of uptake by AMs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>). Immunostaining with LYVE-1 and CD31 to identify the lymphatic and blood vessel endothelium, respectively, (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></bold>) or with Podoplanin another lymphatic endothelial cell marker (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref></bold>) showed the rapid accumulation of the Spike protein bearing VLPs in small and large lymphatic vessels. Within 3 hours of administration of either the VLPs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref></bold>) or the Spike protein (data not shown) areas of alveolar collapse and lung damage were evident.</p>

<p>To assess the cellular response to Spike protein inhalation and to delineate the cells that had acquired Spike protein <italic>in vivo</italic> we collected mouse lungs 18 hours post exposure to different SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein preparations. Saline inhalation served as a control. Lung fragments were digested, and then pushed through a 40-micron cell strainer. Analysis of the collected cells by flow cytometry revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein increased the number of neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells in the lung, but did not affect lymphocyte or eosinophil numbers (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Due to the uneven distribution of the inhaled protein and because of their rapid turnover the neutrophil numbers likely underestimate the local neutrophil recruitment. As the imaging experiments indicated AMs most avidly acquired the Spike protein, some interstitial macrophages also retained it, while only a low percentage of the lung neutrophils and dendritic cells were positive following isolation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Inhalation of the glycan deficient Spike protein reduced the cellular infiltrate and the percentage of cells that retained the protein. The high mannose Spike protein slightly increased the numbers of neutrophil and macrophages in the lung despite a lower uptake by alveolar and interstitial macrophages. Finally, the D614G mutation reduced the cellular infiltrate compared to the unmutated protein and had a slightly different cell binding profile as a greater percentage of monocytes, eosinophils, and dendritic cells retained it (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>)</bold>. We also tested whether the addition of human ACE2 affected the cellular uptake of the Spike protein following intranasal administration by comparing wild type and the human ACE2 transgenic mice. While we saw little difference by imaging, we did note some minor changes in the cellular uptake pattern, most notably an increase uptake by AM and decrease by interstitial macrophages (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Lung neutrophil recruitment and damage 3 hours post inhalation of the Spike protein</title>
<p>Next, we tested whether inhalation of the Spike protein altered the lung vasculature permeability by having mice inhale either the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein or the S1 protein from HCoV-HKU1, which was made as a His tagged protein in HEK293 cells. Subsequently we injected Evans Blue intravenously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Inspection of the lungs from the treated mice revealed a strong increase in Evan blue staining, which was most pronounced following inhalation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Quantifying the Evans blue dye in the collected lungs confirmed the increase in vasculature permeability (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). In lung tissue fixed 3 hours after inhalation, SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein bearing Siglec-F positive macrophages are surrounded by neutrophils and neutrophil fragments (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, C)</bold>. Imaging fixed lung tissue from mice that had inhaled saline, SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, glycan deficient protein, the high mannose protein, and the HCoV-HKU1 S1 subunit recombinant protein revealed enhanced neutrophil recruitment with each of them. The surveyed areas of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein inhaled mice had approximately a 10-fold higher neutrophil density when compared to saline treated control mice and 4-fold more than the mice that inhaled the SARS-HKU1 S1 protein (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>).</p>

Within 3hours local IL-1β injection recruits bone marrow neutrophils and leads to their transmigration into the nearby tissue. Neutrophils and platelets can be visualized by co-injecting fluorescently labeled Ly6G and Gp1bβ antibodies, respectively. Local PBS injection and intermittent imaging over a 6-hour time frame revealed occasional blood neutrophil and numerous flowing platelets (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Video 1)</bold>. Local intrascrotal injection of unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein caused a modest recruitment of neutrophils at 4-6 hours post injection (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Video 1)</bold>. To better assess the long-term effect of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, we co-injected Il-1β and waited until the following day to image. Typically, at 24 hours post Il-1β the inflammatory response is resolving, and the interstitial neutrophil numbers are declining from their peak <bold>(Video 2)</bold>. In contrast, each of the Spike proteins adversely affected neutrophil motility and morphology. Numerous neutrophils and neutrophil fragments localized along the blood vessel walls and were scattered within the interstitium (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, Video 2)</bold>. We did not note any significant difference between the different SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein preparations as each caused neutrophil fragmentation and a decline in mobile neutrophils (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We also assessed the impact of injecting the labeled SARS-CoV-2 protein into the blood on the liver sinusoids using intravital microscopy. Snapshots at three hours post infusion revealed Spike protein outlined liver sinusoid endothelial cells co-localized with the CD31 delineated sinusoid endothelial membranes. Kupffer cells identified by F4-80 immunostaining rapidly acquired large amounts of the infused Spike protein (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>, Video 3)</bold>. The sinusoids, normally devoid of neutrophils, contained many Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils. However, by 18 hours post infusion the amount of Spike protein outlining the sinusoids had declined as had the Kupffer cell associated material (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref></bold>). The neutrophil infiltration had largely resolved suggesting that the inflammatory signals had declined. The origin of the white dots interspersed between the sinusoids is unknown, but they were not present at 3 hours post infusion despite identical imaging conditions. One possibility is that altered vascular permeability had allowed some labeled antibodies to leak into the liver parenchyma. To determine whether other endothelial beds also acquired intravenous administered Spike protein we examined the spleen, heart ventricle, and Peyer’s patches. At 3 hours post infusion endothelial cells at these three sites had acquired the labelled Spike proteins, most prominently in Peyer’s patches (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref></bold>). Finally, we intravitally imaged the inguinal lymph node at 3 and 18-hour after local injection. Typically, locally injected material rapidly enters nearby afferent lymphatics for delivery to the lymph node where subcapsular sinus macrophages first encounter it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). If it bypasses these macrophages lymph borne material flows into the lymph node medullary region, where medullary macrophages reside. At both the 3-hour time point (data not shown) and at 18 hours subcapsular macrophages showed little interest in the Spike protein, but medullary macrophages avidly acquired it. In contrast to the liver, we did not detect neutrophil recruitment into the lymph node at either time point after tail base injection.</p>

<title>Murine and human neutrophils NETosis following exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein</title>
<p>Live cell imaging of lung sections following intranasal inhalation of the Spike protein revealed ongoing neutrophil damage and likely NETosis (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). Time-lapse images show several disrupted neutrophils near a Siglec-F positive AM along with Spike protein bound to a dying neutrophil. This observation along with the cremaster muscle imaging suggested direct neutrophil toxicity. Furthermore, a previous study had shown Spike protein induced neutrophil NETosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). To confirm that the Spike protein can trigger neutrophil NETosis and to compare different Spike protein preparations, we briefly exposed murine bone marrow neutrophils and assessed the % of cells undergoing cell death using a flow-based assay. Exposure to fMLP served as a positive control. The lowest concentration of Spike protein (0.1 µg) tested increased the number of dying neutrophils (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). Switching to human neutrophils purified from human peripheral blood, exposure to TNFα, LPS or PMA for 4 hours or overnight reduced their viability as expected. Addition of SARS-CoV2 or the D614G mutant protein (1 μg/ml) decreased their viability at 4 hours and more dramatically upon overnight exposure. The high mannose versions of the Spike protein and D614G Spike had a slightly greater toxicity at 4 hours but had a similar impact in the overnight assay (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). Finally, we imaged human neutrophils overlaid on SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein treated A549 cells, a human lung epithelial cell line. Numerous dying neutrophils could be observed likely undergoing NETosis (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, Video 4)</bold>. These results confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein can cause neutrophil damage potentially exacerbating the inflammatory response.</p>

<title>Murine and human cells use Siglecs to help capture the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein</title>
<p>Since murine and human leukocytes lack significant ACE2 levels, the major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and −2, they likely use other receptors to capture the Spike proteins. The strong co-localization with Siglec-F expressing murine AMs prompted an examination of the role of Siglec-F and other Siglecs in capturing the Spike proteins. Siglecs are transmembrane proteins that exhibit specificity for sialic acids attached to the terminal portions of cell-surface glycoproteins. Several viruses take advantage of sialic acid-Siglec interactions for cell targeting, spreading, and trans-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Initially, we established a bead assay to assess the binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins. We coupled the S1 domain protein, the SARS-CoV-2 stabilized Spike protein, or the PNGase F treated Spike protein and reacted the beads with fluorescently labeled antibody or different recombinant proteins. Flow cytometry analysis revealed strong binding of the Spike protein antibody, human ACE2, but not murine ACE2 as expected (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>). Siglec-F also bound well, while the human Siglec-5 and Siglec-8 bound poorly despite being the structural and functional equivalents of Siglec F, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Despite the poor binding to the recombinant human Siglecs in the bead assay, we elected to test them in context of a human cell by expressing them in HEK293 cells. We chose HEK293 cells as they exhibited little Spike protein binding. We established ACE2, Siglec-5, Siglec-8, Siglec-5/8, ACE2/Siglec-5, and ACE2/Siglec-8 expressing cell lines (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>). The ACE2 transfected cells behaved as anticipated binding the original Spike protein and even better the D614G version; and binding the S1 protein. The high mannose and glycan deficient Spike proteins did not bind. In contrast to the bead assay both the Siglec-5 and the Siglec-8 expressing HEK293 cells bound the Spike protein, although less efficiently than did the ACE2 expressing cells. They bound the D614G version less well, and very weakly bound the S1 domain protein. The high mannose and glycan deficient Spike proteins exhibited little binding to the Siglec expressing cells. Co-expression of Siglec-5 and −8 did not improve binding, although the ACE2/Siglec co-expressing cells bound the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein slightly better than did ACE2 only cells. We also imaged the Siglec-5 expressing HEK293 with labeled protein (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></bold>). The imaging revealed efficient uptake and Spike protein endocytosis. Co-cultured ACE2 and Siglec-5 expressing cells both captured the Spike protein while HEK293 cells not expressing either protein failed to bind or uptake it (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, Video 5)</bold>. To determine whether Siglec-5 or Siglec-8 could contribute to viral transduction, we produced lentiviral particles expressing the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2, HKU1, or 229E and attempted to transduce the HEK293 ACE2 expressing cells. Successful transduction resulted in GFP expression, which we quantitated by flow cytometry and only occurred with the lentiviral particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein incorporation (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></bold>). Both a receptor binding domain antibody and recombinant ACE2 blocked transduction. Recombinant human Siglec-5 partially inhibited although it required relatively high concentrations, while human Siglec-1, human Siglec-2, and murine Siglec-F had no impact on the transduction frequency.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study analyzed the cell tropism of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and some of its variants using fluorescently labeled proteins and mice to assess <italic>in vivo</italic> binding and human peripheral blood to assess human leukocyte binding. The intranasal administration of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to mice led to its rapid uptake by Siglec-F positive AMs. The reduced uptake of the high mannose Spike protein suggested that AM receptors that interact with complex glycans mediated a portion of the uptake. We confirmed Siglec-F as a potential capturing receptor, as it efficiently bound to the S1 domain, and the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Arguing against a role for mSiglec-1, CD169<sup>+</sup> lung macrophages and CD169<sup>+</sup> subcapsular sinus macrophages failed to accumulate the Spike protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. The closest human paralog of mouse Siglec-F is hSiglec-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). While expressed on human eosinophils and mast cells, human AMs apparently lack it. In contrast, human AMs do express Siglec-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Along with its paired receptor, hSiglec-14, Siglec-5 can modulate innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). When tested in a bead binding assay, in contrast to Siglec-F, neither hSiglec-5 or −8 bound the recombinant Spike protein, yet their expression in a cellular context allowed binding. Additionally, recombinant hSiglec-5 partially inhibited the transduction of Spike protein bearing viral like particles into ACE2 expressing HEK293 cells. Evidently the recombinant protein binding assay we employed did not fully capture the properties of hSiglec-5 or hSiglec-8 in a cellular context. A recent study of human lungs revealed scant alveolar ACE2 expression, highlighting the importance of alternative Spike protein receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). <italic>Ex vivo</italic> infected human lungs and COVID-19 autopsy samples showed AMs positive for SARS-CoV-2 and single-cell transcriptomics revealed nonproductive virus uptake, and activation of inflammatory and anti-viral pathways. Another study which analyzed pulmonary cells from COVID-19 patients found that myeloid cell C-type lectin engagement induced a robust proinflammatory responses that correlated with COVID-19 severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). The robust Spike binding to AMs and their potential roles in COVID-19 lung infection warrants a further exploration of their Spike protein binding partners.</p>
<p>The intranasal administration of the Spike protein resulted in an increase in lung vascular permeability and local tissue damage. While the mechanisms are unknown, infectious agents that target AMs can trigger the secretion of factors that disrupt the integrity of the pulmonary microvascular cell barrier. For example, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infected AMs trigger transcriptional changes in genes in co-cultured microvascular endothelial cells that reduce vascular integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Lung endothelial cells may also be directly targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Spike protein/ACE2 interactions reduce endothelial cell ACE2 expression, which can alter vascular permeability. Yet, the low affinity of mouse ACE2 for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein presumably precludes this mechanism in this study. Also arguing against a role for ACE2 in our model, the responses to intranasal Spike protein in human ACE2 transgenic mice resembled those of wild type mice. The Spike protein RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic Acid) motif can also bind αVβ3 integrins present on endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). This affects VE-cadherin function and vascular integrity. However, we did not detect any Spike protein on the pulmonary blood vessels following intranasal administration although a low level of binding may have escaped visualization. In sum, the rapid and intense uptake of Spike protein by AMs supports a role for these cells in the localized neutrophil recruitment, nearby tissue damage, and increased vascular permeability that follows its intranasal administration.</p>
<p>The intravenous administration of the Spike protein, led to its accumulation by Kupffer cells in the mouse liver. This uptake was accompanied by a transitory increase in liver sinusoid neutrophils. Human Kupffer cells express LSECtin (liver Siglec and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin, CLEC4G) a C-type lectin receptor encoded within the L-SIGN/DC-SIGN/CD23 gene cluster. LSECtin acts as a pathogen attachment factor for Ebola virus and the SARS coronaviruses suggesting that it contributed to the Kupffer cell uptake we noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). The liver sinusoid endothelial cells also avidly accumulated the Spike protein. These cells express another C-type lectin receptor L-SIGN (CD209L/CLEC4M), which has been shown to interact in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner with high-mannose–type N-glycans on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Based on our mouse studies, blood borne SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins, viral particles, or exosomes bearing the Spike protein are likely to accumulate in the liver during severe or prolonged COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p>Local injection of the Spike protein in the region of the cremaster muscle recruited low numbers of neutrophils, but co-administration with IL-1β caused severe neutrophil damage. The Spike protein also proved toxic to purified mouse and human neutrophils cultured <italic>ex vivo</italic> in its presence. Most human neutrophils bound the recombinant Spike protein. The presence of cations in the binding buffer substantially enhanced the binding suggesting that a cation dependent receptor accounted for a significant portion of the binding. While the high mannose version bound neutrophils less well, in the NETosis assay it produced a similar level of neutrophil cell death. Neutrophils likely employ several different receptors to capture the Spike protein. Human neutrophils express several C-type lectin receptors including CLEC5A, which has been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 triggered neutrophil NETosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). They also express Siglec-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), which bound the Spike protein when expressed in HEK293 cells.</p>
<p>In this study, inhaled SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and VLPs bearing the Spike protein rapidly accumulated on AMs. They used Siglec-F and likely other cell surface molecules to capture the Spike protein. Following inhalation, the integrity of the pulmonary vasculature weakened. Resident and recruited neutrophils suffered, either directly targeted by the Spike protein, or secondarily due to the inflammatory response. A similar scenario would be expected during SARS-CoV-2 infection, following direct instillation of the Spike protein in the upper airway of humans, or following an intranasal vaccine that directs the synthesis of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein or fragments. Our data indicates that viral particles and soluble Spike protein that spills into the blood during SARS-CoV-2 infection or following immunization will be cleared by liver Kupffer cells but will also target blood vessel endothelial cells. Local delivery of the Spike protein that occurs following vaccination, rapidly delivers the Spike protein to the draining lymph node via afferent lymphatics. Surprisingly, we found that lymph node medullary macrophages, which largely serve a degradative function, uptake the Spike protein. Designing a less toxic Spike protein immunogen that targets subcapsular sinus macrophages might better deliver the immunogen to B cells, thereby eliciting a more efficacious antibody response.</p>

<title>Human macrophage polarization and cytokine profiling</title>
<p>To polarize human macrophages, monocyte derived macrophages were plated in 48 well plates at 5 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well in 500μl RPMI medium and allowed to rest 2hours at 37°C before treat of cytokines or LPS. The human M0 macrophages were either left untreated or treated for 48h to induce macrophage polarization: (i) for M1 polarization with 10 ng/mL LPS (E055:B55; Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 ng/mL IFNγ (PeproTech), (ii) for M2 polarization with 50 ng/ml human recombinant M-CSF, 20 ng/ml human recombinant IL-4, and 20 ng/ml human recombinant IL-13 (PeproTech). Human macrophages were then cultured alone or with 0.1ug, or 1ug SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins for 48 hr. The cultured supernatants were collected, and cytokine levels determined using the bead-based immunoassays LEGENDplex™ Human Macrophage/ Microglia Panel (Biolegend). The assays were performed in 96-well plates following the manufacturer’s instructions. For measurements a FACSCelesta SORP flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) was employed, and data were evaluated with the LEGENDplex™ Data Analysis software.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein incorporated NL4.3-GFP VLPs were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with full length SARS-CoV-2 Spike-S and HIV-1 NL4-3 Gag-iGFP ΔEnv (12455, NIH AIDS Reagent Program) at a ratio of 1:2.5 using a previously reported method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). EGFP control lentiviruses (no Spike protein) were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr (packaging) and pLentipuro3 TO V5-GW EGFP-Firefly Luciferase (reporter). Coronavirus Spike proteins were incorporated by co-transfection with SARS-CoV-2 Spike-S, HCoV-229E Spike, or HCoV-HKU1 Spike expressing plasmids. Eighty percent confluent HEK293T in six well plates (2.5 ml/well) were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid diluted in Opti-MEM with a 1:4 (DNA/reagent) dilution of TransIT-293 Transfection Reagent. The media was harvested 64 hr later and centrifuged at 500 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and mixed with Lenti-X Concentrator (Takara Bio USA, Inc) at a 1:3 ratio. The mixture was placed at 4 °C overnight and centrifuged the following day at 1500 ×g for 45 min. Fluorescent VLPs were directly counted and measured by BD FACSCelesta™ flow cytometer. The forward scatter (FSC) detector (Photodiode with 488/10 BP filter) and side scatter (SSC) detector (photomultiplier tube (PMT) with 488/10 BP filter) were tuned to detect voltages up to 530 for FSC and 220 for SSC. The NL4.3-GFP VLPs were distinguished from noise and non-VLP particles by GFP signals. NL4.3-GFP VLP spike protein incorporation was tested using human ACE2 expressing HEK293 cells (ACE2/HEK293). Ten thousand VLPs were incubated with 1×10<sup>4</sup> ACE2/HEK293 cells in 1× HBSS (contains; 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 1 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup> and 0.5% fatty acid free BSA) buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. Binding of the VLPs to ACE2/HEK293 cells was measured with BD FACSCelesta™. The 50% lentivirus transduction dose was determined using percentile (50%) of GFP positive ACE2/HEK293 cells 3 days after transduction. The pelleted VLPs or lentiviruses were suspended in PBS and frozen in single use aliquots.</p>

<p>Lung slices were obtained from mouse lungs using a slightly modified published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Briefly, C57BL/6 mice were euthanized with overdose of Avertin (1 ml of 2.5% Avertin). The peritoneum was opened, and the descending aorta cut allowing blood to pool in the abdomen. The trachea was cannulated, and the lungs inflated with 37 °C 1.5% low-melting-point agarose (Cat# 50111, Lonza) prepared with RPMI 1640 media. Subsequently, the lungs were excised and rinsed with RPMI 1640 media. Isolated left lungs were sectioned into six to eight 1-mm-thick transverse slices using a #10 scalpel blade.

<p>The microanatomy of liver, spleen, heart, Peyer’s patch, and inguinal LN were delineated by tail vein injection of labelled antibodies before imaging. Antibodies used included CD31, blood vessels; F4/80, Kupffer cells and macrophages; CD169, subcapsular macrophages; and Ly6G; neutrophils). The antibody mixtures were injected 10 min before starting animal surgery. Fluorescently labelled spike proteins were injected intravenously or at the mouse tail base as indicated. To image the liver or spleen a slightly modified published protocol was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Briefly, after initial anesthesia (Avertin 300 mg/kg, i.p.) the skin and peritoneum were cut to expose the left lobe of the liver, or the left flank was cut below the costal margin to expose the spleen. The visible organs were glued with n-butyl cyanoacrylate to a custom-made metal holder. After attachment, the mouse was placed over a pre-warmed cover glass (Brain Research Laboratories) window on universal mounting frame AK-Set (PECON<sup>®</sup>). The exposed organs were kept moist with saline wetted gauze. The mounting frame was placed into the temperature control chamber on the microscope and maintained at 37.0± 0.5°C. Once stabilized onto imaging stage/insert the mice received isoflurane (Baxter; 2% for induction of anesthesia, and 1 – 1.5% for maintenance, vaporized in an 80:20 mixture of oxygen and air). For liver and spleen four-dimensional analysis of cell behavior, stacks of various numbers of section (z step = 3, 5) were acquired every 5-30 sec to provide an imaging volume of 20 ∼ 50 μm in depth. Intact organ imaging of the heart, inguinal lymph node, or Peyer’s patches was performed after mouse sacrifice using same imaging procedure as used for liver/spleen imaging.</p>
<p>To image neutrophils in the cremaster muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), mice received an intrascrotal injection of PBS, BSA, IL-1β (50 ng in 300 µl saline, R&amp;D Systems), Spike proteins, or IL-1b and Spike proteins. 90 min. prior to imaging, the mice received injections of Avertin (300 mg/kg, i.p.) and fluorescently labeled antibodies intravenously. Antibodies used directed against Gr-1, neutrophils; GPIbβ, platelets; and CD31, blood vessel endothelium. The isolated cremaster tissue was exteriorized and stabilized onto the imaging stage/insert with the tissue directly contacting the cover glass. The exposed tissue was kept moist with pre-warmed saline (37°C). Once stabilized onto an imaging stage/insert the mouse received isoflurane (Baxter; 2% for induction of anesthesia, and 1 – 1.5% for maintenance, vaporized in an 80:20 mixture of oxygen and air), and placed into a temperature-controlled chamber. Image stacks of optical sections (z step=1) were routinely acquired at 20 – 30 sec intervals to provide an imaging volume of 15-25 µm. All imaging was performed with a Leica SP8 inverted 5 channels confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with HC PL APO CS2 40× (NA, 1.30) oil objective.

<p>This paper covers a large range of effects of delivering SAR-CoV2 spike protein to the airway of mice with some in vitro analysis of effect on human cells. The observations will be <bold>valuable</bold> to the field in raising the possibility that the SAR-CoV2 spike protein has pro-inflammatory effects following uptake by macrophages and may lead to neutrophil recruitment and netosis, a pro-inflammatory mode of cell death. Two of the three reviewers felt the evidence was <bold>incomplete</bold>, based on what were felt to be some weak controls, but another expert felt the evidence was <bold>solid</bold>.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Park et. al. examines the interaction of macrophages with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and subsequent inflammatory reactions. The authors demonstrate that following intranasal delivery of spike it rapidly accumulates in alveolar macrophages. Inflammation associated with internalized spike recruits neutrophils to the lung, where they undergo a cell death process consistent with NETosis. The authors demonstrate that modifications spike to contain high mannose reduces uptake of spike protein and limits the inflammation induced. This finding could have implications on vaccine development, as vaccines containing modified spike could be safer and better tolerated.</p>
<p>The authors use a number of different techniques, including in vivo modeling, imaging, human and murine systems to interrogate their hypotheses. These systems provide robust supporting information for their conclusions. There are two key aspects from the current manuscript which would add key evidence. The authors suggest that neutrophils exposed to spike protein undergo a process of NETosis. To confirm this hypothesis inhibitors of NETosis should be used to demonstrate that the cell death is prevented. Additionally, vaccination of a murine model with the modified spike protein would add additional support to the conclusion that modified spike protein would be less inflammatory while maintaining its utility as a vaccine antigen.</p>

<p>The paper describes the various types of immune cells interacting with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and undergoing pathological changes upon different routes of administration into mice mainly in the absence of human ACE-2. Multiple murine cell types in the lungs, the cremaster muscle and surrounding tissues, and the liver were studied. The spike interactions with various cells from the human peripheral blood ex vivo and in cultures were also examined. This study focused on hACE-2-independent effects of the spike protein in vivo in mice and in vitro on human leukocytes and touched upon the potential involvement of sialic-acid-binding lectins (Siglec) as non-hACE-2 receptors for spike. Hence, a multitude of aspects about spike-cell interactions was studied, although each was covered without significant depths and the key findings are difficult to parse through. Many inconsistencies are not explained and the critical experimental parameters and controls are missing. Ultimately, the main message of the study is buried among supporting vs confounding data.</p>

<p>The study focuses on in vivo and in vitro cellular responses intranasal instillation of glycoforms and mutants of SARS-CoV2 spike trimer or spike bearing VLP. Collectively, the experiments suggest that SARS-CoV2 spike has pro-inflammatory roles through increase M1 macrophage associated cytokines and induction of neutrophil netosis, a proinflammatory cell death mechanisms. These effects seem largely independent of hACE2 interaction and partly depend upon interactions with scavenger receptors on macrophages and neutrophils. A strength of the study is that a number sophisticated methods are used, including intravital microscopy in the cramaster and liver as well as acute lung slice models, to look at uptake of the spike proteins and immune cell dynamics. The weakness is that some of the reagents maybe contaminated with uncharacterized glycoforms and some important controls, such as control spike protein and control VLP are unevenly applied or not included. Given the breadth of the studies, it would be ideal for the authors to prioritise strengthening the most important in vivo results in the best animal models with the strongest controls to be able to realise the full impact of the results.</p>
