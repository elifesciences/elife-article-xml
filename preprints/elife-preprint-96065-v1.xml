<title>Abstract</title><p>Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease caused by pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. Humans and some mammals can develop severe forms of leptospirosis accompanied by a dysregulated inflammatory response, which often results in death. The gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized as a vital element in systemic health. However, the precise role of the gut microbiota in severe leptospirosis is still unknown. Here, we aimed to explore the function and potential mechanisms of the gut microbiota in a hamster model of severe leptospirosis. Our study showed that leptospires were able to multiply in the intestine, cause pathological injury, and induce intestinal and systemic inflammatory responses. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection changed the composition of the gut microbiota of hamsters with an expansion of Proteobacteria. In addition, gut barrier permeability was increased after infection, as reflected by a decrease in the expression of tight junctions. Translocated Proteobacteria were found in the intestinal epithelium of moribund hamsters, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, with elevated LPS levels in the serum. Moreover, gut microbiota depletion reduced the survival time, increased the leptospiral load, and promoted the expression of proinflammatory cytokines after <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection. Intriguingly, fecal filtration and serum from moribund hamsters both increased the transcription of <italic>TNF-α</italic>, <italic>IL-1β</italic>, <italic>IL-10</italic>, and <italic>TLR4</italic> in macrophages compared with those from uninfected hamsters. These stimulating activities were inhibited by LPS neutralization using polymyxin B. Based on our findings, we identified an LPS neutralization therapy that significantly improved the survival rates in severe leptospirosis when used in combination with antibiotic therapy or polyclonal antibody therapy. In conclusion, our study not only uncovers the role of the gut microbiota in severe leptospirosis but also provides a therapeutic strategy for severe leptospirosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Leptospirosis is a worldwide emerging zoonotic disease caused by <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> impacts approximately one million people resulting 60000 deaths every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In human leptospirosis, the clinical manifestations can range from mild illness to multiorgan failure, characterized by jaundice, kidney, and liver failure, and even death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Currently, one important challenge is that leptospirosis is often misdiagnosed as other febrile diseases, and once the optimal treatment period is missed, leptospirosis quickly develops into the severe form, which often ends in death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). However, antibiotic treatment is often useless in severe leptospirosis and even aggravates it, called the Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Thus, it is imperative to explore precision medicine strategies for the treatment of severe leptospirosis.</p>
<p>90% of infected humans may resolve spontaneously while 10% of patients are designated as susceptible hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Intestinal bleeding is a common but neglected symptom of severe leptospirosis in humans and hamster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). A healthy gut environment, shaped by the presence of a healthy functional microbial ecosystem, is fundamental to instruct the immune system towards homeostasis. The intestine harbours a densely populated resident microbial community, which consists of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, called microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Gut dysbiosis has been linked to increased susceptibility to disseminated bacterial infections and sepsis in humans. In addition, studies of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) have found that dysbiosis increases the risk of nosocomial infections, sepsis, and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Our previous study proved that the gut microbiota contributed to the defence against <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection in mice, a resistant model of leptospirosis, without obvious intestinal lesions or increased intestinal permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Focusing on the role of the gut microbiota in leptospirosis may help explain the differences in susceptibility to <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection in humans and develop targeted therapy for acute leptospirosis. However, whether a relationship exists between the gut microbiota and severe leptospirosis is still unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, we used the hamster model of leptospirosis to explore the functional role of the gut microbiota in acute leptospirosis. We provided evidence that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection disrupted intestinal homeostasis, and targeting gut-derived LPS improved the survival rates of hamsters with severe leptospirosis. Our study provides a basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to control severe leptospirosis.</p>

<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>A previous study reported that sex influenced host susceptibility to leptospirosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) and that sex may affect the composition of the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). To reduce variability in infection outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), most infection experiments were performed in female Syrian golden hamsters <italic>(Mesocricetus auratus</italic>). For experiments utilizing neutralizing LPS therapy combined with antibiotic or antibody therapy for severe leptospirosis, both sexes were used. Specific pathogen-free female Syrian hamsters were maintained on standard rodent chow with water supplied ad libitum during the experimental period. All animal experiments were conducted according to the regulations of the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals in China. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Jilin University (20170318).</p>

<title>Part I hamster infection</title>
<p>To explore the effect of challenge route on leptospiral colonization in the intestine and the survival rate, six-week-old female hamsters were injected intraperitoneally or subcutaneously with 10<sup>7</sup> leptospires. Hamsters were euthanized at 0 h, 6 h, 48 h, 96 h post infection (p.i.), and articulo mortis stage (AM). The ileums and colons were collected aseptically. The intestinal contents were excluded from the intestine with PBS, and the tissues were stored at -80 °C for leptospiral load analysis. For the survival assay, hamsters were monitored daily for signs of illness including ruffled fur, gait difficulty, loss of appetite, or weight loss of ≥10% of the animal’s maximum weight, which was considered moribund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Hamsters were euthanized when they were moribund.</p>
<p>To explore the effect of <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection on the gut microbiota, six-week-old female hamsters were injected intraperitoneally with a lethal dose of 10<sup>7</sup> leptospires. Fresh fecal pellets were collected aseptically at 0 days, 2 days, and AM p.i., immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Colons were also collected aseptically and the intestinal contents were excluded from the intestine with PBS. Then, tissues were stored at -80 °C for gene expression measurement.</p>
<p>To examine the role of the gut microbiota on acute leptospirosis, the gut microbiota depletion and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT: a therapeutic procedure aimed at restoring a normal intestinal microbiota by application of fecal microorganisms from a healthy subject into the gastrointestinal tract of a dysbiotic subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>)) were performed as described previously with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Briefly, six-week-old female hamsters were administered antibiotics (ampicillin, 100 mg/kg; metronidazole, 100 mg/kg; neomycin sulfate, 100 mg/kg (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and vancomycin, 50 mg/kg (BiochemPartner, China) intragastrically once daily for ten consecutive days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Fresh fecal pellets were collected from uninfected female hamsters and then resuspended in sterile normal PBS (1 fecal pellet in 1 mL of PBS). The pellets were immediately homogenized and the homogenate was centrifuged at 100 rpm, 4 °C for 5 min. 200 μL of the supernatant was given to the gut microbiota-depleted hamster by oral gavage for 5 consecutive days after antibiotic treatment was stopped. Then, hamsters were intraperitoneally infected with 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>L. interrogans</italic>. Hamsters were monitored daily for 21 days to record the survival rate. Hamsters were euthanized when they were moribund. Blood was collected to determine leptospiral load and the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines at 6 days p.i..</p>
<p>To explore the effect of LPS neutralization on severe leptospirosis, six-week-old male or female hamsters were inoculated intraperitoneally with 10<sup>7</sup> leptospires. Treatments were started immediately after detection of the first death regardless of the assigned group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Group 1: saline control (400 μL/hamster, i.p.); Group 2: Polymyxin B (PMB) (1 mg/kg, i.p., Solarbio, China); Group 3: Antibody against <italic>Leptospira</italic> (Ab) (16 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection); Group 4: Doxycycline (Dox) (5 mg/kg, i.p., Solarbio, China); Group 5: PMB (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and Ab (16 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection); Group 6: PMB (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and Dox (5 mg/kg, i.p.). Hamsters were treated twice a day for 3 consecutive days. Hamsters were monitored daily for 21 days. Hamsters were euthanized when they were moribund. Blood from female hamsters was collected to determine the leptospiral load and gene expression of inflammatory cytokines at 6 days p.i..</p>

<title>Part II rabbit infection</title>
<p>The purification of polyclonal antibody (Ab) was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Briefly, six eight-month-old female New Zealand White rabbits were injected intravenously into the marginal ear vein with a dose of 2 ± 4×10<sup>8</sup> live leptospires/mL in PBS according to the following schedule: day 1, 1 mL; day 6, 2 mL; day 11, 4 mL; and day 16 and 21, 6 mL each. One week after the last injection, the rabbits were anaesthetized and then exsanguinated through cardiocentesis. The rabbits were then euthanized. During the immunization period, the rabbits did not exhibit clinical signs of leptospirosis. Antisera were collected by centrifuging blood at 3,000 g. The polyclonal Ab IgG was purified from the antisera using the caprylic acid ammonium sulfate precipitation method from the antisera. The concentration of the IgG-polyclonal Ab was determined with the BCATM Protein Assay Kit (Thermo, USA) and adjusted to a final concentration of 20 mg/mL with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The Ab was stored at -20 °C until used for treatment. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the First Norman Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, China [(2013) clinical trial (2013-121)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>).</p>

<title>Bacterial isolation and culture</title>
<p>For isolation of the translocated microbiota, six-week-old female hamsters were intraperitoneally infected with 10<sup>7</sup> leptospires. Hamsters were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mix of ketamine/xylazine (200 and 10 mg/kg, respectively). Blood from the uninfected group and AM group by cardiac puncture were plated on LB or MacConkey agar plates aerobically or anaerobically at 37 °C for 36 h.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> barrier permeability</title>
<p>Six-week-old female hamsters were intraperitoneally infected with 10<sup>7</sup> leptospires. The permeability of the intestine was determined at 0 days, 2 days, and AM p.i.. Hamsters were starved for 6 h before gavage with FITC-dextran (4 kDa, 400 mg/kg body/hamster). After 2 h, hamsters were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mix of ketamine/xylazine (200 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and blood was collected and centrifuged at 3000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min. The samples were analyzed with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Synergy II plate reader with Gen5 software; BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>

<title>Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination</title>
<p>The MIC of PMB and Dox against <italic>L. interrogans</italic> serovar Lai strain Lai 56601 was determined according to a previous method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Briefly, leptospires in the exponential-phase were deposited at a final concentration of 2×10<sup>6</sup> leptospires/mL in each well of 96 well plates with serial two-fold dilutions of PMB and Dox ranging from to 0.0156 μg/L in EMJH. The final volume was 200 μL in each well. The plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C, and then 20 μL of Alamar Blue (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to each well. Then, the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Each strain–drug combination was tested in duplicate, and positive (bacteria and no antibiotic added) and negative (no bacteria added) controls were included in each plate. The results were recorded by a microplate reader (MultiSkan FC, Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>

<title>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)</title>
<p>Six-week-old female hamsters were injected intraperitoneally with 10<sup>7</sup> leptospires. Hamsters were euthanized at 0 days, 2 days, and AM p.i.. Colons were collected aseptically. The intestinal contents were excluded from the intestine with PBS and a segment of colon was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution overnight, washed and passed through 15% and 30% sucrose solutions. The sample was then embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (O.C.T., Tissue-Tek) and cryo-sectioned into 5 μm longitudinal sections (Leica). Slides were equilibrated in hybridization buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% formamide, pH 7.5) and incubated in Cy3-lablled 10 ng/μl FISH probe (Comate Bioscience Co.,Ltd., China) for 14 h at 42 °C in a humidified chamber. The probe information is listed in Table S1. Slides were then incubated for 20 min in wash buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) preheated to 42 °C and washed three times. Samples were then incubated in the dark with 10 μg/ml DAPI (Servicebio Technology Co., Ltd., China) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs).

Then, 16S rRNA genes of distinct regions were amplified using specific primers with barcodes (27F, AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG; 1492R, ACCTTGTTACGACTT). All PCRs were carried out with TransStart FastPfu DNA Polymerase (TransGen Biotech). PCR products were purified using the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Sequencing libraries were generated using the SMRTbellTM Template Prep Kit (PacBio) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The library quality was assessed on the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific) and FEMTO Pulse system. Finally, the library was sequenced on the PacBio Sequel platform. Raw sequences were initially processed through the PacBio SMRT portal. Sequences were filtered for a minimum of 3 passes, and a minimum predicted accuracy of 90% (minfullpass = 3, minPredictedAccuacy = 0.9). The predicted accuracy was 90%, which was defined as the threshold below which CCS was considered noise. The files generated by the PacBio platform were then used for amplicon size trimming to remove sequences outside the expected amplicon size (minLength 1340 bp, maxLength 1640 bp). The reads were assigned to samples based on their unique barcode and trimmed by removing the barcode and primer sequence. The reads were compared with the reference database using the UCHIME algorithm to detect chimeric sequences, and then the chimeric sequences were removed to obtain clean reads. Alpha diversity (Chao1 and Shannon) was calculated with QIIME (Version 1.9.1) and displayed with R software (Version 2.15.3). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed to obtain principal coordinates and visualize the complex, multidimensional data. A distance matrix of weighted UniFrac among samples obtained before was transformed to a new set of orthogonal axes, by which the maximum variation factor was demonstrated by the first principal coordinate, and the second maximum variation factor was demonstrated by the second principal coordinate. PCoA analysis results were displayed by the WGCNA package, stat packages and ggplot2 package in R software (Version 2.15.3).</p>

<title><italic>L. interrogans</italic> proliferated in the intestine, impaired the intestinal structure, and induced proinflammatory response</title>
<p>Recently, Inamasu <italic>et al</italic>. reported that subcutaneous infection with leptospires led to intestinal dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). We wondered whether different challenge routes affected the dissemination of <italic>Leptospira</italic> into the intestine. Thus, we compared the common intraperitoneal challenge with subcutaneous challenge in a hamster model of leptospirosis. Our study indicated that subcutaneous challenge and intraperitoneal challenge both led to leptospiral proliferation in the ileum and colon (Supplementary Fig. S1A and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). There were approximately 7 times more leptospires in the colon than in the ileums at AM p.i. after intraperitoneal challenge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Hamsters infected by intraperitoneal challenge had shortened survival time compared with hamsters infected by subcutaneous challenge (Supplementary Fig. S1B). <italic>L. interrogans</italic> infection disrupted the intestinal structure, caused bleeding, and led to the infiltration of inflammatory cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).

<title>The disruption of the gut microbiota after <italic>L. interrogans</italic> infection</title>
<p>To obtain insight into the composition of the gut microbiota during leptospirosis, we analyzed the feces from <italic>Leptospira</italic>-infected hamsters by 16S rRNA gene sequencing at the indicated time points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The results showed that the bacterial richness (Observed species and Ace) and the diversity (Simpson index and Shannon index) of the gut microbiota were decreased at 2 days p.i., while they were increased at AM p.i. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-E</xref>). Then, we pooled all groups together to perform principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). The results showed that the composition of the gut microbiota in the AM group was significantly different from that in the D0 group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). There was a large degree of dispersion among different individuals 2 days p.i. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), and the composition of the gut microbiota in the D2 group was also different from that of the other two groups (Supplementary Fig. S3A-B). To identify bacterial taxa that were common in the D0 group or the AM group, we performed linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis. The results showed that the abundance of Proteobacteria was increased in the AM group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2K</xref>), while the abundances of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Allobaculum</italic> were decreased compared with those in the D0 group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2L</xref>, and 2M).

<title><italic>L. interrogans</italic> infection increased intestinal permeability by disrupting tight junctions</title>
<p>The intestinal barrier is essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Epithelial tight junctions define the paracellular permeability of the intestinal barrier, which is related to some tight junction proteins, such as Claudins, Occludin, and Zona Occludens 1 (Zo-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The epithelium separates the organism from the external environment and defines individual compartments within tissues. At some sites, the epithelial cells form a nearly complete barrier, the disruption of which is catastrophic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Most studies have relied on a probe, FITC-4 kDa dextran, which has a hydrodynamic diameter of 28 Å, to probe intestinal permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>).

<title>Gut microbiota depletion exacerbated leptospirosis</title>
<p>To determine the role of the gut microbiota in hamsters during <italic>L. interrogans</italic> infection, we treated hamsters with broad-spectrum antibiotics to deplete the gut microbiota, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicated that the richness of the gut microbiota decreased after antibiotic treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-C</xref>). In addition, the diversity of the gut microbiota in the Abx-treated hamsters was lower than that of the control group, and this change in diversity was reversed by FMT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-E</xref>). Antibiotic treatment changed the composition of the gut microbiota in hamsters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S5A-D), leading to the expansion of Proteobacteria and a decrease in Bacteroidota (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-G</xref>). The survival time of Abx-treated hamsters was significantly reduced after infection with 10<sup>6</sup> leptospires (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). In addition, we also measured leptospiral load and the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines in the blood. The results showed that the leptospiral load of the Abx group was significantly increased compared with that of the control group, and this increase was partially reversed by FMT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). Abx treatment slightly increased the gene expression of <italic>TNF-α</italic> and <italic>IL-1β</italic> compared with those of the untreated group.

<title>Gut-derived LPS in the intestine and serum induced inflammation</title>
<p>Gut dysbiosis is a major determinant of endotoxaemia via dysfunction of the intestinal barrier scaffold, which is a prerequisite for LPS translocation into systemic circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that gut-derived LPS was a central mediator in alcoholic steatohepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), white adipose tissue inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), and peripheral inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Cytokine storms are characteristic of severe leptospirosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Our results showed that the proportion of Proteobacteria and intestinal permeability were increased in the AM group; thus, we hypothesized that gut-derived LPS promoted the inflammatory response in severe leptospirosis. We found that the LPS level was higher in the serum of the AM group than in that of the D0 group (Supplementary Fig. S6B). The LPS level of in the Abx-treated AM group was lower than that in the PBS-treated AM group (Supplementary Fig. S6B). To further gain insight into the role of gut-derived LPS in inflammation, we cocultured macrophages with different concentrations of fecal filtration or serum and measured the changes in gene expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). The results showed that fecal filtration from uninfected hamsters and AM hamsters both upregulated the gene expression of <italic>TNF-α</italic>, <italic>IL-1β</italic>, <italic>IL-10</italic>, and <italic>TLR4</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-E</xref>).

Serum from uninfected hamsters and AM hamsters promoted the transcription of IL-1β (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>).

The identification of TLR4, a well-known receptor of LPS, prompted us to examine whether the proinflammatory activity of fecal filtration and serum of AM hamsters was mediated by LPS. A previous study demonstrated that cytokine responses to heat-killed leptospires were not inhibited by PMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>).

<title>LPS neutralization synergized with antibiotic therapy or polyclonal antibody therapy improved the survival rate in severe leptospirosis</title>
<p>Based on the above results, we proposed that in addition to leptospires, gut-derived LPS might also play a pathogenic role in severe leptospirosis and induce an uncontrolled inflammatory response, in which case neutralizing LPS could be effective in treating severe leptospirosis. Therefore, we explored the effect of LPS neutralization therapy compared with antibiotic therapy and our published rabbit polyclonal antibody therapy in severe leptospirosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, moribund hamsters were treated twice a day for 3 consecutive days. LPS neutralization therapy, antibiotic therapy, and rabbit polyclonal antibody therapy did not significantly improve the conditions of female hamsters with severe leptospirosis. However, LPS neutralization combined with antibiotic therapy or rabbit polyclonal antibody therapy significantly increased the survival rate up to 50% or 66.7% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). To further explore the factors leading to differences in survival, we determined the leptospiral load and gene expression of inflammatory cytokines in the blood at 6 days p.i.. The results showed that antibiotic therapy and rabbit polyclonal antibody therapy decreased the leptospiral load in the blood, while LPS neutralization therapy did not reduce the leptospiral load in the blood (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Although antibiotic therapy reduced the leptospiral load, it significantly increased the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (<italic>TNF-α</italic> and <italic>IL-1β</italic>) compared with that of the control group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recently, Inamasu <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the pathological changes and distribution of leptospires in the gut of hamsters after subcutaneous infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Their study highlighted that not only the urine of infected animals but also the feces could be a source of infection. However, the exact role of the gut microenvironment in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis is still unknown. In our study, we found that leptospires could proliferate in the ileum and colon following intraperitoneal challenge or subcutaneous challenge, which was consistent with the results of Inamasu’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Hamsters infected intraperitoneally exhibited more rapid death than hamsters infected subcutaneously. A previous study reported that the route of infection affected the kinetics of hematogenous dissemination, kidney colonization, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). In addition, the subcutaneous route induced a slower-progressing infection than the intraperitoneal route in a leptospirosis rat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). However, there was a higher leptospiral load in the colons than in the ileums of hamsters infected by the intraperitoneal route. The capacity of <italic>L. interrogans</italic> to breach the immune defence at each port of entry determined when <italic>Leptospira</italic> gained access to the blood. <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection destroyed the intestinal structure and induced intestinal inflammation in the colon. However, Inamasu <italic>et al</italic>. reported that <italic>Leptospira</italic> was not involved in the pathogenesis of the colon, suggesting that the jejunum and ileum are the main sites of lesions. Differences in bacterial strains and the route of infection might lead to variations in results. Infection via the intraperitoneal and subcutaneous routes bypass the epidermal defence system. Early damage to the intestinal structure and environment may be one of the causes of rapid death following infection by intraperitoneal injection. The proliferation of leptospires in the intestine makes feces a potential excretion route. Our previous study demonstrated that leptospires were rapidly cleared in the intestine and that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection did not increase the intestinal permeability of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). A recent study reported that pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. were highly present in human and gorilla stool samples in the Congo but were absent in other African nonhuman primates, therefore suggesting a possible gorilla-humans transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Our 16S rRNA sequencing results also showed that the relative abundance of Spirochetes was increased in the AM group compared with that of the D0 group, which might be related to the excretion of leptospires in the feces. However, no leptospires were detected in the feces from <italic>Leptospira</italic>-infected rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Serovar specificity and species differences may determine the excretion route of leptospires and the disruption of intestinal homeostasis may influence the progression of leptospirosis.</p>
<p>Our 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that the species richness and diversity of the gut microbiota in the AM group were even higher than those in the D2 group. The species richness and diversity of the gut microbiota decreased first and then increased with disease progression. This phenomenon was also reported in melioidosis and HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Lankelma <italic>et al.</italic> explained that several “big players” in the gut microbiota were eliminated by the host immune system during severe systemic bacterial infection, giving way to the proliferation of other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Specific microbiota community composition, rather than species richness, drives microbiota-mediated resistance against <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection. Becattini <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that microbiota composition and the type of immune stimulus impacted bacterial responses and that the intestinal metabolome was rapidly reshaped by host immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). We hypothesized that the early colonization and proliferation of leptospires in the intestine rapidly activated intestinal immunity leading to the expansion of specific microbes in the AM group. The composition of the gut microbiota in the D2 group was discrete, as shown by PCoA. This difference might be related to the disease progression. In addition, we found that the levels of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Allobaculum</italic> were higher in the D0 group than in the AM group at the genus level. Meanwhile, the level of Proteobacteria increased in the AM group. Our study proved that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection increased the gene expression of <italic>TLR2</italic>, <italic>TLR4</italic>, <italic>TLR9</italic>, and some proinflammatory cytokines, which created a proinflammatory environment in the intestine. A previous study demonstrated that intestinal inflammation increased the bioavailability of respiratory electron acceptors for Enterobacteriaceae, which promoted the expansion of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection triggered intestinal inflammation, which promoted the expansion of Proteobacteria by increasing the bioavailability of respiratory electron acceptors for pathogenic Proteobacteria.</p>
<p>The intestinal barrier is critical for maintaining homeostasis in the host. The apical junctional complex (AJC) encircles pairs of neighbouring epithelial and endothelial cells to create an adhesive network and maintain barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Our results showed that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection significantly disrupted the intestinal permeability of hamsters at the late stage of infection. Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection reduced the signalling between cell-cell junction proteins and caused the mislocalisation of AJC proteins, such as occludin and Zo-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). A recent study reported that <italic>L. interrogans</italic> could disassemble AJCs in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells and transmigrate through the paracellular route for dissemination in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that <italic>L. interrogans</italic> was also able to transmigrate through the intestinal epithelial barrier, and feces excretion route of leptospires was possible in susceptible hosts during leptospirosis. Our results showed that the gene expression of <italic>Claudin-2</italic>, <italic>Claudin-3</italic>, <italic>Claudin-4</italic>, <italic>Zo-1</italic> and <italic>Mucin-2</italic> were compensatively upregulated in the D2 group compared with those in the D0 group. However, the gene expression of <italic>Claudin-3</italic>, <italic>JAMA</italic>, <italic>Zo-1</italic> and <italic>Mucin-2</italic> was downregulated in the AM group compared with that in the D0 group. In contrast, the gene expression of <italic>Claudin-2</italic> was higher in the AM group that in the D0 group, which might explain why moribund hamsters had diarrhoea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>
<p>Gut microbiota-depleted hamsters exhibited reduced survival time, increased leptospiral load, and upregulated gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines compared with untreated hamsters after <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection, while FMT partially reversed these effects. Our previous study demonstrated that the leptospiral load was increased in the organs of gut microbiota-depleted mice and that gut microbiota depletion diminished the bactericidal activity of macrophages during <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). These results indicated that the homeostasis of the gut microbiota is essential for both susceptible and resistant hosts to combat <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that antibiotic treatment decreased the diversity of the gut microbiota, and FMT partially reversed these changes. Antibiotic treatment increased the relative abundance of proinflammatory bacteria, such as γ-Proteobacteria, while it reduced the relative abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria, such as <italic>Allobaculum</italic>. The alteration of the gut microbiota might skew the host to an inflammatory condition and reduce antileptospiral capacity. FMT aims to replace an unfavourable resident gut microbiota with a favourable microbiota from a healthy donor. FMT has demonstrated clear efficacy in the treatment of recurrent <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection (rCDI), inflammatory bowel disease, and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The efficiency of FMT determines the phenotypes of subjects in the infection model. Prolonging the duration of FMT might help recover the gut microbiota homeostasis and the capacity to combat anti-<italic>Leptospira</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Our study showed the translocation of Proteobacteria to the intestinal epithelium. Although no bacteria were found in the blood of the AM group, the level of LPS was increased in the PBS-treated AM group compared with that of the uninfected group, and it was decreased in the Abx-treated AM group compared with that of the PBS-treated AM group. This result indicated that gut-derived LPS was involved in severe leptospirosis. Gut dysbiosis is a primary determinant of low-grade endotoxaemia mediated by dysfunction of the intestinal barrier scaffold, which is a prerequisite for LPS translocation into the systemic circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Importantly, mice (resistant to leptospirosis) can tolerate levels of LPS endotoxin 250 higher than the level that humans can tolerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). In addition, classical gram-negative LPS had a 1000-fold higher potency than leptospiral LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Fecal filtration from the AM group and the uninfected group both increased the gene expression of <italic>TLR4</italic>, while only serum from the AM group increased the gene expression of <italic>TLR4.</italic> TLR4 expression was inhibited by PMB treatment. In severe leptospirosis, excessive immune activation is a hallmark of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that the cytokine response to heat-killed whole leptospires was not inhibited by PMB in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Leptospiral LPS has been described as atypical in terms of structure, and silver-stained electrophoretic profiles of LPS from pathogenic leptospiral strains were shown to be different from those of <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Although it is still difficult to distinguish the specific roles of gut-derived LPS and leptospiral LPS in promoting inflammation, we hypothesize that gut-derived LPS may also be an essential driver of inflammatory reactions in severe leptospirosis. In a rat cirrhosis model, gut decontamination with a 2-week course of antibiotics led to a redistributed microbiota, reduced proinflammatory activation of mucosal immune cells and diminished gut bacterial translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Another study showed that endogenous endotoxins caused a pan enteric inflammatory ileus after colonic surgery and that gut decontamination alleviated small intestinal muscularis inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Our results showed that doxycycline treatment significantly reduced the leptospiral load in the blood in severe leptospirosis; however, the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines was upregulated, which was consistent with the Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Recently, Li <italic>et al</italic>. proposed an all-in-one drug delivery strategy equipped with bactericidal, LPS neutralization, and detoxification activities to treat sepsis-associated infections and hyperinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Our study also highlighted the important role of endogenous gut-derived LPS induced by <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection. Thus, the neutralization of gut-derived LPS and antileptospiral therapy are both essential in the treatment of severe leptospirosis; thus, these strategies provide a novel avenue for the treatment of human acute leptospirosis in the future.</p>
<p>Our study has potentially important clinical implications for the care of critically ill patients with severe leptospirosis. In human infections, gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea have been frequently observed, which has been linked to an increased risk of organ dysfunction, and even death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Our findings implicate impairment of the intestinal barrier by <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection as a mechanism underlying the association between gut dysbiosis and disseminated gut-derived LPS in the ICU. More importantly, from a translational perspective, our findings suggest that the increased risk of death in severe leptospirosis can be reduced by LPS neutralization combined with anti-<italic>Leptospira</italic> therapy. In fact, gut microbiota dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients or HIV infection is also associated with microbial translocation, LPS biosynthesis, and an expansion of Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). The application of LPS antagonist therapies, whether microbial or pharmaceutical, may be a viable precision-medicine strategy to increase the survival rate of patients with severe leptospirosis or other gut-damaging infections by protecting against the spread of LPS in the bloodstream.</p>

<p>Herein, Xie and colleagues use a hamster model to show that Leptospira infection leads to gut pathology, an altered gut microbiota, and increased translocation. A combined use of antibiotics and LPS neutralization prolonged survival, providing a potential new therapeutic approach. This <bold>fundamental</bold> study uses <bold>compelling</bold> methods to provide new insights into this emerging disease, which could be dissected further in future studies aimed at gaining mechanistic insight and assessing the translational relevance of these discoveries.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Xie and colleagues aimed to explore the function and potential mechanisms of the gut microbiota in a hamster model of severe leptospirosis. The results demonstrated that Leptospira infection was able to cause intestine damage and inflammation. Leptospira infection promoted an expansion of Proteobacteria, increased gut barrier permeability, and elevated LPS levels in the serum. Thus, they proposed an LPS-neutralization therapy which improved the survival rate of moribund hamsters combined with antibody therapy or antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is well-designed and the story is interesting to me. The gut microbiota is essential for immunity and systemic health. Many life-threatening pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and other gut-damaged infection, have the potential to disrupt the gut microbiota in the later stages of infection, causing some harmful gut microbiota-derived substances to enter the bloodstream. It is emphasized that in addition to exogenous pathogenic pathogens, harmful substances of intestinal origin should also be considered in critically ill patients.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There are many serotypes of Leptospira, it is suggested to test another pathogenic serotype of Leptospira to validate the proposed therapy.</p>
<p>(2) Authors should explain why the infective doses of leptospires was not consistent in different study.</p>
<p>(3) In the discussion section, it is better to supplement the discussion of the potential link between the natural route of infection and leptospirosis.</p>
<p>(4) Line 231, what is the solvent of thioglycolate?</p>
<p>(5) Lines 962-964, there are some mistakes which are not matched to Figure 7.</p>

<p>Severe leptospirosis in humans and some mammals often meet death in the endpoint. In this article, authors explored the role of the gut microbiota in severe leptospirosis. They found that Leptospira infection promoted a dysbiotic gut microbiota with an expansion of Proteobacteria and LPS neutralization therapy synergized with antileptospiral therapy significantly improved the survival rates in severe leptospirosis. This study is well-organized and has potentially important clinical implications not only for severe leptospirosis but also for other gut-damaged infections.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a well-prepared manuscript that presented interesting research results. The only defect is that the authors should further revise the English language.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The omics method produced unbiased results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>LPS neutralization is not a new method for treating leptospiral infection.</p>
