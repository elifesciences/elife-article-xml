<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Large vesicle extrusion from neurons may contribute to spreading pathogenic protein aggregates and promoting inflammatory responses, two mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative disease. Factors that regulate extrusion of large vesicles, such as exophers produced by proteostressed <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch neurons, are poorly understood. Here we document that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons. Exopher production from the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production. Overall, genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths and genetic interventions that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths. In addition to the impact of fertilized eggs, ALMR exopher production can be enhanced by filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or even fluid, supporting that distention consequences, rather than the presence of fertilized eggs, constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus. We conclude that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons. Our observations draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms, making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In neurodegenerative disease, prions and protein aggregates can transfer among cells of the nervous system to promote pathology spread <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Determination of the factors that enhance or deter pathological transfer is therefore a central goal in the effort to clinically address neurodegenerative disease. Study of aggregate transfer in the context of the mammalian brain is a major experimental challenge as events are rare, sporadic and transiently apparent, and tissue is not easily accessible for <italic>in vivo</italic> observation. We model aggregate transfer by proteostressed ALMR touch receptor neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> in the living <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system, an experimental system that enables molecular and genetic manipulation and evaluation in physiological context, directly through the transparent cuticle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>More specifically, <italic>C. elegans</italic> adult neurons can extrude large vesicles called exophers (∼5µm, 100X larger than exosomes) that carry potentially deleterious proteins and organelles out of the neuron <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Disrupting proteostasis via diminished chaperone expression, autophagy, proteasome activity, or over-expressing aggregating proteins like human Alzheimer’s disease associated fragment A<italic>β</italic><sub>1-42</sub>, expanded polyglutamine Q128 protein, or high concentration mCherry fluorophore, increases exopher production from the affected neurons. Neurons that express proteotoxic transgenes maintain higher functionality if those neurons produce exophers as compared to those that do not, suggesting that exopher-genesis can be neuroprotective, at least in young adult neurons. Extruded exopher contents can be transferred to neighboring glial-like hypodermal cell for content degradation in the lysosomal network <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Several mammalian models feature similar biology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and thus we speculate that the basic transfer biology represents a conserved process that can be recruited for animal-wide proteostasis balance.</p>
<p>Neuronal exophers are generated only in adult animals, with an unexpected pattern of a peak at young adult days 2-3 and then later in age with more variable onset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. While using chemical regent FuDR to block progeny production for aging studies, we found that blocking reproduction strongly limited the early adult peak of exopher production. Here we report data that support that early adult exopher production is sensitive to the load of eggs in the reproductive tract. We document that uterine expansion, rather than chemical signals emanating from fertilized eggs, correlates strongly with level of exopher production and suggest a model in which mechanical signaling, normally induced across generations from egg to parent via uterine stretch, is a license for proteostressed neurons to release potentially toxic materials in large extracellular vesicles.</p>
<p>Mechanical signaling exerts a profound impact on virtually all cell types, and has been implicated in traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative disease, yet remains poorly understood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Our observations direct enhanced experimental attention to studies of how mechanical force can influence extracellular vesicle formation and aggregate transfer in living brain and in neurodegenerative disease.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The six <italic>C. elegans</italic> gentle touch receptor neurons (AVM, ALML and ALMR located in the anterior body and PVM, PLML and PLMR located in the posterior body) can be readily visualized <italic>in vivo</italic> by expression of fluorescent proteins under the control of the touch neuron-specific <italic>mec-4</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We commonly monitor exophers extruded by the ALMR neuron, which typically produces more exophers than the other touch neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, using a strain in which fluorophore mCherry is highly expressed in touch neurons and is avidly eliminated (strain ZB4065 <italic>bzIs166</italic>[P<sub><italic>mec-4</italic></sub>::mCherry], hereafter referred to as mCherryAg2 for simplicity). ALMR exopher production occurs with a distinctive temporal profile, such that at the L4 larval stage ALMR rarely, if ever, produces an exopher, but in early adult life, the frequency of exopher events increases, typically reaching a peak of 5-20% of ALMR neurons scored at adult day 2 (Ad2); exopher detection then falls to a low baseline level after Ad3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, a pattern that parallels adult reproduction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Late in life, exophers can reappear with variable frequency, but here we focus on young adult exopher generation.</p>

All animals express P<sub><italic>mec-4</italic></sub>mCherryAg2, and the <italic>glp-4(ts</italic>) mutants lack a germline when reared at the restrictive temperature (25°C). Eggs collected from both wild type and the <italic>glp-4(ts</italic>) mutants were grown at 15°C for 24 hours before being shifted to 25°C (at L1 stage) to enable development under restrictive conditions; 3 independent trials of 50 animals represented by each dot; *** <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 or * <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 in Cochran– Mantel–Haenszel test.

SPE-44 is a critical transcription factor for spermatogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and is tagged with a degron sequence that enables targeted degradation in the presence of auxin in line ZB4749. In the AID system, auxin is added to the plates in 0.25% ethanol, so “control” is treated with 0.25% ethanol and “no sperm” is treated with 1mM auxin applied to plates in 0.25% ethanol from egg to adult day 1; 4-6 independent trials of 50 animals per trial. **** <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 or *** <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 in Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test.

<p><bold>I. Summary: Genetic interventions that block major steps of germ cell development strongly block ALMR exophergenesis in the adult hermaphrodite</bold>.

<title>Sterility-inducing drug FUdR suppresses ALMR exophergenesis</title>
<p>In experiments originally designed to study exopher events in aging animals, we sought to generate age-synchronized populations by blocking progeny production from early adult stages using DNA synthesis inhibitor 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine (FUdR). Unexpectedly, we found that 51μM FUdR strongly suppressed exopher events as quantitated at Ad2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). FUdR is commonly used in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to inhibit the proliferation of germline stem cells and developing embryos, but has also been noted to impair RNA metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and improve adult proteostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. To probe which FUDR outcome might confer exopher suppression, we first addressed whether disruption of progeny production by alternative genetic means might suppress exophergenesis, which would implicate a viable germline as a factor in exopher modulation.</p>

<title>Germline elimination and germline tumors suppress ALMR exopher production</title>
<p>In the assembly line-like hermaphrodite <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad, germline stem cells close to the signaling distal tip cell (DTC) proliferate by mitosis (cartoon of <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad and germ cell development in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). As maturing germ nuclei move through the gonad away from the DTC, nuclei transition to meiosis and enter the pachytene stage in the vicinity of the gonad bend. Germline nuclei transit further through the loop region, exit pachytene, become more fully enclosed by plasma membrane, and form a que of successive maturity states of oocytes in the proximal gonad arm. The most mature oocyte is arrested at meiosis I diakinesis prior to fertilization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Somatic gonad, sperm, and oocyte signaling contribute to the maturation of the ovulated oocyte that is primed for fertilization by sperm that are generated earlier in development and stored in the spermatheca <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We disrupted germ cell production using the <italic>glp-4(bn2ts)</italic> valyl-tRNA synthetase 1 mutant. At the restrictive temperature (25°C), <italic>glp-4(bn2ts)</italic> causes germ cell arrest during the initial mitotic germ cell divisions, effectively eliminating the germline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. We constructed an mCherryAg2; <italic>glp-4(bn2ts)</italic> strain and quantitated ALMR exopher production in animals grown at the restrictive temperature, scoring exophers during early adulthood (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). ALMR neurons in the germline-less <italic>glp-4</italic> mutant produced significantly fewer exophers on Ad1-4 as compared to age- and temperature-matched controls.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Both oogenesis and spermatogenesis are critical for early adult exopher production</title>
<p>Given that lack of functional germ cells impaired neuronal exopher production, we sought to test whether oocytes or sperm might be specifically required for exophergenesis, taking advantage of <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetic reagents available for the manipulation of gamete development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Oogenesis is required for the peak of early adult exophergenesis</title>
<p>In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite, the differentiation of germline stem cells begins during the L4 larval stage with spermatogenesis, after which sperm production is shut down and oogenesis begins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Genetic mutants that produce only sperm or only oocytes have been well characterized. To test a mutant that produces sperm but no oocytes, we employed <italic>fem-3(q20ts)</italic>, a temperature sensitive gain-of-function mutant that causes germ cells to exclusively differentiate into sperm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. We constructed an mCherryAg2; <italic>fem-3(q20ts)</italic> line, reared animals at non-permissive temperature 25°C, and scored ALMR exophers in mutant and control worms during early adulthood. In the sperm-only, oocyte-deficient <italic>fem-3(q20ts)</italic> background, we recorded no exophers over the first five days of adulthood (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). We infer that oocytes must be present for early adult ALMR exopher production and conclude that sperm alone are not sufficient to drive exopher elevation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Spermatogenesis is required for the peak of early adult exophergenesis</title>
<p>To assess neuronal exopher production in the reciprocal reproductive configuration in which animals have oocytes but no sperm, we disrupted spermatogenesis using two approaches. First, we used a temperature sensitive <italic>fem-1</italic> mutation to produce animals with oocytes but no sperm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We crossed <italic>fem-1(fc17ts)</italic> into the mCherryAg2 strain and examined exopher production from ALMR neurons in hermaphrodites at the restrictive temperature of 25°C. We found that ALMR exopher production in <italic>fem-1(fc17)</italic> mutants was suppressed at 25°C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, we used the auxin-inducible degron system (AID <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>) to degrade SPE-44, an essential protein required for spermatid differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In the AID system, addition of auxin to the culture induces rapid degradation of proteins genetically tagged with a specific auxin-dependent degron sequence.

<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic> fertilization, as the mature oocyte encounters the sperm-filled spermatheca, a single sperm enters the mature ovulated oocyte (fertilization time 0), triggering the rapid events of egg activation, which include polyspermy block, eggshell formation, completion of meiotic divisions and extrusion of polar bodies. The multi-step eggshell formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) is completed within 5 minutes of sperm entry, by which time the zygote has been passed into the uterus, where the maternal chromosomes execute both meiotic divisions (meiosis accomplished by ∼20 minutes after fertilization). After establishment of egg polarity cues, the first mitotic cell division occurs ∼40 minutes after fertilization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Eggs are held in the mother’s uterus until they are laid at the ∼30 cell stage (gastrulation).

Our data support a fertilization requirement for neuronal exopher stimulation and suggest that the exophergenesis signal/condition that promotes the early adult wave of exophergenesis is associated with the very earlest stages of embryonic development. Of note, disruption of eggshell biosynthesis has the immediate downstream consequence of disruption of early polarity establishment and first divisions, such that genetic separation of eggshell production from first division proficiency is not possible (<italic>pod-1</italic> and <italic>emb-8</italic> have been reported to also have eggshell deficits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>).

<title>Restoring fertilized eggs later in life can extend ALMR exophergenesis</title>
<p>Having found that fertilized eggs are necessary for the early adult elevation in exopher production, we asked whether the presence of eggs is sufficient for stimulation of exopher production by introducing fertilized eggs later in adult life when they are not normally present. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, sperm are made in the L4 stage and are stored in the spermatheca to fertilize oocytes that mature in the adult. Sperm are limiting for hermaphrodite self-fertilization, with more oocytes made than can be fertilized by self-derived sperm. Unmated hermaphrodites thus cease egg laying around adult day 4 because they run out of self-supplied sperm. However, if males mate with hermaphrodites, increased progeny numbers can be produced due to increased sperm availability. More germane to our experiment, if males are mated to the reproductively senescing hermaphrodite to replenish sperm, hermaphrodites can produce fertilized eggs for a few additional days (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine if the presence of eggs might be sufficient to drive exopher production after Ad3, we mated males to Ad3 reproductively senescing hermaphrodites. We found that restored egg production is associated with increased and extended exopher production, provided that hermaphrodites were mated to fertilization-proficient males (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). We conclude that adult ALMR exophergenesis is driven by the presence of fertilized eggs and that the older age decrease in exopher production (∼Ad4) under standard culture conditions is more likely attributed to the lack of fertilized egg accumulation at this lifestage, rather than to the existence of a chronological limit on the biochemical capacity to elevate exopher levels at older ages.</p>

<title>Genetically induced egg retention elevates ALMR exopher production</title>
<p>Fertilized eggs might release a signal or create a condition that stimulates exophergenesis. If such an influence was limiting, increasing the egg concentration in the body might increase exopher numbers. To address whether elevating the young adult egg load can increase exophers, we took multiple distinctly-acting genetic approaches to limit egg laying and promote egg retention in the body (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). We tested four genetic conditions that lower or block egg-laying: a null mutation of prolyl hydroxylase <italic>egl-9</italic>, for which disruption induces a mild egg laying defect <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>; a null allele of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 2 <italic>egl-3</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> that perturbs neuropeptide processing and confers a severe egg-laying defective phenotype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>; a reduction-of-function mutation in SOX transcription factor <italic>sem-2(n1343)</italic> that eliminates production of the sex myoblasts needed to generate egg laying muscle; and RNAi directed against the <italic>lin-39</italic> homeobox transcription factor HOXA5 ortholog required for vulval cell fate specification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We found that the associated massive egg retention correlated with a dramatic elevation of exopher numbers for each genetic impediment to egg laying (<italic>egl-9</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>); <italic>egl-3</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>); <italic>sem-2</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), <italic>lin-39</italic>(RNAi) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>)). For example, ∼80% of the <italic>sem-2(rf)</italic> mutants produced ALMR exophers on Ad1, compared to only ∼6% of WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).

<title>Hyperactive egg-laying and consequent low egg retention is associated with low exopher production</title>
<p>Neurotransmitters octopamine (OA) and serotonin (5-HT) have been well documented to play opposite roles in <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Feeding <italic>C. elegans</italic> octopamine strongly suppresses egg-laying to induce egg retention, while supplementing with 5-HT causes hyperactive egg-laying <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Consistent with outcomes in animals physically blocked for egg-laying, treatment with egg retention-promoting OA enhanced ALMR exophergenesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the outcome of 5-HT-induced enhanced egg laying, we measured the impact of 5-HT consequent to 6 hour food withdrawal, a condition that we previously found markedly enhances ALMR exophergenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, and therefore is expected to increase the dynamic range for scoring exopher suppression. We find that 5-HT treatment, which lowers egg retention, strongly suppresses fasting-associated ALMR exophergenesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). Although perturbing neuronal signaling holds complex consequences for whole-animal physiology, our findings are consistent with a model in which high egg load increases neuronal exophergenesis, and low egg retention decreases exophergenesis.</p>
<p>The egg laying circuit is controlled in part by Go<italic>α</italic> inhibition--null allele <italic>goa-1(n1134)</italic> removes this inhibition such that eggs are often laid at very early developmental stages (2-4 cell stage) rather than being retained in the uterus until gastrulation (∼30 cell stage) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. We introduced <italic>goa-1(n1134)</italic> into the mCherryAg2 background and scored ALMR exopher events at Ad2.

<p>In sum, manipulation of uterine egg occupancy is strongly correlated with the extent of ALMR neuronal exophergenesis—high egg retention promotes high exophergenesis and low egg retention is associated with exophergenesis block.</p>

<p>To ask if proximity to the gonad is correlated with exopher production, we randomly selected 128 Ad2 hermaphrodites that expressed mCherry in the touch receptor neurons, imaged in brightfield to visualize the egg zone of each animal, and imaged again in the red channel to visualize the touch neuron, recording the relative positions of ALMR and the egg zone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). We also assessed whether the ALMR neuron had produced an exopher or not.</p>
<p>We found that 37/128 ALMRs examined had produced an exopher (Exopher+), and that 36/37 (95%) of the ALMR neuronal somas that had produced exophers were positioned within the visualized egg zone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). For the ALMRs that had not produced exophers, fewer (63/91; 70%) ALMR neurons were located in the egg zone (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 in Chi-Square test, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), a first indication that proximity of ALMR to eggs is associated with higher exopher frequency.</p>
<p>To further test for association of egg zone proximity to ALMR and exopher production, we genetically shifted ALM position. During development, the ALM neurons migrate posteriorly to near the mid-body <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and most commonly, ALM somas are situated posterior to AVM. ALM soma positions, however, can be influenced by migration and specification cues. In particular, transgenic introduction of a <italic>mec-3</italic> promoter fragment bearing an internal deletion (fusion of the -1 to -563 sequences to the -1898 to - 2372 <italic>mec-3</italic> promoter fragment, plasmid pJC4) can induce anterior ALM migration during development, sometimes resulting in final ALM positions anterior to AVM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). We took advantage of the partially deleted <italic>mec-3</italic> promotor sequences in pJC4 to manipulate ALM position. In these studies we introduced pJC4 with the co-transformation marker pRF4 (<italic>rol-6(su1006))</italic> that disrupts the cuticle to induce rolling of transgenic animals into the P<sub><italic>mec-4</italic></sub>::mCherry background. Rol hermaphrodites have a strikingly high baseline of ALMR exophergenesis (∼71% exophers in rollers vs. ∼20% in the wild type) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Strikingly, we found that when ALMs are situated anterior to AVM, ALMR exophergenesis drops to ∼5% (4/73) vs. 71% for posterior position (55/78) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Although we cannot exclude that physiological changes in differently-positioned touch neurons underlie reduced exophergenesis, data are consistent with a model in which proximity to the egg zone correlates with exophergenesis.</p>
<p>Another way to increase egg proximity to ALMR is to disrupt egg laying capacity, which confers egg retention and uterine expansion. We hypothesized that in the <italic>sem-2(rf)</italic> mutant, which is associated with considerable internal egg accumulation, additional touch neurons should experience increased proximity to eggs in the blocked uterus. Indeed, we find that in the <italic>sem-2(rf)</italic> background, every touch neuron that is positioned in the general region of the expanded uterus (ALML, AVM, PVM) increases exopher production, but the posterior PLM neurons, which cannot be approached by the gonad, do not produce exophers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Thus, touch neurons can be stimulated to produce exophers if the egg domain is artificially brought closer to them. Data are consistent with a model in which ALMR normally makes most exophers because of its closest natural positioning near the egg-filled uterus. Possibilities are that a diffusible signal may eminate from the filled uterus or that mechanical pressure associated with a filled uterus might signal enhanced exophergenesis.</p>

<title>Uterine expansion associated with high egg load correlates with high exophergenesis</title>
<p>How might the presence of eggs signal to the maternal neurons to induce exophers? We consider two main possibilities: 1) eggs filling the uterus might exert physical pressure that activates essential stretch-signaling for young adult neuronal exopher release. This mechanical stretch signal might act directly (for example introducing chronic and/or dynamic pressure on the touch neurons), or indirectly (possibly inducing the stretched uterus/somatic gonad to release chemical signals that promote neuronal exopher formation); 2) early fertilized eggs might release a short-range chemical signal that contributes to young adult proteostasis reorganization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> to promote exophergenesis.</p>
<p>To begin to dissect the role of egg pressure in promoting exophergenesis, we analysed the physical relationships of neurons, eggs and uterine shape. Eggs can readily be observed to distort tissue structure in young adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>. For example, in a strain that expresses GFP to label the hypodermis and expresses mCherry to label the touch neurons, the distortion of the hypodermis by eggs can be easily visualized as dark non-fluorescent eggs project through the observation plane of the hypodermis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Thus, the uterus can approach and pressure surrounding tissue, including touch neurons.</p>

<title>Forced uterine expansion via oocyte accumulation can elevate exopher levels</title>
<p>Although uterine retention of malformed inviable embryos is sufficient to elevate neuronal exophers when egg laying is blocked, the defective <italic>cbd-1</italic> embryos or debris might still release egg-associated chemical signals. To test for a requirement of any fertilization-dependent egg signals in the egg-laying compromised mutants, we asked whether uterine filling with only oocytes can suffice to promote neuronal exopher elevation. Unfertilized oocytes cannot initiate embryonic development or egg-shell biosynthesis; nor can oocytes elevate ALMR exophergenesis in hermaphrodites that are proficient at egg-laying (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G&amp;H</xref>).</p>
<p>We tested two distinct uterine retention conditions-<italic>-sem-2(rf)</italic> and <italic>lin-39(RNAi</italic>)--in which we used the auxin inducible degron system to disrupt sperm maturation such that only oocytes filled the gonad. For both genetic retention strategies, we found that build-up of retained oocytes in egg-laying blocked animals was sufficient to elevate exophers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C&amp;E</xref>) and expand the uterus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D&amp;F</xref>). Strikingly, ALMR exophergenesis can occur in approximately 80% (129/150) ALMR upon oocyte retention in the <italic>sem-2(rf)</italic> mutant, which is comparable to the fertilization-proficient, but egg retaining <italic>sem-2(rf)</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).

<title>Lack of a functional egg-laying apparatus does not induce exopher elevation when the uterus is not filled</title>
<p>The above-described experiments left open the possibility that the lack of a functional egg-laying apparatus itself might be causative in the elevation of exopher production.

<p><bold>F. Summary</bold>. Eggs, dead egg accumulation, oocyte accumulation, or injection pressure all lead to ALMR exophergenesis. These varied interventions have a similar impact on the uterus, which is the uterine distortion by mechanical forces. We propose that early adult ALMR exophergenesis requires mechanical or stretch-assocated force generated by the uterine cargos.</p></caption>

<p>We picked the L4 stage vulva-less (<italic>lin-39(RNAi)</italic>) + sperm-less (SPE-44 AID) hermaphrodites for age synchronization (20°C, grown for 12 hours after L4 selection) and then injected dye containing M9 buffer into the uteri of these very young adult day 1 hermaphrodites, scoring for exopher production 10 minutes after the injection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>Control animals (mock injected animals that were stabbed without fluid delivery) exhibited no ALMR exophers. By contrast, we found that when we held injection pressure continuous for 2 or more minutes, ∼20% of the ALMs scored exhibited an exopher event shortly after injection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C&amp;D</xref>). Injection experiments using animals with functional vulvae (in which injected material is rapidly extruded through the vulval opening) failed to induce ALMR exophers (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>), supporting that ALMR exophergenesis caused by 2-minute injection of dye-containing M9 is due to the physical distortion of gonad rather than the chemical impact of the dye-containing M9.</p>
<p>In sum, exopher induction by uterine accumulation of eggs, malformed eggs, dead embryos, oocytes, or fluid-induced expansion support a model in which early adult ALMR exophergenesis is elevated by physical distortion of the uterus that occurs with reproduction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Exopher production by proteo-stressed <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch neurons occurs with a striking temporal pattern that features a puzzling early adult peak of exophergenesis coincident with the period of maximal egg production. Here we report that the early exophergenesis peak is dependent on uterine occupation, which normally is conferred by fertilized egg accumulation prior to the deposition of eggs. Uterine expansion that is associated with the filling of a blocked uterus with unfertilized oocytes or by fluid alone can also induce high neuronal exopher production, supporting a model in which the physical distention associated with uterine occupancy, rather than chemical signals derived from fertilized eggs <italic>per se</italic>, is a required component of the signaling relay between reproduction and young adult neuronal debris elimination. Trans-tissue cross talk to the maternal nervous system thus appears accomplished via mechanical force transduction. Our findings hold implications for mechano-biology in neuronal proteostasis management.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>The mechanical landscape of reproduction that influences neuronal exophergenesis</title>
<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> reproduction features physical expansion and contraction of multiple tissue/cell types. The gonad houses the expanding germline, the spermatheca expands and retracts vigorously as each mature oocyte enters and exits. The uterus also stretches to house eggs and can contract locally as eggs transit or are expelled via action of the vulval and uterine muscles. The filled reproductive apparatus can thus clearly exert both constitutive and sporadic pressure on surrounding tissues as it enacts its essential functions.</p>
<p>What is the source of the force that promotes exopher production? Elegant work on the egg laying circuit (comprising the somatic gonad, the HSN and VC neurons, and the vulval and uterine muscle) has provided evidence for mechanical signaling within the egg laying circuit that regulates initiation, promotion and termination of egg laying <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Working backward, exopher-promoting force seems unlikely to derive from the vulva or vulval muscle contractions, since when these cells are genetically disrupted in <italic>lin-39(RNAi</italic>) or in <italic>sem-2</italic> mutants, high levels of exophers still are generated. Changes in spermatheca volume, which expands and contracts dramatically as mature oocytes enter via valve opening/closure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, might be sensed, but spermatheca contractions are reported to be normal in hyperactive egg laying <italic>goa-1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, which is an exopher-suppressing background. Under no-sperm conditions, oocyte transit rates are lower than for fertilized eggs, and sperm-derived signals influence spermathecal valve opening <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, but if the egg laying apparatus is genetically compromised and oocytes accumulate in the absence of sperm, exopher levels are high, suggesting deficits in spermatheca operations or sperm signals <italic>per se</italic> do not drive exophergenesis. Given that, under normal reproductive conditions of egg-laying proficiency, correctly shelled eggs are required for the early peak in exopher production, a plausible hypothesis was that fertilized eggs might produce an essential diffusible factor that stimulates neuronal exopher-genesis. However, exophers can be produced abundantly in the absence of fertilized eggs when the vulva is unable to open and release uterine contents, resulting in uterine distention due to debris filling. Thus, the simplest model we envision for the reproductive cues that influence maternal neuronal exophergenesis is that a filled uterus (under normal conditions the consequence of hard-shelled eggs that occupy it) is sensed and required for the early adult peak in exopher production.</p>

<title>How might force be sensed and transduced?</title>
<p>Mechanotransduction is the sensing of a mechanical signal, such as pressure or stretch, and conversion into a cellular response. Members of several ion channel families have been implicated in sensing of touch, hearing, shear stress, and pressure, including Piezo, TRP, and DEG/ENaC families <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. These are rational candidates for mechanosensors in neurons, the uterus, or other cells that might act in a relay between the uterus and neuron. At the same time, classic mechanosensory channels have extremely rapid gating and might not be the best suited candidates for acting in the sustained and locally dynamic forces anticipated for the reproductive uterine environment.</p>
<p>Adhesion G-Protein Coupled Receptors, which have extracellular adhesion motifs and 7 transmembrane domains characteristic of the GPCR class (<italic>lat-1, lat-2, cdh-6</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>), or components of the YAP/TAZ transcriptional program <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> may integrate responses to forces transmitted via the cytoskeleton and could be considered as potential players in the required signaling. Determination of the identity of mechanotransducers and assignment of site of action to the neuron, the uterus, or an intermediate relay cell type remains for future studies. Modeling will also need to incorporate the fact that fluid injections, which required 2 minute long sustained application of the filling stimulus to induce exophers, could provoke exopher production on a rapid timeframe, typically recorded only 10 minutes after injection period. Thus the proteostressed touch neurons appear poised to eliminate contents upon mechanical stimulation.</p>

<title>Mechanical signaling in reproduction across species</title>
<p>Uterine stretch may be a more prevalent mechanism for inducing maternal nervous system response than currently appreciated. Distention of the female fly reproductive tract by egg passage through the tract (normal biology) or by artificial means (experimental fluid injection) can induce behavioral attraction of the mother to acetic acid, thought to signal a favorable food environment for offspring <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. In this case, DEG/ENaC channel family member PPK1 expressed in a subset of mechanosensitve neurons that tile the tract and respond to contraction/distention of the tract is required. The pathway to the behavioral change remains to be determined. Uterine stretch in mammals has also be reported influence maternal behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Why link exophers to reproduction?</title>
<p>Turek et al. report that exophers produced by <italic>C. elegans</italic> muscle cells follow a similar time course of highest production at adult day 2, and demonstrated a dependence of the temporal muscle exophergenesis pattern on eggs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> (muscle exophers may be released to supply nutrients to developing progeny). Together with our observations, data raise the possibility that the onset of reproduction and the initial filling of the uterus triggers, or generates a ‘license” for EV/exopher production across tissues. In the case of stressed touch receptor neurons that have been our focus, evidence suggests that deleterious protein aggregates and/or excess proteins and organelles are handed off to neighboring glial-like hypodermal cells for degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Clearing the nervous system (and other organs) for optimal function might confer a selective advantage for successful maternal reproduction.</p>
<p>In this regard it is fascinating that the peak exopher production period is coincident with a proteostasis reconfiguration that has been well documented to accompany reproduction onset in young adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In brief, during larval development <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits high activity of HSF-1 and consequently HSF-1-dependent chaperone expression, but HSF-1 activity is turned down in adult life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. At the same time in early adult life, proteasome activity is relatively enhanced (at least as measured in the hypodermis) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. These measures may reflect a general proteostasis reorganization (chaperone activity, proteosome activity) that occurs in early adult life in response to reproduction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Our observations on neuronal exophers suggests that exopher-mediated content elimination may constitute another co-regulated branch of this proteostasis reconfiguration. Importantly, the HSF-1 turn-down in young adult life is blocked by <italic>cbd-1(RNAi)</italic> (and additional early eggshell/development gene RNAi) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Thus the presence of eggs can signal across tissues to turn-down <italic>hsf-1</italic> proteostasis-related activities in the mother. We speculate that this young adult reconfiguration of proteostasis might reflect a mechanism to optimize successful reproduction, possibly both fine tuning nervous system function and shifting resources balance to favor progeny as suggested by the disposable soma theory of aging proposed by Kirkwood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Of note, we do not observe exophers in larval stages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. We speculate that young adult physiology might be temporally tweaked such that some tissues have optimized capacity to manage/degrade large aggregates and organelles at an early adult developmental “clean up” time, possibly analogous to how a town service for large garbage pick-up might be limited to particular times during the year. As exopher production appears generally beneficial for neuronal function and survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>, the early life extrusion phase appears a positive feature of reproductive life. More broadly, proteome “clean up” phases may be programmed as key steps at specific transitions during development and homeostasis, for example, as occurs in the temporal lysosome activation that clears aggregate debris in <italic>C. elegans</italic> maturing oocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> or in the maturation of adult neuronal stem cells via vimentin-dependent proteaseome activity during quiescence exit in the mouse <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Across species, production of exopher-like vesicles may also be enhanced by mechanical signals anchored outside of reproduction. For example, mice cardiomyocytes that are constantly under mechanical stress due to the contraction activities produce exopher-like vesicles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Mouse kidney proximal tubular epithelia cells (PTEC) under constant mechanical stress due to both fluid shear stresses and absorption-associated osmotic pressure, also release exopher-like vesicles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Large vesicle extrusion, mechanobiology and neurodegenerative disease</title>
<p>The impact of mechanical force on <italic>in vivo</italic> production of extracellular vesicles has not been a major focus of the EV field, although a range of studies have considered force consequences (such as fluid shear responses, stretch) in cultured cells. Overall, however, EV biogenesis and uptake appear to be markedly influenced by biomechanical force type, magnitude, and duration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. At the same time, the neurodegeneration field has generated myriad studies linking Alzheimer’s disease susceptibility and AD pathology signatures such as extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β protein and/or intracellular accumulation of tau as outcomes of mechanical stress-based stimuli such as traumatic brain injury, arterial hypertension, and normal pressure hydrocephalus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. Mechanical stress may trigger or promote protein misfolding, aggregation, and extrusion.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study explores the potential influence of physiologically relevant mechanical forces on the extrusion of vesicles from C. elegans neurons. The authors provide <bold>compelling</bold> evidence to support the idea that uterine distension can induce vesicular extrusion from adjacent neurons. The work would be strengthened by using an additional construct (preferably single-copy) to demonstrate that the observed phenotypes are not unique to a single transgenic reporter. Overall, this work will be of interest to neuroscientists and investigators in the extracellular vesicle and proteostasis fields.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors sought to understand the stage-dependent regulation of exophergenesis, a process thought to contribute to promoting neuronal proteostasis in C. elegans. Focusing on the ALMR neuron, they show that the frequency of exopher production correlates with the timing of reproduction. Using many genetic tools, they dissect the requirements of this pathway to eventually find that occupancy of the uterus acts as a signal to induce exophergenesis. Interestingly, the physical proximity of neurons to the egg zone correlates with exophergenesis frequency. The authors conclude that communication between the uterus and proximal neurons occurs through the sensing of mechanic forces of expansion normally provided by egg occupancy to coordinate exophergenesis with reproduction.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The genetic data presented is thorough and solid, and the observation is novel.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The main weakness of the study is that the detection of exophers is based on the overexpression of a fluorescent protein in touch neurons, and it is not clear whether this process is actually stimulated in wild-type animals, or if neurons have accumulated damaged proteins in relatively young day 2 animals.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This paper reports that mechanical stress from egg accumulation is a biological stimulus that drives the formation of extruded vesicles from the neurons of C. elegans ALMR touch neurons. Using powerful genetic experiments only readily available in the C. elegans system, the authors manipulate oocyte production, fertilization, embryo accumulation, and egg-laying behavior, providing convincing evidence that exopher production is driven by stretch-dependent feedback of fertilized, intact eggs in the adult uterus. Shifting the timing of egg production and egg laying alters the onset of observed exophers. Pharmacological manipulation of egg laying has the predicted effects, with animals retaining fewer eggs having fewer exophers and animals with increased egg accumulation having more. The authors show that egg production and accumulation have dramatic consequences for the viscera, and moving the ALMR process away from eggs prevents the formation of exophers. This effect is not unique to ALMR but is also observed in other touch neurons, with a clear bias toward neurons whose cell bodies are adjacent to the filled uterus. Embryos lacking an intact eggshell with reduced rigidity have impaired exopher production. Acute injection into the uterus to mimic the stretch that accompanies egg production causes a similar induction of exopher release. Together these results are consistent with a model where stretch caused by fertilized embryo accumulation, and not chemical signals from the eggs themselves or egg release, underlies ALMR exopher production seen in adult animals.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Overall, the experiments are very convincing, using a battery of RNAi and mutant approaches to distinguish direct from indirect effects. Indeed, these experiments provide a model generally for how one would methodically test different models for exopher production. The paper is well-written and easy to understand. I had been skeptical of the origin and purpose of exophers, concerned they were an artefact of imaging conditions, caused by deranged calcium activity under stressful conditions, or as evidence for impaired animal health overall. As this study addresses how and when they form in the animal using otherwise physiologically meaningful manipulations, the stage is now set to address at a cellular level how exophers like these are made and what their functions are.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Not many. The experiments are about as good as could be done. Some of the n's on the more difficult-to-work strains or experiments are comparatively low, but this is not a significant concern because of the number of different, complementary approaches used. The microinjection experiment in Figure 7 is very interesting, there are missing details that would confirm whether this is a sound experiment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this paper, the authors use the C. elegans system to explore how already-stressed neurons respond to additional mechanical stress. Exophers are large extracellular vesicles secreted by cells, which can contain protein aggregates and organelles. These can be a way of getting rid of cellular debris, but as they are endocytosed by other cells can also pass protein, lipid, and RNA to recipient cells. The authors find that when the uterus fills with eggs or otherwise expands, a nearby neuron (ALMR) is far more likely to secrete exophers. This paper highlights the importance of the mechanical environment in the behavior of neurons and may be relevant to the response of neurons exposed to traumatic injury.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The paper has a logical flow and a compelling narrative supported by crisp and clear figures.</p>
<p>The evidence that egg accumulation leads to exopher production is strong. The authors use a variety of genetic and pharmacological methods to show that increasing pressure leads to more exopher production, and reducing pressure leads to lower exopher production. For example, egg-laying defective animals, which retain eggs in the uterus, produce many more exophers, and hyperactive egg-laying is accompanied by low exopher production. The authors even inject fluid into the uterus and observe the production of exophers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The main weakness of the paper is that it does not explore the molecular mechanism by which the mechanical signals are received or responded to by the neuron, but this could easily be the subject of a follow-up study.</p>
<p>I was intrigued by this paper, and have many questions. I list a few below, which could be addressed in this paper or which could be the subject of follow-up studies.</p>
<p>- Why do such a low percentage of ALMR neurons produce exophers (5-20%)? Does it have to do with the variability of the proteostress?</p>
<p>
- Why does the production of exophers lag the peak in progeny production by 24-48 hours? Especially when the injection method produces exophers right away?</p>
<p>
- As mentioned in the discussion, it would be interesting to know if PEZO-1/PIEZO is required for uterine stretching to activate exophergenesis. pezo-1 animals accumulate crushed oocytes in the uterus.</p>
