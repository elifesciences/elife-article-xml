<title>Abstract</title><p>Spatial and temporal associations between sympatric species underpin biotic interactions, structure ecological assemblages, and sustain ecosystem functioning and stability. However, the resilience of interspecific spatiotemporal associations to human activity remains poorly understood, particularly in mountain forests where anthropogenic impacts are often pervasive. Here we applied context-dependent Joint Species Distribution Models to a systematic camera-trap survey dataset from a global biodiversity hotspot in eastern Himalaya to understand how prominent human activities in mountain forests influence species associations within terrestrial mammal communities. We obtained 10,388 independent detections of 17 focal species (12 carnivores and five ungulates) from 322 stations over 43,163 camera days of effort. We identified a higher incidence of positive associations in habitats with higher levels of human modification (87 %) and human presence (83 %) compared to those located in habitats with lower human modification (64 %) and human presence (65 %) levels. We also detected a significant reduction of pairwise encounter time at increasing levels of human disturbance, corresponding to more frequent encounters between pairs of species. Our findings indicate that human activities can push mammals together into more frequent encounters and associations, which likely influences the coexistence and persistence of wildlife, with potential far-ranging ecological consequences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pervasive human activities can disrupt invisible facets of biodiversity such as species associations, with potential cascading ecosystem effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Naeem et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Parsons et al., 2022</xref>). Human encroachment into natural ecosystems squeezes the spatiotemporal niches of wildlife species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gilbert et al., 2022</xref>), altering the number and magnitude of associations in a community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Burkle et al., 2013</xref>), and accelerating species decline and loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jones et al., 2018</xref>). Humans play a role as ‘super predators’ in shaping the co-occurrence of other species with complicated indirect modifications to multiple interactions between organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gilbert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Moll et al., 2021</xref>). Human disturbance, such as chronic landscape modification and acute direct human presence, may significantly alter spatiotemporal distribution of species and fundamentally change the way that species interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sévêque et al., 2020</xref>). For example, expanding human footprints have compressed the space and time available for mammals to share by restricting animal movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tucker et al., 2018</xref>) and increasing wildlife nocturnality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gaynor et al., 2018</xref>). As human and animal activities increasingly overlap in time and space, it is important to assess and quantify the potential for human-induced changes in species association to ecosystem structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Penjor et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Species are not distributed independently of each other; rather, they co-occur in time and space and interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tilman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wisz et al., 2013</xref>). The spatiotemporal co-occurrence of species, termed interspecific associations, provides unique ecological information and has important consequence for ecosystem integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gorczynski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Keil et al., 2021</xref>). However, segregated species co-occurrence could be generated by processes such as negative interspecific interaction, distinct environment requirements, and dispersal limitations; similarly, aggregated species pairs may reflect positive interspecific interaction but could also reflect shared environmental preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Song et al., 2020</xref>). Although interspecific co-occurrence or avoidance cannot be used to directly estimate species interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Blanchet et al., 2020</xref>), animals cannot interact if their spatiotemporal niches do not overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gilbert et al., 2022</xref>) and strong interactions should be expected to lead to significant associations. Thus, interspecific associations convey key information about interactions between sympatric species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boron et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Disruptions to the spatiotemporal relationships of species can result in serious ecological consequences including alteration of community structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tulloch et al., 2018</xref>), upsetting the competitive balance between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boron et al., 2023</xref>), increasing disease transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hassell et al., 2017</xref>), and accelerating local extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fidino et al., 2019</xref>). This can significantly distort the distribution of ecological functions that species provide, ultimately influencing ecosystem dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gardner et al., 2019</xref>). Taken as a whole, interactions between sympatric species play a fundamental role in community assembly and are intricately related to ecosystem stability and resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boron et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, understanding how interspecific spatiotemporal associations change across human disturbance gradients provides valuable insight into the long-term implications of human impacts on ecosystem function and recovery relevant to biodiversity conservation in the Anthropocene.</p>
<p>Species interactions are known to be context-dependent such that they can vary across space and time, for example along environmental gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chamberlain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Davis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pellissier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Perrin et al., 2022</xref>). For example, gradients in stress are associated with variation in the outcomes of pairwise species interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chamberlain et al., 2014</xref>). A key challenge in community ecology is to identify the conditions under which negative and positive species interactions are more likely to occur. For example, the controversial stress-gradient hypothesis predicts that positive interactions should increase as environmental conditions become more severe. Alpine bird communities have been shown to have a higher frequency of positive associations in grasslands with low productivity compared with in forests with high productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">García-Navas et al., 2021</xref>) and savanah ungulates are more likely to form mixed-species groups in areas where there is predation risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Beaudrot et al., 2020</xref>). Increasingly, major stresses on wild communities derive from human activity, and understanding how species interactions vary in response to human disturbance is pivotal in making robust ecological predictions about biodiversity responses to changing environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dangles et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Perrin et al., 2022</xref>). However, a review of the literature indicates that the impact of human activity on interspecific interactions of terrestrial mammals remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boron et al., 2023</xref>), particularly in mountain forests where anthropogenic impacts are often pervasive and increasing.</p>
<p>Medium and large-sized terrestrial mammals are a key components of mountain forest communities. They play crucial roles in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lacher et al., 2019</xref>), and are especially vulnerable to anthropogenic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al., 2022b</xref>). Here, we set out to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of occurrence and the interspecific associations within a terrestrial mammalian community along human disturbance gradients. We executed a systematic camera trapping survey spanning 4,100 km<sup>2</sup> of the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon National Nature Reserve in the eastern Himalayas at a total of 322 camera trapping stations, obtaining detections of both wildlife and humans. We classified human disturbances into two groups: human modification (i.e. relating to habitat modifications by humans) or human presence (i.e. referring to the direct presence of humans) disturbances. We employed a context-dependent joint species distribution model (JSDM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tikhonov et al., 2017</xref>) to infer pairwise species associations along human disturbance gradients. We used kernel density distributions of animal diel activity and time between detections of species pairs (time-to-encounter) to compare temporal associations at low and high human disturbances. We consider two hypotheses regarding temporal and spatial interspecific associations. The spatial compress hypothesis posits that human modification on habitats would suppress space available for animals to share (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tilman et al., 2017</xref>), resulting in increased positive spatial associations between species. The temporal compress hypothesis postulates that fear of direct human presence would compress diurnal activity in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gaynor et al., 2018</xref>), resulting in reduced encounter time (or increased encounter rate) between species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Our study incorporates two different types of human disturbances in the analysis to elucidate the effects of humans on multidimensional (i.e., space and time) species associations. We then consider implications for conservation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite accumulating evidence of widespread impacts of humans on wildlife distribution and activity patterns, our understanding of how different types of anthropogenic pressures reshape species associations remains limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Van Scoyoc et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we compared the impacts of human modification (spatial compress effects) and human presence (temporal compress effects) on spatiotemporal associations among threatened terrestrial mammals based on systematic camera-trapping data in an understudied Himalayan landscape. Our results show a strong influence of humans on species co-occurrence patterns. The overall results of the spatiotemporal associations across levels of human modification and human presence suggest that humans are associated with increasing positive spatiotemporal associations among species. Specifically, we detected a higher incidence of positive associations in habitats with moderate and higher levels of human modification and human presence compared to those located in habitats with lower disturbance levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). On the temporal axis, we detected a significant reduction of pairwise encounter time at increasing levels of human disturbance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Our results are therefore demonstrate that human disturbance can upset interspecific associations both on spatial and temporal niche dimensions.</p>
<p>Interspecific spatial associations can arise from species interaction, response to environmental covariates and common dispersal barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Blanchet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">de Jonge et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Poggiato et al., 2021</xref>). Our context-dependent JSDM, which accounts for similarities and disparities in species-specific response to habitat covariates considered relevant to medium- and large-bodied mammal species, detected a higher prevalence of interspecific spatial associations in human disturbed habitats. Humans can have “bottom-up” impacts on animal distribution and associations by land use change and habitat modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Riggio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tucker et al., 2018</xref>). Human activities can also have top-down impacts on spatiotemporal associations among animals by directly or indirectly changing the landscape of fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Palmer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Suraci et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies suggest that human disturbance may compress the space and time available for communities to use, resulting in increased frequency of positive associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gilbert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sévêque et al., 2022</xref>). We interpret our results to mean that anthropogenic presence and disturbance reduce available habitats for wildlife, causing a greater predominance of positive associations in anthropogenic landscapes. On the one hand, human presence, such as while grazing livestock and gathering resource, generates landscapes of fear for wildlife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gaynor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Palmer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Suraci et al., 2019</xref>) and may downgrade habitat quality by overexploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Filazzola et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, human modification such as land-use change often constrains the realized niche space of wildlife, restricting animal movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tucker et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, our study provides one of the first tests of whether positive spatiotemporal associations between terrestrial mammals increase along gradients of different types of anthropogenic pressures. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that suggests anthropogenic activities reduce available niche space for animals, causing observed positive spatial associations among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gilbert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gorczynski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Murphy et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Identifying thresholds of anthropogenic activity that shift species behavior and co-occurrence will be key to drawing useful inference from human impact studies and improving our knowledge on when altered associations may lead to reverberating impacts on ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Van Scoyoc et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wilson et al., 2020</xref>). We note that the number of species pairs with significant positive associations rapidly increased from lower to moderate levels of human disturbance, but dropped from mean to higher level of human disturbance (Figure 3—figure supplement 1-3 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1-3). Such patterns are consistent across human modification and human presence levels, indicating a threshold after which the positive effects of human disturbance on species associations were dampened. Human disturbance is an important factor in shaping species distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jones et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Samia et al., 2015</xref>). Wildlife often has a limited tolerance threshold to human activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Polaina et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Samia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). When human pressures reach levels that preclude a species occurring at a site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Polaina et al., 2018</xref>), prediction of species associations in an anthropogenic context may become uninformative. More work needs to be done to further clarify the mechanisms driving the observed co-occurrence patterns.</p>
<p>Anthropogenic activities can also shift temporal niche of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gaynor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2022a</xref>), possibly altering encounter rates among species and trophic dynamics that structure communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gilbert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Karanth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mills and Harris, 2020</xref>). Congruent with our hypothesis, we observed significant reduction of pairwise encounter time at increasing levels of human disturbance, corresponding to more frequent encounters between the pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gilbert et al., 2022</xref>). Although we did not find a significant shift in nocturnality at community level, we detected a significant shift to nocturnal activity of carnivores, indicating different sensitivities to human presence among the carnivores and ungulates in our study system. Fear of humans may explain the temporal response of wildlife to human presence. Numerous studies have shown that fear of humans as “super predators” can have suppressive effects on widlife activity, which may contribute to increased temporal overlap among speceis (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sévêque et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Suraci et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>All in all, our results indicate that both human modification and human presence may rewire species interactions by increasing spatial and temporal co-occurrence. Studies on the impacts of humans on wildlife communities should explicitly account for different types of co-occurring disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2022a</xref>). Our camera trapping survey observed that human presence is pervasive even inside this remote protected area in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, indicating that wildlife and their habitats are exposed to frequent human disturbance. Humans exploit resources in protected areas in many ways, including through livestock herding, resource gathering, illegal hunting, and recreation, all of which impact wildlife and their habitats to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Harris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mills and Harris, 2020</xref>). Our results demonstrate prevalent disruptions to species co-occurrence patterns from humans. If we are to preserve biodiversity in protected area, we must work to understand the negative effects on multiple facets of biodiversity from co-occurring anthropogenic pressures. Only then can we design effective mitigation measures.</p>
<p>Although interspecific associations should not be directly interpreted as a signal of biotic interactions between pairs of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Blanchet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Poggiato et al., 2021</xref>), it describes a unique facet of biodiversity, and can provide important insights into the coexistence and persistence of wildlife as well as ecosystem function in settings with anthropogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Keil et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Van Scoyoc et al., 2023</xref>). Since interspecific associations often increases with the ecological similarity of species involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gorczynski et al., 2022</xref>), the tendency of many species towards positive associations with increase in anthropogenic pressures indicates a trend towards homogenization of terrestrial mammal communities. Such human-mediated changes in species co-occurrence patterns can have serious ecological consequences at multiple scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gilbert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gorczynski et al., 2022</xref>). For individual species, increased positive associations may affect fitness and population dynamics, increasing local extinction rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kuussaari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Parsons et al., 2022</xref>). Increase in spatial aggregation among functionally similar species may be indicative of a hidden extinction debt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kuussaari et al., 2009</xref>). At the community level, increased positive associations may depress co-occurrence network complexity and stability, amplify interactions such as predation, and simplify communities with similar traits or co-occurrence patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Manlick and Pauli, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mills and Harris, 2020</xref>). Also increased encounter rates between species may expand disease transmission across communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hassell et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, wildlife can host a variety of zoonotic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wicker et al., 2017</xref>) and populations unnaturally associated with humans are more likely to transmit pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jones et al., 2013</xref>). We observed that several species such as masked palm civet and wild boar are positively associated with humans in our study area, indicating a substantial overlap between their habitats and human activity. Ongoing habitat modification, livestock grazing and resource gathering in this region may increase probability of pathogen exchange.</p>
<p>The effects of human disturbance on species associations might be scale-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gilbert et al., 2022</xref>). At present, our sampling design only considers the effects of cumulative human modification and instantaneous local human presence on spatial associations and temporal encounter time at each camera trapping station. We are not able to compare the effects of human disturbance at broader scales (e.g., landscape scale) as such an analysis requires adequate data from hierarchical samplings. Estimating the effects of human disturbance at different spatial scale on species associations is a promising approach. Thus, we encourage future work to further clarify the multiscale ecological effects of human disturbance on species associations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that anthropogenic pressures increase spatiotemporal associations of terrestrial mammals from low to mean levels of human disturbances, but the frequency of positive spatial associations dropped from mean to higher level of human disturbances. Such variations in species associations likely influence the coexistence and persistence of wildlife, with potentially far-ranging ecological consequences. Because terrestrial mammals like carnivores and ungulates play fundamental roles in regulating montane forest ecosystems, the prevalent disruptions to their associations may precipitate biodiversity loss and impair ecosystem function. With increasing human presence and human modification of areas throughout the world, identifying thresholds of anthropogenic activity that shift species relationships, limiting human activity and increasing landscape connectivity across protected areas may be imperative to maintain interspecific spatiotemporal associations that underpin ecosystem resilience. Moreover, the methods we applied highlight the utility of camera trapping surveys in studying the spatiotemporal relationships among elusive species in settings with anthropogenic activities.</p>

<title>Study area</title>
<p>The study was carried out inside the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon National Nature Reserve (29°05′–30°02′ N, 94°39′–96°6′ E) in Nyingchi City in the southeast Tibet Autonomous Region of China (Figure 7). This area is situated within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot, a globally important region for biodiversity conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2021</xref>). The Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon is the deepest in the world, with an elevation drop of more than 7000 m, and has the reputation of “Gene Bank of Mountain Biological Resources” and “Natural Vegetation Museum” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Duan et al., 2022</xref>). This region is characterized by dramatic vertical zonation of vegetation. From the valley bottom to the mountain peak, the main vegetation types consist of low mountain tropical monsoon rain forest, subtropical mountain evergreen broad-leaved forest, mid-mountain warm coniferous forest, sub-alpine cold coniferous forest, alpine subfrigid shrub meadow, and periglacial alpine vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deng et al., 2011</xref>). The complete landscapes in the region harbors endangered species such as Bengal tiger <italic>Panthera tigris tigris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Human activities such as decentralized residential settlements and free-ranging livestock grazing is prevalent in the region, even within the protected area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Camera trap sampling</title>
<p>Camera trap detections of terrestrial mammals were collected during the dry season between November 2020 and April 2021 and November 2021 and April 2022 to avoid the heavy rainy seasons in the region. The mean trapping efforts were 134 days (89 to 147 days range). We used Yianws L720 camera traps to conduct the survey. To determine how anthropogenic factors shape spatiotemporal associations among terrestrial mammals, we set up camera trapping stations within the nature reserve based on intensity of human activities and distance to nearest human settlement. We deployed 350 camera stations in the reserve with different degrees of anthropogenic disturbance, maintaining at least 800 m between them (range 886 to 2233 m, median 1219). This distance may not satisfy the assumption of population closure and there may be some degree of pseudo-replication as observations of wide-ranging animals may not be independent. For these species, the occupancy estimate can be thought of as an estimate of the probability that the species used the area where the camera trapping station was located, rather than true occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Our camera trapping stations spanned a gradient of forest areas with varying levels of human activities and habitat modifications in the surrounding area. We affixed camera traps to trees between 80 and 100 cm off the ground, and they were not baited. Camera sensitivity was set to “low” to reduce false detections triggered by nonanimal movements. We set cameras to take three photos per detection event, with 3 s delay between subsequent detections. Camera trap photos were later identified to species when possible. We combined all human presence photos into a single “Human” categorization representing a variety of human activities detected around a camera station (e.g. resource gathering, livestock grazing, recreation etc.). All photos of the same species (including humans) at the same camera station were considered independent detections if separated by at least 1 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Several camera stations were invalid due to camera malfunctions or lost camera. The total valid sampling effort was 43,163 camera days from 322 camera stations that operated effectively. The target species consisted of ground-dwelling mammal species observed in more than 10 camera stations and weighing more than 1 kg. Thus, the occurrence dataset consists of presence-absence information on 17 mammal species at 322 camera stations.</p>

<title>Anthropogenic and habitat covariates</title>
<p>We derived two different types of human impacts: chronic human modification (e.g., settlement, transportation night-time lights etc.) and acute direct human presence (occurrence of people and domestic animals detected by camera traps) to address our hypotheses. We explored the degree of habitat modification based on the Human modification (HM) map metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kennedy et al., 2019</xref>). The HM metric provides a cumulative estimate of artificial modification of terrestrial landscapes based on 13 anthropogenic stressors caused by five human activities (human settlement, agriculture, transportation, energy production and electrical infrastructure) at a resolution of 1km (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kennedy et al., 2019</xref>). The metric is based on both the intensity and extent of impact of each anthropogenic stressor and ranges from 0 (no human disturbance) to 1 (highest human disturbance). Our sampling stations represent a varied gradient of human modification from 0.04 in minimum to 0.28 in maximum, with a mean value of 0.12 (sd = 0.05). We quantified the level of acute direct human presence around each camera trapping station by calculating the independent detections of human-related activities (e.g., livestock grazing, forest resource collection and tourism) per 100 camera-trap days. The range of human presence recorded by our camera trapping survey was 0 to 46.81, with a mean value of 6.42 (sd = 8.61). We also chose a set of two environmental covariates known to impact spatiotemporal distribution of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2018</xref>) and presumed to affect interspecific associations: (1) elevation, which plays a key role in shaping spatial distribution of many species in mountain forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2018</xref>), and (2) percent of forest cover, which provides food resources, thermal cover and escape shelter for animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Long et al., 2005</xref>). We derived percent of forest cover for each camera station based on the 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery (MOD44B Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) yearly product) of the study area for the period of 2021. For each camera trapping station, we derived human modification and percent of forest cover with a buffer radius of 500 m. This spatial scale should capture the environment that influences both resident animals with small home ranges and transient animals moving through the area. Prior to analysis, we log-transformed [log (x + 0.1)] human presence data to account for its highly skewed distribution. We also standardized human modification and other environmental covariates by scaling to have mean of zero and unit variance.</p>

<title>Spatial co-occurrence analysis</title>
<p>We employed a context-dependent joint species distribution model (JSDM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tikhonov et al., 2017</xref>) to characterize interspecific spatial associations of sympatric species. JSDMs are able to separate spatial associations between species into shared environmental preferences and residual correlations that cannot be explained by the environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pollock et al., 2014</xref>). The context-dependent JSDM approach allow residual correlations to vary across the environment by incorporating species- and site-specific latent variables in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tikhonov et al., 2017</xref>). We followed this approach and constructed a context-dependent model by utilizing a latent variable structure, where the factor loadings are modelled as a linear regression of covariates, allowing species associations to covary with human disturbance covariates. For our camera trap detections, we modelled the presence-absences of species j at camera station i as:
<disp-formula>

<graphic xlink:href="559422v2_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>n<sub>c</sub></italic> denotes the number of fixed covariates (i.e., elevation, percent of forest cover, human modification, and human presence) plus intercept, <italic>β<sub>jk</sub></italic> denotes the effect of environmental covariate <italic>k</italic> on species <italic>j</italic>, <italic>x<sub>ik</sub></italic> denotes the measured covariates <italic>k</italic> = 1…<italic>n<sub>c</sub></italic> in the sampling unit <italic>i</italic>. The intercept of the model is included by setting <italic>x<sub>i1</sub></italic> = 1 for all sampling units, so that the number of measured environmental covariates is <italic>n<sub>c</sub></italic> − 1. The species associations are modelled through the term <italic>ε<sub>ij</sub></italic>, which is defined by a latent factor model:

The predictors <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559422v2_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> on which the species associations are assumed to depend can be arbitrary, usually a subset of environmental predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tikhonov et al., 2017</xref>). Here we model the factor loadings of species as a function of the two types of human disturbances (i.e., human modification and human presence):
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="559422v2_ueqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559422v2_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> denotes the number of covariates assumed to impact residual correlations plus intercept. The intercept is included to the regression part by setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559422v2_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for all sampling units. In this study, assume <italic>n<sub>f</sub></italic>=3, as our Deviance information criteria did not improve notably with the addition of more latent variables. We defined the covariance matrix of species factor loading as a function of human disturbances as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559422v2_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559422v2_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559422v2_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the matrix of factor loadings, which depends on the human disturbances. We then scale this covariance matrix Ω to interspecific correlation matrices R by defining <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559422v2_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for each pair of species, which represents disturbance-dependent associations between species that are not explained by fixed species-specific effects of environmental predictors. These resulted in values between -1 and 1, with negative values representing negative association between species, and positive values implying the opposite.</p>
<p>We estimated changes in species associations over continuous gradients of human modification (range: 0.04 to 0.28) and human presence gradients (range: 0.00 to 46.81). After fitting the model to data, we used the parameterized model to infer how species associations depend on human presence and human modification and generated predictions at minimum (lower), mean (moderate) and maximum (higher) conditions of the two variables separately.</p>
<p>We fitted the model based on a Bayesian approach using the greta R-package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Golding, 2019</xref>) as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Perrin et al. (2022)</xref>. We specified uninformative normally-distributed priors for all parameters. We made inference from 3000 samples on three chains after a burn-in of 2000 samples.</p>

<title>Temporal co-occurrence analysis</title>
<p>For temporal co-occurrence analysis, we defined “Low” and “High” categories of human presence and human modification. We ranked camera trapping stations based on human presence and human modification separately, and filtered detections from the 25% most- (“High” category) and least- (“Low” category) disturbed camera trap stations and pooled detections within each category. We used kernel density distributions of animal diel activity and time between detections of species pairs (time-to-encounter) to compare temporal associations at lower and higher human disturbances. To examine if changes in species diel activity patterns were a mechanism behind anthropogenic impacts, we computed the nocturnal probability and time between consecutive detections of species pairs from lower- and higher-disturbance habitats. We transformed the detection time stamp to “solar time” to eliminate the impacts of day-length variation in day length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nouvellet et al., 2012</xref>). We retained only those species that had at least 30 independent detections in the low- and high-disturbance categories. For nocturnality analysis, we excluded detections within the hour around sunrise and sunset to avoid the effects of crepuscular activities on nocturnal probability. Thus, we defined nocturnal records as detections 1 h after sunset up to 1 h before sunrise. We conducted a binomial t-test to evaluate shifts in species nocturnality in the low- and high-disturbance categories.</p>
<p>To calculate time between detections of species pairs, we filtered camera stations to only those that detected at least two species for each disturbance category. We then calculated the time (in days) between successive detections across species pairs at each camera station. For analysis, we log transformed the time-to-encounter values to account for their markedly skewed distribution. We used 10,000 bootstrapped samples to evaluate 95% confidence interval (CI) shifts in time-to-encounter of species pairs from camera stations in the low- and high-disturbance categories. Results were considered to be significant if the key values fell outside of the 95% Confidence Interval.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study analyses camera trapping information on the occurrence of forest mammals along a gradient of human modification of the environment. The key hypotheses are that human disturbance squeezes wildlife into a smaller area or their activity into only part of the day, leading to increased co-occurrence under modification. The method used is joint species distribution modelling (JSDM).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data source seems to be very nice, although since very little information is presented, this is hard to be sure of. Also, the JSDM approach is, in principle, a nice way of simultaneously analysing the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript suffers from a mismatch of hypotheses and methods at two different levels.</p>
<p>(1) At the lower level, we would need to better understand what the individual species do and &quot;like&quot; (their environmental niche).</p>
<p>(2) The hypothesis clearly asks for an analysis of the statistical interaction between human disturbance and co-occurrence. Yet, the study is not set up in a way to test this directly.</p>
<p>The hypotheses point towards presenting the spatial and the temporal niche, and how it changes, species for species, under human disturbance. To this, one could then add the layer of interspecific associations.</p>
<p>The change in activity and space use could be analysed by looking at the activity times and spatial distribution directly. If biotic interactions change along the disturbance gradient, then observed data are already the outcome of such changed interactions. We thus cannot use the data to infer them! But we can show, for each species, that the habitat preferences change along the disturbance gradient - or not, as the case may be.</p>
<p>The per-species models are simplistic: the predictors are only linear, and there are no statistical interactions. It is unclear how spatial autocorrelations of residuals were treated, although they form the basis for the association analysis. Why are times of day and day of the year not included as predictors IN INTERACTION with niche predictors and human disturbance, since they represent the temporal dimension on which niches are hypothesised to change?</p>
<p>The discussion has little to add to the results. The complexity of the challenge (understanding a community-level response after accounting for species-level responses) is not met, and instead substantial room is given to general statements of how important this line of research is. What is the advance in ecological understanding at the community level?</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study examines the spatial and temporal patterns of occurrence and the interspecific associations within a terrestrial mammalian community along human disturbance gradients. They conclude that human activity leads to a higher incidence of positive associations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The theoretical framework of the study is brilliantly introduced. Solid data and sound methodology. This study is based on an extensive series of camera trap data. Good review of the literature on this topic.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors use the terms associations and interactions interchangeably.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is not the case. In fact, we state specifically that &quot;... interspecific associations should not be directly interpreted as a signal of biotic interactions between pairs of species…&quot; However, co-occurrence can be an important predictor of likely interactions, such as competition and predation. We stand by our original text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is not clear what the authors mean by &quot;associations&quot;. A brief clarification would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our specific definition of what is meant here by spatial association can be found in the Methods section. To clarify, the calculation of the index of associations is based on the covariance for the two species of the residuals (epsilon) after consideration of all species-specific response to known environmental covariates. These covariances are modelled to allow them to vary with the level of human disturbance, measured as human presence and human modification. After normalization, the final index of association is a correlation value that varies between -1 (complete disassociation) and +1 (complete positive association).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, the authors do not delve into the different types of association found in the study. A more ecological perspective explaining why certain species tend to exhibit negative associations and why others show the opposite pattern (and thus, can be used as indicator species) is missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Suggesting the ecological underpinnings of the associations observed here would mainly be speculation at this point, but the associations demonstrated in this analysis do suggest promising areas for the more detailed research suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, the authors do not distinguish between significant (true) non-random associations and random associations. In my opinion, associations are those in which two species co-occur more or less than expected by chance. This is not well addressed in the present version of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Results were considered to be non-random if correlation coefficients (for spatial association) or overlap (for temporal association) fell outside of 95% Confidence Intervals. This is now stated clearly in the Methods section.  In Figure 3—figure supplement 1-3 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1-3, p&lt;0.01 levels are also presented.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The obtained results support the conclusions of the study.</p>
<p>Anthropogenic pressures can shape species associations by increasing spatial and temporal co-occurrence, but above a certain threshold, the positive influence of human activity in terms of species associations could be reverted. This study can stimulate further work in this direction.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study analyses camera trapping information on the occurrence of forest mammals along a gradient of human modification of the environment. The key hypotheses are that human disturbance squeezes wildlife into a smaller area or their activity into only part of the day, leading to increased co-occurrence under modification. The method used is joint species distribution modelling (JSDM).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data source seems to be very nice, although since very little information is presented, this is hard to be sure of. Also, the JSDM approach is, in principle, a nice way of simultaneously analysing the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript suffers from a mismatch of hypotheses and methods at two different levels.</p>
<p>(1) At the lower level, we first need to understand what the individual species do and &quot;like&quot; (their environmental niche). That information is not presented, and the methods suggest that the representation of each species in the JSDM is likely to be extremely poor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The response of each species to the environmental covariates provides a window into their environmental niche, encapsulated in the beta coefficients for each environmental covariate. This information is presented in Figure 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The hypothesis clearly asks for an analysis of the statistical interaction between human disturbance and co-occurrence. Yet, the model is not set up this way, and the authors thus do a lot of indirect exploration, rather than direct hypothesis testing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our JSDM model is set up specifically to examine the effect of human disturbance on co-occurrence, after controlling for shared responses to environmental variables.  It directly tests the first hypothesis, since, if increase in indices of human disturbance had not tended to increase the measured spatial correlations between species as detected by the model, we would have rejected our stated hypothesis that human modification of habitats results in increased positive spatial associations between species.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Even when the focus is not the individual species, but rather their association, we need to formulate what the expectation is. The hypotheses point towards presenting the spatial and the temporal niche, and how it changes, species for species, under human disturbance. To this, one can then add the layer of interspecific associations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Examining each species one by one and how each one responds to human disturbance would miss the effects of any meaningful interactions between species.  The analysis presented provides a means to highlight associations that would have been overlooked.  Future research could go on to analyze the strongest associations in the community and the strongest effects of human disturbance so as to uncover the underlying interactions that give rise to them and the mechanisms of human impact.  We believe that this will prove to be a much more productive approach than trying to tackle this problem species by species and pair by pair.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The change in activity and space use can be analysed much simpler, by looking at the activity times and spatial distribution directly. It remains unclear what the contribution of the JSDM is, unless it is able to represent this activity and spatial information, and put it in a testable interaction with human disturbance.</p>
<p>The topic is actually rather complicated. If biotic interactions change along the disturbance gradient, then observed data are already the outcome of such changed interactions. We thus cannot use the data to infer them! But we can show, for each species, that the habitat preferences change along the disturbance gradient - or not, as the case may be.</p>
<p>Then, in the next step, one would have to formulate specific hypotheses about which species are likely to change their associations more, and which less (based e.g. on predator-prey or competitive interactions). The data and analyses presented do not answer any of these issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We suggest that the so-called “simpler” approach described above is anything but simple, and this is precisely what the Joint Species Distribution Model improves upon.  As pointed out in the Introduction, simply examining spatial overlap is not enough to detect a signal of meaningful biotic interaction, since overlap could be the result of similar responses to environmental variables.  With the JSDM approach, this would not be considered a positive association and would then not imply the possible existence of meaningful interaction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another more substantial point is that, according to my understanding of the methods, the per-species models are very inappropriate: the predictors are only linear, and there are no statistical interactions (L374). There is no conceivable species in the world whose niche would be described by such an oversimplified model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While interaction terms can be included in the JSDM, this would considerably increase the complexity of the models.  In previous work, we have found no strong evidence for the importance of interaction terms and they do not improve the performance of the models.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>We have no idea of even the most basic characteristics of the per-species models: prevalences, coefficient estimates, D2 of the model, and analysis of the temporal and spatial autocorrelation of the residuals, although they form the basis for the association analysis!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The coefficient estimates for response to environmental variables used in the JSDM are provided in Figure 2 and Figure 2—source data 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Why are times of day and day of the year not included as predictors IN INTERACTION with niche predictors and human disturbance, since they represent the temporal dimension on which niches are hypothesised to change?</p>
<p>Also, all correlations among species should be shown for the raw data and for the model residuals: how much does that actually change and can thus be explained by the niche models?</p>
<p>The discussion has little to add to the results. The complexity of the challenge (understanding a community-level response after accounting for species-level responses) is not met, and instead substantial room is given to general statements of how important this line of research is. I failed to see any advance in ecological understanding at the community level.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the community-level response to human disturbance is a complex topic, and we believe it is also a very important one.  This research and its support of the spatial compression hypothesis, while not providing definitive answers to detailed mechanisms, opens up new lines of inquiry that makes it an important advance.  For example, the strong effects of human disturbance on certain associations that were detected here could now be examined with the kind of detailed species by species and pair by pair analysis that this reviewer appears to demand.</p>

<p>L27 indicates instead of &quot;idicates&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for catching that error.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L64 I would refer to potential interactions or just associations. It is always hard to provide evidence for the existence of true interactions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised to “potential interactions” to qualify this statement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L69 Suggestion: distort instead of upset.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for catching that error.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L70-71 Here, authors use the term associations. Please, be consistent with the terminology throughout the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point.  The term “co-occurrence” appears to be used inconsistently in the literature, so we have tried to refer to it only when referencing the work of us. For us, co-occurrence means “spatial overlap” without qualification as to whether it is caused by interaction or simply by similar responses to environmental factors (see Blanchet et al. 2020, Argument 1). In our view, interactions refer to biotic effects like predation, competition, commensalism, etc., while associations are the statistical footprint of these processes.   In keeping with this understanding, in Line 73, we changed &quot;association&quot; to the stronger word &quot;interaction,&quot; but in Line 76, we keep the words &quot;spatiotemporal association&quot;, which is presumed to be the result of those interactions. In Line 91, we have changed “interactions” to “associations,” as we do not believe interactions were demonstrated in that study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L76 &quot;Species associations are not necessarily fixed as positive or negative...&quot; This sentence is misleading. I would say that species associations can vary across time and space, for instance along an environmental gradient.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the potential for confusion.  In Line 79, we have changed as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L78 &quot;Associations between free-ranging species are especially context-dependent&quot; Loose sentence. Please, explain a bit further.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have changed the sentence to be more specific; ”Interactions are known to be context-dependent; for example, gradients in stress are associated with variation in the outcomes of pairwise species interactions.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L83-85 This would be a good place to introduce the 'stress gradient' hypothesis, which has also been applied to faunal communities in a few studies. According to this hypothesis, the incidence of positive associations should increase as environmental conditions harden.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our review of the literature, we find that the stress gradient hypothesis is somewhat controversial and does not receive strong support in vertebrates.  We have added the phrase “…the controversial stress-gradient hypothesis predicts that positive associations should increase as environmental conditions become more severe…”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L86-88 Well, overall, the number of studies examining spatiotemporal associations in vertebrates is relatively small. That is, bird associations have not received much more attention than those of mammals. I find this introductory/appealing paragraph a bit rough. I think the authors can do better and find a better justification for their work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments.  We have rewritten the paragraph extensively to make it clearer and to provide a stronger justification for the study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L106 &quot;[...] resulting in increased positive spatial associations between species&quot; I'd say that habitat shrinking would increase the level of species clustering or co-occurrence, but in my opinion, not necessarily the incidence of positive associations. It is not clear to me if the authors use positive associations as a term analogous to co-occurrence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this very important distinction.  Habitat shrinking would increase levels of species co-occurrence, but this is not particularly interested.  We wanted to test whether there were effects on species interactions, as revealed by associations.  We find that the terms association and co-occurrence are used somewhat loosely in the literature and so have made some new effort to clarify and systematize this in the manuscript.  For example, there appear to be a differences in the way “co-occurrence” is used in Boron 2023 and in Blanchet 2020. We do not use the term &quot;positive spatial association&quot; as analogous to &quot;spatial co-occurrence.&quot;. Spatial co-occurrence, which for us has the meaning of spatial overlap, could simply be the result of similar reactions to environmental co-variates, not reflecting any biotic interaction. Joint Species Distribution Models enable the partitioning of spatial overlap and segregation into that which can be explained by responses to known environmental factors, and that which cannot be explained and thus might be the result of biotic interactions.  It is only the latter that we are calling spatial association, which can be positive or negative.   These associations may be the statistical footprint of biotic interactions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Results:</p>
<p>Difference between random and non-random association patterns. It is not clear to me if the reported associations are significant or not. The authors only report the sign of the association (either positive or negative) but do not clarify if these associations indicate that two species coexist more or less than expected by chance. In my opinion, that is the difference between true ecological associations (e.g., via facilitation or competition effects) and random co-existence patterns. This is paramount and should be addressed in a new version of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This information is provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 1,2,3 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1,2,3.  This is referenced in the text as follows, “… correlation coefficients for 18 species pairs were positive and had a 95 % CI that did not overlap zero, and the number increased to 65 in moderate modifications but dropped to 29 at higher modifications&quot; and so on. This criterion for significance (ie., greater than expected by chance) is now stated at the end of the Materials and methods.  In Figure 3—figure supplement 1,2,3 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1,2,3, those correlations that were significant at p&lt;0.01 are also shown.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I am also missing a more ecological explanation for the observed findings. For instance, the top-ranked species in terms of negative associations is the red fox, whereas the muntjac seems to be the species whose presence can be used as an indicator for that of other species. What are the mechanisms underlying these patterns? Do red foxes compete for food with other species? Do the species that show positive associations (red goral, muntjac) have traits or a diet that are more different from those of other species? More discussion on these aspects (role of traits and the trophic niche) would be necessary to better understand the obtained results.</p>

<p>The purpose of this paper was to test the compression hypotheses, and we have tried to keep that as the focus.  However, the analysis does open up interesting lines of inquiry for future research to decipher the details of the interactions between species and the mechanisms by which human disturbance facilitates or disrupts these interactions. The reviewer raises some interesting possibilities, but at this point, any discussion along these lines would be largely speculation and could lengthen the paper without great benefit.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript should be accompanied by all data and code of analysis.</p>
<p>All data and RScripts have been made available in Science Data Bank: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.11804">https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.11804</ext-link>.</p>
<p>The sentence &quot;not much is known&quot; is weak: it suggests the authors did not bother to quantify what IS known, and simply waved any previous knowledge aside. Surely we have some ideas about who preys on whom, and which species have overlapping resource requirements (e.g., due to jaw width). For those, we would expect a particularly strong signal, if the association is indeed indicative of interactions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that the reviewer is referring to the statement in Line 90-92 about the lack of understanding of the resilience of terrestrial mammal associations to human disturbance.  We have added a reference to one very recent publication that addresses the issue (Boron et al., 2023), but otherwise we stand by our statement. We have, however, added a qualifier to make it clear that we did indeed look for previous knowledge; &quot;However, a review of the literature indicates that ....&quot;</p>

<p>That only 4 predictors are presented is unacceptably oversimplified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Only 4 predictors are included because, in previous work, we found that adding additional predictors or interactions did little to improve the model’s performance (Li et al. 2018, 2021 and 2022) and could lead to over-fitting.</p>

<p>L55: can you give any such &quot;unique ecological information&quot;</p>
<p>L60: Lyons et al. (Kathleen is the first name) has been challenged by Telford et al. (2016 Nature) as methodologically flawed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The first name has been deleted.  The methodological flaw has to do with interpretation of the fossil record and choice of samples, not with the need to partition shared environmental preferences and interactions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L61 contradicts line 64: Blanchet et al. (2022, specifying some arguments from Dormann et al. 2018 GEB) correctly point out that logically one cannot infer the existence or strength from co-occurrence data. It is thus wrong to then claim (citing Boron et al.) that such data &quot;convey key information about interactions&quot;. The latter statement is incorrect. A tree and a beetle can have extremely high association and nothing to do with each other. Association does not mean anything in itself. When two species are spatially and temporally non-overlapping, they can exhibit perfect &quot;anti-association&quot;, yet, by the authors' own definition, cannot interact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that the reviewer’s concerns arise from a misunderstanding of how we use the term association.  In our usage, an association is not the same as co-occurrence or overlap, which may simply be the result of shared responses to environmental variables.  The co-occurring tree and beetle would not be found to have any association in our analysis, only shared environmental sensitivities.  In contrast, associations can be the statistical footprint of interactions, and would be overlaid onto any overlap due to similar responses to the environment.  In the case of negative associations, such as might be the result of competitive exclusion or avoidance of predators, the two species would share environmental responses but show lower than expected spatial overlap.  Even though they might be only rarely found in the same vicinity, they would indeed be interacting when they were together.</p>
<p>Joint Species Distribution Models &quot;allow the partitioning of the observed correlation into that which can be explained by species responses to environmental factors... and that which remains unexplained after controlling for environmental effects and which may reflect biotic interactions.&quot; (Garcia Navas et al. 2021). It is the latter that we are calling “associations.”</p>

<p>L63: Gilbert reference: Good to have a reference for this statement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This point is important, but the reviewer’s comments below have made it clear that it is even more important to point out that strong interactions should be expected to lead to significant associations.  We have added a statement to clarify this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L70-72: Incorrect, interactions play a role, not associations (which are merely statistical).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this, we agree, and we have revised the statement to refer to interactions, not associations. In our view, an interaction is a biological phenomenon, while an association is the resulting statistical signal that we can detect.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L75: Associations tell us nothing, only interactions do. Since these can not be reliably inferred, this statement and this claim are wrong.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point, but we beg to disagree. Strong interactions should be expected to lead to significant associations that can be detected in the data. Associations, which can be measured reliably, are the evidence of potential interactions, and hence associations can tell us a great deal.  We have added a note to this effect after the Gilbert reference above to clarify this point.</p>
<p>However, we do accept that associations must be interpreted with caution. As Blanchet et al. 2020 explain, &quot; …the co-occurrence signals (e.g. a signiﬁcant positive or negative correlation value) estimated from these models could originate from any abiotic factors that impact species differently. Therefore, this correlation cannot be systematically interpreted as a signal of biotic interactions, as it could instead express potential non-measured environmental drivers (or combinations of them) that inﬂuence species distribution and co-distribution.”  Or alternatively an association could be the result of interaction with a 3rd species.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L87: Regarding your claim, how would you know you DO understand? For that, you need to formulate an expectation before looking at the data and then show you cannot show what you actually measure. (Jaynes called this the &quot;mind-projection fallacy&quot;.)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not sure if the reviewer is criticizing our paper or the entire field of community ecology.  Perhaps it is the statement that “….resilience of interspecific spatiotemporal associations of terrestrial mammals to human activity remains poorly understood….”  Since we are confident that the reviewer believes that mammals do interact, we guess that it is the term “association” that is questioned.  We have revised this to “…the impacts of human activity on interspecific interactions of terrestrial mammals remains poorly understood…”</p>
<p>In this particular case, we did formulate an expectation before looking at the data, in the form of the two formal hypotheses that are clearly stated in the Introduction and illustrated in Figure 1. If the hypotheses had not been supported, then we would have accepted that we do not understand. But as the data are consistent with the hypotheses, we submit that we do understand a bit more now.</p>
