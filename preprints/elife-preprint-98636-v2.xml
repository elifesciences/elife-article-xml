<title>Abstract</title><p>Tendon injury occurs at high frequency and is difficult to repair. Identification of human stem cells being able to regenerate tendon will greatly facilitate the development of regenerative medicine for tendon injury. We identified human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors having tendon differentiation potential both in vitro and in vivo. Transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors contributes to injured tendon repair and thus improves locomotor function. Interestingly, the tendon differentiation potential in mouse muscle stem cells is minimal and the higher TGFβ signaling level may be the key for the distinct feature of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. These findings reveal that human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors are bi-potential adult stem cells and can serve as a new source for tendon regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Skeletal muscle is a tissue with great regeneration ability due to the existence of muscle stem cells (MuSCs). MuSCs are adult stem cells located at the periphery of myofibers between the basal lamina and the plasmalemma of the myofibers and responsible for muscle regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. MuSCs have been considered to be unipotent stem cells to have a sole differentiation potential to myofibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. MuSCs undergo expansion and differentiate to multinuclei myofibers after injury in vivo. MuSCs have remarkable abilities to support muscle regeneration. After transplantation, the engrafted mouse MuSCs go through active expansion and regenerate myofibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Isolation by FACS and expansion of MuSCs have been reported from several species including mouse, pig, and human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Single cell sequencing analysis from human skeletal muscles have also revealed the existence of Pax7+ myogenic progenitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Due to the different motion patterns, the regeneration capacity may be different between human and rodents. Current investigations have suggested that human myogenic progenitor cells didn’t share same markers as that in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and the expression pattern of oxidative enzymes and cytokines between these two species are also different<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, suggesting that human muscle progenitor cells may have distinct features from mice.</p>
<p>FACS method to isolate cells with myogenic differentiation potential from human muscle biopsies has been established. It has been reported that CD56 (NCAM)+ and CD56+ CD29+ cells from skeletal muscle display myogenic differentiation potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The CD56+ CD34+ progenitor cells isolated from human skeletal muscle biopsies have been reported to have chondrogenic, adipogenic, and osteogenic potentials besides myogenic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. CD56+CD34-progenitor cells are free of adipogenic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The differentiation potential of human myogenic progenitors remains to be further explored.</p>
<p>Skeletal muscle directly connects to tendons which is responsible for transmitting forces from skeletal muscle to bone to generate active movement. Tendinopathy affects more than 10% of the population under 45 and compromises the tendon functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Tendon injury healing is slow and incomplete due to the low number of cells in tendon and the hypovascular and anaerobic environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Tendon stem/progenitor cells (TDSCs) is a cell population derived from tendon and considered to be a subgroup of mesenchymal stem cells that have abilities to improve tendon injury healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. However, the number of TDSCs in tendon is low and retrieving TDSCs is invasive and exacerbates tendon injury. Morphology and proliferation ability loss in the culture system also hampers the efforts to obtain sufficient amounts of active TDSCs. To find more cell types supporting tendon regeneration will facilitate the development of regenerative medicine to treat tendon injury. The activity of tenogenesis is tightly regulated by many signaling pathways, especially for TGFβ signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. TGFβ signaling is indispensable for tendon development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and it could systematically promote the tenogenic differentiation of stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The downstream effectors SMAD2 and SMAD3 are able to activate the transcription of tendon-specific genes which further facilitates tendon development and tenogenic differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. After tendon injury, TGFβ signaling promotes the proliferation, migration and differentiation of TDSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, increases tendon collagen synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and contributes to matrix anabolism for tendon remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we found that human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors can be differentiated to tendon cells both in vitro and in vivo. Transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors to injured tendon in mice improved the tendon regeneration, suggesting its bipotential ability. Interestingly, the tendon differentiation potential in mouse muscle stem cells is minimal and the higher TGFβ signaling level may be the key for the distinct feature of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors.</p>

<title>The CD29+/CD56+ cells isolated from human muscle biopsies display robust features of myogenic progenitors</title>
<p>To analyze the cell components of human skeletal muscle, single cell sequencing analysis was performed using skeletal muscle biopsy. A total of 57,193 cells were included for analysis. The cells were grouped to 9 cell populations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). Consistent with the previous single cell sequencing results from human muscles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, Fibro/Adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), endothelial cells, myocytes, and myogenic progenitors were among the identified cell types (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). Especially, myogenic progenitors accounted for 12.4% of all the mononuclear cells, while tenocytes only accounted for 0.06% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). To investigate the identity of CD29+/CD56+ cells, joint expression analysis was performed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). The scRNA-seq data revealed that all the CD29+/CD56+ cells were myogenic progenitors, which occupied 19.3% of all the myogenic progenitors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). However, there existed no tenocytes with CD29+/CD56+ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Combined, the scRNA-seq data revealed human CD29+/CD56+ cells were myogenic progenitors.</p>

<p>To confirm the single cell analysis results, we first isolated CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors from human muscle biopsy using FACS as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. CD31-/CD45-/CD29+/CD56+ cells were collected from the single cell suspension dissociated from muscle tissue. The collected cells were stained with anti-PAX7, anti-MYOD1 and anti-MYF5 antibody to confirm the purity of isolated CD29+/CD56+ cells, and nearly all of the obtained cells were positively stained with these myogenic progenitors markers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). The proliferation assay indicated high in vitro expansion ability of these human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). When induced to differentiate by 0.4% Ultroser G, human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors differentiate to myotubes robustly. Approximately 90% of nuclei were present in Myosin heavy chain (MyHC) positive myotubes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">j</xref>). Consistently, the expression of PAX7, MYF5 and MYOD1 were enriched in the myogenic progenitors, and their expression decreased after differentiation as shown by RT-qPCR assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k</xref>). In contrast, the expression of genes marking differentiation such as Myogenin (MYOG), Myosin heavy chain 1 (MYH1), and Myosin heavy chain 3 (MYH3) were significantly up-regulated in differentiated myotubes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1l</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the CD29+/CD56+ cells isolated from human muscle biopsies have robust features of myogenic progenitors.</p>

<title>Human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors display tenogenic differentiation potential in vitro</title>
<p>Since previous studies indicated that there could be tenogenic differentiation ability for muscle-derived cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, we next explored the tenogenic differentiation potential of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. The isolated primary human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors were induced to differentiate to tenocytes by 100ng/ml GDF5, 100ng/ml GDF7 and 0.2mM ascorbic acid for 12 days. After 12 days of tendon differentiation, the morphology of cells displayed dramatic differences from those undergoing myogenic differentiation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">SFig. 1a</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of tendon markers such as TNC and SCX was significantly increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Moreover, some other tendon related genes, such as COL I, MKX, THBS4, and COMP, were also enriched after tendon differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). In contrast, the expression of these genes was not enriched upon myogenic differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). The expression of genes marking myogenic differentiation such as MYOG and MyHC were only detected in a small portion of cells after tenogenic differentiation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">SFig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Compared to the over 90% of differentiation efficiency upon myogenic differentiation, only about 20% of cells showed MYOG and MyHC expression after 12 days of tenogenic induction (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">SFig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). The genes marking differentiated myotubes such as MYH1, MYH3, DESMIN, and MYL1 showed moderate elevation after tenogenic differentiation, while dramatic upregulation of these genes was observed after myogenic differentiation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">SFig. 1d</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">e</xref>). These results combined suggest that human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors are capable of tendon differentiation in vitro.</p>

<p>To further confirm the results, we next performed clonal analysis. The freshly isolated primary human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors were seeded to 96 well plate with the concentration of 1 cell/well. The wells of single cell were allowed to proliferate for 10 days followed by tenogenic or myogenic induction. The plates with myogenic induction were differentiated for 4 days and immunofluorescence staining of MyHC was performed to determine myogenic differentiation. The plates with tenogenic induction were differentiated for 12 days and immunofluorescence staining of SCX was performed to determine tenogenic differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The number of wells showing positive MyHC staining was counted and the myogenic differentiation efficiency was calculated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). MyHC+ myotubes was observed in over 95% of wells with alive cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). Similarly, the number of wells displaying positive SCX staining were counted and the tenogenic differentiation efficiency was calculated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). Approximately 40% of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors displayed tenogenic differentiation ability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>), suggesting that human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors have tenogenic differentiation potential. Taken together, these results suggest that human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors have dual differentiation potentials towards muscle or tendon in vitro.</p>

<title>Tenocytes differentiated from human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors display similar expression profile to primary tenocytes</title>
<p>RNA sequencing was then performed to further determine the lineage of the tenocytes differentiated from human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. Human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors were induced towards myogenic or tenogenic differentiation respectively. We also isolated primary human tenocytes as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. These cells were subjected for RNA sequencing analysis. The differentiated myotubes and tenocytes displayed distinct expression patterns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The differentiated tendon cells share high similarity to fresh isolated tenocytes from human tendons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), suggesting that human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors are capable of tendon differentiation. Consistently, two distinct sets of genes representing myogenic markers and tenogenic markers were up-regulated after myogenic induction and tenogenic induction, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">c</xref>).

<p>Further GO analysis also displayed the activation of two distinct sets of cell features. Upon the skeletal muscle differentiation, terms related to skeletal muscle functions such as skeletal muscle thin filament assembly, skeletal muscle contraction, muscle organ development, and sarcomere organization were enriched (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>), suggesting the muscular identity of the differentiated cells. In contrast, terms related to tendon formation, tendon development, and tendon cell differentiation were enriched after tenogenic differentiation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), suggesting that tendon identity is achieved in the differentiated cells. Together, these results suggest that human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors are capable of both myogenic and tenogenic differentiation in vitro.</p>

<title>Murine MuSCs display poor tenogenic differentiation ability</title>
<p>We next investigated whether the tenogenic differentiation ability is present in rodent muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Mouse MuSCs were isolated by positive marker of Vcam1 as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and induced for tenogenic differentiation. In sharp contrast to human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, murine MuSCs failed to be induced to tendon cells upon the same induction condition as that for human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, though the myogenic differentiation is as efficient as the human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. After myogenic differentiation, 93.9% of nuclei were present in MyHC+ myotubes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). In sharp contrast, no Scx+ cells were observed after 12 days of induction for tenogenic differentiation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Consistent with the immunofluorescence staining results, RT-qPCR results revealed that myogenic differentiation marker genes such as MyoG, Myh1, and Myh3 were significantly up-regulated under both myogenic and tenogenic differentiation conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), suggesting that murine MuSCs predominantly commit myogenic differentiation under induction. Different from human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, the expression of genes indicating tendon cell fate such as Scx, Tnc, Col I, Mkx, and Thbs4 did not increase after tenogenic differentiation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), suggesting the failure to induce tenogenic cell fate from murine MuSCs. Together, these results suggest that murine MuSCs display almost no tenogenic differentiation potential in vitro.</p>

<p>We next performed the lineage tracing experiments in mice to further examine the tenogenic potential of mouse MuSCs in vivo (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Pax7CreERT2 mice were crossed to flox-Stop-flox-tdTomato mice. MuSCs and the descendants of MuSCs will be labeled by tdTomato (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">SFig. 2a</xref>). Tendon injury in mice was generated by mimicking the peroneus longus tendon removal surgery in human (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">SFig. 2b</xref>). In human, it has been reported that the tendon could be regenerated to some extent after the peroneus longus tendon removal surgery based on MRI imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In this surgery, injury of the skeletal muscle adjacent to the removed tendon was inevitable. The accompanied skeletal muscle injury could activate MuSCs and make them available for tendon regeneration. To further activate MuSCs to guarantee that sufficient amount of activated MuSCs were available around the tendon injury site, we also injected 15μl of 10μM cardiotoxin (CTX) at the muscle adjacent to the sites where the tendon was removed to induce more muscle injuries and further activated MuSCs. If MuSCs can participate tendon regeneration, tdTomato+ tendon cells would be observed after the repair of tendon injury.</p>
<p>Expectedly, large amount of tdTomato+ myofibers were observed after muscle injury (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">SFig. 2c-d</xref>), suggesting that the tracing system works well. Nevertheless, less than 0.2% tendon cells originated from mouse MuSCs were observed even four months after tendon removal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f-g</xref>). These results suggest that murine MuSCs have poor tendon differentiation abilities.</p>

<p>We next went on to investigate whether the transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors to mouse can improve tendon regeneration. An approximately 1.5mm long and 0.5mm width transverse incision was performed at 5mm from the calcaneus in Achilles tendon for NOD/SCID immunodeficient mice. Total 50,000 human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors packed in hydrogel were planted at the incision site (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). As a control, mixture of PBS and hydrogel was transplanted in the SCID recipient mice undergoing the same tendon injury at the cleavage sites. Packing the cells with hydrogel concentrated the transplanted cells at the local injury sites.

<p>In mice transplanted with human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, continuous cryosections containing muscle and tendon tissues were generated. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect tendon and muscle markers with two cryosections adjacent to each other, respectively. The two sets of images obtained on continuous cryosections were superimposed on each other to pinpoint the position of tendons. Immunofluorescence staining of antibody specifically recognizing human TNC indicated the position of regenerated tendon-like tissue from human cells in the harvested tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). The presence of human cells was also illustrated by the immunofluorescence staining with the antibody specifically recognizing human Lamin A/C. In the control PBS injection group, where the mixture of PBS and hydrogel instead human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors was injected to the incision sites, no human Lamin A/C was detected. These results confirmed the specificity of human TNC and Lamin A/C antibody. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that over 75% of the human cells showed TNC expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">d</xref>), suggesting that the majority of the transplanted human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors differentiate to tendon cells in vivo. The immunofluorescence staining of MyHC and human Lamin A/C were performed to detect the muscle cells originated from the transplanted human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitor cells. Only about 12.8% of the human cells detected expressed MyHC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). Moreover, the human cells were predominantly enriched at the tendon region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Only a few MyHC+ cells originated from the transplanted human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors scattered in the muscle region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). To further confirm the tendon differentiation potential of the transplanted human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, immunofluorescence staining of SCX and TNMD was also performed. The majority (80.0% and 74.6%) of transplanted human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors also expressed SCX and TNMD (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">SFig. 3a, b</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Furthermore, Col I was predominantly expressed in the regenerated tendon-like tissue rather than Col III after human cells transplantation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>), indicating human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors could contribute to structural repair of injured tendon and facilitate the healing process. Taken together, these results suggest that human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors are capable of tendon differentiation in vivo and contributing to tendon regeneration.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, when 50,000 murine MuSCs constitutively expressing tdTomato were transplanted to pre-injured tendon in NOD/SCID mice under the same condition, less than 0.3% of tdTomato+ TNC+ cells were detected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). However, the myogenic differentiation potential of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors and mouse MuSCs was similar. Muscle injury was induced by muscular injection of CTX in tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in NOD/SCID mice. TA muscles were irradiated to kill the local MuSCs as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors and mouse MuSCs to the irradiated pre-injured recipient mice was performed, respectively. TA muscles were harvested after 28 days. Transplantation of both human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors and murine MuSC displayed robust engraftment efficiency (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">SFig. 3d-i</xref>). These results suggest that human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors and murine MuSCs have similar myogenic differentiation potential.</p>
<p>Combined, the above results suggest that human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors have dual differentiation potentials towards myogenesis or tenogenesis in vivo, while murine MuSCs predominantly commit myogenesis.</p>

<p>We next checked whether transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors could improve tendon functions.

Larger and denser collagen fibrils of the tendons were identified in transplanted group than control group with PBS injection, although the maturation level of collagen fibrils could still not reach to those in uninjured tendon (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">b</xref>).

<p>Whether the improved tendon regeneration could facilitate the whole organism locomotor function was next investigated. Since the Achilles tendon transmits the plantarflexion force from gastrocnemius muscle to calcaneus, the plantarflexion force of involved leg was also performed two months after tendon injury. Expectedly, transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors for injured tendon also contributed to improving both twitch and tetanus plantarflexion force when compared with PBS injection control group, although the plantarflexion force could still not reach to the level of uninjured leg (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). Consistent with the improved plantarflexion force, the endurance time and max fatigue speed of the mice transplanted with human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors were better in treadmill test when compared to PBS group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>). Since immunofluorescence staining with human Lamin A/C revealed that only a small number of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors engrafted in muscle sporadically (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">d</xref>), these results suggest that the transplanted human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors can improve locomotor function by directly repairing injured tendon.</p>

<title>TGF<bold>β</bold> signaling pathway contributes to tenogenic differentiation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors</title>
<p>Since the human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors and murine MuSCs shared the same strain of recipient mice and the same tendon injury while being transplanted, they had the similar microenvironment. Therefore, the distinct differentiation potentials are due to the cell intrinsic differences between species. We further compared the expression profiles of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors and murine MuSCs. Interestingly, TGFβ signaling was identified in KEGG enrichment analysis of upregulated genes in human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors when compared with murine MuSCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>), indicating that TGFβ signaling could be the key node for maintaining the tendon differentiation potential. Especially, SMAD2 and SMAD3 were identified in upregulated gene set which was enriched in TGFβ signaling pathway (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). Since TGFβ/SMAD2/SMAD3 axis plays a crucial role in tendon development and tenogenic differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, these data further indicated potential crucial role of TGFβ signaling for tenogenic differentiation ability of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. Then TGFβ signaling inhibitor SB-431542 was used to investigate the biological effect of TGFβ signaling during tenogenic induction. The immunofluorescent staining, western blot assay and RT-qPCR results showed SB-431542 significantly suppressed expression level of tendon related genes SCX, TNC, COL I, MKX, and THBS4 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c, d, e</xref>). On the contrary, myogenic differentiation ability of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors was increased after treatment of SB-431542 during tenogenic induction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">g</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we show that human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors have dual differentiation potentials towards muscle and tendon. Transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors contributes to injured tendon repair and thus improves locomotor function. Thus, the human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors could be served as a new source for tendon regeneration.</p>
<p>Tendon disorders widely occur in people of all ages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. It disrupts the stability and mobility of joint, which deeply affects their locomotor function and quality of life. However, the natural healing of injured tendon is very slow due to hypocellularity and hypovascularity of tendon. The biomechanical property and structural integrity could be hardly completely recovered even with surgical treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. It is still a great challenge in clinical work to treat tendon injury.</p>
<p>The relative inefficient outcome of routine therapy for tendon injury sparked the exploration of stem cell treatment. Seed cells with the ability to differentiate into tenocytes and secrete paracrine factors to repair tendon injury are preferred. Thus, tendon derived stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells have been introduced as seed cells to treat tendon injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. However, inadequate sources of tendon derived stem cells, ethical issue and risk of teratoma formation of embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cell, and heterogeneity of mesenchymal stem cells limit the development of these seed cells for tendon injury treatment. As for muscle progenitors, it is high in proliferation and abundant in sources, and donor site morbidity after muscle harvest was low. Thus, myogenic progenitors might be a promising candidate as seed cells for tendon repair.</p>
<p>Here we also find that the differentiation potential of muscle stem cells is species dependent. Human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors are bipotential adult stem cells. In contrast, murine muscle stem cells barely have tendon differentiation potential. The species difference might be due to the higher TGFβ signaling level in human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. It has been reported that TGFβ/SMAD2/SMAD3 axis plays a crucial role in tendon development and tenogenic differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. SMAD2/3-dependent TGFβ signaling also acts as a crucial molecular brake for myogenesis. It could suppress myogenic regulatory factors Myod1 and Myogenin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, as well as inhibit myotube fusion and muscle regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Thus, the elevated TGFβ signaling may help inhibit the myogenic differentiation ability and stimulate the tenogenic differentiation potential of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors under specific microenvironment.</p>
<p>Studies using mouse models contributed to the majority of our knowledge about muscle stem cells and laid the foundation for our understanding of mammalian muscle stem cells. However, human is dramatically different from mouse in many aspects such as size, life span, and manners of motions. It is more demanding for humans to maintain the homeostasis of the locomotion system and the whole organism locomotion ability in much longer life span and bigger body size. Though our knowledge about human muscle regeneration is limited, the current studies have revealed multiple differentiation potentials of Pax7+ human myogenic progenitors in skeletal muscles. CD56+ CD34+ progenitor cells in human skeletal muscle have been reported to have myogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The CD56+ CD34-progenitor cells in human skeletal muscle have been shown to be free of adipogenic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that the CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors in skeletal muscles also have tenogenic differentiation ability besides their myogenic differentiation ability. It seems that there are multiple subpopulations of myogenic progenitors in skeletal muscle. They are all capable of muscle regeneration, while with potentials to regenerate other components of the motion system such as bone, tendon, and adipocytes. This could be an economic method to maintain the functions of the motion system for the longer life span and more complicated motion manner in human beings.</p>

<p>The authors demonstrate the <bold>valuable</bold> discovery that human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors can differentiate into tendon through the TGFβ pathway, addressing mouse and human interspecies differences in regard to the potential of muscle stem cells. The in vivo transplantation experiments provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for the conclusion, as human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors contribute to tendon regeneration, resulting in functional recovery in mouse model. The authors' approach can be used for the development of cell therapy for tendon-injured patients.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have thoroughly addressed all my concerns. The revised version of the current manuscript is solid now. It's very interesting that there is bi-potential ability of human CD29/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. The current study substantiates the medical translational potential for human CD29/CD56+ myogenic progenitors in promoting tendon regeneration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>CD29+/CD56+ stem/progenitor cells were transplanted into immunodeficient mice with a tendon injury, and human cells expressing tenogenic markers contributed to the repair of the injured tendon. Furthermore, the authors also show better tendon biomechanical properties and plantarflexion force after transplantation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>None. The authors have thoroughly addressed all my concerns.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.’</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>For the colony analysis, it is unclear from the methods and main text whether the initial individual sorted colonies were split and subject to different conditions to support the claim of bi-potency. The finding that 40% of colonies displayed tenogenic differentiation, may instead suggest heterogeneity of the sorted progenitor population. The methods as currently described, suggest that two different plates were subject to different induction conditions. It is therefore difficult to assess the strength of the claim of bi-potency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable comment. We are sorry for the confusing illustration of colony assay. In fact, we first obtained CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors by FACs. Then these freshly isolated cells were randomly seeded to 96-well plate with density of 1 cell/well. Subsequently, the single cell in each plate was cultured with growth medium to form colonies for ten days. Then myogenic induction was performed in three 96-well plates and tenogenic induction was performed in another three 96-well plates for subsequent analyses. We agree with your point that the sorted cell population could be heterogeneous myogenic progenitors. The result showed over 95% colonies successfully differentiated into myotubes, while 40% of colonies displayed tenogenic differentiation (Fig. 2g). Since the freshly obtained CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors were randomly seeded for tenogenic induction or myogenic induction, the undifferentiated cells in each group were considered as the same sample. Furthermore, the optimal tenogenic differentiation condition for these cells was still waiting for investigation. Thus, we believe the colony analysis combined with the data in Figure 1 and Figure 2 could indicate the bi-potency for human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This group uses the well-established CD56+/CD29+ sorting strategy to isolate muscle progenitor cells, however recent work has identified transcriptional heterogeneity within these human satellite cells (ie Barruet et al, eLife 2020). Given that they identify a tenocyte population in their human muscle biopsy in Figure 1a, it is critical to understand the heterogeneity contained within the population of human progenitors captured by the authors' FACS strategy and whether tenocytes contained within the muscle biopsy are also CD56+/CD29+.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your constructive suggestion. We have included more samples to perform scRNA-seq and reanalyzed the data. The scRNA-seq data revealed that all the CD29+/CD56+ cells were myogenic progenitors, which occupied 19.3% of all the myogenic progenitors (Fig. 1e). However, there existed no tenocytes with CD29+/CD56+ (Fig. 1d), and tenocytes made up only a small percentage (0.06%) of all the mononuclear cells. Thus, human CD29+/CD56+ cells are myogenic progenitors, and tenocytes contained within the muscle biopsy are not CD56+/CD29+. In addition, both published research and our results indicated the heterogeneity of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. Since the main purpose of current study was to investigate the tenogenic differentiation potential of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, the heterogeneity in CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors should be investigated in the further study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The bulk RNA sequencing data presented in Figure 3 to contrast the expression of progenitor cells under different differentiation conditions are not sufficiently convincing. In particular, it is unclear whether more than one sample was used for the RNAseq analyses shown in Figure 3. The volcano plots have many genes aligned on distinct curves suggesting that there are few replicates or low expression. There is also a concern that the sorted cells may contain tenocytes as tendon genes SCX, MKX, and THBS4 were among the genes upregulated in the myogenic differentiation conditions (shown in Figure 3b).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comment. Each group consisted of three samples for RNAseq analyses. We are sorry there existed a minor analysis mistake in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3c, which have been reanalyzed in the revised version. There was no significantly difference of tendon related marker genes after myogenic differentiation (Fig. 3b), while these tenogenic genes were significantly up-regulated after tenogenic induction (Fig. 3c). As for contamination of tenocytes, scRNA-seq data showed there were no tenocytes with both CD29 and CD56 positive (please see response to Comment 2). And almost all the obtained cells highly expressed myogenic progenitors markers PAX7/MYOD1/MYF5 (Fig. 1f-g). Low expression levels of tendon markers were identified in these cells (Fig. 2a-c). Furthermore, although tendon genes slightly upregulated in myogenic differentiation conditions, these markers dramatically upregulated in tenogenic differentiation conditions (Fig. 2c). Thus, we believe the bulk RNA sequencing data could add the evidence of tenogenic differentiation ability of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>scRNAseq assay using total mononuclear cell population did not provide meaningful insight that enriched knowledge on CD56+/CD29+ cell population. CD56+/CD29+ cells information may have been lost due to the minority identity of these cells in the total skeletal muscle mononuclear population, especially given the total cell number used for scRNAseq was very low and no information on participant number and repeat sample number used for this assay. Using this data to claim a stem cell lineage relationship for MuSCs and tenocytes may not convincing, as seeing both cell types in the total muscle mononuclear population does not establish a lineage connection between them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your constructive suggestion. We have included more samples to perform scRNA-seq and reanalyzed the data. Three samples with a total of 57,193 cells were included for analysis. As you can see in Fig. 1d and 1e, the joint expression analysis revealed that all the CD29+/CD56+ cells were myogenic progenitors, which occupied 19.3% of all the myogenic progenitors.  In addition, we agree with your comment that the pseudotime analysis could be a bit misleading as the nature of computational biology with pseudotime plots, so we deleted this assay.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The TGF-b pathway assay uses a small molecular inhibitor of TGF-b to probe Smad2/3. The assay conclusion regarding Smad2/3 pathway responsible for tenocyte differentiation may be overinterpretation without Smad2/3 specific inhibitors being applied in the experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comment. We agree with your comment and we have revised it in the revision version (Figure 7, Line 306-326).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This dual differentiation capability was not observed in mouse muscle stem cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comment. We have explored the tenogenic differentiation potential of mouse MuSCs both in vivo and in vitro. However, low tenogenic differentiation ability was revealed (Figure 4), which might be due to species diversity. Maybe it is more demanding for humans to maintain the homeostasis of the locomotion system and the whole organism locomotion ability in much longer life span and bigger body size. Thus, the current study also indicated that anima studies may not clinically relevant when investigating human diseases.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The methods section contained insufficient details for sample tissue for many methods, including the single cell analysis, RNA FISH, and for in vivo cardiotoxin treatment. ie. how were the samples subclustered for the monocle pseudotime analysis; how many cells were counted in the FISH shown in Fig 1e/f, does the n=5 refer to tissue sections or biological replicates?; for the double injury, what was the cardiotoxin dose?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comment. Three samples and a total 57,193 cells were analyzed in single cell analysis (Line 464). We deleted RNA FISH assay data because it provided limited information to prove bipotential ability of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. In addition, since the pseudotime analysis could be a bit misleading as the nature of computational biology with pseudotime plots, we also deleted this assay. For the double injury, 15μl of 10μM cardiotoxin was used for lineage tracing (Line 533).</p>

<p>scRNAseq of the sorted CD29/56+ population could help uncover possible cell heterogeneity within these muscle progenitors and which sub-populations of myogenic progenitor cells have tenogenic potential.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable suggestion. We included more cells from three biological repetitions to perform scRNA-seq and found that CD29/CD56+ cells were absolutely from myogenic progenitors (Fig. 1d and 1e). We agree with you that additional scRNAseq will be helpful to clarify the possible cell heterogeneity within these muscle progenitors. Since the main scope of current study is to investigate the biopotential of CD29/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, analysis of scRNAseq of the sorted CD29/56+ population would be performed in the further study for further exploration.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) scRNAseq is performed in total mononuclear cells isolated from human skeletal muscle. The cell number (around 15000 cells) seems very low for this assay, given the CD56+/CD29+ cells are a minority population in this sequencing, the data does not seem to provide meaningful insight into the MuSC cell identities. No information on sample numbers and number of patient participants can be found in the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comment. We added more cells to reanalyze the data in the revised manuscript. Three samples with a total of 57,193 cells were analyzed (Line 464). The joint expression analysis revealed that all the CD29+/CD56+ cells were myogenic progenitors, which occupied 19.3% of all the myogenic progenitors (Fig. 1d and 1e). These scRNA-seq data combined with functional experiment confirmed the MuSC cell identity of CD29+/CD56+ cells from mononuclear cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In this regard, the paragraph starts with &quot;To confirm the single cell analysis results, we first isolated myogenic progenitor cells from human muscle biopsy using FACS as described previously&quot; which is misleading as the seRNAseq is not the result of the sorted cells. Please reword this paragraph to clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The related paragraph has been reworded (Line 84-95).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly, the existence of myocytes and tenocytes in scRNAseq does not necessarily prove a stem cell and mature cell lineage relationship. Please edit the wording to avoid overinterpretation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your reminding. Since the pseudotime analysis could be a bit misleading as the nature of computational biology with pseudotime plots, we deleted this assay.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The in vitro differentiation assays are well performed, which included bulk culture and clonal culture. The efficiencies of those two assays seem to have discrepancies which may need clarification. Again, no sample numbers and repeats have been informed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since the tendon differentiation period for bulk culture was 12 days, those myotubes fused by CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors with only myogenic differentiation potential will be no longer alive. Thus, the efficiency of bulk culture seemed higher than that in clonal culture. As stated in statistical analysis, at least three biological replicates and technical repeats were performed in each experimental group (Line 577).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In these paragraphs, terminologies including MuSCs, myogenic progenitors, CD56+/CD29+, and Pax7+ are interchangeably used, which generates confusion while reading. It is probably best to consistently use the cell sorting markers markers to address this cell population, throughout the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your constructive suggestion. The cell population was consistently named as CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors throughout the paper.</p>

<p>Information on the proliferation rate and expansion of the MuSCs would be useful but not provided.</p>

<p>The murine cell differentiation assays are not as convincing as the human study. The assay regarding &quot;mouse muscle CD29+/CD56+ cells were isolated for tenogenic induction. However, very few mouse muscle CD29+/CD56+ cells expressed myogenic progenitor cell marker Pax7, MyoD1 and Vcam1&quot; does not add any value to the work as those markers are not mouse MuSC markers to start with.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comment. The experiments concerning mouse muscle CD29+/CD56+ cells have been deleted to avoid misleading.</p>

<p>The Pax7-cre-TdTomato assay was also not convincing, as a negative finding may not be the best proof of absence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comment. Pax7 positive cells could consistently express TdTomato for lineage tracing. In current study, large amount of tdTomato+ myofibers were observed after muscle injury (SFig. 2c-d), suggesting that the tracing system works well. However, less than 0.2% tendon cells originated from TdTomato+ MuSCs were observed even four months after tendon removal (Fig. 4f-g). When comparing in vivo data between murine MuSCs and human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, we believe these data could indicate the poor tendon differentiation abilities of murine MuSCs.</p>

<p>(5) TGFb as a pathway of smad2/3 mediated tenocyte differentiation assays were well done albeit not novel. Using TGFb universal inhibitor may not accurately state the pathways were due to SMAD2/3 inhibition either.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with your comment and the conclusion concerning SMAD2/3 has been deleted throughout the manuscript.</p>

<p>The paper also needs thorough proofreading. Currently, typographic, grammatical, and logical sequences of writing do not lend the paper to easy reading.</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1K and 1I have similar legends but presumably K is referring to MuSC and I is referring to differentiated cells.</p>
<p>(2) Tenogenic and myogenic induction should be changed to tenogenic/myogenic differentiation as they are the cells at the end of differentiation.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 6, it is not clear how the &quot;human cells&quot; are calculated in this assay.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your constructive comment. (1) The figure legends in Figure1 have been revised (Line 797-804).  (2) Tenogenic and myogenic induction have been changed to tenogenic/myogenic differentiation manuscript when they are referring to cells at the end of differentiation (Fig.1, Fig.2, Fig.3, Fig.4, Fig.7 and SFig.1). (3) In Figure 6, “human cells” is referring to those injured tendons with transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. To evaluate the function of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, PBS group was set as negative control and uninjured group was set as normal control.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The full extent of the differentiation potential of CD29+/CD56+ stem/progenitor cells has not been thoroughly evaluated. There can also exist heterotopic ossification in injured tendon sites. Thus, it remains unclear whether these cells are truly bipotent as the authors claim, or can they differentiate into chondrocytes and osteoblasts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comment. The current study focused on the tenogenic differentiation potential of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, so the research priority was the bipotential ability of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. We agree with you that chondrogenic and osteogenic ability of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors is also important and would investigate it in the further study.</p>

<p>(2) In Figure 3, the GO analysis also shows increased enrichment of muscle-related terms including muscle contraction and filament. Please clarify it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The tenogenic differentiation efficiency of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors was about 40% in clonal assay. Some cells would myogenically differentiated under this tenogenic induction system. Thus, the GO analysis could also enrich muscle related terms including muscle contraction and filament.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors use TNC staining to evaluate cell transplantation. My concern is whether the TNC expression is specific to the tendon site, or do engrafted human cells also express TNC in other sites such as muscle?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>TNC is one of a well-known tendon-related markers. As you can see in Figure 6b and Figure 6c, although some human cells (labeled by Lamin A/C) were engrafted in muscle tissue area (labeled by MyHC), these engrafted human cells didn’t express TNC in muscle. In addition, we also used tendon related markers SCX and TNMD to confirm the tenogenic differentiation ability of engrafted human cells in vivo (SFig. 3a and 3b).</p>

<p>(4) The authors demonstrate that CD29+/CD56+ human stem/progenitor cells could efficiently transplant and contribute to myofiber regeneration in vivo. However, why were only a few transplanted human cells differentiating into myofiber (labeled by MyHC) in the tenon injury model even with CTX injection?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comment. Since skeletal muscle is able to regenerate with in situ muscle progenitor cells, regeneration of injured muscle by CTX injection was dependent on not only CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, but also native murine MuSCs. Thus, it is reasonable that there were only a few transplanted human cells differentiating into myofiber (labeled by MyHC) in the tenon injury model even with CTX injection.</p>

<p>(5) Figure 7 shows the crucial role of TGFB/SMAD signaling for the tenogenesis of human CD29+/CD56+ stem/progenitor cells. However, can TGFB/SMAD signaling activation facilitate the tenogenic differentiation of mouse MuSCs? This point is crucial to clarify the difference of MuSCs between different species.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable suggestion. We did a series of pilot assays to investigate the effect of TGFβ signaling activation to facilitate tenogenic differentiation of mouse MuSCs (Author response image 1). As you can see, activating TGFβ by SRI-011381 could slightly increase the expression of tenogenic markers of murine MuSCs. It’s an interesting topic and we would investigate it in the further study.</p>
