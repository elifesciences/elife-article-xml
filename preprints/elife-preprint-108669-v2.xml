<abstract><p>The liver is a complex organ responsible for multiple functions, including metabolism, energy storage, detoxification, bile secretion, and immune regulation. Its highly organized vascular system plays a crucial role in maintaining functional zonation and tissue homeostasis. Within the liver, the hepatic artery, portal vein, hepatic vein, bile duct, and nerve networks intertwine to form an intricate three-dimensional architecture; however, traditional two-dimensional imaging fails to reveal their true spatial relationships, and current three-dimensional imaging methods remain insufficient to capture fine structural details. To achieve comprehensive visualization of these multi-ductal systems, we established a high-resolution three-dimensional imaging platform that combines multicolor perfusion of metallic compound nanoparticles (MCNPs) with an optimized tissue-clearing protocol (Liver-CUBIC), enabling simultaneous 3D reconstruction of the portal vein, hepatic artery, bile duct, and hepatic vein in mouse livers. Based on these data, we identified and defined a previously unrecognized structure located in the outer layer of the portal vein, termed the Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC). The PLC encircles the portal vein between the vascular endothelium and the perisinusoidal region, exhibits low-permeability barrier characteristics, and contains a distinctive population of CD34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells. During liver fibrosis, the PLC extends from the portal vein toward the hepatic lobule, forming a structural scaffold that guides bile duct and nerve migration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The liver performs diverse physiological functions, including nutrient metabolism, detoxification, bile secretion, and immune regulation, all of which depend on its unique microanatomy—the hepatic lobule, the smallest structural and functional unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Almazroo, Miah, &amp; Venkataramanan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Friedman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kalra et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ozougwu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yap &amp; Mitchell, 2022</xref>). To maintain efficient operation across the vast hepatic parenchyma, the liver has evolved an exceptionally complex ductal-vascular network composed of the portal vein, central vein, hepatic artery, biliary system, and intrahepatic autonomic nerve network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Miller, Oderberg, &amp; Goessling, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Q. Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). These systems form a multicompartmental 3D network that integrates blood transport, bile drainage, and neuroimmune regulation essential for maintaining hepatic homeostasis. Despite their distinct roles, these systems are spatially and functionally intertwined to coordinate metabolism, immunity, and regeneration within each lobule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Q. Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). While macroscopic vascular patterns and metabolic zonation have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lv et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Peeters et al., 2018</xref>), the micro-level interactions among these ductal systems within individual lobules remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Traditional two-dimensional (2D) histology provides high spatial resolution but cannot reconstruct the true 3D continuity of vascular structures or their relationships across multiple ductal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hankeova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kim, Chen, Alpini, &amp; Lau, 2015</xref>). Thus, three-dimensional (3D) visualization of multiple intrahepatic networks is essential for understanding liver development, homeostasis, and disease. Conventional imaging modalities such as ultrasound, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer macroscopic resolution but cannot resolve micrometer-scale vascular details. X-ray phase-contrast computed tomography (PCCT) achieves contrast-agent-free microvascular imaging in rat livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Qin et al., 2017</xref>), yet still lacks subcellular resolution. Similarly, the double resin-casting micro computed tomography (DUCT) technique reconstructed 3D portal vein–bile duct networks using dual-color resin casting, but failed to visualize luminal structures smaller than 5 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hankeova et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, a high-resolution, multicolor 3D imaging approach is required to elucidate terminal interactions such as portal vein–artery coupling, bile duct–vessel countercurrent exchange, and nerve–vessel communication.</p>
<p>Developing such imaging approaches for the liver remains technically challenging. The hepatic vasculature is highly dense (sinusoids occupy 10–15% of the liver volume) and intricately intertwined, demanding submicron resolution and millimeter-scale penetration depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lv et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Segovia-Miranda et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, tissue-specific autofluorescence (e.g., from bilirubin, lipofuscin, collagen, and NADPH/FAD) impairs optical clearing and fluorescence signal quality, yielding low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Molina et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tainaka et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the liver’s multiple intrahepatic systems—blood vessels, bile ducts, nerves, lymphatics, and immune networks—are functionally interdependent, yet current methods lack efficient 3D multi-target labeling strategies to visualize them simultaneously. Consequently, existing clearing and labeling protocols (such as CLARITY, iDISCO, and conventional immunofluorescence) remain limited in depth, resolution, and SNR, leaving the liver far behind other organs in 3D multicolor imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Molina et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>To address these challenges, we developed a liver-adapted, high-fidelity 3D visualization strategy tailored for the hepatic multi-ductal system. This platform integrates several key innovations: (1) The optimized Liver-CUBIC tissue clearing protocol shortened the clearing duration by 63.89% and enhanced optical transmittance by 20.12%, compared with the original CUBIC protocol; (2) Multicolor metal compound nanoparticles (MCNPs), which provide stable, simultaneous labeling of the portal vein, hepatic artery, bile duct, and central vein, and support multimodal imaging at subcellular resolution; and (3) A multimodal immunolabeling system compatible with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and tyramide signal amplification (TSA)-based multiplex staining, allowing high signal-to-noise 3D mapping of vascular and cellular structures.</p>
<p>Using this platform, we achieved liver 3D visualization at single-cell resolution and discovered a previously unrecognized structure, the Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC). The PLC is periodically distributed along the portal vein axis and closely associated with terminal bile duct branches and autonomic nerve plexuses, forming a specialized interaction unit.</p>
<p>Single-cell transcriptomic and multiplex 3D immunostaining analyses revealed that the PLC exhibits distinct localization, morphology, and gene expression signatures, suggesting it may play a crucial role in hepatic microanatomical coordination.</p>
<p>In summary, this liver-specific multicolor 3D visualization system enables comprehensive mapping of hepatic ductal-vascular interactions from the organ to the single-cell level. It not only demonstrates the power of the platform in resolving complex hepatic microstructures but also establishes a new technical foundation for investigating hepatic physiology and pathological remodeling.</p>

<title>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-enhanced CUBIC clearing with multicolor nanoparticles enables high-resolution 3D mapping of the hepatic ductal–vascular network</title>
<p>The CUBIC (Clear, Unobstructed Brain/Body Imaging Cocktails and Computational analysis) technique has been widely applied in the tissue clearing and 3D imaging of organs such as the brain, kidney, and heart due to its excellent compatibility with various fluorescent dyes and immunolabeling protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tainaka et al., 2014</xref>). However, the application of CUBIC in liver tissue remains challenging because of the liver’s high heme content and densely packed cellular architecture, which leads to pronounced light scattering and markedly limits the clearing efficacy. Furthermore, the conventional CUBIC protocol requires up to 9 days for liver tissue processing, severely restricting experimental throughput (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, red schematic). To address these limitations, Laura M. Molina et al. incorporated a hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) bleaching step into the CLARITY protocol, improving liver transparency but failing to reduce the processing time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Molina et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we developed an optimized clearing strategy termed Liver-CUBIC, featuring two key modifications: (1) Integration of an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-CUBIC hybrid system, incorporating an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> bleaching step into the CUBIC workflow. This technical improvement effectively removes pigments such as heme and lipofuscin through oxidative reactions, while partially clearing lipid components to reduce light scattering; (2) Optimization of urea concentration, increasing from 25% to 40%, enhancing protein denaturation to minimize light scattering and improve tissue permeability, thus promoting more uniform reagent distribution. Experimental results confirmed that the Liver-CUBIC protocol significantly improved liver clearing efficiency (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Specifically, initial PBS/PFA perfusion efficiently removed residual heme; subsequent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> bleaching eliminated pigment deposits; and final 40% urea treatment achieved refractive index homogenization (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using this optimized protocol, the total clearing time was reduced from 9 days with conventional CUBIC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, red schematic) to 3.25 days with 40% urea + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, green schematic), representing a 63.89% increase in efficiency. Importantly, no significant tissue expansion was observed following Liver-CUBIC treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>). Transmittance measurements revealed that the Liver-CUBIC protocol (40% urea + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) markedly outperformed conventional CUBIC, with an average transmittance improvement of 20.12% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; 95% <italic>CI</italic>: 19.14–21.09) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, in 1 mm-thick liver sections, the clearing time was reduced to just 20 minutes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), while real-time imaging demonstrated complete clearing of 200 μm-thick slices within 60 seconds (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, and Figure 1—video 1), fully meeting the demands for rapid live imaging.</p>

<p>Metal compound nanoparticles (MCNPs) exhibit excellent brightness, tunable multicolor properties, and strong resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> bleaching, maintaining color stability even after Liver-CUBIC clearing. Utilizing four distinct MCNP colors — pink, green, black, and yellow — we developed a four-channel vascular labeling strategy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The hepatic artery was perfused with yellow MCNPs via the left ventricle, bile ducts were retrogradely injected with green MCNPs through the extrahepatic duct, portal veins were directly filled with pink MCNPs, and central veins were labeled using black MCNPs via the inferior vena cava. Using this method, simultaneous four-color labeling of the intrahepatic ductal-vascular system can be achieved (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-G</xref>), while single- or dual-color labeling allows for higher-resolution visualization of fine microscale structures. High-resolution 3D imaging revealed that MCNP-Green-labeled large intrahepatic bile ducts exhibit a one-to-one parallel topology with adjacent portal vein branches. At the periphery, the terminal biliary network forms a classic three-dimensional plexus, characterized by helical configurations and polygonal extensions projecting into the hepatic lobules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Meanwhile, MCNP-Pink-labeled portal veins displayed a typical tree-like branching pattern in the central regions of hepatic lobes, but in the marginal areas, they formed an unusually dense, radial micro-branching pattern (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Notably, the terminal micro-branches of the portal vein appeared not only around secondary branches but also intermittently along the main trunks, challenging the conventional notion of strictly hierarchical vascular bifurcation. For MCNP-Black-labeled central veins, imaging revealed sparse, circular or oval fenestrae measuring 5–10 μm in diameter distributed across the surface of the central vein trunks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Previous scanning electron microscopy studies have described similar structures, which are thought to facilitate the return of hepatocyte-synthesized metabolic products (such as lipoproteins and cytokines) into the circulation, assist immune cell trafficking from the liver to the systemic circulation, and help maintain hepatic sinusoid–interstitium osmotic pressure balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mak &amp; Shin, 2021</xref>). Additionally, dual-label imaging using MCNP-Pink and MCNP-Green demonstrated that the hepatic artery runs parallel to the portal vein trunk, with the hepatic artery displaying a notably smaller diameter compared to its adjacent portal vein. At the periphery, hepatic arterial branches formed a three-dimensional entwined network that closely contacted the portal vein micro-branches (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, combining Liver-CUBIC with MCNPs enabled highly efficient, simultaneous mapping of intrahepatic bile ducts, portal veins, central veins, and hepatic arteries in mice at cellular resolution, revealing their spatial organization and topological relationships.</p>

<title>The periportal lamellar complex (PLC) serves as a low-permeability gateway bridging portal veins to hepatic lobules</title>
<p>In this study, scanning electron microscopy revealed that MCNP dye is a nanoparticle-based labeling agent with a diameter of approximately 150-200 nm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Our experimental results showed that MCNPs were primarily distributed within the lumens of blood vessels and bile ducts through physical perfusion, without exhibiting specific molecular binding capacity. Under our perfusion conditions, the dye signals remained confined to the luminal regions, clearly delineating the morphology of vascular and biliary structures without diffusing into the surrounding parenchyma (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-H</xref>). However, due to the increased imaging depth of liver tissue after optical clearing, nuclear stains such as DAPI often generate highly dense fluorescence signals that obscure fine vascular and perivascular structures (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I, J</xref>). Thus, our imaging analyses primarily focused on the high-resolution visualization of the spatial architecture of the vascular and biliary systems.</p>

<p>We employed a dual-channel vascular labeling strategy to simultaneously visualize the portal vein and hepatic artery systems in the mouse liver. Specifically, MCNP-Green was employed to label the portal venous system by injection from portal vein, while MCNP-Pink marked the hepatic arterial system by injection via left ventricular (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Extended depth-of-field (EDOF) imaging revealed that MCNP-Green specifically labels a distinct vascular structural unit located in the adventitial layer of the portal vein trunk, which we designate as the Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>, orange arrows). Morphologically, this structure consists of fine vascular branches distributed along the surface of the portal vein trunk. Its base is anchored to the portal vein, and it radiates outward in a lobular pattern centered on the portal vein, giving rise to multiple terminal branches that directly connect to the liver sinusoids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The PLC structures align in a serial arrangement along the portal vein trunk (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Further validation by confocal fluorescence imaging confirmed that following portal vein perfusion with MCNP-Green, fluorescence signals are highly enriched within the PLC. Quantitative analysis showed that the fluorescence intensity within the PLC was significantly higher than that observed in the portal vein lumen and liver sinusoid regions, with minimal dye diffusion at the PLC periphery, indicating predominant localization within the main PLC structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-J</xref>). In contrast, MCNP-Pink signals, introduced via hepatic artery perfusion, predominantly localized within the PLC and its margins without crossing into adjacent PLC units. Due to differences in perfusion pathways, the pink dye demonstrated a greater tendency to extend from the PLC towards the lobular parenchyma compared to the green dye. This phenomenon likely reflects the relatively low permeability of the PLC region: green nanoparticles delivered through the portal vein are largely retained within the low-permeability PLC core, with limited peripheral diffusion, whereas the arterial pink dye, influenced by the pressure and flow characteristics of the hepatic artery system, effectively labels the peripheral PLC structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-J</xref>).</p>
<p>To further characterize PLC distribution, we used the EDOF imaging system to quantitatively analyze the distribution of PLC structures in relation to portal vein diameter and anatomical location. By defining classical hexagonal hepatic lobule units through the primary portal vein trunk containing PLC structures and its two adjacent secondary branches (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>), quantitative analysis revealed that the length of the primary portal vein trunk ranged from 269.85 μm to 1513.67 μm (<italic>n</italic> = 19), with a median length of 769.89 μm (<italic>IQR</italic>: 593.67 μm – 987.77 μm), the number of PLC structures per trunk ranged from 1 to 4, with 68.42% (13/19) of portal veins containing two PLCs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Notably, neither the number nor the area of PLCs showed significant correlation with the length of the portal vein trunk (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K, L</xref>), indicating that morphological parameters alone (such as trunk length) may be insufficient to define hepatic lobular units, especially given the substantial differences in blood transport capacity among portal veins of varying diameters. The diameters of the primary portal veins bearing PLC structures ranged from 63.45 μm to 321.42 μm, and PLC area showed a significant positive correlation with portal vein diameter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>), whereas PLC number did not correlate with diameter (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1M</xref>). This diameter–area relationship may reflect a functional adaptation of the portal venous system in metabolically active liver regions: larger-diameter portal veins accommodate higher blood flow and consequently experience greater shear stress on the vessel wall. The formation of PLC structures in the adventitial layer may participate in local blood flow regulation, maintenance of microenvironmental homeostasis.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that the Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC) is not only a morphologically and spatially distinct, low-permeability vascular unit surrounding the portal vein, but also likely serves as a critical nexus connecting the portal vein, hepatic artery, and liver sinusoids. Thus, the PLC constitutes a key node within the interactive vascular network of the mouse liver.</p>

<title>Spatial juxtaposition of the periportal lamellar complex with canals of Hering at the portal venous interface</title>
<p>To further investigate the potential relationship between the PLC and bile delivery regulation within the hepatic lobule, we employed a dual-channel vascular-biliary labeling strategy to simultaneously visualize the mouse liver portal vein and bile duct systems.</p>
<p>We combined MCNP-Pink labeling of the portal vein and its associated PLC structures with three-dimensional DAB immunohistochemical staining for CK19 to visualize the bile duct epithelial architecture. EDOF imaging revealed a consistent 1:1 anatomical association between the primary portal vein trunk (diameter 280 ± 32 μm) and the first-order bile duct (diameter 69 ± 8 μm) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Multiview imaging showed that second-order bile ducts are distributed along the portal vein trunk and branch directionally toward the PLC. The terminal portions, namely the canals of Hering, form the distal bile duct network responsible for bile collection and are located at the interface between hepatic lobules, rather than being evenly distributed around the portal vein. These terminal ducts are specifically concentrated within the PLC surrounding the portal vein, displaying marked spatial colocalization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This finding suggests a potential anatomical spatial association between the terminal canals of Hering and the periportal PLC structures. Furthermore, based on MCNP-Green labeling of the biliary tract, combined with 3D DAB-CK19 staining, both EDOF imaging and 3D confocal fluorescence imaging consistently confirmed that the terminal regions of the biliary network—responsible for collecting bile from the hepatic parenchyma—are primarily located adjacent to the PLC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>To delineate the microscopic architecture underlying bile flow from the hepatic parenchyma into the bile duct network, we employed three-dimensional TSA-based multiplex immunofluorescence to simultaneously label the tight junction protein ZO1, the hepatocyte nuclear marker HNF4A, and the bile duct epithelial marker CK19 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Three-dimensional confocal imaging demonstrated that bile canaliculi on the hepatocyte surface formed polygonal networks demarcated by ZO1, while terminal bile duct epithelial cells also organized into luminal structures via ZO1, arranged in either single- or multicellular rings, thereby establishing an interface between the canalicular network and the bile duct system. However, detailed morphological analysis suggested that this connection does not occur directly between the bile canaliculi and the terminal bile duct epithelial cells. Instead, bile duct epithelial cells at the terminal ducts extended partially along the canalicular network without directly participating in the formation of the bile duct lumen (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This finding indicates that these cells may remain in an immature state or possess alternative stem/progenitor cell-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Banales et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">de Jong, van den Heuvel, Wells, &amp; Porte, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>To further verify the precise interface between the terminal bile ducts and the bile canalicular network, we performed retrograde perfusion of MCNP-Green dye through the common bile duct while progressively increasing the perfusion pressure. When the dye pressure exceeded a defined threshold, dye leakage was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-H</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Quantitative analysis of ultra–deep-focus images demonstrated that the dye leakage sites were primarily located adjacent to the PLC structures, rather than in the perisinusoidal regions surrounding the portal vein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).</p>
<p>This observation further supports our earlier hypothesis: first-order bile ducts distribute along the portal vein trunk, secondary bile ducts branch directionally toward the PLC regions, and terminal bile duct branches converge spatially adjacent to the PLC, where they collect bile drained from the hepatic lobules. These results suggest that the PLC may serve not only as a spatial positional cue guiding bile duct growth and branching but also as a regulatory node involved in coordinating bile drainage from the hepatic lobule into the biliary network.</p>

    <p>To investigate the molecular characteristics and potential functional roles of endothelial cells (ECs) within the PLC, we re-analyzed publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of liver endothelial cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from three healthy adult mouse livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Su et al., 2021</xref>).

<p>The PLC structures are anatomically located within the transitional zone between portal vein ECs and periportal LSECs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Most characteristic genes within this region exhibited a continuous gradient expression pattern rather than a distinct binary classification. Based on this spatial continuum, we hypothesized that PLC endothelial cells might display a hybrid transcriptional signature, co-expressing marker genes from both adjacent populations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Venn diagram intersection analysis combined with differential gene expression screening identified a set of candidate genes potentially specific to PLC endothelial cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). TSA staining confirmed that CD31, a pan-endothelial marker, reliably delineated the spatial boundaries of portal vein ECs, PLC endothelium, and periportal LSECs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Notably, CD34 and Sca-1 (Ly6a) were co-expressed exclusively within PLC structures surrounding the portal vein, but absent from central vein ECs and midzonal LSECs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>We further examined the spatial distribution of other endothelial-associated markers in two-dimensional liver sections. CD36 specifically labeled periportal LSECs, while PDGFRβ was broadly expressed across multiple intrahepatic endothelial subtypes (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Given that CD34 and Sca-1 are classical markers of mesenchymal stem cells and intrahepatic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), these observations suggest potential stem/progenitor-like properties of PLC-associated endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agrawal, Mehatre, &amp; Khurana, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morcos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">B.

<p>Further analysis revealed that the CD34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> endothelial population marking the PLC structures exhibited significantly upregulated expression of HSC-associated genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). <italic>Mecom</italic>, a critical transcriptional regulator essential for HSC self-renewal and highly expressed in human and approximately 60% of murine long-term HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Christodoulou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Y.

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis further revealed that differentially expressed genes in the CD34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> population were significantly enriched in pathways associated with the development, proliferation, and differentiation of multiple stem cell types (including hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells), as well as in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). These findings suggest that this unique endothelial cell subset in the periportal region may possess dual regulatory functions in both metabolic and hematopoietic modulation.</p>
<p>Finally, the main trunk of the PLC is composed of CD34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). A distinct “hematopoietic stem cell–vascular” niche was formed by CD34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> double-positive cells. This niche was located at the basal region of the PLC structure. These results suggest that PLC endothelial cells may not only regulate periportal microcirculatory blood flow but also help establish a specialized microenvironment that potentially supports periportal hematopoietic regulation, contributing to stem cell recruitment, vascular homeostasis, and tissue repair.</p>

<p>During liver fibrosis progression, proliferation and infiltration of terminal bile duct branches (Canals of Hering) into the hepatic parenchyma represent a core feature of the intrahepatic ductular reaction (DR), critically influencing disease progression, liver regeneration, and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carpino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Clouston et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Strazzabosco &amp; Fabris, 2012</xref>).

(4)with advancing fibrosis, the extension of CK19<sup>+</sup> bile duct termini into the parenchyma was markedly greater after 6 weeks of CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment compared to 3 weeks, suggesting a coordinated expansion of bile duct branches alongside PLC structures that correlates with fibrosis severity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E, F</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, single-cell transcriptomic re-analysis revealed significant upregulation of bile duct-related genes in the CD34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> endothelium of PLC in fibrotic liver, with notably high expression of <italic>Lgals1</italic> (Galectin-1) and <italic>Hgf</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Previous studies have shown that Galectin-1 is absent in normal liver parenchyma but highly expressed in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), correlating with tumor dedifferentiation and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bacigalupo, Manzi, Rabinovich, &amp; Troncoso, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shimonishi et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), particularly in combination with epidermal growth factor (EGF) in 3D cultures, promotes hepatic progenitor cells to form bile duct-polarized cystic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">N. Tanimizu, Miyajima, &amp; Mostov, 2007</xref>). Together, these findings suggest the PLC endothelium may act as a key regulator of bile duct branching and fibrotic microenvironment remodeling in liver fibrosis.</p>
<p>Collectively, our results demonstrate that the PLC, situated between the portal vein and periportal sinusoidal endothelium, constitutes a critical vascular microenvironmental unit. It may not only colocalize with bile duct branches under normal physiological conditions, but also through its basal CD34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> double-positive endothelial cells, potentially orchestrate bile duct epithelial proliferation, branching morphogenesis, and bile acid transport homeostasis via multiple signaling pathways. Particularly during liver fibrosis progression, the PLC exhibits dynamic structural extension, serving as a spatial scaffold facilitating terminal bile duct migration and expansion into the hepatic parenchyma (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). These findings highlight the PLC endothelial cell population and the vascular-bile duct interface as key regulatory hubs in bile duct regeneration, tissue repair, and pathological remodeling, providing novel cellular and molecular insights for understanding bile duct-related diseasessuch as ductular reaction, cholangiocarcinoma, and cholestatic disorders, and offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<p>Previous studies have further explained the physiological basis for this difference: even among species that differ in parenchymal sympathetic innervation (i.e., species with or without direct sympathetic input), their sympathetic efferent regulatory functions may remain comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beckh, Fuchs, Ballé, &amp; Jungermann, 1990</xref>). This is because signals released from aminergic and peptidergic nerve terminals can be transmitted to hepatocytes in the form of electrical impulses through intercellular gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hertzberg &amp; Gilula, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jensen, Alpini, &amp; Glaser, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seseke, Gardemann, &amp; Jungermann, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Taher, Farr, &amp; Adeli, 2017</xref>). However, the scarcity of nerve fibers within the mouse hepatic parenchyma implies that the mechanisms of autonomic regulation of liver function in mice may differ from those in humans, prompting us to further investigate the potential role of PLC endothelial cells in this process.</p>
<p>We further identified that the <italic>CD34</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Sca-1</italic><sup>+</sup> endothelium of the PLC exhibits prominent neurodevelopmental molecular features. Differential gene expression analysis revealed significant upregulation of multiple genes associated with neurogenesis and axon guidance within this population (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), including <italic>Nrg1</italic>. Previous studies have shown that NRG-1 is present in intrahepatic nerves and colocalizes with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Exposure to high doses of bisphenol A (BPA) significantly increases the density of NRG-1–immunoreactive fibers in intrahepatic nerves and enhances the colocalization of NRG-1 with VIP, suggesting that NRG-1 in intrahepatic nerves may play a role in BPA-induced liver injury and/or liver regeneration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Szymańska, Makowska, Całka, &amp; Gonkowski, 2020</xref>); <italic>ADGRG6</italic> (GPR126) might regulate liver innervation through non-myelination-related mechanisms. Indeed, GPR126 has been shown to mediate Schwann cell–dependent and independent processes during peripheral nerve injury and repair, influencing axon guidance, mechanosensing, and ECM remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mogha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Monk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">S. C. Petersen et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that GPR126 may participate in neural–microenvironment communication within the periportal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Monk, Oshima, Jörs, Heller, &amp; Talbot, 2011</xref>). Subsequent GO enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in this cell cluster demonstrated significant activation of pathways related to neuronal projection and central nervous system differentiation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have confirmed that the highest density of hepatic parenchymal innervation originates from postganglionic sympathetic neurons located in the celiac ganglion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mizuno &amp; Ueno, 2017</xref>). Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry is the preferred method to visualize noradrenergic sympathetic innervation of hepatocytes and vasculature in both rodents and humans(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adori et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, confocal three-dimensional imaging revealed that TH<sup>+</sup> sympathetic nerve fibers form a characteristic “neuronal bead-chain” network along the PLC structure, with nerve terminals terminating at the PLC base and around vascular bundles, suggesting a potential regulatory role of the PLC in controlling functional zones within the hepatic lobule (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>).</p>
<p>Further validation using a CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced mouse liver fibrosis model demonstrated that: (1) during fibrosis progression, sympathetic nerve fibers progressively extend along the PLC structure, accompanied by nerve terminal branching and infiltration into the hepatic parenchyma; (2) after 6 weeks of CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment, TH<sup>+</sup> nerve fibers extended significantly farther into the hepatic parenchyma compared to 3 weeks, indicating a coordinated expansion trend of bile duct branches, PLC structures, and sympathetic nerve networks closely associated with fibrosis severity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D, E</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomic volcano plot re-analysis revealed significant upregulation of neural-related genes within the <italic>CD34</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Sca-1</italic><sup>+</sup> endothelium of PLC in the fibrosis group, notably including EDNRB (Endothelin receptor type B), which plays a critical role in the development of neural crest-derived autonomic nervous system components, including the liver(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">N. Tanimizu et al., 2007</xref>). Nestin, a type VI intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, has recently been implicated in tissue homeostasis during wound healing. For example, in traumatic CNS injury, Nestin is induced in reactive astrocytes contributing to glial scar formation. Additionally, Nestin expression correlates with the severity of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. In the healthy adult liver, Nestin is nearly absent but is upregulated following acute or chronic hepatic injury, indicating its potential role in liver regeneration(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ahmed, Kunisaki, Merad, &amp; Frenette, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>To further validate the reliability of our findings, we incorporated another high-depth single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset for cross-analysis and re-exploration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pietilä et al., 2025</xref>). This dataset provides a detailed molecular atlas of the major cell types in the adult mouse liver. In their original analysis, Pietilä et al. annotated cluster #e2 as portal vein endothelial cells based on well-established cell-type-specific markers, such as Ly6a/Sca-1 and Cd34 for portal vein endothelium. This annotation closely aligns with the CD34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> endothelial cell population we identified in the PLC region, providing cross-dataset preliminary validation for the existence and core molecular features of this endothelial subpopulation.</p>
    <p>Building on this, we performed targeted re-analysis of the reference dataset: by selecting the CD34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> double-positive cell population, we found that their highly expressed gene profile closely matched our own database results, notably including genes related to hematopoietic stem cells (e.g., <italic>ACE</italic>, <italic>Mecom</italic>), bile duct-associated genes (e.g., <italic>DLL4</italic>, <italic>JCAD</italic>), and neural-associated genes (e.g., <italic>NRG1</italic>,<italic>Adgrg6</italic>), all of which were significantly upregulated (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D—source data 1).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of this cell population further confirmed that pathways related to hematopoietic stem cell function regulation (including stem cell development and differentiation), neural development (e.g., neural development), and bile duct-related processes (epithelial tube formation pathway) were all significantly upregulated (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This result echoes the gene expression characteristics, as it not only strengthens the functional associations between CD34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells in the PLC region and the hematopoietic, bile duct, and nervous systems, but also provides molecular evidence for their multipotential regulatory properties</p>
<p>These findings suggest that this specific endothelial subpopulation of PLC may participate in neural branching development and fibrotic microenvironment remodeling, exhibiting multifunctional regulatory potential(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Accurate three-dimensional mapping of the liver is crucial for understanding its function and disease mechanisms. Conventional 2D histology and flow cytometry lose spatial information, particularly in the liver’s complex ductal-vascular systems. To address technical challenges in 3D liver imaging—namely, tissue opacity due to heme, lipids, and dense connective tissue, and trade-offs between resolution and field of view—we developed the Liver-CUBIC system. By optimizing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> bleaching and urea concentration, tissue transparency was significantly improved, while multicolor metal compound nanoparticles (MCNPs) enabled four-channel labeling of portal veins, hepatic arteries, central veins, and bile ducts. This approach allows high-resolution 3D visualization of fine microstructures, including terminal bile duct arborization, portal vein branching, and central vein fenestrations, providing a robust platform for studying liver microcirculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hankeova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Peeters et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Qi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Renier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tainaka et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The labeling strategy relies on perfusing contrast-complementary MCNPs into multiple vascular and ductal compartments. By carefully controlling injection site, pressure, and volume—combined with 15 μL microinjection needles and post-perfusion vessel ligation—we ensured even dye distribution and structural fidelity. High-density image data can be simplified using dual-channel overlays (e.g., portal vein and bile duct), and multiple imaging modalities (e.g., stereomicroscopy, confocal, or extended-depth microscopy) can be chosen depending on the desired resolution or field of view. Moreover, the dyes demonstrate robust fluorescence under laser-scanning microscopy, enabling clear 3D structural imaging.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the current imaging thickness of our method is mostly around 200 μm, and it is not yet possible to achieve whole-liver tissue three-dimensional reconstruction at the level of light-sheet microscopy. However, through MCNP perfusion experiments on intact, unsectioned liver lobes, we have demonstrated dye distribution results covering the entire liver lobe (as shown in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplements1F</xref>): the images fully present the three-dimensional branching pattern and distribution range of the bile duct system within the liver lobe, clearly showing the continuous network structure from the main trunk to the terminal branches. This confirms that our study can also achieve overall visualization of the vascular system at the whole-organ level.</p>
<p>Although this system has significant advantages, it remains sensitive to anatomical variations of the liver, such as lobe overlap and heterogeneous vascular architecture. At vascular intersections, local perfusion may be uneven or excessively aggregated; therefore, injection strategies and perfusion parameters need to be adjusted according to liver size and vessel status to improve reproducibility and imaging quality. It should be noted that the results obtained with this method are primarily intended to visualize the overall and fine structures of the hepatic vascular and ductal systems, rather than to precisely reflect hemodynamic processes. In the future, we plan to further investigate the diffusion characteristics of the dyes within the liver microcirculation using in vivo perfusion or dynamic fluid models.</p>
<p>Using this system, we identified a previously unrecognized structure located on the adventitia of the main portal vein, which we termed the Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC). The PLC consists of multi-branched extensions radiating from the outer membrane of the main portal vein. Notably, it is absent in terminal vessels and other vascular systems, challenging the conventional “strict hierarchical bifurcation” model of vascular organization. The PLC is spatially associated with terminal branches of both bile ducts and hepatic arteries, suggesting possible roles in local microenvironmental regulation through physical or signaling interactions.</p>
<p>Multiplex immunostaining revealed that cholangiocytes extend along ZO-1<sup>+</sup> bile canalicular networks but display an elongated, immature morphology without forming complete lumens (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). This observation aligns with previous findings that HNF4α<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes and CK19<sup>+</sup> cholangiocytes can jointly form bile-excreting conduits, supporting a guiding role for the PLC in bile duct positioning and morphogenesis(Naoki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tanimizu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Morphologically, the PLC shares features with previously described telocytes (TCs)—a recently identified class of interstitial cells in the liver observed via transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry as CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with multiple long telopodes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Xiao, Wang, Liu, &amp; Yang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). However, functional and molecular characterization of TCs remains limited, and their direct relationship with the PLC is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed a CD34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> endothelial cell population enriched within the PLC that expressed hematopoiesis-related genes and stem cell regulatory pathways(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Su et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that the PLC may not only provide structural support but also serve as a perivascular stem cell niche specific to the portal region, potentially involved in hematopoiesis and tissue regeneration. Supporting this, Sca-1 expression is localized to the portal region during mouse liver development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gomez-Salinero et al., 2022</xref>), and Nestin<sup>+</sup>NG2<sup>+</sup> precursor cells in the fetal liver also concentrate near the portal vein, where they express key HSC-supportive factors such as SCF and CXCL12(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ahmed et al., 2013</xref>) — highlighting the PLC as a key component of the hepatic vascular-stem cell microenvironment.</p>
<p>Further analysis showed significant upregulation of genes involved in neurodevelopment and axonal guidance in the CD34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cluster, along with activation of neuronal signaling pathways. Immunostaining confirmed the presence of TH<sup>+</sup> sympathetic nerve fibers wrapping around the PLC in a “beads-on-a-string” pattern (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), consistent with a classic neurovascular unit(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adori et al., 2021</xref>). Previous studies have shown that sympathetic nerves enter the liver along collagen fibers of Glisson’s capsule and interact with hepatic arteries, portal veins, and bile duct epithelium, supporting the PLC as a scaffold for intrahepatic neurovascular integration.</p>
<p>In CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced hepatotoxic fibrosis models, injury and toxic metabolite accumulation are primarily restricted to the centrilobular region, while bile ducts extend linearly toward the central vein(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kaneko, Kamimoto, Miyajima, &amp; Itoh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). We observed dynamic elongation of the PLC in parallel with fibrosis progression, indicating its role as a spatial scaffold for ductal expansion. This suggests potential involvement in ductular reactions and neural remodeling during fibrosis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides the first systematic characterization of the PLC as a structural and functional interface among hepatic vasculature, bile ducts, and nerves. The PLC serves as a directional scaffold for ductal growth, a specialized stem cell niche, and a potential site of neurovascular coupling. These findings provide novel insights into hepatic homeostasis, bile duct development, and fibrotic remodeling, and suggest that the PLC and its CD34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> endothelial population may represent promising therapeutic targets for diseases such as cholangiocarcinoma and primary sclerosing cholangitis.</p>

<title>Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of MCNPs</title>
<p>Prior to imaging, MCNP dye solutions were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove aggregates and impurities. The supernatant was diluted 50-fold, and 3–4 μL of the diluted sample was applied onto freshly glow-discharged Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 300 mesh). After a 30 s incubation to allow particle adsorption, excess liquid was gently blotted with filter paper and the grid was air-dried at room temperature. Samples were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 s and air-dried again before imaging.</p>
<p>Negative-stain TEM images were acquired using a 120 kV JEOL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Japan) equipped with a CCD camera. Data collection was performed using standard imaging conditions.</p>

            <title>Single-Cell Data Mining</title>
            <p>We re-analyzed published single-cell transcriptomic datasets of liver endothelial cells (ECs) sorted by FACS from three normal mouse livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Su et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we downloaded single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data published by Su et al. from a public database and preprocessed the data according to the filtering criteria reported in the original study, retaining only GFP-positive cells.</p>
            <p>Subsequently, standard analysis procedures were performed using Seurat (v5.0.3), including quality control, normalization, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. Cell populations were annotated based on marker genes reported in the literature, and UMAP was used to visualize cell distribution. We further quantified the abundance of different endothelial cell (EC) subpopulations. After extracting the Seurat object for ECs, clustering results were corrected and re-clustered. Differential expression analysis was performed using the FindMarkers function. During this process, we selected the intersection of highly variable genes and differentially expressed genes in ECs as a candidate gene set and generated a heatmap showing the top 20 differentially expressed genes from portal vein ECs to periportal LSECs. Within this intersecting gene set, Cd34 and Sca-1 were identified. We then extracted the Cd34<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> double-positive subpopulation from both portal vein and periportal vein clusters and continued analysis and differential gene screening according to the Seurat workflow.</p>
            <p>Finally, the differentially expressed genes (p_val &lt; 0.05 and avg_log2FC &gt; 0.3) were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis with ont = “BP”. Enrichment bar plots and volcano plots were generated using ggplot2 (v3.5.1) to illustrate key differentially expressed genes and their functional enrichment.</p>
            <p>To validate these results, we downloaded data from another public dataset containing cell populations similar to the PLC in our study. After extracting the target population (e2), cells were divided into Cd34-and Sca-1-positive and -negative groups, and the previous analyses—including differential expression and enrichment analyses—were repeated for validation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pietilä et al., 2025</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Chengjian Zhao et al. focused on the interactions between vascular, biliary, and neural networks in the liver microenvironment, addressing the critical bottleneck that the lack of high-resolution 3D visualization has hindered understanding of these interactions in liver disease.</p>

<p>This study developed a high-resolution multiplex 3D imaging method that integrates multicolor metallic compound nanoparticle (MCNP) perfusion with optimized CUBIC tissue clearing. This method enables the simultaneous 3D visualization of spatial networks of the portal vein, hepatic artery, bile ducts, and central vein in the mouse liver. The authors reported a perivascular structure termed the Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC), which is identified along the portal vein axis.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present manuscript of Xu et al. reports a novel clearing and imaging method focusing on the liver. The Authors simultaneously visualized the portal vein, hepatic artery, central vein, and bile duct systems by injected metal compound nanoparticles (MCNPs) with different colors into the portal vein, heart left ventricle, vena cava inferior and the extrahepatic bile duct, respectively. The method involves: trans-cardiac perfusion with 4% PFA, the injection of MCNPs with different colors, clearing with the modified CUBIC method, cutting 200 micrometer thick slices by vibratome, and then microscopic imaging. The Authors also perform various immunostaining (DAB or TSA signal amplification methods) on the tissue slices from MCNP-perfused tissue blocks. With the application of this methodical approach, the Authors report dense and very fine vascular branches along the portal vein. The authors name them as 'periportal lamellar complex (PLC)' and report that PLC fine branches are directly connected to the sinusoids. The authors also claim that these structures co-localize with terminal bile duct branches and sympathetic nerve fibers and contain endothelial cells with a distinct gene expression profile. Finally, the authors claim that PLC-s proliferate in liver fibrosis (CCl4 model) and act as scaffold for proliferating bile ducts in ductular reaction and for ectopic parenchymal sympathetic nerve sprouting.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The simultaneous visualization of different hepatic vascular compartments and their combination with immunostaining is a potentially interesting novel methodological approach.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This reviewer has some concerns about the validity of the microscopic/morphological findings as well as the transcriptomics results, and suggests that the conclusions of the paper may be critically viewed. Namely, at this point, it is still not fully clear that the 'periportal lamellar complex (PLC)' that the Authors describe really exists as a distinct anatomical or functional unit or these are fine portal branches that connect the larger portal veins into the adjacent sinusoid. Also, in my opinion, to identify the molecular characteristics of such small and spatially highly organized structures like those fine radial portal branches, the only way is to perform high-resolution spatial transcriptomics (instead of data mining in existing liver single cell database and performing Venn diagram intersection analysis in hepatic endothelial subpopulations). Yet, the existence of such structures with a distinct molecular profile cannot be excluded. Further research with advanced imaging and omics techniques (such as high resolution volume imaging, and spatial transcriptomics/proteomics) are needed to reproduce these initial findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the revised version of the manuscript authors addressed multiple comments, clarifying especially the methodological part of their work and PLC identification as a novel morphological feature of the adult liver portal veins. Tet is now also much clearer and has better flow.</p>
<p>The additional assessment of the smartSeq2 data from Pietilä et al., 2025 strengthens the transcriptomic profiling of the CD34+Sca1+ cells and the discussion of the possible implications for the liver homeostasis and injury response. Why it may suffer from similar bias as other scRNA seq datasets - multiple cell fate signatures arising from mRNA contamination from proximal cells during dissociation, it is less likely that this would happen to yield so similar results.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a more thorough assessment by functional experimental approaches is needed to decipher the functional molecules and definite protein markers before establishing the PLC as the key hub governing the activity of biliary, arterial, and neuronal liver systems.</p>
<p>The work does bring a clear new insight into the liver structure and functional units and greatly improves the methodological toolbox to study it even further, and thus fully deserves the attention of the Elife readers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors clearly demonstrate an improved technique tailored to the visualization of the liver vasulo-biliary architecture in unprecedented resolution.</p>
<p>This work proposes a new morphological feature of adult liver facilitating interaction between the portal vein, hepatic arteries, biliary tree, and intrahepatic innervation, centered at previously underappreciated protrusions of the portal veins - the Periportal Lamellar Complexes (PLCs).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The importance of CD34+Sca1+ endothelial cell subpopulation for PLC formation and function was not tested and warrants further validation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Chengjian Zhao et al. focused on the interactions between vascular, biliary, and neural networks in the liver microenvironment, addressing the critical bottleneck that the lack of high-resolution 3D visualization has hindered understanding of these interactions in liver disease.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study developed a high-resolution multiplex 3D imaging method that integrates multicolor metallic compound nanoparticle (MCNP) perfusion with optimized CUBIC tissue clearing. This method enables the simultaneous 3D visualization of spatial networks of the portal vein, hepatic artery, bile ducts, and central vein in the mouse liver. The authors reported a perivascular structure termed the Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC), which is identified along the portal vein axis. This study clarifies that the PLC comprises CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ dual-positive endothelial cells with a distinct gene expression profile, and reveals its colocalization with terminal bile duct branches and sympathetic nerve fibers under physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This manuscript is well-written, organized, and informative. However, there are some points that need to be clarified.</p>
<p>(1) After MCNP-dye injection, does it remain in the blood vessels, adsorb onto the cell surface, or permeate into the cells? Does the MCNP-dye have cell selectivity?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The experimental results showed that after injection, the MCNP series nanoparticles predominantly remained within the lumens of blood vessels and bile ducts, with their tissue distribution determined by physical perfusion. No diffusion of the dye signal into the surrounding parenchymal tissue was observed, nor was there any evidence of adsorption onto the cell surface or entry into cells. The newly added Supplementary Figure S2A–H further confirmed this feature, demonstrating that the dye signals were strictly confined to the luminal space, clearly delineating the continuous course of blood vessels and the branching morphology of bile ducts. These findings strongly support the conclusion that “MCNP dyes are distributed exclusively within the luminal compartments.”</p>
<p>Therefore, the MCNP dyes primarily serve as intraluminal tracers within the tissue rather than as labels for specific cell types.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) All MCNP-dyes were injected after the mice were sacrificed, and the mice's livers were fixed with PFA. After the blood flow had ceased, how did the authors ensure that the MCNP-dyes were fully and uniformly perfused into the microcirculation of the liver?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s valuable comments. Indeed, since all MCNP dyes were perfused after the mice were euthanized and blood circulation had ceased, we cannot fully ensure a homogeneous distribution of the dye within the hepatic microcirculation. The vascular labeling technique based on metallic nanoparticle dyes used in this study offers clear imaging, stable fluorescence intensity, and multiplexing advantages; however, it also has certain limitations. The main issue is that the dye distribution within the hepatic parenchyma can be affected by factors such as lobular overlap, local tissue compression, and variations in vascular pathways, resulting in regional inhomogeneity of dye perfusion. This is particularly evident in areas where multiple lobes converge or where anatomical structures are complex, leading to local dye accumulation or over-perfusion.</p>
<p>In our experiments, we attempted to minimize local blockage or over-perfusion by performing PBS pre-flushing and low-pressure, constant-speed perfusion. Nevertheless, localized dye accumulation or uneven distribution may still occur in lobe junctions or structurally complex regions. Such variation represents one of the methodological limitations. Overall, the dye signals in most samples remained confined to the vascular and biliary lumens, and the distribution pattern was highly reproducible.</p>
<p>We have addressed this issue in the Discussion section but would like to emphasize here that, although this system has clear advantages, it remains sensitive to anatomical variability in the liver—such as lobular overlap and vascular heterogeneity. At vascular junctions, local perfusion inhomogeneity or dye accumulation may occur; therefore, injection strategies and perfusion parameters should be adjusted according to liver size and vascular condition to improve reproducibility and imaging quality. It should also be noted that the results obtained using this method primarily aim to visualize the overall and fine anatomical structures of the hepatic vascular system rather than to quantitatively reflect hemodynamic processes. In the future, we plan to combine in vivo perfusion or dynamic fluid modeling to further validate the diffusion characteristics of the dyes within the hepatic microcirculation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It is advisable to present additional 3D perspective views in the article, as the current images exhibit very weak 3D effects. Furthermore, it would be better to supplement with some videos to demonstrate the 3D effects of the stained blood vessels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s valuable comments. In response to the suggestion, we have added perspective-rendered images generated from the 3D staining datasets to provide a more intuitive visualization of the spatial morphology of the hepatic vasculature. These images have been included in Figure S2A–J. In addition, we have prepared supplementary videos (available upon request) that dynamically display the three-dimensional distribution of the stained vessels, further enhancing the spatial perception and visualization of the results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 1-I, the authors used MCNP-Black to stain the central veins; however, in addition to black, there are also yellow and red stains in the image. The authors need to explain what these stains are in the legend.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s constructive comment. In Figure 1I, MCNP-Black labels the central vein (black), MCNP-Yellow labels the portal vein (yellow), MCNP-Pink labels the hepatic artery (pink), and MCNP-Green labels the bile duct (green).

<p>(6) Nuclear staining is necessary in immunofluorescence staining, especially for Figure 5e. This will help readers distinguish whether the green color in the image corresponds to cells or dye deposits.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion. We understand that nuclear staining can help determine the origin of fluorescence signals. However, in our three-dimensional imaging system, the deep signal acquisition range after tissue clearing often causes nuclear dyes such as DAPI to generate highly dense and widespread fluorescence, especially in regions rich in vascular structures, which can obscure the fine vascular and perivascular details of interest. Therefore, this study primarily focuses on high-resolution visualization of the spatial architecture of the vascular and biliary systems. We have added an explanation regarding this point in Figures S2I–J.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present manuscript of Xu et al. reports a novel clearing and imaging method focusing on the liver. The authors simultaneously visualized the portal vein, hepatic artery, central vein, and bile duct systems by injecting metal compound nanoparticles (MCNPs) with different colors into the portal vein, heart left ventricle, inferior vena cava, and the extrahepatic bile duct, respectively. The method involves: trans-cardiac perfusion with 4% PFA, the injection of MCNPs with different colors, clearing with the modified CUBIC method, cutting 200 micrometer thick slices by vibratome, and then microscopic imaging. The authors also perform various immunostaining (DAB or TSA signal amplification methods) on the tissue slices from MCNP-perfused tissue blocks. With the application of this methodical approach, the authors report dense and very fine vascular branches along the portal vein. The authors name them as 'periportal lamellar complex (PLC)' and report that PLC fine branches are directly connected to the sinusoids. The authors also claim that these structures co-localize with terminal bile duct branches and sympathetic nerve fibers, and contain endothelial cells with a distinct gene expression profile. Finally, the authors claim that PLC-s proliferate in liver fibrosis (CCl4 model) and act as a scaffold for proliferating bile ducts in ductular reaction and for ectopic parenchymal sympathetic nerve sprouting.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The simultaneous visualization of different hepatic vascular compartments and their combination with immunostaining is a potentially interesting novel methodological approach.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This reviewer has several concerns about the validity of the microscopic/morphological findings as well as the transcriptomics results. In this reviewer's opinion, the introduction contains overstatements regarding the potential of the method, there are severe caveats in the method descriptions, and several parts of the Results are not fully supported by the documentation. Thus, the conclusions of the paper may be critically viewed in their present form and may need reconsideration by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the thorough evaluation and constructive comments on our study. We fully understand and appreciate the reviewer’s concerns regarding the methodological validity and interpretation of the results. In response, we have made comprehensive revisions and additions to the manuscript as follows:</p>
<p>First, we have carefully revised the Introduction and Discussion sections to provide a more balanced description of the methodological potential, removing statements that might be considered overstated, and clarifying the applicable scope and limitations of our approach (see the revised Introduction and Discussion).</p>
<p>Second, we have substantially expanded the Methods section with detailed information on model construction, imaging parameters, data processing workflow, and technical aspects of the single-cell transcriptomic reanalysis, to enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the study.</p>
<p>Third, we have added additional references and explanatory notes in the Results section to better support the main conclusions (see Section 6 of the Results).</p>
<p>Finally, we have rechecked and validated all experimental data, and conducted a verification analysis using an independent single-cell RNA-seq dataset (Figure S6). The results confirm that the morphological observations and transcriptomic findings are consistent and reproducible across independent experiments.</p>
<p>We believe these revisions have greatly strengthened the reliability of our conclusions and the overall scientific rigor of the manuscript. Once again, we sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s valuable comments, which have been very helpful in improving the logic and clarity of our work.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the reviewed manuscript, researchers aimed to overcome the obstacles of high-resolution imaging of intact liver tissue. They report successful modification of the existing CUBIC protocol into Liver-CUBIC, a high-resolution multiplex 3D imaging method that integrates multicolor metallic compound nanoparticle (MCNP) perfusion with optimized liver tissue clearing, significantly reducing clearing time and enabling simultaneous 3D visualization of the portal vein, hepatic artery, bile ducts, and central vein spatial networks in the mouse liver. Using this novel platform, the researchers describe a previously unrecognized perivascular structure they termed Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC), regularly distributed along the portal vein axis. The PLC originates from the portal vein and is characterized by a unique population of CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ dual-positive endothelial cells. Using available scRNAseq data, the authors assessed the CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ cells' expression profile, highlighting the mRNA presence of genes linked to neurodevelopment, biliary function, and hematopoietic niche potential. Different aspects of this analysis were then addressed by protein staining of selected marker proteins in the mouse liver tissue. Next, the authors addressed how the PLC and biliary system react to CCL4-induced liver fibrosis, implying PLC dynamically extends, acting as a scaffold that guides the migration and expansion of terminal bile ducts and sympathetic nerve fibers into the hepatic parenchyma upon injury.</p>
<p>The work clearly demonstrates the usefulness of the Liver-CUBIC technique and the improvement of both resolution and complexity of the information, gained by simultaneous visualization of multiple vascular and biliary systems of the liver at the same time. The identification of PLC and the interpretation of its function represent an intriguing set of observations that will surely attract the attention of liver biologists as well as hepatologists; however, some claims need more thorough assessment by functional experimental approaches to decipher the functional molecules and the sequence of events before establishing the PLC as the key hub governing the activity of biliary, arterial, and neuronal liver systems. Similarly, the level of detail of the methods section does not appear to be sufficient to exactly recapitulate the performed experiments, which is of concern, given that the new technique is a cornerstone of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the work does bring a clear new insight into the liver structure and functional units and greatly improves the methodological toolbox to study it even further, and thus fully deserves the attention of readers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors clearly demonstrate an improved technique tailored to the visualization of the liver vasulo-biliary architecture in unprecedented resolution.</p>
<p>This work proposes a new biological framework between the portal vein, hepatic arteries, biliary tree, and intrahepatic innervation, centered at previously underappreciated protrusions of the portal veins - the Periportal Lamellar Complexes (PLCs).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Possible overinterpretation of the CD34+Sca1+ findings was built on re-analysis of one scRNAseq dataset.</p>
<p>Lack of detail in the materials and methods section greatly limits the usefulness of the new technique to other researchers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We agree that when conclusions are mainly based on a single dataset, overinterpretation should be avoided. In response to this concern, we have carefully re-evaluated and clearly limited the scope of our interpretation of the scRNA-seq analysis. In addition, we performed a validation analysis using an independent single-cell RNA-seq dataset (see new Figure S6), which consistently confirmed the presence and characteristic transcriptional profile of the periportal CD34⁺Sca1⁺ endothelial cell population. These supplementary analyses strengthen the robustness of our findings and address the reviewer’s concern regarding potential overinterpretation.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have also greatly expanded the Materials and Methods section by providing detailed information on sample preparation, imaging parameters, data processing workflow, and single-cell reanalysis procedures. These revisions substantially improve the transparency and reproducibility of our methodology, thereby enhancing the usability and reference value of this technique for other researchers.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>(1) In general, the Introduction is very lengthy and repetitive. It needs extensive shortening to a maximum of 2 A4 pages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestions. We have thoroughly condensed and restructured the Introduction, removing redundant content and merging related paragraphs to make the theme more focused and the logic clearer. The revised Introduction has been shortened to within two A4 pages, emphasizing the scientific question, innovation, and technical approach of the study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Please correct this erroneous sentence:</p>
<p>'...the liver has evolved the most complex and densely n organized vascular network in the body, consisting primarily of the portal vein system, central vein system, hepatic artery system, biliary system, and intrahepatic autonomic nerve network [6, 7].'</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this spelling error. The revised sentence is as follows:</p>
<p>“…the liver has evolved the most complex and densely organized ductal-vascular network in the body, consisting primarily of the portal vein system, central vein system, hepatic artery system, biliary system, and intrahepatic autonomic nerve network [6, 7].”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) '...we achieved a 63.89% improvement in clearing efficiency and a 20.12% increase in tissue transparency'</p>
<p>Please clarify what you exactly mean by 'clearing efficiency' and 'increased tissue transparency'.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments and have clarified the relevant terminology in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>“Clearing efficiency” refers to the improvement in the time required for the liver tissue to become completely transparent when treated with the optimized Liver-CUBIC protocol (40% urea + H₂O₂), compared with the conventional CUBIC method. In this study, the clearing time was reduced from 9 days to 3.25 days, representing a 63.89% increase in time efficiency.</p>
<p>“Tissue transparency” refers to the ability of the cleared tissue to transmit visible light. We quantified the optical transparency by measuring light transmittance across the 400–900 nm wavelength range using a microplate reader. The results showed that the average transmittance increased by 20.12%, indicating that Liver-CUBIC treatment markedly enhanced the optical clarity of the liver tissue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) I am concerned about claiming this imaging method as real '3D imaging'. Namely, while the authors clear full lobes, they actually cut the cleared lobes into 200-micrometer-thick slices and perform further microscopy imaging on these slices. Considering that they focus on ductular structures of the liver (such as vasculature, bile duct system, and innervations), 200 micrometer allows a very limited 3D overview, particularly in comparison with the whole-mount immuno-imaging methods combined with light sheet microscopy (such as Adori 2021, Liu 2021, etc). In this context, I feel several parts of the Introduction to be an overstatement: besides of emphasizing the advantages of the technique (such as simultaneous visualization of different hepatic vascular compartments and the bile duct system by MCNPs, the combination with immunostainings), the authors must honestly discuss the limitations (such as limited tissue overview, potential dye perfusion problems - uneven distribution of the dye etc).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments. It is true that most of the imaging depth in this study was limited to approximately 200 μm, and thus it could not achieve whole-liver three-dimensional imaging comparable to light-sheet microscopy. However, the primary focus of our study was to resolve the microscopic intrahepatic architecture, particularly the spatial relationships among blood vessels, bile ducts, and nerve fibers. Through high-resolution imaging of thick tissue sections, combined with MCNP-based multichannel labeling and immunofluorescence co-staining, we were able to accurately delineate the three-dimensional distribution of these microstructures within localized regions.</p>
<p>In addition to thick-section imaging, we also obtained whole-lobe dye perfusion data (as shown in Figure S1F), which comprehensively depict the three-dimensional branching patterns and distribution of the vascular systems within the liver lobe. These images were acquired from intact liver lobes perfused with MCNP dyes, revealing a continuous vascular network extending from major trunks to peripheral branches, thereby demonstrating that our approach is also capable of achieving organ-level visualization.</p>
<p>We have added this image and a corresponding description in the revised manuscript to more comprehensively present the coverage of our imaging system, and we have incorporated this clarification into the Discussion section.</p>

<p>Method</p>
<p>(5) More information may be needed about MCNPs:</p>
<p>a) As reported, there are nanoparticles with different colors in brightfield microscopy, but the particles are also excitable in fluorescence microscopy. Would you please provide a summary about excitation/emission wavelengths of the different MCNPs? This is crucial to understand to what extent the method is compatible with fluorescence immunohistochemistry.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the careful attention and professional suggestion. We fully agree that this issue is critical for evaluating the compatibility of our method with fluorescent immunohistochemistry. Different types of metal compound nanoparticles (MCNPs) have clearly distinguishable spectral properties:</p>
<p>- MCNP-Green and MCNP-Yellow: AF488-matched spectra, with excitation/emission wavelengths of 495/519 nm.</p>
<p>- MCNP-Pink: Designed for far-red spectra, with excitation/emission wavelengths of 561/640 nm.</p>
<p>- MCNP-Black: Non-fluorescent, appearing black under bright-field microscopy only.</p>
<p>The above information has been added to the Materials and Methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) Also, is there more systematic information available concerning the advantage of these particles compared to 'traditional' fluorescence dyes, such as Alexa fluor or Cy-dyes, in fluorescence microscopy and concerning their compatibility with various tissue clearing methods (e.g., with the frequently used organic-solvent-based methods)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the detailed question. Compared with conventional organic fluorescent dyes, MCNP offers the following advantages:</p>
<p>- Enhanced photostability: Its inorganic core-shell structure resists fading even after hydrogen peroxide bleaching.</p>
<p>- High signal stability: Fluorescence is maintained during aqueous-based clearing (e.g., CUBIC) and multiple rounds of staining without quenching.</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. In our Liver-CUBIC system, MCNP nanoparticles exhibited excellent multi-channel labeling stability and fluorescence signal retention. Regarding compatibility with other clearing methods (e.g., SCAFE, SeeDB, CUBIC), since these methods have limited effectiveness for whole-liver clearing (see Figure 2 of Tainaka, et al. 2014) and cannot meet the requirements for high-resolution microstructural imaging in this study, we consider further testing of their compatibility unnecessary.</p>
<p>In summary, MCNP dye demonstrates superior signal stability and spectral separation compared with conventional organic fluorescent dyes in multi-channel, long-term, high-transparency three-dimensional tissue imaging.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c) When you perfuse these particles, to which structures do they bind inside the ducts (vessels, bile ducts)? Is the 48h post-fixation enough to keep them inside the tubes/bind them to the vessel walls? Is there any 'wash-out' during the complex cutting/staining procedure? E.g., in Figure 2D: the 'classical' hepatic artery in the portal triad is not visible - but the MCNP apparently penetrated to the adjacent sinusoids at the edge of the lobulus. Also, in Figure 3B, there is a significant mismatch between the MNCP-green (bile duct) signal and the CD19 (epithelium marker) immunostaining. Please discuss these.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The experimental results showed that following injection, MCNP nanoparticles primarily remained within the vascular and biliary lumens, and their tissue distribution depended on physical perfusion. No dye signal was observed to diffuse into the surrounding parenchyma, nor did the particles adhere to cell surfaces or enter cells. The newly added Supplementary Figures S2A–H further confirm this feature: the dye signal is strictly confined within the lumens, clearly delineating continuous vascular paths and biliary branching patterns, strongly supporting the conclusion that “MCNP dye is distributed only within luminal spaces.”</p>
<p>Thus, MCNP dye mainly serves as an intraluminal tracer rather than a label for specific cell types.</p>
<p>We provide the following explanations and analyses regarding MCNP distribution in the hepatic vascular and biliary systems and its post-fixation stability:</p>
<p>- Potential signal displacement during sectioning/immunostaining: During slicing and immunostaining, a small number of particles may be washed away due to mechanical cutting or washing steps; however, the overall three-dimensional structure retains high spatial fidelity.</p>
<p>- Observation in Figure 2D: MCNP was seen entering the sinusoidal spaces at the lobule periphery, but hepatic arteries were not visible, likely due to limitations in section thickness. Although arteries were not apparent in this slice, arterial distribution around the portal vein is visible in Figure 2C. It should be noted that Figures 2C, D, and E do not represent whole-liver imaging, so not all regions necessarily contain visible hepatic arteries. For easier identification, the main hepatic artery trunk is highlighted in cyan in Figure 2E.</p>
<p>- Incomplete biliary signal in Figure 3B: This may be because CK19 labeling only covers biliary epithelial cells, whereas MCNP-green distributes throughout the biliary lumen. In Figure 3B, the terminal MCNP-green signal exhibits irregular polygonal structures, which we interpret as the canalicular regions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Which fixative was used for 48h of postfixation (step 6) after MCNP injections?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>After MCNP injection, mouse livers were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 48 hours. This fixation condition effectively “locks” the MCNP particles within the vascular and biliary lumens, maintaining their spatial positions, while also being compatible with subsequent sectioning and multi-channel immunostaining analyses.</p>
<p>The above information has been added to the Materials and Methods section</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) What is the 'desired thickness' in step 7? In the case of immunostained tissue, a 200-micrometer slice thickness is mentioned. However, based on the Methods, it is not completely clear what the actual thickness of the tissue was that was examined ultimately in the microscopes, and whether or not the clearing preceded the cutting or vice versa.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s question. The “desired thickness” referred to in step 7 of the manuscript corresponds to the thickness of tissue sections used for immunostaining and high-resolution microscopic imaging, which is typically around 200 µm. We selected 200 µm because this thickness is sufficient to observe the PLC structure in its entirety, allows efficient staining, and preserves tissue architecture well. Other researchers may choose different section thicknesses according to their experimental needs.</p>
<p>In this study, the processing order for immunostained tissue samples was sectioning followed by clearing, as detailed below:</p>
<p>Section Thickness</p>
<p>To ensure antibody penetration and preservation of three-dimensional structure, tissue sections were typically cut to ~200 µm. Thicker sections can be used if more complete three-dimensional structures are required, but adjustments may be needed based on antibody penetration and fluorescence detection conditions.</p>

<p>In this study, fixed livers were first sectioned into thick slices (~200 µm) using a vibratome. Subsequently, DAB and TSA immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were performed on free-floating sections.

<p>(11) Regarding the 'transmission quantification': this was measured on 1 mm thick slices. While it is interesting to make a comparison between different clearing methods in general, one must note that it is relatively easy to clear 1mm thick tissue slices with almost any kind of clearing technique and in any tissues. The 'real' differences come with thicker blocks, such as &gt;5mm in the thinnest dimension. Do you have such experiences (e.g., comparison in whole 'left lateral liver lobes')?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we performed three-dimensional visualization of entire liver lobes to depict the distribution of MCNPs and the overall spatial architecture of the vascular and biliary systems (Figure S1F). However, due to the limitations of the plate reader and fluorescence imaging systems in terms of spatial resolution and light penetration depth, quantitative analyses were conducted only on tissue sections approximately 1 mm thick.</p>
<p>Regarding the comparative quantification of different clearing methods, as the reviewer noted, nearly all aqueous- or organic solvent–based clearing techniques can achieve relatively uniform transparency in 1 mm-thick tissue sections, so differences at this thickness are limited. We have not yet conducted systematic comparisons on whole-lobe sections thicker than 5 mm and therefore cannot provide “true” difference data for thicker tissues.</p>

<p>Before imaging, the MCNP dye solution was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 minutes at 4 °C to remove aggregates and impurities. The supernatant was collected, diluted 50-fold, and 3–4 μL of the sample was applied onto freshly glow-discharged Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 300 mesh). The sample was allowed to sit for 30 seconds to enable particle adsorption, after which excess liquid was gently wicked away with filter paper and the grid was air-dried at room temperature. The sample was then negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 seconds and air-dried again before imaging.</p>

<p>Results</p>
<p>(16) While it is stated in the Methods that certain color MCNPs were used for labelling different structures (i.e., yellow: hepatic artery; green: bile duct; portal vein: pink; central veins: black), in some figures, apparently different color MCNPs are used for the respective structures. E.g., in Figure 1J, the artery is pink and the portal vein is green. Please clarify this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The color assignment of MCNP dyes is not fixed across different experiments or schematic illustrations. MCNP dyes of different colors are fundamentally identical in their physical and chemical properties and do not exhibit specific binding or affinity for particular vascular structures. We select different colors based on experimental design and imaging presentation needs to facilitate distinction and visualization, thereby enhancing recognition in 3D reconstruction and image display. Therefore, the color labeling in Figure 1F is primarily intended to illustrate the distribution of different vascular systems, rather than indicating a fixed correspondence to a specific dye or injection color.</p>

<p>(17) In Figure 1J, the hepatic artery is extremely shrunk, while the portal vein is extremely dilated - compared to the physiological situation. Does it relate to the perfusion conditions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s attention. In fact, under normal physiological conditions, the hepatic arteries labeled by CD31 are naturally narrow. Therefore, the relatively thin hepatic arteries and thicker portal veins shown in Figure 1J are normal and unrelated to the perfusion conditions. See figure 1E of Adori et al., 2021.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the correction. The previous statement was a typographical error. In fact, the diameter of the “elliptical windows” marked by MCNP-black is 5–10 μm, so the diameter of 5–10 μm shown in Figure 1I is correct.</p>

<p>(20) How do you define the 'primary portal vein tract'?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the question. The term “primary portal vein tract” refers to the first-order branches of the portal vein that enter the liver from the hepatic hilum. These are the major branches arising directly from the main portal vein trunk and are responsible for supplying blood to the respective hepatic lobes. This definition corresponds to the concept of the first-order portal vein in hepatic anatomy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(21) I am concerned that the 'periportal lamellar complex (PLC)' that the Authors describe really exists as a distinct anatomical or functional unit. I also see these in 3D scans - in my opinion, these are fine, lower-order portal vein branches that connect the portal veins to the adjacent sinusoid. The strong MCNP-labelling of these structures may be caused by the 'sticking' of the perfused MCNP solutions in these 'pockets' during the perfusion process. What do these structures look like with SMA or CD31 immunostaining? Also, one may consider that the anatomical evaluation of these structures may have limitations in tissue slices. Have you ever checked MCNP-perfused, cleared full live lobes in light sheet microscope scans? I think this would be very useful to have a comprehensive morphological overview. Unfortunately, based on the presented documentation, I am also not convinced that PLCs are 'co-localize' with fine terminal bile duct branches (Figure 3E, S3C), or with TH+ 'neuronal bead chain networks' (Fig 6C). More detailed and more convincing documentation is needed here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the detailed comments. Regarding the existence and function of the periportal lamellar complex (PLC), our observations are based on MCNP-Pink labeling of the portal vein, through which we were able to identify the PLC structure surrounding the portal branches. It should be noted that the PLC represents a very small anatomical structure. Although we have not yet performed light-sheet microscopy scanning, we anticipate that such imaging would primarily visualize larger portal vein branches. Nevertheless, this does not affect our overall conclusions.</p>
<p>We also appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion that the observed structures might result from MCNP adherence during perfusion. To verify the structural characteristics of the PLC, we performed immunostaining for SMA and CD31, which revealed a specific arrangement pattern of smooth muscle and endothelial markers rather than simple perfusion-induced deposition (Figures 4F and S6B).</p>
<p>Regarding the apparent colocalization of the PLC with terminal bile duct branches (Figures 3E and S3C) and TH⁺ neuronal bead-like networks (Figure 6C), we acknowledge that current literature evidence remains limited. Therefore, we have carefully described these observations as possible spatial associations rather than definitive conclusions. Future studies integrating high-resolution three-dimensional imaging with functional analyses will help to further clarify the anatomical and physiological significance of the PLC.</p>

<p>(22) 'Extended depth-of-field three-dimensional bright-field imaging revealed a strict 1:1 anatomical association between the primary portal vein trunk (diameter 280 {plus minus} 32 μm) and the first-order bile duct (diameter 69 {plus minus} 8 μm) (Figures 3A and S3A)'.</p>
<p>How do you define '1:1 anatomical association'? How do you define and identify the 'order' (primary, secondary) of vessel and bile duct branches in 200-micrometer slices?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the question. In this study, the term “1:1 anatomical correlation” refers to the stable paired spatial relationship between the main portal vein trunk and its corresponding primary bile duct within the same portal territory. In other words, each main portal vein branch is accompanied by a primary bile duct of matching branching order and trajectory, together forming a “vascular–biliary bundle.”</p>
<p>The definitions of “primary” and “secondary” branches were based on extended-depth 3D bright-field reconstructions, considering both branching hierarchy and vessel/duct diameters: primary branches arise directly from the main trunk at the hepatic hilum and exhibit the largest diameters (averaging 280 ± 32 μm for the portal vein and 69 ± 8 μm for the bile duct), whereas secondary branches extend from the primary branches toward the lobular interior with smaller calibers.</p>

<p>(23) In my opinion, the applied methodical approach in the single cell transcriptomics part (data mining in the existing liver single cell database and performing Venn diagram intersection analysis in hepatic endothelial subpopulations) is largely inappropriate and thus, all the statements here are purely speculative. In my opinion, to identify the molecular characteristics of such small and spatially highly organized structures like those fine radial portal branches, the only way is to perform high-resolution spatial transcriptomic.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We fully acknowledge the importance of high-resolution spatial transcriptomics in identifying the fine structural characteristics of portal vein branches. Due to current funding and technical limitations, we were unable to perform such high-resolution spatial transcriptomic analyses. However, we validated the molecular features of the PLC using another publicly available liver single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset, which provided preliminary supporting evidence (Figures S6B and S6C). In the manuscript, we have carefully stated that this analysis is exploratory in nature and have avoided overinterpretation. In future studies, high-resolution spatial omics approaches will be invaluable for more precisely delineating the molecular characteristics of these fine structures.</p>

<p>(24) 'How the autonomic nervous system regulates liver function in mice despite the apparent absence of substantive nerve fiber invasion into the parenchyma remains unclear.'</p>
<p>Please consider the role of gap junctions between hepatocytes (e.g., Miyashita, 1991; Seseke, 1992).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we analyzed the spatial distribution of hepatic nerves in mice using immunofluorescence staining and found that nerve fibers were almost exclusively confined to the portal vein region (Figure S6A). Notably, this distribution pattern differs markedly from that in humans. Previous studies have shown that, in human livers, nerves are not only located around the portal veins but also present along the central veins, interlobular septa, and within the parenchymal connective tissue (Miller et al., 2021; Yi, la Fleur, Fliers &amp; Kalsbeek, 2010).</p>
<p>Further research has provided a physiological explanation for this interspecies difference: even among species with distinct sympathetic innervation patterns in the parenchyma—i.e., with or without direct sympathetic input—the sympathetic efferent regulatory functions may remain comparable (Beckh, Fuchs, Ballé &amp; Jungermann, 1990). This is because signals released from aminergic and peptidergic nerve terminals can be transmitted to hepatocytes through gap junctions as electrical signals (Hertzberg &amp; Gilula, 1979; Jensen, Alpini &amp; Glaser, 2013; Seseke, Gardemann &amp; Jungermann, 1992; Taher, Farr &amp; Adeli, 2017).</p>
<p>However, the scarcity of nerve fibers within the mouse hepatic parenchyma suggests that the mechanisms by which the autonomic nervous system regulates liver function in mice may differ from those in humans. This observation prompted us to further investigate the potential role of PLC endothelial cells in this process.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) A strong recommendation - the authors ought to challenge their scRNAsq- re-analysis with another scRNAseq dataset, namely a recently published atlas of adult liver endothelial, but also mesenchymal, immune, and parenchymal cell populations <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40954217/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40954217/</ext-link>, performed with Smart-seq2 approach, which is perfectly suitable as it brings higher resolution data, and extensive cluster identity validation with stainings. Pietilä et al. indicate a clear distinction of portal vein endothelial cells into two populations that express Adgrg6, Jag1 (e2c), from Vegfc double-positive populations (e5c and e2c). Moreover, the dataset also includes the arterial endothelial cells that were shown to be part of the PLC, but were not followed up with the scRNAseq analysis. This distinction could help the authors to further validate their results, better controlling for cross-contaminations that may occur during scRNAseq preparation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion. As noted, we have further validated the molecular characteristics of the PLC using a recently published atlas of adult liver endothelial cells (Pietilä et al., 2023, PMID: 40954217). This dataset, generated using the Smart-seq2 technique, provides high-resolution transcriptomic profiles. By analyzing this dataset, we identified a CD34⁺LY6A⁺ portal vein endothelial cell population within the e2 cluster, which is localized around the portal vein. We then examined pathways and gene expression patterns related to hematopoiesis, bile duct formation, and neural signaling within these cells. The results revealed gene enrichment patterns consistent with those observed in our primary dataset, further supporting the robustness of our analysis of the PLC’s molecular characteristics.</p>

<p>(3) In Figure 2A, the authors claim the size of the nanoparticle is 100nm, while based on the image, the size is ~150-180nm. A more thorough quantification of the particle size would help users estimate the usability of their method for further applications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. In the TEM image shown in Figure 2A, the nanoparticles indeed appear to be approximately 150–200 nm in size. We have re-verified the particle dimensions and will update the corresponding description in the Methods section to allow readers to more accurately assess the applicability of this approach.</p>

<p>(4) In Figure 3E, it is not clear what is labeled by the pink signal. Please consider labeling the structures in the figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. The pink signal in Figure 3E was originally intended to label the hepatic artery. However, a slight spatial misalignment occurred during the labeling process, making its position appear closer to the central vein rather than the portal vein in the image. To avoid misunderstanding, we will add clear annotations to the image and clarify this deviation in the figure legend in the revised version. It should also be noted that this figure primarily aims to illustrate the spatial relationship between the bile duct and the portal vein, and this minor deviation does not affect the reliability of our experimental conclusions.</p>

<p>(5) The following statement is not backed by quantification as it ought to be „Dual-channel three-dimensional confocal imaging combined with CK19 immunostaining revealed that the sites of dye leakage did not coincide with the CK19-positive terminal bile duct epithelium, but instead were predominantly localized within regions adjacent to the PLC structures&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. We have added the corresponding quantitative analysis to support this conclusion. Quantitative assessment of the extended-depth imaging data revealed that dye leakage predominantly occurred in regions adjacent to the PLC structure, rather than in the perivenous sinusoidal areas. The corresponding results have been presented in the revised Figure 3G.</p>

<p>(6) Similarly, Figure 4F is central to the Sca1CD34 cell type identification but lacks any quantification, providing it would strengthen the key statement of the article. A possible way to approach this is also by FACS sorting the double-positive cells and bluk/qRT validation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We agree that quantitative validation of the Sca1⁺CD34⁺ population by FACS sorting could further support our conclusions. However, the primary focus of this study is on the spatial localization and transcriptional features of PLC endothelial cells. The identification of the Sca1⁺CD34⁺ subset is robustly supported by multiple complementary approaches, including three-dimensional imaging, co-staining with pan-endothelial markers, and projection mapping analyses. Collectively, these lines of evidence provide a solid basis for characterizing this unique endothelial population.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the careful comment. We agree that the original Sca1-stained image, being a longitudinal section of the portal vein, was not optimal for direct comparison with other cross-sectional images. We have replaced it with a cross-sectional image of the portal vein to ensure comparability across all images. The updated image has been included in the revised Supplementary Figure S4D.</p>

<p>(9) The methods section lacks information about the CCL4concentration, and it is thus hard to estimate the dosage of CCL4 received (ml/kg). This is important for the interpretation of the severity of the fibrosis and presence of cirrhosis, as different doses may or may not lead to cirrhosis within the short regimen performed by the authors [PMID: 16015684 DOI: 10.3748/wjg.v11.i27.4167]. Validation of the fibrosis/cirrhosis severity is, in this case, crucial for the correct interpretation of the results. If the level of cirrhosis is not confirmed, only progressive fibrosis should be mentioned in the manuscript, as these two terms cannot be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s comment. We indeed omitted the information on the concentration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) in the Methods section. In our experiments, mice received intraperitoneal injections of CCl<sub>4</sub> at a dose of 1 mL/kg body weight, twice per week, for a total of six weeks.

<p>This section has been revised. In this study, we analyzed the spatial distribution of nerves in the mouse liver using immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that nerve fibers were almost entirely confined to the portal vein region (Figure S6A). Notably, this distribution pattern differs significantly from that in humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that in the human liver, nerves are not only distributed around the portal vein but also present in the central vein, interlobular septa, and connective tissue of the hepatic parenchyma (Miller et al., 2021; Yi, la Fleur, Fliers &amp; Kalsbeek, 2010).</p>
<p>Previous studies have further explained the physiological basis for this difference: even among species with differences in parenchymal sympathetic innervation (i.e., species with or without direct sympathetic input), their sympathetic efferent regulatory functions may still be similar (Beckh, Fuchs, Ballé &amp; Jungermann, 1990). This is because signals released by adrenergic and peptidergic nerve terminals can be transmitted to hepatocytes as electrical signals through intercellular gap junctions (Hertzberg &amp; Gilula, 1979; Jensen, Alpini &amp; Glaser, 2013; Seseke, Gardemann &amp; Jungermann, 1992; Taher, Farr &amp; Adeli, 2017). However, the scarcity of nerve fibers in the mouse hepatic parenchyma suggests that the mechanism by which the autonomic nervous system regulates liver function in mice may differ from that in humans. This finding also prompts us to further explore the potential role of PLC endothelial cells in this process.</p>

<p>(12) Could the authors discuss their interpretation of the results in light of the fact that the innervation is lower in cirrhotic patients? <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2871629/">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2871629/</ext-link>.

<p>We have revised the text to state that although most hepatic nerves are unmyelinated, GPR126 (ADGRG6) may regulate hepatic nerve distribution via non-myelination-dependent mechanisms. Studies have shown that GPR126 exerts both Schwann cell–dependent and –independent functions during peripheral nerve repair, influencing axon guidance, mechanosensation, and ECM remodeling (Mogha et al., 2016; Monk et al., 2011; Paavola et al., 2014).</p>
