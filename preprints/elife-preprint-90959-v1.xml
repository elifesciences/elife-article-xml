<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Evidence suggests that estradiol-sensing preoptic area GABA neurons are involved in the pre-ovulatory surge mechanism necessary for ovulation. In vivo CRISPR-Cas9 editing was used to achieve a 60-70% knockdown in estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) expression by GABA neurons located within the region of the rostral periventricular of the third ventricle (RP3V) and medial preoptic nuclei (MPN) in adult female mice. Mice exhibited variable reproductive phenotypes with the only significant finding being those mice with bilateral ESR1 deletion in RP3V GABA neurons that had reduced cFos expression in GnRH neurons at the time of the surge. One sub-population of RP3V GABA neurons expresses kisspeptin. Re-grouping ESR1-edited mice on the basis of their RP3V kisspeptin expression revealed a highly consistent phenotype; mice with a near complete loss of kisspeptin immunoreactivity displayed constant estrus and failed to exhibit surge activation but retained pulsatile LH secretion. These observations demonstrate ESR1-expressing GABA-kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V are essential for the murine preovulatory LH surge mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Understanding how circulating estradiol levels feedback on the brain to regulate the pulse and surge profiles of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion is of central importance to elucidating the neural control of mammalian fertility. Studies in genetic mouse models have clearly identified that estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) is the key receptor underlying both estrogen positive and negative feedback (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Couse, Yates et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Herbison 2015</xref>). Despite significant progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Herbison 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Moenter, Silveira et al. 2019</xref>, <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Goodman, Herbison et al. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kauffman 2022</xref>), defining the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms through which ESR1 ultimately modulates GnRH secretion remains a significant challenge.</p>
<p>Recent experiments using live cell imaging and <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR gene editing have demonstrated that estradiol acts directly at ESR1-expressing kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus to suppress the activity of the GnRH pulse generator and bring about estrogen negative feedback at the level of the brain (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">McQuillan, Clarkson et al. 2022</xref>). This same level of definition has not yet been possible for the positive feedback mechanism where only the general location of estradiol action is known with certainty. Viral retrograde labelling demonstrated that ESR1-expressing afferents to the GnRH neuron cell bodies are concentrated in the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) and preoptic periventricular (PVpo) nuclei of the hypothalamus (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Wintermantel, Campbell et al. 2006</xref>); collectively termed the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Herbison 2008</xref>). As the selective knockdown of ESR1 in the RP3V results in acyclic mice with an absent luteinizing hormone (LH) surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Porteous and Herbison 2019</xref>), it seems very likely that the RP3V is the area within which estradiol acts to enable the surge mechanism in mice.</p>
<p>The identity of the key ESR1-expressing populations within the RP3V mediating the estrogen positive feedback mechanism has not been defined conclusively. Most evidence supports a role for the RP3V kisspeptin neurons. These cells express ESR1, are activated at the time of the surge, and have their kisspeptin synthesis strongly up regulated by estradiol (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Smith, Popa et al. 2006</xref>, <xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Adachi, Yamada et al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Clarkson, d’Anglemont de Tassigny et al. 2008</xref>). Further, RP3V kisspeptin neurons project directly to GnRH neuron cell bodies where they provide a strong and lasting excitatory influence while the selective activation of RP3V kisspeptin neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> evokes a surge-like increment in LH secretion (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Piet, Kalil et al. 2018</xref>). Given these findings, it was surprising to find that selective <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR knockdown of ESR1 in AVPV kisspeptin neurons blunted the amplitude of the LH surge but had no impact on estrous cyclicity (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Vanacker et al. 2019</xref>). This suggested that kisspeptin neurons may not be the key or sole phenotype in the RP3V responsible for positive feedback in mice.</p>
<p>There is a long-standing evidence implicating GABAergic inputs to the GnRH neuron cell bodies in the rodent positive feedback mechanism. This ranges from studies showing alterations in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor dynamics at GnRH neurons around the time of the daily LH surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Christian and Moenter 2007</xref>) through to <italic>in vivo</italic> studies demonstrating a functionally significant fall in GABA release within the preoptic area just prior to the LH surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Herbison and Dyer 1991</xref>, <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Jarry, Hirsch et al. 1992</xref>). More recently, the genetic deletion of ESR1 in all GABA neurons was found to result in failure of the positive feedback mechanism (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Cheong, Czieselsky et al. 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study was designed to test directly whether ESR1 GABA neurons located in the medial preoptic area are critical for the positive feedback mechanism. We employed <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR gene editing to knockdown ESR1 in the RP3V and adjacent medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) and evaluated estrous cyclicity alongside pulsatile and surge patterns of LH secretion.</p>

<p>The design of guide RNAs for <italic>Esr1</italic> (NM_007956) has been reported previously (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">McQuillan, Clarkson et al. 2022</xref>). In brief, gRNA directed at both the sense and antisense strands around exon 3 were tested for efficacy <italic>in vitro</italic> using an ESR1-expressing hypothalamic cell line mHypo-CLU189-A genetically modified to stably express Cas9 (CLU189-Cas922C). Transduction with AAV-U6-gRNA-EGFP identified gRNA-1, −2, −3 and −6 to be the most effective in reducing <italic>Esr1</italic> mRNA levels by 20-30% <italic>in vitro</italic>. The efficacy of gRNA-2, −3 and −6 were assessed <italic>in vivo</italic> by giving unilateral injections AAV1-U6-gRNA(2, 3, or 6)-Ef1α-mCherry into the medial preoptic area of <italic>Vgat-Cre,LSL-Cas9-EGFP</italic> mice (N=4 per gRNA). This was found to result in 79±7%, 72±5% and 78±3% reductions, respectively, in the numbers of ESR1-immunoreactive EGFP-expressing neurons on the injected side of the brain compared with the non-injected side. Our prior studies have shown that this CRISPR-Cas9-AAV platform enables the knockdown of ESR1 in a selective manner in genetically targeted hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">McQuillan, Clarkson et al. 2022</xref>).</p>

In keeping with the predominant GABAergic phenotype of preoptic area neurons (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Moffitt, Bambah-Mukku et al. 2018</xref>), large numbers of cells expressing EGFP/Cas9 were detected throughout the region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A,B</xref>), including the AVPV, PVpo, MPN and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.

<p>The percentage of VGAT-EGFP neurons expressing ESR1 was evaluated within AAV-injected regions of the RP3V and MPN in mice receiving gRNA-2, gRNA-3, or control gRNA-LacZ. In keeping with prior studies showing that up to one half of medial preoptic area GABA neurons express ESR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Herbison 1997</xref>, <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Cheong, Czieselsky et al. 2015</xref>), we found that 50.4±6.1% and 61.1±4.2% of VGAT-EGFP neurons in the RP3V (N=3) and MPN (N=7), respectively, of gRNA-LacZ mice were immunoreactive for ESR1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A,C</xref>). In mice receiving gRNA-2 these values were reduced to 19.6±3.7% (N=7) and 22.2±4.7% (N=9) while gRNA-3 resulted in 18.7±1.7% (N=8) and 15.4±2.8% (N=9) of VGAT-EGFP neurons with ESR1 in the PVpo and MPN, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B,C</xref>). Inexplicably, one gRNA-3 mouse with correct AAV targeting maintained normal levels of ESR1 expression (52%) and was excluded from the analysis. Overall, the gRNA generated a significant 61% and 63% reduction ESR1 expression by RP3V VGAT neurons (p=0.0032; one-way ANOVA F<sub>(2,14)</sub>= 18.14, post-hoc Dunnett’s test versus LacZ P=0.0002 (gRNA2), p=0.0001 (gRNA3); <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>) and a 63% and 70% reduction ESR1 expression by MPN VGAT neurons (p&lt;0.0001; one-way ANOVA F<sub>(2,21)</sub>= 34.30, post-hoc Dunnett’s test versus LacZ P&lt;0.0001 (gRNA2), p&lt;0.0001 (gRNA3); <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that the two gRNAs result in a very similar 60-70% reduction in ESR1 expression in preoptic VGAT neurons.</p>

<title>Locations of VGAT ESR1 knockdown</title>
<p>Bilateral AAV injections occurred in an heterogenous manner within the medial preoptic area of individual mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D-G</xref>). Due to the established importance of the RP3V in the estrogen positive feedback mechanism and possible role of the MPN (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Wintermantel, Campbell et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Porteous and Herbison 2019</xref>), mice were categorized according to the unilateral or bilateral spread of AAV in the AVPV, PVpo and MPN. Injection sites including parts of the AVPV and/or PVpo were termed an “RP3V” hit while AAV spread in central aspects of the medial preoptic area involving at least part of the MPN and were termed an “MPN” hit (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D-G</xref>).</p>
<p>Nine gRNA-2 mice had injection sites involving both the RP3V and MPN; in three mice this included bilateral hits of the “RP3V” and “MPN” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>) while four mice had one region with a bilateral hit and the other unilateral (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref>). The remaining two mice received solely unilateral injections and were excluded from functional correlations. Eight gRNA-3 mice had injection sites involving RP3V and MPN. This included bilateral hits of the “RP3V” and “MPN” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1F</xref>) in three mice with another three mice having one region with a bilateral hit and the other unilateral. The remaining two gRNA-3 mice received solely unilateral injections and were excluded from functional correlations. Of six gRNA-LacZ mice, four had bilateral injections involving the RP3V and MPN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1G</xref>). The remaining two mice had unilateral RP3V/MPN injections, but as ESR1 expression in VGAT neurons is not changed by gRNA-LacZ injections, they were included in functional analyses. This resulted in experimental groups of 6 gRNA-LacZ, 7 gRNA-2 and 6 gRNA-3 mice.</p>

<title>Effects of VGAT ESR1 knockdown on estrous cyclicity</title>
<p>The estrous cycles of <italic>Vgat-Cre,LSL-Cas9-EGFP</italic> mice were determined over a three week period before stereotaxic injection of AAV-gRNA and then again for 3 weeks after a three-week post-surgical interval. Mean cycle length for all animals prior to AAV injection was 5.9±1.5 days. No significant differences (p&gt;0.05, Wilcoxon paired tests) were detected in cycle length for mice given gRNA-LacZ (n=6), gRNA-2 (N=7) or gRNA-3 (n=6) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A-C</xref>). Whereas individual gRNA-LacZ mice exhibited relatively stable cycles before (5.9±0.7 days) and 3-weeks after (5.6±0.7 days) AAV injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2F</xref>), gRNA-2 and −3 mice displayed considerable variability in estrous cycle length after AAV injection with some mice entering constant estrous (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2G</xref>); scored as zero for cycle length. We considered that this heterogeneity may have resulted from variations in ESR1 knockdown across the RP3V and MPN in individual mice. To assess this, all animals that had bilateral AAV injections involving the RP3V (n=9) and those with bilateral MPN injections (n=10) were considered as separate groups. These groupings also exhibited great variability with no significant differences (p&gt;0.05, Wilcoxon paired tests) in cycle length (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D,E</xref>). The four mice displaying constant estrous did not exhibit any unique gRNA, bilateral/unilateral injection location, or level of ESR1 in RP3V or MPN VGAT neurons.</p>

<title>Effects of VGAT ESR1 knockdown on pulsatile LH secretion</title>
<p>Following the post-AAV estrous cycle monitoring, pulsatile LH secretion was evaluated in diestrus, or in estrus for the four mice that had stopped cycling, using 5-min interval tail tip bleeding for 180 min (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Steyn, Wan et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Czieselsky, Prescott et al. 2016</xref>) and analyzed with PULSAR-Otago using the “Intact Female” parameters (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Porteous, Haden et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>All mice exhibited typical profiles of pulsatile LH secretion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3 A-D</xref>) with the exception of three mice (one in each gRNA group) that had no LH pulse during the 180 min sampling period. The gRNA-lacZ mice exhibited mean LH levels of 0.39±0.10 ng/mL (n=6) and had LH pulses with an interval of 32.6±3.1 min and amplitude of 0.92±0.17 ng/mL (n=5), as found in wild-type mice (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Czieselsky, Prescott et al. 2016</xref>). No differences were detected in mean LH (p=0.35; Kruskal-Wallis test), pulse amplitude (p=0.34) or pulse interval (p=0.34) between gRNA-LacZ and gRNA-2 (n=6-7) or gRNA-3 mice (n=5-6) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3E-G</xref>). To test whether bilateral ESR1 knockdown in VGAT neurons in the RP3V or MPN might be more selective in identifying a pulse phenotype, we re-grouped mice as above depending on their bilateral involvement of the RP3V and MPN and correlated pulse parameters with ESR1 expression in VGAT neurons. No significant correlations were detected between any parameter in either region (Pearson correlation r values of 0.06-0.41; p&gt;0.05)(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3H-M</xref>).</p>

<p>All gRNA-lacZ mice had increased cFos expression in rostral preoptic area GnRH neurons (43±8%, range 24-84%; 21±0.7 GnRH neurons/section), although two of the mice had LH levels below 1.5 ng/mL indicating that they had likely surged before lights off (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A,B</xref>). Unexpectedly, huge variation was found between gRNA-2 and gRNA-3 treated mice in the generation of the surge (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A,B</xref>). The number of GnRH neurons detected in the rPOA was the same in all groups (gRNA2, 20±1.9 GnRH neurons/section; gRNA3, 20±1.7 GnRH neurons/section). However, a significant reduction in the number GnRH neuron with cFos was found with gRNA-2 (p=0.0023, Kruskal Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons) but not gRNA-3 (p=0.91) compared with gRNA-LacZ mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref>). The wide variation in single point LH values in all three groups did not reveal any significant differences between groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4B</xref>). This was a curious result given that gRNA-2 and −3 generated an identical 60-70% ESR1 knockdown in VGAT neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>). To explore this effect of gRNA-2 further and parcellate between the RP3V and MPN, we again re-grouped the mice depending on whether they had bilateral involvement of the RP3V and MPN. A significant correlation was found between ESR1 expression in RP3V VGAT neurons and cFos in GnRH neurons (p=0.008, Pearson r = 0.66) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4C</xref>) but not LH secretion (p=0.26, Pearson r=0.31) across all mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4D</xref>). No significant correlation was found for ESR1 expression in MPN VGAT neurons and cFos in GnRH (p=0.18, Pearson r = 0.36) or LH secretion (p=0.60, Pearson r=0.14) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4E,F</xref>).</p>

<title>CRISPR knockdown of ESR1 in RP3V GABA-kisspeptin neurons</title>
<p>The above observations suggested that ESR1 in RP3V VGAT neurons was required for the activation of GnRH neurons at the time of the surge. However, it remained unclear why so much heterogeneity remained in this group; some mice with significant ESR1 knockdown (&lt;20%) continued to show surge levels of cFos in GnRH neurons (&gt;40%). Further the mice entering constant estrus had some of the highest levels of remaining ESR1 in RP3V VGAT neurons. Given the importance of RP3V kisspeptin neurons for the GnRH surge (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Clarkson, d’Anglemont de Tassigny et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Vanacker et al. 2019</xref>) and evidence that these cells are a GABAergic phenotype (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Moffitt, Bambah-Mukku et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Stephens and Kauffman 2021</xref>), we considered that one possible explanation for the heterogeneity was that the CRISPR gene editing had knocked down ESR1 variably in the sub-population of RP3V GABA neurons co-expressing kisspeptin.</p>

<title>Effects of ESR1 knockdown on estrous cycles, pulsatile LH secretion and the LH surge</title>
<p>The groups segregated by kisspeptin expression exhibited highly consistent reproductive phenotypes. The two gRNA groups with normal RP3V kisspeptin expression (“lacZ” and “normal”), exhibited normal estrous cycles 3 weeks after AAV injection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5C</xref>), the usual variable LH surge levels (4.8±1.7 and 6.3±1.3 ng/mL; range 0.1-14.3 ng/mL)(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5D</xref>) and ∼40-50% of GnRH neurons with cFos at the time of the expected LH surge (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5E</xref>). This was accompanied by normal pulsatile LH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5F-H</xref>). In contrast, the “bilateral” mice with essentially no RP3V kisspeptin expression were all found to enter constant estrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs.2D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>) and have both low LH levels (1.4±0.3 ng/mL; range 0.8-2.1 ng/mL) and low cFos expression in GnRH neurons (4.3±2.6%; p=0.0185, Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s tests)(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5E</xref>) at the time of the expected surge. The LH surge levels across the groups were significantly different (p=0.0320; Krusakl-Wallis ANOVA; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5D</xref>) but the high variability in lacZ and normal mice prevented significant differences between individual groups. Pulsatile LH release in “bilateral” mice was variable with one mouse having no pulses in the 180 min recording period while the others displayed pulses not significantly different to gRNA-lacZ mice despite an apparent trend for reduced LH pulse amplitude (p=0.1409) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5H</xref>). Finally, the “unilateral” mice displayed a phenotype intermediate between that of “normal” and “bilateral” groups. Estrous cyclicity was normal (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5C</xref>) except for one mouse that went into constant diestrus and LH pulsatility was unaffected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5F-H</xref>), while LH levels (1.6±0.5 ng/mL) and the % GnRH neurons with cFos (10.3±3.7%, p=0.0297, Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s tests) at the time of the expected LH surge were similar to the “bilateral” group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We find here that CRISPR knockdown of ESR1 in preoptic area GABAergic neurons results in a variable reproductive phenotype with most mice exhibiting normal estrous cycles and LH secretion. However, re-sorting individual mice on the basis of their RP3V kisspeptin expression provided highly consistent reproductive traits; mice with absent RP3V kisspeptin expression were acyclic and failed to exhibit an LH surge but retained pulsatile LH secretion. These data demonstrate an essential role for the RP3V GABA-kisspeptin neuronal phenotype in the murine estrogen positive feedback mechanism.</p>
<p>We show here that gRNA-2 and gRNA-3 are effective at knocking down ESR1 expression in preoptic GABA neurons in adult female mice; both gRNA achieved a 60-70% reduction in ESR1 within the RP3V and MPN compared to gRNA-lacZ mice. We had previously reported that gRNA-3 generated an 80% knockdown in ESR1 within arcuate kisspeptin neurons (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">McQuillan, Clarkson et al. 2022</xref>). This indicates that general utility of the CRISPR approach for <italic>in vivo</italic> gene editing of ESR1 in the mouse brain.</p>
<p>When examined on the basis of the original GABA neuron groupings, the only significant observation was that expression of ESR1 in RP3V GABA neurons correlated positively with the percentage of GnRH neurons expressing cFos at the time of the surge. The significant correlation between the ESR1 expression in RP3V GABA neurons and cFos in GnRH neurons when all gRNA-2 and gRNA-3 mice were combined revealed that this was not likely to be due to any unique actions of gRNA-2. While providing evidence that ESR1 in RP3V GABA neurons was required for normal activation of the GnRH neurons at the time of the surge, this was not the case for the LH surge. We note that single-point LH measurements are unreliable even for the OVX+E2 paradigm with individual mice exhibiting quite marked variability in surge onset and peak LH levels (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Czieselsky, Prescott et al. 2016</xref>). As such, we favor cFos expression in GnRH neurons as a more reliable index of whether the surge has commenced at the time of investigation.</p>
<p>The highly variable reproductive phenotypes of the ESR1 knockdown mice became consistent when sorted on the basis of their RP3V kisspeptin expression. Four mice exhibited a near complete lack of kisspeptin immunoreactivity within the entire RP3V. As the RP3V kisspeptin neurons are a GABAergic phenotype (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Moffitt, Bambah-Mukku et al. 2018</xref>), they will be targeted for Cas9 expression in the <italic>Vgat-Cre,LSL-Cas9-EGFP</italic> mice. Prior estimates have indicated that 20-75% of RP3V kisspeptin neurons express Vgat in adult mice (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Cravo, Margatho et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Cheong, Czieselsky et al. 2015</xref>) although it is very likely that all RP3V kisspeptin neurons express VGAT during development and, as such, will express Cas9 as adults. Hence, when the bilateral stereotaxic AAV-gRNA injections happen to include the entire extent of the RP3V, all GABA-kisspeptin neurons will be targeted. The almost complete lack of kisspeptin immunoreactivity is most likely due to the dependence of kisspeptin expression on ESR1 in RP3V kisspeptin neurons (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Smith, Cunningham et al. 2005</xref>, <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Dubois, Acosta-Martinez et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Greenwald-Yarnell, Marsh et al. 2016</xref>). The CRSIPR-mediated knockdown in ESR1 within these cells would gradually result in the suppression of kisspeptin biosynthesis. However, one curious observation is that essentially all kisspeptin immunoreactivity in the RP3V is absent despite the expectation that some kisspeptin neurons would retain functional ESR1; CRISPR does not, by design, generate a complete knockout (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Platt, Chen et al. 2014</xref>). Hence, the near complete absence of kisspeptin might also result from disordered circulating estradiol levels in acyclic mice.</p>
<p>We also noted an interesting reproductive phenotype in mice with unilateral knockdown of ESR1 in RP3V kisspeptin neurons resulting in unilateral 70-80% reductions in kisspeptin-immunoreactive neuron numbers. Although showing no change in estrous cycles, these mice had somewhat similar deficits in GnRH neuron activation levels at the time of the surge compared to mice with no RP3V kisspeptin. Prior studies have indicated that 30-50% reductions in RP3V kisspeptin neuron number are compatible with a normal surge mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Szymanski and Bakker 2012</xref>, <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Hu, Li et al. 2015</xref>). It is possible that a substantial reduction in RP3V kisspeptin input to GnRH neurons from one side of the brain results in weaker surge activation. It may also alter the timing of surge onset outside the window examined in this study as the mice maintain normal estrous cycles implying that ovulation is occurring.</p>
<p>It is widely anticipated that that RP3V kisspeptin neurons are the critical estradiol-sensing component underlying the preovulatory surge mechanism (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Uenoyama, Inoue et al. 2021</xref>, <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Goodman, Herbison et al. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kauffman 2022</xref>). We now provide data demonstrating that ESR1-expressing RP3V kisspeptin neurons are essential for the surge mechanism and estrous cyclicity in mice. We also note that pulsatile LH secretion is maintained in the absence of RP3V kisspeptin expression. A trend towards a reduced LH pulse amplitude was observed but, alongside pulse frequency, no significant differences were detected. This observation agrees with the “two-compartment model” of the GnRH neuron network in which the kisspeptin pulse and kisspeptin surge generators are thought to operate in relative independence at different compartments of the female GnRH neuron to bring about LH pulses and the LH surge, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Herbison 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>A caveat to an exclusive role of RP3V kisspeptin neurons in surge generation is the possibility that non-kisspeptin ESR1-expressing GABA neurons immediately adjacent to RP3V kisspeptin cells are also required for the surge. However, we note that acyclic mice with no kisspeptin (“bilateral loss”) had the same levels of ESR1 knockdown in RP3V GABA neurons found in normal mice that exhibited normal surge activation. Nevertheless, we cannot be sure that the significant correlation between the degree of ESR1 knockdown in RP3V GABA neurons and GnRH neuron activation at the surge is attributable entirely to GABA-kisspeptin neurons. If RP3V GABAergic non-kisspeptin neurons are involved, it seems that they may play an intrinsic role within the RP3V as GABA release from the RP3V to GnRH neurons is inconsequential for surge induction (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Piet, Kalil et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we show here that CRISPR gene editing can be used to efficiently knockdown ESR1 in GABAergic neurons. Characterizing reproductive phenotypes on an individual animal basis in relation to GABA neuron sub-populations revealed that a loss of kisspeptin in RP3V GABA neurons was perfectly correlated with a absent surge mechanism and estrous acyclicity. These observations provide definitive evidence for ESR1-expressing RP3V GABA-kisspeptin neurons being essential for the preovulatory surge mechanism while having no role in pulse generation.</p>

Cell counts were undertaken by analyzing all EGFP-positive cells through 10 z-slices of 2μm thickness in sections at each of the levels of the RP3V-MPN for each mouse. The number of kisspeptin neurons with ESR1 was assessed under brightfield microscopy by counting the number of kisspeptin-immunoreactive cells (brown DAB) with and without black (nickel-DAB) ESR1-positive nuclei bilaterally in 3-4 sections throughout the AVPV and PVpo in each mouse. The number of GnRH neurons with cFos was assessed under brightfield microscopy by counting the number of GnRH-immunoreactive cells (brown DAB) with and without black (NiDAB) cFos-positive nuclei bilaterally in 2 sections of the rostral preoptic area in each mouse.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The current study examines the necessity of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) in GABA neurons located in the anteroventral and preoptic periventricular nuclei and the medial preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. This brain area is implicated in regulating the pre-ovulatory LH surge in females, but the identity of the estrogen-sensitive neurons that are required remains unknown. The data indicate that approximately 70% knockdown of ESR1 in GABA neurons resulted in variable reproductive phenotypes. However, when the ESR1 knockdown also results in a decrease in kisspeptin expression by these cells, the females had disrupted LH surges, but no alterations in pulsatile LH release. These data support the hypothesis that kisspeptin cells in this region are critical for the pre-ovulatory LH surge in females.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The current study examined the efficacy of two guide RNAs to knockdown ESR1 in GABA neurons, resulting in an approximate 70% reduction in ESR1 in GABA neurons. The efficacy of this knockdown was confirmed in the brain via immunohistochemistry and the reproductive outcomes were analyzed several ways to account for differences in guide RNAs or the precise brain region with the ESR1 knockdown. The analysis was taken one step further by grouping mice based on kisspeptin expression following ESR1 knockdown and examining the reproductive phenotypes. Overall, the aims of the study were achieved, the methods were appropriate, and the data were analyzed extensively. This data supports the hypothesis that kisspeptin neurons in the anterior hypothalamus are critical for the preovulatory LH surge.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: One minor weakness in this study is the conclusion that the guide RNAs didn't seem to have unique effects on GnRH cFos expression or the reproductive phenotypes. Though the data indicate a 60-70% knockdown for both gRNA2 and gRNA3, 3 of the 4 gRNA2 mice had no cFos expression in GnRH neurons during the time of the LH surge, whereas all mice receiving gRNA3 had at least some cFos/GnRH co-expression. In addition, when mice were re-categorized based on reduction (&gt;75%) in kisspeptin expression, most of the mice in the unilateral or bilateral groups received gRNA2, whereas many of the mice that received gRNA3 were in the &quot;normal&quot; group with no disruption in kisspeptin expression. Thus, additional experiments with increased sample sizes are needed, even if the efficacy of the ESR1 knockdown was comparable before concluding these 2 gRNAs don't result in unique reproductive effects.</p>

<p>Clarkson et al investigated the impact of in vivo ESR1 gene disruption selectively in preoptic area GABA neurons on the estrogen regulation of LH secretion. The hypothalamic pathways by which estradiol controls the secretion of gonadotrophins are incompletely understood and relevant to a better understanding of the mechanisms driving fertility and reproduction. Using CRISPR-Cas9 methodology, the authors were able to effectively reduce the expression of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha in GABA neurons located in the preoptic area of adult female mice. The results obtained were rather variable except in the animals with concomitant suppression of kisspeptin in the rostral periventricular region of the third ventricle (RP3V), which displayed interruption of ovarian cyclicity and an altered estradiol-induced LH surge. The experimental approach used allowed for a cell-selective, temporally-controlled suppression of ER-alpha expression, providing further evidence of the critical role of RP3V kisspeptin neurons in the estrogen positive-feedback effect. Nevertheless, the assessment of the estradiol-induced LH surge was limited to only one terminal blood collection. The preovulatory LH surge is a variable phenomenon and would require serial blood sampling for a conclusive evaluation of the surge occurrence or alteration, such as in shape, amplitude, or timing. The animals were not assessed for ovulation either, which might be a functional readout for the effectiveness of the LH surge. Thus, the actual effect on the preovulatory LH surge was not fully characterized. Finally, the study leaves unanswered the role of GABA itself. As there was no evident phenotype for the ESR1 knockdown in GABA neurons that do not coexpress kisspeptin, this suggests that GABA neurotransmission in the preoptic area is not involved in the estrogen regulation of LH secretion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Although the key role of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα ; encoded by ESR1 gene) in the control of reproduction has been known for more than two decades, the identity of the neuronal population(s) underlying the control of the negative and positive feedbacks exerted by estrogens on the hypothalamic pituitary ovary axis has been more complicated to pinpoint. Among the factors contributing to the difficulty in this endeavor are the cellular heterogeneity of the preoptic area and hypothalamus and the pulsatile activity of the axis. Several neuronal populations have been identified that control the activity of GnRH neurons, the hypothalamic headmasters of the axis. Among them, the kisspeptin neurons of the rostral periventricular aspect of the third ventricle (RP3V) have been considered the major candidates to convey preovulatory estrogen signals to GnRH neurons, which do not express ERα. Yet, the existence of other populations of kisspeptin neurons (notably in the arcuate nucleus) has made it difficult to selectively ablate ESR1 in one population. A first study (Wang et al., 2019) reported that knocking down ESR1 specifically in RP3V kisspeptin neurons led to decreased excitability of Kp neurons, blunted spontaneous as well estrogen-induced preovulatory LH surge, and reduced or absent corpora lutea indicative of impaired ovulation, but cyclicity was left unaltered.</p>
<p>As GABAergic afferences to GnRH neurons are also implicated in mediating the effects of estrogens on the HPG axis, the present study sought to investigate their role in the positive feedback using genetically driven Crispr-Cas9 mediated knockdown of ERα in VGAT expressing neurons in a specific subregion of the preoptic area. To this end, they stereotaxically delivered viral vectors expressing validated guide RNA into the preoptic area and evaluated their impact on estrus cyclicity and the ability of mice to mount an LH surge induced by estrogens and associated activation of GnRH neurons assessed by the co-expression of Fos. The results demonstrate that knocking down ESR1 in preoptic gabaergic neurons leads to an absence of LH surge and acyclicity when associated with severely reduced kisspeptin expression suggesting that a subpopulation of neurons co-expressing Kp and VGAT neurons are key for LH surge since total absence of Kp is associated with an absence of GnRH neuron activation and reduced LH surge (although this was not confirmed by the post-hoc). Although the implication of kisspeptin neurons was highly suspected already, the novelty of these results lies in the fact that estrogen signaling is necessary for only a selected fraction of them to maintain both regular cycles and LH surge capacity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Remarkable aspects of this study are, its dataset which allowed them to segregate animals based on distinct neuronal phenotypes matching specific physiological outcomes, the transparency in reporting the results (e.g. all statistical values being reported, all grouping variables being clearly defined, clarity about animals that were excluded and why) and the clarity of the writing. This allows the reader to understand clearly what has been done and how the analyses have been carried out. The same applies to the discussion which describes clearly possible interpretations as well as the limitations of this study based on a single in vivo experiment.</p>
<p>Another remarkable feature of this work lies in the analysis of the dataset. As opposed to the cre-lox approach which theoretically allows for the complete ablation of specific neuronal populations, but may lack specificity regarding timing of action and location, genetically driven in vivo Crispr-Cas9 editing offers both temporal and neuroanatomic selectivity but cannot achieve a complete knockdown. This approach based on stereotaxic delivery of the AAV-encoded guide RNAs comes with inevitable variability in the location where gene knockdown is achieved. By adjusting their original grouping of the animals based on the evaluation of the extent of kisspeptin expression in the target region, the authors obtained a much clearer and interpretable picture. Although only a few animals (n=4) displayed absent kisspeptin expression, the convergence of observations suggesting a central impairment of the reproductive axis is convincing.</p>
<p>In particular, the lack of activation of GnRH neurons in these mice despite a non-significant effect on the reduced LH levels in the post-hoc following a significant ANOVA (which is likely due to the limited number of concerned animals [n=4]), is convincing. Did the authors test whether LH concentrations correlated with the percentage of GnRH+ESR1 positive neurons? This could reinforce the conclusion.</p>
<p>Moreover, the apparent complete absence of kisspeptin expression in these 4 animals is compelling as it provides indirect confirmation of the key role of Kisspeptin neurons in this phenomenon using a different LH surge induction paradigm than Wang et al., 2019. Yet, the quality of the kisspeptin immunostaining in control animals does seem suboptimal and casts doubts about this conclusion (see the section on weaknesses for more details).</p>
<p>It is also interesting that a few animals with unilateral reduction in Kp expression also showed deficits in GnRH neuron activation suggesting that the impact of Kp may not be limited to the side of the brain where it is produced or the existence of a dose effect of Kp activation of GnRH neurons.</p>
<p>Finally, the observation that the pulsatile secretion of LH is maintained in the absence of Kp expression in the RP3V lends support to the notion that LH surge and pulsatility are regulated independently by distinct neuronal populations, a model put forward by the corresponding author a few years ago.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
One aspect for which I have ambiguous feelings is the minimal level of detail regarding the HPG axis and its regulation by estrogens. This limited amount of detail allows for an easy read with the well-articulated introduction quickly presenting the framework of the study. Although not presenting the axis itself nor mentioning the position of GnRH neurons in this axis or its lack of ERα expression is not detrimental to the understanding of the study, presenting at least the position of GnRH neurons in the axis and their critical role for fertility would likely broaden the impact of this work beyond a rather specialist audience.</p>
<p>The expression of kisspeptin constitutes a key element for the analysis and conclusion of the present work. However, the quality of the kisspeptin immunostaining seems suboptimal based on the representative images. The staining primarily consists of light punctuated structures and it is very difficult to delineate cytoplasmic immunoreactive material defining the shape of neurons in LacZ animals. For some of the cells marked by an arrow, it is also sometimes difficult to determine whether the staining for ESR1 and Kp are in the same focal plane and thus belong to the same neurons. Although this co-expression is not critical for the conclusions of the study, this begs the question of whether Kp expression was determined directly at the microscope (where the focal plan can be adjusted) or on the picture (without possible focal adjustment). Moreover, in the representative image of Kp loss, several nuclei stained for fos (black) show superimposed brown staining looking like a dense nucleus (but smaller than an actual nucleus). This suggests some sort of condensed accumulation of Kp immunoproduct in the nucleus which is not commented. Given the critical importance of this reported change in Kp expression for the interpretation of the present results, it is important to provide strong evidence of the quality/nature of this staining and its analysis which may help interpret the observed functional phenotype.</p>
<p>As acknowledged in the introduction, this study is not the first to use in vivo Crisp-Cas editing to demonstrate the role of kisspeptin neurons in the control of positive feedback. Although the present work achieved this indirectly by targeting VGAT neurons, I was surprised that the paper did not include more comparison of their results with those of Wang et al., 2019. In particular, why was the present approach more successful in achieving both lack of surge and complete acyclicity? Moreover, why is it that targeting ESR1 in a selected fraction of GABAergic neurons can lead to a near-complete absence of Kp expression in this region? This is briefly discussed in the penultimate paragraph but mostly focuses on the non-kisspeptinergic GABAneurons rather than those co-expressing the two markers.</p>
