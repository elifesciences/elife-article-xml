<title>Abstract</title>
<p>When replication forks encounter DNA lesions that cause polymerase stalling a checkpoint pathway is activated. The ATR-dependent intra-S checkpoint pathway mediates detection and processing of sites of replication fork stalling to maintain genomic integrity. Several factors involved in the global checkpoint pathway have been identified, but the response to a single replication fork barrier (RFB) is poorly understood. We utilized the <italic>E.coli</italic>-based Tus-<italic>Ter</italic> system in human MCF7 cells and showed that the Tus protein binding to <italic>TerB</italic> sequences creates an efficient site-specific RFB. The single fork RFB was sufficient to activate a local, but not global, ATR-dependent checkpoint response that leads to phosphorylation and accumulation of DNA damage sensor protein γH2AX, confined locally to within a kilobase of the site of stalling. These data support a model of local management of fork stalling, which allows global replication at sites other than the RFB to continue to progress without delay.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genomic DNA is constantly exposed to exogenous and endogenous damaging agents, forming DNA lesions that challenge the progression of replication forks (RFs) during the S-phase of the cell cycle. The genome contains natural impediments, which cause replication stalling such as common fragile sites, repeated sequences, non-B structures, sites of collision between transcription and replication machinery, or DNA-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mirkin and Mirkin, 2007</xref>). These replication fork barriers (RFB) can impede the progression of the replication machinery and if unresolved, lead to genomic instability, a common hallmark of aneuploidy, neurological and neuromuscular disorders, and cancer.</p>
<p>Replication stress can impede the progression of the replication fork. During replication stress, the intra-S phase checkpoint pathway can be activated at a local and global level which is a critical step to process the DNA lesions and maintaining genome integrity. The S-phase checkpoint involves the uncoupling of replicative polymerases from the replicative helicase and the generation of ssDNA, which rapidly gets coated with RPA. In turn, this activates ATR/ATRIP kinase signaling with its effector kinase CHK1, plus phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser139 in response to a variety of lesions which promote cell cycle arrest, fork stabilization, and restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Iyer and Rhind, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Willis and Rhind, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zeman and Cimprich, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies suggest that the local and global intra-S checkpoints are two distinct mechanisms that can be distinguished by the signaling intensity of detecting DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Saxena and Zou, 2022</xref>). It is thought that a threshold of DNA damage must be reached to activate the global checkpoint and impact cell cycle progression during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bantele et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Shimada et al., 2002</xref>). The local checkpoint reacts to a unique replication fork stalling site, which does not impact overall cell cycle progression. The proteins involved in the global replication stress response have been identified using DNA damaging agents that lead to multiple DNA lesion formation randomly throughout the genome. Nevertheless, the mechanism and timing of the checkpoint pathway at a local scale remain largely unknown and are critical to understanding the series of processes at a single RF stall.</p>
<p>In the <italic>E.coli</italic> genome, the DNA pausing sequences called terminator (Ter) are recognized by a protein called Tus to cause a polar site-specific arrest of the RF at the end of the bacterial chromosome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hiasa and Marians, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hidaka et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mulcair et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Roecklein et al., 1991</xref>). The Tus-<italic>Ter</italic> complex leads to a temporarily locked complex on DNA that can be overcome by the fork arriving in the opposite direction, displacing Tus to terminate replication. The artificial <italic>E.coli</italic>-based Tus/Ter system has previously been employed in mouse embryonic stem cells to measure homologous recombination repair products and investigate the DNA repair pathway choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chandramouly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Willis et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we integrated a plasmid with 5 repeats of the <italic>TerB</italic> sequence in the non-permissive orientation at a unique site within chromosome 12 of the breast cancer cell line MCF7 (MCF7 5C-TerB clone). We utilized the integrated Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> system in human MCF7 cells to artificially generate individual RFBs and investigated the activation of the S-phase checkpoint signaling mechanism. We show that Tus/Ter creates an efficient site-specific RFB in human cells and observed local activation of ATR signaling which was responsible for the phosphorylation of DNA damage marker γH2AX at the stall sites. When a replication fork pauses at the local Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> block, we do not detect any alteration in global replication profiles. Our system allows us to study the ATR-checkpoint activity as a local response to a single RFB.</p>

<title>Tus is found enriched at <italic>TerB</italic> sites integrated in human cells</title>
<p>The 23 bp <italic>TerB</italic> sequence in interaction with the Tus protein have been successfully used in yeast and mice to create artificial RFBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Larsen et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Willis et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Willis and Scully, 2016</xref>). To study the effect of site-specific replication blocks at a genomic locus in human cells, a previously established MCF7 clone with a unique integrated copy of a plasmid carrying two sets of 5 repeats of the <italic>TerB</italic> sequence in the non-permissive orientation was used (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>, SupFig1). Whole genome sequencing of the clone was carried out to confirm the single copy integration of the plasmid at hg38 chr12:95325001. Firstly, we checked if Tus protein was able to bind <italic>TerB sequences</italic> in this artificial system in human cells. Chromatin-Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) was performed using an antibody against the His-tag 24h after MCF7 5C-TerB cells were transfected with a Tus-His expression plasmid. The Tus signal is specifically enriched over 20 times compared to the vector control (VC) condition in proximity to the <italic>TerB</italic> sequences (PP9, 2, and 47) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>).</p>

<p>To corroborate this observation, we performed the proximity ligation assay (PLA) (see methods). Two tagged-Tus (HA-Tus and Tus-His) or a VC expression plasmid were simultaneously transfected and antibodies against the two tags, HA and His, were used to generate a PLA signal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>, D). We observed 19% of the cells transfected with the two tagged Tus were harboring one or two PLA signal versus 9% of the cells transfected with the VC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref>), a significant enrichment of the PLA signal when Tus was bound to <italic>TerB</italic>. These results indicate a specific interaction of the Tus protein with the <italic>TerB</italic> sequences in human cells.</p>

<title>The Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> barrier is an efficient block to incoming replication forks</title>
<p>It has previously been demonstrated that the Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> interaction can induce an RFB in mouse embryonic cells in an episomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Willis et al., 2014</xref>). We reasoned that our integrated system in MCF7 cells would be more prone to replication fork arrests near the <italic>TerB</italic> sequences. We used single-molecule analysis of replicated DNA (SMARD) to investigate evidence of replication fork stalling in the genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Norio and Schildkraut, 2001</xref>). The self-labeling SNAP-tag was used to label Tus. After induction of Myc-NLS-TUS-SNAP by using Dox for 3 days, asynchronous MCF7 5C-TerB cells were sequentially pulse-labeled using two nucleoside analogs (iododeoxyuridine (IdU) and chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU)) for 4h each (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). The isolated DNA was digested by restriction endonuclease Sfil and the 200 kb fragment obtained was stretched on slides for staining. Two DNA FISH probes were used to detect the 200 kb segment of interest containing the <italic>TerB</italic> arrays: one probe of 40 kb within the chromosome 12 (hg38 chr12:95,199,827 – 95,239,226) and one probe of 7 kb made from pWB15 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). The direction of replication forks could be determined using the labeling patterns and its position within the locus of interest using our FISH probes. After inducing the expression of Myc-NLS-TUS-SNAP from an integrated plasmid in MCF7 5C-TerB cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">SupFig.2A, B</xref>), we analyzed its impact on the replication fork progression within the region containing <italic>TerB</italic> repeats (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C</xref>, D). The yellow arrows indicate the transition of labeling from IdU to CldU incorporation showing the replication fork direction. When Tus was expressed, these transition sites were found accumulated near the <italic>TerB</italic> regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D</xref>, arrows within the white oval) compared to the random signal spread on the 200 kb region when Tus is not expressed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C</xref>). We quantified the percentage of molecules with replication forks at each 5 Kb interval in the 200 kb SfiI segment containing <italic>TerB</italic> sequences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2E</xref>, F) and confirmed an accumulation of forks at the <italic>TerB</italic> sequences only when Tus was expressed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2F</xref>, black arrow) supporting that the binding of Tus on <italic>TerB</italic> arrays can impair the replisome progression at genomic loci. Interestingly, expression of the Tus protein alone does not alter the direction of replication fork progression along the 200 kb SfiI segment where forks predominantly progress from the 3’ to 5’ direction in cells both with and without Tus expression as analyzed by the percentage of molecules with IdU incorporation at each 5 kb interval (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">SupFig.2C, D</xref>). Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in the global replication fork speed in cells with or without Tus expression (SupTable1). Together, these data indicate that when Tus bound the <italic>TerB</italic> sequences integrated within chromosome 12, it creates a physical barrier and an obstacle to the replication fork progression.</p>

<p>The eukaryotic replisome is a multiprotein apparatus consisting of DNA helicases, DNA polymerases and accessory proteins to duplicate the genome. We hypothesized that an RFB would induce an accumulation of these proteins on chromatin around <italic>TerB</italic> sequences. To test our hypothesis, we performed ChIP using an antibody against mini-chromosome maintenance protein 3 (MCM3), a CMG core-complex protein, in the absence or presence of Tus. When Tus was expressed, MCM3 was 3-fold more enriched upstream of the <italic>TerB</italic> arrays at the PP0-2 and PP10 sites compared to the surrounding primer pairs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2G</xref>, H). Additionally, we find that there is an enrichment of the DNA repair scaffold protein FANCM at the <italic>TerB</italic> sites mirroring the MCM3 enrichment (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">SupFig.3</xref>), indicative of the stalled replication forks as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Collis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nandi and Whitby, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Panday et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these results show that Tus expression induces a RFB at the <italic>TerB</italic> arrays impairing the replisome progression during S-phase.</p>

<title>γH2AX is enriched at <italic>TerB</italic> sites after Tus expression before fork collapse</title>
<p>One of the earliest responses to replication stress is the phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX on serine 139 (γH2AX) by members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-like family (PIKK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ward and Chen, 2001</xref>). As we demonstrated that <italic>TerB</italic> arrays can block incoming replication forks, we asked whether we could see a γH2AX signal enrichment due to fork arrest. Using a co-immunoprecipitation assay with the chromatin fraction of cross-linked-cells expressing either GFP tag or GFP-Tus, we found that GFP-Tus and γH2AX were immunoprecipitated together using GFP or γH2AX antibodies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain insight into the γH2AX signal at the RFB induced by the Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> interaction, cells were transfected with either VC or HA-Tus expression plasmids, and PLA was performed using antibodies against HA and γH2AX (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B</xref>). We found that 16% of the HA-Tus transfected cells were harboring at least one PLA signal versus 3% of the VC transfected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>).</p>
<p>To better characterize the γH2AX enrichment around <italic>TerB</italic> sites, we performed ChIP-qPCR assays using a γH2AX antibody 24h after Tus or VC expression. We observed an enrichment of γH2AX, strictly co-localizing with the Tus-Ter interaction sites (PP9 and PP47), suggesting a local role of γH2AX in response to stalled RFs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3D</xref>, E). This is in stark contrast to the observed spreading of the γH2AX signal after a site-directed DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berkovich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chailleux et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Clouaire et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Savic et al., 2009</xref>). To corroborate this observation in our integrated cassette, we generated a site-specific DSB by expressing Cas9 targeted to the integrated cassette (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">SupFig.4A-C</xref>). We assessed γH2AX using the ChIP-qPCR assay 24h after transfection and noticed enrichment at the distal primer pair (PP10) contrasting with the very tight local signal observed at the Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> RFB (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">SupFig.4D</xref>). However, we did not find any significant γH2AX signal between VC or Tus expression (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">SupFig 5A-B</xref>) supporting the lack of global response. This suggests that the RFB generated by the interaction between Tus and the <italic>TerB</italic> arrays activates a stress response that stimulates the phosphorylation of H2AX, concentrated around the fork block.</p>

<title>H2AX is phosphorylated in an ATR-dependent manner without a global activation of the intra-S checkpoint</title>
<p>ATR is known to phosphorylate H2AX in response to replication stress and plays a pivotal role in the surveillance of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ward and Chen, 2001</xref>). To understand if the global ATR-dependent checkpoint was activated in response to the Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> RFB, we analyzed the levels of phospho-proteins involved in the intra-S checkpoint activation pathway (RPA, CHK1, and ATR) by immunoblotting fractionated cell extracts 24h after VC or Tus expression. Cells treated with 2mM hydroxyurea (HU) for 4h demonstrated an increase in phospho-protein levels, acting as a control for checkpoint activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>.A, lanes 3 and 4). Tus expression alone did not activate the global ATR-dependent checkpoint as the level of phospho-protein remained the same as the VC control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>.A, lanes 1 and 2). We did not find any observable difference in cell cycle progression between VC or Tus expression alone (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">SupFig6 A-B</xref>) supporting the lack of global response.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that if the local γH2AX enrichment at <italic>TerB</italic> sites was ATR-dependent, a reduction of ATR activity would lead to a decreased γH2AX signal. To validate the ATR inhibitor activity (ATRi), VE-822 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fokas et al., 2012</xref>), we performed immunoblotting using total protein extracts of cells treated with 2mM HU and compared the level of phospho-ATR TH1989 with or without an ATR inhibitor. A 4h treatment with ATRi reduced the level of phospho-ATR TH1989, reflecting a decrease in ATR activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4B</xref>). ChIP-qPCR assays were performed using a γH2AX antibody 24h after VC or Tus expression and cells were harvested after a 4h ATRi treatment. Consistent with our hypothesis, the γH2AX enrichment in the vicinity of <italic>TerB</italic> sites after Tus expression was remarkably decreased upon ATRi treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4C</xref> PP9 and PP47), implying that the Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> RFB activates a localized stress response that stimulated the local phosphorylation of H2AX. Together, these data suggest a local activation of the intra-S checkpoint via the ATR kinase and rapid phosphorylation of H2AX, which could mediate the recruitment of repair factors near the damage site.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Replication stress occurs during the S-phase of the cell cycle, when the replication machinery encounters DNA lesions that cause stalling of replicative polymerases and can be a significant cause of genomic instability. If the stalled forks cannot be processed, they can result in DNA breakage, mutations, and chromosomal rearrangements leading to the development of many different human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gaillard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>). In this study, we used the reconstituted <italic>E.coli</italic>-derived protein-DNA barrier, Tus-<italic>TerB,</italic> to study the replication stress response at a single RFB. We have shown that the Tus protein efficiently binds at the <italic>TerB</italic> sequences using ChIP-qPCR and PLA in MCF7 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>). We confirmed that this integrated system was able to cause site-specific RFB at <italic>TerB</italic> sequences when Tus was introduced with the use of the SMARD technique and observed the accumulation of replication fork protein MCM3 upstream of <italic>TerB</italic> sequences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>). Our results indicate that the integrated Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> system acts as an efficient site-specific replication fork barrier, providing valuable insights into the local processing of a stalled single fork in human cells and its difference from global replication stress (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>).</p>
<p>We show that the site-specific replication stress leads to the accumulation of γH2AX at the site of fork block when Tus was expressed by co-immunoprecipitation of Tus and γH2AX (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref>). Additionally, we confirmed that γH2AX is localized at the site of Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> using PLA and ChIP-qPCR assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B</xref>,C). We suggest that the γH2AX signal is being constrained to a region of less than a kilobase from the <italic>TerB</italic> sites by tortional stress generated when the replication fork encounters the barrier and is not influenced by well-defined topological domains that are one measure of the functional units of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, there was no observable difference in global replication profiles or the activation of global checkpoint markers such as pRPA, pCHK1, and pATR, with or without Tus protein expression, contrasting with the differences observed in the presence and absence of HU-induced replication stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref>, SupTable1 &amp; Sup<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>,6). We conclude that Tus-<italic>TerB</italic>-induced replication fork stall does not activate global ATR-dependent S-phase checkpoint signaling, suggesting that a local response is occurring at the stalled replication fork. Interestingly, upon ATR inhibition, we observed that the enrichment of phosphorylated H2AX at <italic>TerB</italic> sites was significantly reduced when Tus was expressed, which indicates local ATR signaling is responsible for the phosphorylation of H2AX at the stalled site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4C</xref>,D). This localized ATR-dependent γH2AX differs from the well-observed ATM-dependent spreading of γH2AX signal after a site-directed double-strand break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berkovich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chailleux et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Clouaire et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Savic et al., 2009</xref>) and suggests a distinct local intra-S phase checkpoint is being activated in response to the single RFB.</p>
<p>There are additional mechanisms to be understood in this newly described local replication stress response, which includes whether the activation of ATR is dependent on ATRIP. ATRIP requires binding to ssDNA, but in unpublished observations we have not found significant ssDNA (using RPA-ChIP) in response to Tus-TerB replication stalling. In the Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> system, there is no known dissociation of the replicative helicase from the polymerase, which is responsible for the ssDNA signal. Therefore, just like ATM can be activated independently of the MRE11 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</xref>), we expect that ATR is activated independently of ATRIP, likely due to local changes in chromatin that will be investigated in future studies.</p>
<p>During extensive DNA damage, the genome-wide checkpoint response activates ATR/CHK1 globally, which leads to the slowing of all replication forks in the cell, inhibition of cell cycle progression, and suppression of late origin firing; to provide sufficient time for DNA repair. It has been proposed that a local checkpoint response occurs when one or a few replication forks encounter a DNA lesion and activates ATR/CHK1 signaling at local sites of fork stalling. The local ATR response has been hypothesized to be transient, in which the fork moves slowly only at stalled sites to promote fork stabilization, restart the stalled fork, and suppress recombination without triggering the global checkpoint response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Iyer and Rhind, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kaufmann et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Merrick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Saxena and Zou, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Willis and Rhind, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zeman and Cimprich, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We predict that the local ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling can result in a rapid and controlled response to allow RFB resolution, through the recruitment of repair factors to the damaged site. The factors might include those involved in fork stabilization, fork reversal, fork cleavage, and homology-dependent replication restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Saxena and Zou, 2022</xref>). The Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> system has previously been employed in mouse embryonic stem cells to measure and investigate the DNA repair pathway choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chandramouly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Panday et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Willis et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">2014</xref>). This included both error-free and error-prone homologous recombination induced by a mammalian chromosomal RFB, as well as identifying the role of the structure-specific endonuclease complex SLX4-XPF and FANCM in the repair of microhomology-mediated tandem duplications that occur at replication arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Elango et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nandi and Whitby, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Willis et al., 2017</xref>). The Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> block is robust and is not dissociated by the action of DNA helicases such as PIF1, corroborated in previous yeast studies that have demonstrated that the “sweepase” RRM3 is unable to resolve this RFB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Larsen et al., 2014b</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the RFB is resolved either by incoming replication forks leading to termination at the <italic>TerB</italic> site or by fork cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Larsen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Willis et al., 2014</xref>). Unpublished work from our laboratory has demonstrated that replication forks are cleaved at or near the <italic>TerB</italic> site, resulting in fork breakage at the barrier. Fork reversal at the Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> site has been observed in the yeast system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Larsen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Marie and Symington, 2022</xref>), but not for the mammalian systems, and it is unlikely that shifting the position of the RFB would make it easier to resolve. Therefore, fork cleavage is the most likely mechanism for resolving the RFB.</p>
<p>The upstream pathway of activation of the DNA damage response, as a result of a single RFB, is not completely understood. Previous work has shown that FANCM acts as a scaffolding protein for recruitment of different repair protein complexes involved in the stalled replication fork rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Panday et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Willis et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that the FANCM protein is enriched at the site of the RFB induced by Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">SupFig.3</xref>), confirming a similar phenomenon observed in mouse cells. However, it is yet to be determined if FANCM recruitment to the RFB precedes local H2AX phosphorylation by ATR, or if FANCM is recruited as a consequence of the γH2AX signal to help elicit the downstream DNA damage response (DDR). We also anticipate that the protein complex, 9-1-1 (RAD9A, HUS1, RAD1), and the subsequently recruited TOPBP1, may also play a role at this local ATR-dependent intra-S checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Helt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Parrilla-Castellar et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>While the Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> system is an important tool in deciphering signaling at individual replication forks, it will be important to test if the local-S phase model remains supported when exploring endogenous lesions that occur when replication forks encounter secondary structures such as R-loops, G-quadruplexes and common fragile sites characterized by trinucleotide repeat expansion [(CAG)n/(CTG)n] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brickner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bryan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Here the mechanisms surrounding the identification and resolution of the RFB may differ. Overall, our results indicate that Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> system acts as an efficient RFB and activates local ATR checkpoint signaling at the stall site, leading to phosphorylation and accumulation of the DNA damage sensor protein γH2AX, which is dependent on the ATR kinase. The local γH2AX accumulation at the stalled region would lead to the recruitment of DNA repair factors for resolution of the fork (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>). Together, our findings reveal the signaling mechanism of the Tus/<italic>TerB</italic> induced replication block and showed that the site-specific fork block is dependent on the local ATR S-phase checkpoint signaling.</p>

<title>Detection of DSBs using the T7 endonuclease assay</title>
<p>MCF7 5C-TerB cells were seeded and transfected the day after with 120 pmol of Cas9 protein and 120 pmol of the sgRNA TerB1 using the Lipofectamine CRISPRMAX™ Cas9 transfection reagents (previously described). 24 hours post-transfection, cells were lysed using a lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 25 mM EDTA pH 8, 0,5% SDS) and 50 ug of Proteinase K overnight at 50°C with shaking. After addition of NaCl and mix for 1 min, the supernatant was put in a new tube and an ethanol precipitation was performed. A PCR to amplify the 900 bp region surrounding the sgRNA TerB1 site was conducted using PP9F and R. Heteroduplex were formed by heating and cooling down the samples and a T7 endonuclease assay digestion was performed prior electrophoresis for detection.</p>

<p>MCF7 5C-TerB cells were transfected as described before. Control cells were treated with 2mM HU for 4 hours before harvesting. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 1 ml cold 70% ethanol for 30 minutes. Cells were pelleted and washed with PBS. 100 µg/mL RNase A was added 50 µg/mL PI solution was added directly to the pellet, mixed well and incubated for 30 mins at room temperature in the dark. 50,000 cells per condition were analyzed by flow cytometry.</p>

<p>Cells were fixed with 4% PFA/PBS for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X 100 for 10 min, washed 3 times in 1X PBS, and blocked in 10% goat serum overnight at 4°C. The primary antibody (1:500) was incubated for 2 hr at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times in 1X PBS. The secondary antibody (1:1500) was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in dark. Cells were then washed again 3 times in 1X PBS. Stained cells were mounted with mounting medium containing DAPI. Slides were imaged at 60X (immersion oil) using Nikon A1 spinning disk confocal microscope.</p>

<title>Image Analysis</title>
<p>For PLA and gH2AX experiments, slides were imaged at 60X (immersion oil) with Nikon spinning disk confocal microscope. PLA foci per nucleus and gH2AX foci per nucleus were calculated using Nikon Elements AR Analysis Explorer (version 5.21.03), where DAPI was used as a mask for the nucleus. The number of PLA foci per nucleus were quantified to get the percentage of cells with 1 or 2 foci indicating a positive signal at the site-specific replication block. The number of gH2AX foci was counted for each DAPI to obtain the average number of gH2AX foci in each condition.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> paper reports data on the cellular response to a single site-specific replication fork block in human MCF7 cells. <bold>Compelling</bold> evidence shows the efficacy of the bacterial Tus-Ter system to stall replication forks in human cells, with fork stalling leading to lasting ATR-dependent phosphorylation of histone H2AX but not of ATR itself and its downstream targets RPA and CHK1.

<p>The authors report the first use of the bacterial Tus-Ter replication block system in human cells. A single plasmid containing two divergently oriented five-fold TerB repeats was integrated on chromosome 12 of MCF7 cells. ChIP and PLA experiments convincingly demonstrate the occupancy of Tus at the Ter sites in cells. Using an elegant Single Molecule Analysis of Replicated DNA (SMARD) assay, convincing data demonstrate the replication block at Ter sites dependent on the presence of the protein. As an orthogonal method to demonstrate fork stalling, ChIP data show the accumulation of the replicative helicase component MCM3 and the repair protein FANCM around the Ter sites. It is unclear whether the Ter sites integrated by a single copy plasmid have any effect on the replication of this region but the data show that the observed effects are dependent on expression of the Tus protein. The SMARD data do not reveal what proportion of forks are arrested at Tus/Ter, or how long the fork delay is imposed. Fork stalling led to a highly localized gammaH2AX response, as monitored by ChIP using primer pairs spread along the integrated plasmid carrying the Ter sites. This response was shown to be dependent on ATR using the ATR inhibitor VE-822. This contrasts with a single Cas9-induced DSB between the two Ter sites, which causes a more spread gammaH2AX response. While this was monitored only at a single distal site, the difference between the DSB and the Tus-induced stall is very significant. Interestingly, despite evidence for ATR activation through the gammaH2AX response, no evidence for phosphorylation of ATR-T1989, CHK1-S345, or RPA2-S33 could be found under fork stalling conditions. The global replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) elicited phosphorylation of ATR-T1989, CHK1-S345, or RPA2-S33. In this context, it would have been of interest to examine if a single DSB in the Ter region leads to phosphorylation of ATR-T1989, CHK1-S345, or RPA2-S33 and cell cycle arrest. It is not shown whether the replication inhibitor HU leads to the same widely spread gamma H2AX response. Overall, this is a well written manuscript, and the data provide convincing evidence that the Tus-Ter system poses a site-specific replication fork block in MCF7 cells leading to a localized ATR-dependent DNA damage checkpoint response that is distinct from the more global response to HU or DSBs.</p>

<p>“It is unclear whether the Ter sites integrated by a single copy plasmid have any effect on the replication of this region but the data show that the observed effects are dependent on expression of the Tus protein.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>-The lack of perturbation of the <italic>TerB</italic> sequence on fork progression has extensively been studied previously in both Willis et al, 2014 and Larsen et. al, 2014. Furthermore, as the detection of the SMARD signal at the <italic>TerB</italic> sites is dependent on the 7.5kb probe that spans the TerB sites (orange probe, Fig 2B &amp; 2D), it would be impossible to study the effect on replication in this region, with and without the integration of the single copy plasmid.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“The SMARD data do not reveal what proportion of forks are arrested at Tus/Ter, or how long the fork delay is imposed.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>-The percentage of fork stalling at the <italic>TerB</italic> sites, with and without Tus expression, has been quantified in Figure 2E &amp; 2F. Essentially, 36% forks stall at the <italic>TerB</italic> block, i.e. 18% of the forks stall in both the 5’ to 3’ (orange) and 3’ to 5’ (blue) direction when the Tus-<italic>TerB</italic> block is active.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“It is not shown whether the replication inhibitor HU leads to the same widely spread gamma H2AX response.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>-While we have not shown gH2AX accumulation via ChIP after HU treatment, Supplementary Figure 5A &amp; 5B clearly show increased gH2AX foci when the cells are treated with HU, suggesting a global replication stress response that is in stark contrast to the response to Tus-<italic>TerB.</italic></p>
