<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Feeding behavior is essential to animals for their survival and reproduction and is known to be modulated by various internal and external factors: nutritional status, sexual maturity, temperature, seasonality, etc. This behavior is known to be closely correlated with reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kauffman &amp; Rissman, 2004</xref>), which is an essential biological activity important for the animal life. Previous studies reported that nutritional-state modulates reproductive behaviors and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amirjani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Volk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lynn et al., 2010</xref>). For example, musk shrews show defective sexual behavior under fasted conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Temple &amp; Rissman, 2000</xref>). In addition, not a few studies demonstrated that fasting-induced low energy condition suppresses reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Evans &amp; Anderson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kalra &amp; Kalra, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kirkwood et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Merry &amp; Holehan, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hasebe et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it has been well investigated how nutritional status resulting from feeding modulates reproduction. On the other hand, it has been reported that some animals change their feeding behavior during the breeding season. For instance, the black seabream migrates to the shallow water during the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tsuyuki, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kawai et al., 2020</xref>) where they can get more food, and the white-tailed deer spend more time for feeding under reproductive status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stone et al., 2017</xref>). Such a close relationship between reproduction and feeding is thought to be important for biological fitness. However, the regulatory mechanisms for breeding season-dependent feeding behavior are still unknown. One possible reason is that most of the model animals appear to have lost the well-defined breeding season. Although the mammalian models, mice and rats, and teleost model zebrafish, have reproductive cycles of about 4-5-days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nilsson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Peute et al., 1978</xref>), they do not have definite breeding seasonality. Thus, the mechanisms for long-term changes in feeding behavior according to the breeding season have not yet been studied in detail.</p>
<p>Here, as a model animal for the seasonal breeder, we used a teleost fish, medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>). Medaka is a useful model animal, whose reproductive status can be experimentally controlled by day length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Robinson &amp; Rugh, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Egami, 1954</xref>) while keeping an appropriate temperature constant. In the long-day (LD) condition (14 h light/10 h dark), female medaka becomes reproductive and regularly spawns every day, while it becomes non-reproductive in the short-day (SD) condition (10 h light/14 h dark). In other words, LD or SD condition can induce breeding or non-breeding season of female medaka, respectively. Thus, medaka enables us to analyze the mechanisms of breeding season-dependent feeding behavior without consideration for possible changes in metabolism and gene expressions due to the changes in ambient temperature.</p>
<p>Regulatory mechanisms of feeding behavior have mainly been analyzed in mammals. These studies reported that some neuropeptides, such as agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY), are involved in the control of feeding and called âfeeding-related peptidesâ as key molecules for the regulation of feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hahn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Andermann &amp; Lowell, 2017</xref>). Teleosts have also been thought to possess a regulatory mechanism for feeding similar to mammals. In fact, expression of homologous genes coding for feeding-related peptides have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">RÃ¸nnestad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Conde-Sieira &amp; Soengas, 2016</xref>). On the other hand, although administration of some of them have been suggested to induce feeding behavior in teleosts as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">RÃ¸nnestad et al., 2017</xref>), their functions in feeding behaviors still remain unclear.</p>
<p>In the present study, to understand mechanisms of breeding season-dependent feeding behavior, we focused on female medaka, which clearly show seasonal changes in breeding conditions by day length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mitani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kanda et al., 2008</xref>) under the fixed appropriate temperature. We first quantified changes in feeding behavior according to the breeding states and found that female medaka under the condition of breeding season (LD) eat more than those under the condition of non-breeding (SD). Therefore, we searched for genes that show breeding state-dependent changes in expression and found some candidates for feeding-related peptides in medaka. We then analyzed expressions of the candidate genes by using RNA-seq, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, and RT-qPCR, and analyzed phenotypes of gene knockout medaka. These results led us to conclude that AgRP1 plays a key role in the breeding season-dependent changes in feeding behavior via ovarian estrogenic signals.</p>

<title>Feeding behavior of female medaka is upregulated in breeding season</title>
<p>To analyze food intake of male and female medaka in breeding/non-breeding seasons, we first established a method for measuring food intake in medaka. In brief, we placed medaka in a white cup, fed brine shrimp to medaka in all-you-can-eat style for 10 min, and counted the leftover brine shrimp in the cup with a âshrimp-counterâ system (called Japanese âWanko-sobaâ like method, Figure 1-Source Code 1 and Figure 1-Supplementary Figure 1). We used this system to analyze food intake of male and female medaka under the breeding condition equivalent to that in breeding season (kept under long day (LD) condition) or under the non-breeding condition equivalent to that in non-breeding season (short day (SD) condition) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kanda et al., 2008</xref>). We found that female medaka under the breeding (LD) condition eat more than those under the non-breeding (SD) condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.02519). In contrast to female, in males there was no significant difference in food intake between the breeding and non-breeding condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.6540). Since these results demonstrated that females, not males, show breeding season-dependent feeding behavior, we focused only on female medaka in the following analyses on neuronal mechanism for breeding season-dependent feeding behavior. Next, to examine which gene products modulate feeding behavior of female medaka in breeding season, we performed mRNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) using the whole brain of female medaka in breeding condition (LD) and non-breeding condition (SD) (Figure 1-Supplementary Figure 2A). Overall, 1025 genes showed significantly different expression between LD and SD female medaka. Figure 1-Supplementary Figure 2B shows a heat map of representative genes mainly related to neuroendocrine system, which were differently expressed between LD and SD females. Among the conventional candidate feeding-related neuropeptides, we identified two kinds of neuropeptides, <italic>agrp1</italic> and <italic>npyb</italic>, both of which showed higher expression in LD than in SD (Figure 1-Supplementary Figure 2C and 2D). Both AgRP and NPY are known to have orexigenic effects mainly in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schwartz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Andermann &amp; Lowell, 2017</xref>). Therefore, in the subsequent analyses, we focused on <italic>agrp1</italic> and <italic>npyb</italic> as candidate genes that modulate breeding season-dependent feeding behavior in female medaka.</p>

<p>In mice, <italic>agrp</italic> is known to be only expressed in the hypothalamus and mostly co-expressed with <italic>npy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hahn et al., 1998</xref>), and these AgRP/NPY neurons are known to regulate mammal feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Shutter et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Broberger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ollmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Takahashi &amp; Cone, 2005</xref>). In medaka, on the other hand, <italic>agrp1</italic> signals were not observed in <italic>npya</italic> neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> left), although the both genes were expressed in the hypothalamus. In addition, <italic>agrp2</italic> signals were not observed in hypothalamic <italic>npya</italic> neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> right), either. These results suggest that AgRP and NPY are not co-expressed in medaka. Since AgRP and NPY of medaka showed different expressing patterns compared with other animals such as mice, we examined whether they act as modulators of feeding. We divided female medaka in LD condition into two groups; one group was kept under normally fed condition (Fed), and the other was kept under 2-week food restricted condition (FR). We then analyzed whole-brain expressions of these four genes. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that 2-week FR increased the expression of <italic>agrp1</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001243) but decreased that of <italic>npyb</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0003108), suggesting that the two peptides are involved in feeding in an opposite manner. On the other hand, <italic>agrp2</italic> did not significantly change their expressions between Fed and FR conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.9551). Although <italic>npya</italic> did not significantly change their expressions between Fed and FR conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.2319), it may be possible that <italic>npya</italic> expression changed in a specific brain region, since <italic>npya</italic> neurons are widely distributed in various brain regions as described above (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Since it is suggested that NPY released from hypothalamic <italic>npy</italic>-expressing neurons controls food intake in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kohno &amp; Yada, 2012</xref>), we also examined the <italic>npya</italic>-expression in medaka hypothalamus by ISH. We counted <italic>npya</italic>-expressing neurons in each hypothalamic region and compared them between Fed and FR female medaka (Figure 2-Supplementary Figure 1). We found that the total number of <italic>npya</italic>-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus was significantly larger in Fed compared with FR (Figure 2-Supplementary Figure 1A; <italic>p</italic> = 0.02857). Here, significant increase in cell number was observed in NRL (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02857) and NAT (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02857), but not in NVT (<italic>p</italic> = 0.1143) (Figure 2-Supplementary Figure 1B-D). On the other hand, the expression of <italic>agrp2</italic> did not show remarkable difference in the hypothalamus under food restriction or not (Figure 2-Supplementary Figure 1E). Thus, the results suggest that AgRP1, NPYa and NPYb may be the âfeeding-related peptides&quot; in female medaka.</p>

<p>To further examine the result of RNA-sequencing (Figure 1-Supplementary Figure 2), we compared expression of <italic>agrp1</italic> and <italic>npyb</italic> between the female medaka under the breeding condition (LD) and those under the non-breeding condition (SD), using ISH and whole-brain RT-qPCR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).

Since the expression level of <italic>agrp1</italic> was higher in LD than that in SD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), higher expression of <italic>agrp1</italic> under the breeding condition may be due to the increase in the number of neurons expressing <italic>agrp1</italic>.

These results suggest that the expression level for each neuron increased in LD compared with SD.

<title>Estrogen, which is released from mature ovary, may affect the expression of <italic>agrp1</italic></title>
<p>Among various factors associated with ovarian maturity, estrogens are known to be abundantly released from mature ovary and play important roles in reproductive readiness, sexual behavior, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jennings &amp; de Lecea, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Naftolin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adachi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Clarkson &amp; Herbison, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wintermantel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Micevych &amp; Meisel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Melo &amp; Ramsdell, 2001</xref>). Among the ovarian estrogens, 17Î²-estradiol (E2) is the major factor important for reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kanda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kelly &amp; Qiu, 2010</xref>), and the blood E2 concentration of LD-conditioned female medaka is higher than those of SD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ikegami et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that E2 regulates the expression of <italic>agrp1</italic> and <italic>npyb</italic> under the condition of breeding season. We analyzed the expression of <italic>agrp1</italic> and <italic>npyb</italic> in sham-operated (Sham), ovariectomized (OVX, fish with surgical ablation of the ovary), and OVX medaka with E2-administration (OVX+E) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). The OVX medaka were allowed to survive at least for two weeks to clear the endogenous E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kayo et al., 2020</xref>), and spawning of all the Sham medaka were confirmed for three consecutive days. By using whole-brain RT-qPCR, we found that OVX induces significantly lowered <italic>agrp1</italic> expression than Sham, and OVX+E shows a tendency to recover <italic>agrp1</italic> expression compared with OVX (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; Sham vs OVX: <italic>p</italic> = 0.04310, OVX vs OVX+E: <italic>p</italic> = 0.05790, Sham vs OVX+E: <italic>p</italic> = 0.2000), which suggests that the ovarian E2 regulates <italic>agrp1</italic> expression. On the other hand, the expression levels of <italic>npyb</italic> did not show significant differences among the three groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; Sham vs OVX: <italic>p</italic> = 0.1386, OVX vs OVX+E: <italic>p</italic> = 0.9991, Sham vs OVX+E: <italic>p</italic> = 0.08120). In addition, food intake of OVX female was not significantly different between LD and SD (Figure 5-Supplementary Figure 1; <italic>p</italic> = 0.7308), which suggests that ovarian signal may be important for breeding season-dependent feeding behavior. Therefore, we focused more on the estrogenic regulation of <italic>agrp1</italic> expression.</p>

<title><italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> female medaka show a decrease in food intake and in the number of fertilized eggs</title>
<p>Our present experimental evidence thus far highlights the importance of <italic>agrp1</italic> as the factor modulating the season-dependent feeding behavior in medaka. To analyze the function of AgRP1 in medaka, we generated knockout medaka of <italic>agrp1</italic> (<italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>) by using CRISPR/Cas9. The designed CRISPR guide RNA cleaved targeted sites of <italic>agrp1</italic> (exon3, Figure 6-Supplementary Figure 1A), and we obtained <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> medaka, which has lots of amino acid changes in functional site for AgRP1 (Figure 6-Supplementary Figure 1B). In <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> brain, AgRP1 immunoreactive signals, which were observed in WT, were not found (Figure 6-Supplementary Figure 1C). These suggested that <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> possess nonfunctional AgRP. As for phenotype of the knockout, the <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> female medaka appeared skinny and the body weight was significantly lower than that of <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>; body weight: <italic>p</italic> = 0.04113; abdominal length: <italic>p</italic> = 0.002165). In addition, abdominal height of <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> was also smaller than that of <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, while the body length was not significantly different (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>; body length: <italic>p</italic> = 0.3939). We next analyzed food intake of <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> female medaka in LD condition (breeding). As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004329) and Figure 6-Supplementary Figure 2 (<italic>agrp1</italic> <sup>+/+</sup> vs <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/+</sup>: <italic>p</italic> = 0.5470, <italic>agrp1</italic> <sup>+/+</sup> vs <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>: <italic>p</italic> = 0.009353, <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/+</sup> vs <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>: <italic>p</italic> = 0.01234), we found that LD <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> female medaka eat less than <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>+/+</sup>. Then, we kept <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> medaka in LD or SD condition and compared their food intake. In contrast to <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> in LD condition did not show a significant increase in food intake compared with SD (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>; <italic>p =</italic> 0.5953). We also examined whether loss of AgRP1 affects reproductive function. Whereas the <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> females were fertile, the pairs of <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> female and <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> male resulted in fewer spawned eggs than <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> pairs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.008658). In addition, the ovarian size of <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> appeared to be smaller than <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> left). In particular, since relative ovarian weight normalized by body weight (Gonadosomatic index: GSI) of <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> female tended to be marginally smaller than <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> right; <italic>p</italic> = 0.06494), the smaller body size of <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) may drastically affect ovarian morphology. Since the number of spawned eggs was decreased in <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> female, we analyzed gene expressions of gonadotropins which should affect ovarian maturation. Oocyte maturation and ovulation are known to be regulated by gonadotropins, follicular-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>, <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> females showed lower levels of expression of gonadotropin genes (<italic>fshb</italic> and <italic>lhb</italic>; <italic>lhb</italic>: <italic>p</italic> = 0.008658; <italic>fshb</italic>: <italic>p</italic> = 0.02597), which suggests that loss of function of <italic>agrp1</italic> impaired breeding season-dependent feeding behavior and led to attenuation of reproductive functions, especially the decrease in number of spawned eggs in the breeding season.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we took advantage of female medaka which clearly shows breeding season-dependent feeding behavior and found that neuropeptides, <italic>agrp1</italic> and <italic>npyb,</italic> show higher expression under the breeding condition than under the non-breeding condition. We also obtained results to suggest that the expression of both <italic>agrp1</italic> and <italic>npyb</italic> changes depending on nutritional status of female medaka. In addition, ovariectomy and E2 administration changed expression of <italic>agrp1</italic> but not <italic>npyb</italic>, suggesting that increased release of ovarian E2 in breeding season upregulates the <italic>agrp1</italic> expression, which results in facilitation of female feeding behavior. Finally, loss-of-function mutation of AgRP1 decreased the amount of food intake and the number of spawned eggs. The present results suggest that breeding season-dependent feeding behavior can be modulated by the increased expression of <italic>agrp1</italic> upregulated by increased release of ovarian estrogen in the breeding season (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). To date, not a few previous reports have shown the influence of nutritional status on reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Evans &amp; Anderson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kalra &amp; Kalra, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kirkwood et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Merry &amp; Holehan, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hasebe et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, although seasonal breeders have been reported to show changes in feeding behavior during the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tsuyuki, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kawai et al., 2020</xref>), its neuroendocrine mechanism have largely remained enigmatic. Our present results may provide a neuroendocrinological model for the mechanisms that play a key role in the control of breeding season-dependent feeding behavior in teleosts.</p>

<title>Feeding-related peptides AgRP and NPY in medaka</title>
<p>Here, we demonstrated that female medaka eat more under the condition of breeding season (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Various kinds of neuropeptides in the brain have been suggested to control feeding, and these are generally called âfeeding-related peptidesâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Funahashi et al., 2003</xref>). In the present study, we first used a seasonally breeding model teleost medaka and searched for the âfeeding-related peptidesâ involved in seasonal feeding behavior. A whole-brain RNA-seq analysis using female medaka under the breeding condition (LD) and non-breeding condition (SD) revealed two kinds of feeding-related peptides, <italic>agrp1</italic> and <italic>npyb</italic>, which show different expression levels between LD and SD (Figure 1-Supprementary <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).

Previous studies in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schwartz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Andermann &amp; Lowell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Muroi &amp; Ishii, 2016</xref>) have suggested neural mechanisms of appetite including functions of AgRP and NPY. However, such mechanisms in non-mammalian vertebrates such as teleosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">RÃ¸nnestad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blanco &amp; Soengas, 2021</xref>) have not yet been clarified. Our present study using medaka has shown possible functions of AgRP and NPY in teleost feeding behavior, especially in a breeding season-dependent manner.</p>
<p>Our present study using medaka showed that female medaka express <italic>agrp1</italic> in hypothalamus, and food restriction increases the <italic>agrp1</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). It has been reported that leptin receptor-knockout medaka show higher food intake and higher expressions of <italic>agrp1</italic> and <italic>npya</italic> than wild type, whereas the expression of <italic>agrp2</italic> and <italic>npyb</italic> remained to be analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chisada et al., 2014</xref>). Zebrafish has also been used as a model animal in teleosts. In zebrafish, food restriction increased <italic>agrp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Song et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Opazo et al., 2018</xref>) expression, and transgenic overexpression of <italic>agrp1</italic> caused gain of body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Song &amp; Cone, 2007</xref>), as in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Graham et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adam et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hahn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ilnytska &amp; Argyropoulos, 2008</xref>). It has also been reported that <italic>agrp1</italic> knockout zebrafish eat less than the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Shainer et al., 2019</xref>), although loss of AgRP in mice showed little effect on food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Qian et al., 2002</xref>). Our present results and these previous studies strongly support that <italic>agrp1</italic> regulates feeding and may act as an orexigenic factor in teleosts. On the other hand, <italic>agrp2</italic> neurons were distributed mainly in telencephalon, and its weak expressions were also observed in the POA and the hypothalamus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), which is different from the results in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Shainer et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, food restriction did not remarkably affect the <italic>agrp2</italic> expression in medaka (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and Figure 2-Supplementary Figure 1E), and AgRP2 in zebrafish is suggested to play an important role in stress response, not feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Shainer et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it is highly probable that <italic>agrp2</italic> is involved in functions other than feeding in female medaka.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we demonstrated that <italic>npya</italic> is expressed in multiple brain regions including hypothalamus in medaka (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), which is similar to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gray &amp; Morley, 1986</xref>) and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yokobori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>). We also showed that <italic>npya</italic> is not co-expressed with <italic>agrp1</italic> nor <italic>agrp2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) as in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that The relationship between NPY and AgRP of teleosts may be different from that of mammals, in which most of the <italic>agrp</italic>-expressing neurons co-express <italic>npy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hahn et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, our present study also showed that <italic>npyb</italic> expression is localized in telencephalon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), which is similar to the previous report using tiger puffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kamijo et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies of NPY in zebrafish showed that zebrafish has only one type of NPY (NPYa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">SÃ¶derberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Larsson et al., 2009</xref>) and has lost NPYb during evolution. Like in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Marks et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clark et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Glenn Stanley et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Marks &amp; Waite, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baldock et al., 2009</xref>), food restriction in zebrafish increased the <italic>npya</italic> expression in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Song et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Opazo et al., 2018</xref>), and intracerebroventricular administration of NPYa increased food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yokobori et al., 2012</xref>). Although these zebrafish studies suggest that NPYa may increase food intake, it is still debatable, since body weight was not significantly different between <italic>npya</italic> knockout zebrafish and wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Shiozaki et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, by analyzing both <italic>npya</italic> and <italic>npyb</italic> expression in medaka of different nutritional conditions, we found that food restriction decreased the <italic>npya</italic>-expressing cell number in the hypothalamus (Figure 2-Supplementary Figure 1) and <italic>npyb</italic> expression level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). These changes in <italic>npya</italic> and <italic>npyb</italic> expressions are not consistent with previous studies using other conventional model animals described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yokobori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Marks et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clark et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Glenn Stanley et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Marks &amp; Waite, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baldock et al., 2009</xref>). Our present study may suggest that the function of <italic>npy</italic> may be different among teleosts. In addition, <italic>npyb</italic> expression was increased under the breeding condition (LD), while LD female showed increase in food intake (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, decreased expression of <italic>npyb</italic> by food restriction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>) may suggest that the change in <italic>npyb</italic> expression reflects nutritional condition in medaka. Thus, future study of <italic>npya</italic> and <italic>npyb</italic> functions in the control of feeding will be necessary.</p>
<p>As described above, we found that <italic>agrp1</italic>, <italic>npya</italic>, and <italic>npyb</italic> change expression levels in response to nutritional status. Among these three genes, we suggest that <italic>agrp1</italic> most probably affects relatively long-term feeding in the breeding season, which agrees well with the recent studies in mice showing the function of AgRP as a long-term orexigenic factor. In mice, it has been reported that intracerebroventricular administration of AgRP increases food intake for one week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hagan et al., 2000</xref>), and stimulation of receptors expressed in AgRP neurons triggers AgRP release, leading to an increase in food intake for three days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nakajima et al., 2016</xref>). Our present study also suggests a long-term (seasonal) orexigenic effect of AgRP in teleosts and may also provide an important insight into the understanding of common regulatory mechanisms of feeding by AgRP among various animal species.</p>

<title>High concentration of E2 in breeding season facilitates <italic>agrp1</italic> expression</title>
<p>Our results suggest that <italic>agrp1</italic> and <italic>npyb</italic> show higher expressions under the breeding condition (LD) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), but the experiments using juvenile female medaka (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) showed that expression levels of these two genes do not change according to the day-length itself but to the LD-induced sexual maturity. In addition, the present results indicate that the ovarian estrogen E2 upregulates <italic>agrp1</italic> expression mainly via the estrogen receptors <italic>esr2a</italic> that are co-expressed in some population of <italic>agrp1</italic> neurons in the hypothalamic nucleus NVT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Since LD female medaka (breeding) shows high blood concentration of E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ikegami et al., 2022</xref>), this pathway may be important for breeding season-dependent feeding behavior. Especially, in teleost, main egg protein for nutrition is vitellogenin, whose expression is also facilitated by E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Tohyama et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, it is suggested that E2 may synchronously regulate amount of food intake and female-specific reproductive signals (vitellogenin production and oocyte maturation), which plays a key role in reproductive success in oviparous animals.</p>
<p>In mammals, previous studies have reported on inconsistent effects of ovary and E2 on feeding. Ablation of ovary caused suppression of food intake in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yu et al., 2020</xref>), whereas it caused no change in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Roesch, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, administration of E2 decreased food intake in both mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yu et al., 2020</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Roesch, 2006</xref>). It should be noted that these laboratory rodents only exhibit short estrous cyclicity and have lost breeding seasonality, and the blood E2 concentration drastically changes in a few days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nilsson et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the control mechanisms of feeding may be different between animals with short estrous cyclicity and those with breeding seasonality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our present study suggests different control mechanisms of feeding between the animals with breeding seasonally and those without. Here, we showed that E2 directly modulates <italic>agrp1</italic> expression via <italic>esr2a</italic> receptors co-expressed in the <italic>agrp1</italic> neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), while in mice, <italic>AgRP</italic>/<italic>NPY</italic> neurons are reported to be suppressed by E2 indirectly via <italic>esr1</italic> (<italic>er</italic>Î±)-expressing <italic>Kiss1</italic> neurons located in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dubois et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, in medaka, expressions of all kinds of estrogen receptors are reported to be localized in NVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zempo et al., 2013</xref>), in which <italic>agrp1</italic> expression is also localized (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, <italic>esr2a</italic> has been reported to be involved in the feedback regulation of follicle stimulating hormone in the pituitary and in the development of oviduct, and <italic>esr2a</italic> knockout females are completely infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kayo et al., 2019</xref>). Our hypothesis that estrogen signaling via <italic>esr2a</italic> affects <italic>agrp1</italic> expression may highlight another important function of <italic>esr2a</italic> for reproduction, while a possibility still remains that <italic>esr1-</italic> and <italic>esr2b</italic>-expressing neurons also affect <italic>agrp1</italic> expression indirectly.</p>

<title>AgRP1 changes feeding behavior depending on LD-induced sexual maturity, which causes the increase in food intake in breeding season</title>
<p>Since our results thus far indicate the importance of <italic>agrp1</italic>, which shows upregulated expression directly stimulated by the ovarian E2 in breeding season, we examined phenotypes of <italic>agrp1</italic> knockout (<italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>) medaka. We found that <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> medaka under the condition of breeding season eat less (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) and spawn a smaller number of eggs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) than WT. Furthermore, the <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> females did not show significant difference of food intake in LD and SD (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These results strengthen our hypothesis that <italic>agrp1</italic> is involved in the increased food intake in breeding season. Furthermore, <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> female displayed light body weight (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), accompanied by smaller ovary (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>) and low level of expression of gonadotropins, <italic>fshb</italic> and <italic>lhb</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>), which are considered to have caused smaller number of spawned eggs. All of these results support our hypothesis that AgRP1 plays an important role in breeding season-dependent feeding behavior, which culminates in normal reproduction.</p>
<p>In summary, by using a seasonal breeder medaka, we found evidence to suggest that long day-length facilitates ovarian maturation and E2 release, which upregulates <italic>agrp1</italic> expression of hypothalamic neurons to activate neural circuitry for feeding behavior and boost oocyte maturation. We propose that this kind of positive feedback control may be important for animals that spawn many eggs every day in the breeding season (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>); medaka needs plenty of food for production of many eggs. In other words, the metabolic costs of producing eggs on a daily basis in medaka would inevitably require increased food intake. Indeed, previous study showed a need for high food intake for reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hasebe et al., 2016</xref>). It is expected that future studies will elucidate whether or not the present findings in medaka are applicable to other seasonal breeders as well.</p>

<p>Female and male wild-type d-rR medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) and <italic>agrp1</italic> knockout (<italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>) medaka were maintained in pairs or shoals at 27L. Fish were fed three times a day with brine shrimp and flake food (Otohime B-2; San-u Fish Farm, Osaka, Japan). Their reproductive status was controlled by day-length (long day (LD; 14-hour light/10-hour dark): reproductive, short day (SD; 10-hour light/14-hour dark): non-reproductive). The light-on time was 8:00 AM. We used juvenile medaka (â¼5 weeks after fertilization) and adult medaka (&gt;3 months after fertilization). Female medaka, which spawned at least three consecutive days, were used as reproductive ones. For the analysis of the effect of food restriction, reproductive and non-reproductive female medaka were fasted for 14 days or 10 days. Note that all medaka survived after food restriction. For the analyses of food intake, we food-restricted medaka for 6 hours after 10-min feeding in the morning and sampled their whole brains for subsequent experiments. Food-restricted medaka were sampled at the same time as the other fed medaka. All experiments and fish maintenance were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments (Science Council of Japan) and the protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Graduate School of Science, the University of Tokyo (Permission number, 17-1, 20-6) and the Animal Care and Use Committee of Graduate School of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (Permission number, R05-15, R06-27).</p>

<p>Each 6-hour food-restricted medaka was put into a white cup with 100 mL breeding water and was habituated for 5 min.

Then we collected 10 mL aliquot from the experimental cup by using a micro pipette and transferred it to a conical tube. The conical tube was frozen overnight, and the leftover brine shrimp sunk in the bottom were counted by âshrimp-counterâ. We counted the number of brine shrimp in the 200 Î¼L solution three times before and after the experiments, and the average number was used. The food intake was calculated as follows.</p>

<p>= (The average number of brine shrimp in the solution) * (number of aliquots, N)</p>

<p>Ovariectomy and E2 administration were performed according to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kayo <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Briefly, reproductive female medaka were anesthetized with 0.02% MS-222 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and their ovaries were excised via intraperitoneal operation. Sham operation group was anesthetized, received an abdominal incision without removing the ovaries, and received skin suture by using a silk thread. After checking that all Sham females spawn, we prepared three tanks; two tanks contained 7-8 OVX medaka, and one tank contained Sham medaka in 2 L breeding water in it. We dissolved Î²-Estradiol 1.4 mg in 1 mL EtOH (E2 stock) and dispensed 2 Î¼L of E2 stock or the same amount of 100% Ethanol for the control tank. Ethanol or E2 containing water were changed every day. After the steroid treatment for 5 days, the medaka were anesthetized, and their whole brains were collected for RT-qPCR analysis.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>agrp1</italic> KO medaka lines</title>
<p>We generated <italic>agrp1</italic> KO medaka lines by using CRISPR/Cas9. Cas9 mRNA and tracer RNA were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA). The guide RNA sequence for digestion by CRISPR/Cas9 complex was âCCTCACCAGCAGTCCTGCCTGGâ.</p>
<p>Mixture of Cas9 protein, tracer RNA, CRISPR RNA, GFP mRNA diluted with PBS and 0.02% phenol red (final concentration: Cas9 protein; 500 ng/Î¼L, tracer RNA; 100Lng/Î¼L, CRISPR RNA; 50Lng/Î¼L, GFP mRNA; 5Lng/Î¼L) was injected into the cytoplasm of one- or two-cell-stage embryos (F0). To obtain homozygous transgenic offspring, the carriers were crossed with each other.</p>

<title>Measurement of body size and ovary size</title>
<p>We took photographs of fish bodies from the lateral side by using a digital camera MC120HD (Leica) and calculated the abdominal and body length by ImageJ. For the analysis of body length, we measured the length from the mouth to the base of the tail. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) was calculated as ovary weight/ body weight*100.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry using AgRP1 antibody</title>
<p>We made brain sections of WT and <italic>agrp1</italic> KO as described in â<italic>Histological analysis of the distribution of agrp- and npy-neurons in the brain</italic>â. After washing with PBST two times for 10 mins, sections were incubated with AgRP1 antibody (1:1000; Rabbit polyclonal AgRP (83-132) amide (Human), Cat# H-003-53; RRID: AB_2313908, Phoenix Pharmaceutical, Burlingame, CA) /10% goat serum/PBS overnight. In the next day, slides were washed with PBST and incubated with anti-rabbit biotinylated goat antibody (1:200; Cat. #BA-1000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hour. Then we applied Alexa 488 conjugated streptavidin (1:500, Cat. #S11223, Invitrogen) and DAPI (1:2000; Dojin, Kumamoto, Japan). Photographs were taken with a digital camera (Leica Microsystems) attached to an upright microscope (Leica Microsystems).</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>For the statistical analysis, we used Kyplot 5.0 software (Kyence, Tokyo, Japan) or R software (R core team 2023) with R studio (version 2023.06.0+421). For the comparison of the TPM, we used Studentâs t-test. For the comparison of <italic>agrp1</italic> and <italic>npyb</italic> expressions in OVX and E2 administrated medaka, Steel-Dwass test was used for multiple comparison of the expression level. In the other experiments, we used Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. In all statistical analysis, significance levels were described as follows: *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, and ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001.</p>

<p><bold>Figure 1-Supplementary Figure 1 âWanko-sobaâ method for calculation of the amount of food intake of fish</bold></p>
<p>(A) One medaka is put into a white cup with 100 mL breeding water and is habituated for 5 min. (B) Medaka is fed by application of 200 Î¼L aliquots of food water containing brine shrimp in all-you-can-eat style and serve another aliquot once done with it, which is repeated N times (like the Japanese âWanko sobaâ). (C) Stop feeding 10 min after the start, take 10 mL out of the breeding water and transfer it to a conical tube. The conical tube is frozen overnight and the leftover brine shrimp sunk in the bottom are counted by âshrimp-counterâ. The food intake is calculated as follows (also see Material and Methods).</p>
<p>(Food Intake)</p>
<p>= (The average number of brine shrimp in the solution) * (number of aliquots, N)</p>
<p>- (number of leftover brine shrimp sunk in the bottom) * 10</p>
<p>Food intake was normalized by the average of LD medaka.</p>

<p>(A) Time course of the number of neurons showing ISH signals for <italic>agrp1</italic> at each 30-min time point from the beginning of the chromogenic reaction in LD (orange; n = 5) and SD (blue; n = 5). The positive neurons were counted from 0 min to 300 min after application of NBT/BCIP (see Material and Methods), and the reaction saturated at 300 min onward. (B) Ratio of cell number at 90 min divided by that at 300 min. The relative cell number was not significantly different between LD and SD. (<italic>p</italic> = 0.2948, <italic>U</italic> = 18)</p>
<p><bold>Figure 4-Supplementary Figure 1: Food intake of juvenile female does not show significant change according to the day-length.</bold></p>
<p>(A) Method for counting food intake of juvenile. A fish was placed in a white cup containing 50 mL breeding water. After 5 mins habituation, 200 ÂµL shrimp water was applied. Fish was picked up 10 mins later by a dropper, and its fin was cut for the genotype of sex. The food intake was calculated by subtraction from the number of applied shrimps to that of the leftover shrimps. (B) Food intake of juvenile female medaka in LD (n = 9) and SD (n = 10) conditions. Each food intake was normalized to the average food intake of LD fish. (<italic>p</italic> = 0.7197, <italic>U</italic> = 50) Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. n.s., not significant.</p>

<p>This manuscript provides <bold>fundamental</bold> new insight into the mechanisms linking photoperiod, reproduction function, and feeding activity, using medaka, a genetic model that itself exhibits photoperiodic responses. As well as identifying key neuropeptide genes that are regulated by photoperiod and involved in regulating feeding activity, the authors establish a knockout line for agrp1 using CRISPR Cas9 - based approach, profiting from the extensive use and development on this methodology in medaka. The combination of the RNAseq and quantitative in situ hybridization analysis with the knockout results as well as the study of ovariectomized fish provides <bold>compelling</bold> evidence implicating agrp1 in feeding regulation in response to photoperiod and reproductive status.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors use the teleost medaka as an animal model to study the effect of seasonal changes in day-length on feeding behaviour and oocyte production. They report a careful analysis how day-length affects female medakas and a thorough molecular genetic analysis of genes potentially involved in this process. They show a detailed analysis of two genes and include a mutant analysis of one gene to support their conclusions</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors pick their animal model well and exploit the possibilities to examine in this laboratory model the effect of a key environmental influence, namely the seasonal changes of day-length. The phenotypic changes are carefully analysed and well controlled. The mutational analysis of the agrp1 by a ko-mutant provides important evidence to support the conclusions. Thus this report exceeds previous findings on the function of agrp1 and npyb as regulators of food-intake and shows how in medaka these genes are involved in regulating the organismal response to an environmental change. It thus furthers our understanding on how animals react to key exogenous stimuli for adaptation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors are too modest when it comes to underscoring the importance of their findings. Previous animal models used to study the effect of these neuropeptides on feeding behaviour have either lost or were most likely never sensitive to seasonal changes of day-length. Considering the key importance of this parameter on many aspects of plant and animal life it could be better emphasised that a suitable animal model is at hand that permits this.</p>
<p>
The molecular characterization of the agrp1 ko-mutant that the authors have generated lacks some details that would help to appreciate the validity of the mutant phenotype. Additional data would help in this respect.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors dealt adequately with the comments and suggestions of this reviewer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated the mechanisms behind breeding season-dependent feeding behavior using medaka, a well-known photoperiodic species, as a model. Through a combination of molecular, cellular, and behavioral analyses, including tests with mutants, they concluded that AgRP1 plays a central role in feeding behavior, mediated by ovarian estrogenic signals.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study offers valuable insights into the neuroendocrine mechanisms that govern breeding season-dependent feeding behavior in medaka. The multidisciplinary approach, which includes molecular and physiological analyses, enhances the scientific contribution of the research.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>My concerns from the first review have been addressed. The manuscript's key points are clearly presented, and the conclusions are readily comprehensible</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Understanding the mechanisms whereby animals restrict the timing of their reproduction according to day length is a critical challenge given that many of the most relevant species for agriculture are strongly photoperiodic. However, the principal animal models capable of detailed genetic analysis do not respond to photoperiod so this has inevitably limited progress in this field. The fish model medaka occupies a uniquely powerful position since it's reproduction is strictly restricted to long days and it also offers a wide range of genetic tools for exploring, in depth, various molecular and cellular control mechanisms.</p>
<p>For these reasons, this manuscript by Tagui and colleagues is particularly valuable. It uses the medaka to explore links bridging photoperiod, feeding behaviour and reproduction. The authors demonstrate that in female, but not male medaka, photoperiod-induced reproduction is associated with an increase in feeding, presumably explained by the high metabolic cost of producing eggs on a daily basis during the reproductive period. Using RNAseq analysis of the brain, they reveal that the expression of the neuropeptides agrp and npy that have been previously implicated in the regulation of feeding behaviour in mice, are upregulated in the medaka brain during exposure to long photoperiod conditions. Unlike the situation in mouse, these two neuropeptides are not coexpressed in medaka neurons and food deprivation in medaka led to increases in agrp but also a decrease in npy expression. Furthermore, the situation in fish may be more complicated than in mouse due to the presence of multiple gene paralogs for each neuropeptide. Exposure to long day conditions increases agrp1 expression in medaka as the result of increases in the number of neurons expressing this neuropeptide, while the increase in npyb levels results from increased levels of expression in the same population of cells. Using ovariectomized medaka and in situ hybridization assays, the authors reveal that the regulation of agrp1 involves estrogen acting via the estrogen receptor esr2a. Finally, a loss of agrp1 function mutant is generated where the female mutants fail to show the characteristic increase in feeding associated with long day enhanced reproduction as well as yielding reduced numbers of eggs during spawning.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript provides important foundational work for future investigations aiming to elucidate the coordination of photoperiod sensing, feeding activity and reproduction function. The authors have used a combination of approaches with a genetic model that is particularly well suited to studying photoperiodic dependent physiology and behaviour. The data are clear and the results are convincing and support the main conclusions drawn. The findings are relevant not only for understanding photopriodic responses but also provide more general insight into links between reproduction and feeding behaviour control.</p>
<p>The manuscript has been further strengthened by the inclusion of additional information according to my advice: The analysis of ovariectomized female fish and juvenille fish has now been reported in terms of their feeding behaviour and so provide a complete view of the position of this feeding regulatory mechanism in the context of reproduction status. Furthermore, the discussion section has been expanded to speculate on the functional significance of linking feeding behaviour control with reproductive function. Modifications made in order to address technical concerns of the other 2 reviewers have also significantly strengthened the presentation of this work.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>These have now been addressed in the revised version.</p>

The phenotypic changes are carefully analysed and well-controlled. The mutational analysis of the agrp1 by a ko-mutant provides important evidence to support the conclusions. Thus this report exceeds previous findings on the function of agrp1 and npyb as regulators of food-intake and shows how in medaka these genes are involved in regulating the organismal response to an environmental change. It thus furthers our understanding of how animals react to key exogenous stimuli for adaptation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors are too modest when it comes to underscoring the importance of their findings. Previous animal models used to study the effect of these neuropeptides on feeding behaviour have either lost or were most likely never sensitive to seasonal changes of day length. Considering the key importance of this parameter on many aspects of plant and animal life it could be better emphasised that a suitable animal model is at hand that permits this. The molecular characterization of the agrp1 ko-mutant that the authors have generated lacks some details that would help to appreciate the validity of the mutant phenotype. Additional data would help in this respect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank Reviewer #1 for the really constructive advice. In the revised manuscript, we provided more information on the molecular characterization of the <italic>agrp1</italic> KO-mutant and to emphasize the importance of our present animal model that permits the analysis of neuropeptide effects on feeding behavior in response to seasonal changes of day length.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated the mechanisms behind breeding season-dependent feeding behavior using medaka, a well-known photoperiodic species, as a model. Through a combination of molecular, cellular, and behavioral analyses, including tests with mutants, they concluded that AgRP1 plays a central role in feeding behavior, mediated by ovarian estrogenic signals.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study offers valuable insights into the neuroendocrine mechanisms that govern breeding season-dependent feeding behavior in medaka. The multidisciplinary approach, which includes molecular and physiological analyses, enhances the scientific contribution of the research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While medaka is an appropriate model for studying seasonal breeding, the results presented are insufficient to fully support the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>Specifically, methods and data analyses are incomplete in justifying the primary claims:</p>
<p>
- the procedure for the food intake assay is unclear;</p>
<p>- the sample size is very small;</p>
<p>- the statistical analysis is not always adequate.</p>
<p>Additionally, the discussion fails to consider the possible role of other hormones that may be involved in the feeding mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank Reviewer #2 for the helpful comments. As the reviewer suggested, we revised the paragraph describing the procedure for the food intake assay to make it much easier for the readers to understand in the revised manuscript. In Figure 1-Supplementary figure 2, RNAseq was performed to search for the candidate neuropeptides, and thatâs why the sample size was the minimum. On the other hand, each group in the other experiments consist of n â¥ 5 samples, which is usually accepted to be adequate sample size in various studies (cf. Kanda et al., Gen Comp Endocrinol., 2011, Spicer et al., Biol Reprod., 2017). As for the statistical analyses, we revised our manuscript so that the readers may be convinced with the validity of our statistical analyses.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Understanding the mechanisms whereby animals restrict the timing of their reproduction according to day length is a critical challenge given that many of the most relevant species for agriculture are strongly photoperiodic. However, the principal animal models capable of detailed genetic analysis do not respond to photoperiod so this has inevitably limited progress in this field. The fish model medaka occupies a uniquely powerful position since its reproduction is strictly restricted to long days and it also offers a wide range of genetic tools for exploring, in depth, various molecular and cellular control mechanisms.</p>
<p>For these reasons, this manuscript by Tagui and colleagues is particularly valuable. It uses the medaka to explore links bridging photoperiod, feeding behaviour, and reproduction. The authors demonstrate that in female, but not male medaka, photoperiod-induced reproduction is associated with an increase in feeding, presumably explained by the high metabolic cost of producing eggs on a daily basis during the reproductive period. Using RNAseq analysis of the brain, they reveal that the expression of the neuropeptides agrp and npy that have been previously implicated in the regulation of feeding behaviour in mice are upregulated in the medaka brain during exposure to long photoperiod conditions. Unlike the situation in mice, these two neuropeptides are not co-expressed in medaka neurons, and food deprivation in medaka led to increases in agrp but also a decrease in npy expression. Furthermore, the situation in fish may be more complicated than in mice due to the presence of multiple gene paralogs for each neuropeptide. Exposure to long-day conditions increases agrp1 expression in medaka as the result of increases in the number of neurons expressing this neuropeptide, while the increase in npyb levels results from increased levels of expression in the same population of cells. Using ovariectomized medaka and in situ hybridization assays, the authors reveal that the regulation of agrp1 involves estrogen acting via the estrogen receptor esr2a. Finally, a loss of agrp1 function mutant is generated where the female mutants fail to show the characteristic increase in feeding associated with long-day enhanced reproduction as well as yielding reduced numbers of eggs during spawning.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript provides important foundational work for future investigations aiming to elucidate the coordination of photoperiod sensing, feeding activity, and reproduction function. The authors have used a combination of approaches with a genetic model that is particularly well suited to studying photoperiodic-dependent physiology and behaviour. The data are clear and the results are convincing and support the main conclusions drawn. The findings are relevant not only for understanding photopriodic responses but also provide more general insight into links between reproduction and feeding behaviour control.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some experimental models used in this study, namely ovariectomized female fish and juvenile fish have not been analysed in terms of their feeding behaviour and so do not give a complete view of the position of this feeding regulatory mechanism in the context of reproduction status. Furthermore, the scope of the discussion section should be expanded to speculate on the functional significance of linking feeding behaviour control with reproductive function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank Reviewer #3 for the insightful advice. We added several pertinent sentences describing the ovariectomized female fish and juvenile fish, and our revised manuscript will give more complete view of their feeding regulatory mechanism in the context of reproduction status. In addition, we revised the discussion section to incorporate the valuable suggestion of the Reviewer #3.</p>

<p>As medaka is a unique genetic vertebrate model to study seasonal effects, it would be interesting to know whether the authors found novel or rather unexpected genes with a differential expression between LD and SD. It is understandable that the authors focused on argrp1 and npyb, as these have already been well studied in mammalian models although not in this context. Novel insights with genes previously not implicated in feeding regulation could underscore the unique nature of medaka as a model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your kind comments, which we found really encouraging to us. Since we focused on feeding-related peptides, we did not find any novel genes that have not been reported.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>ISH is unreliable as a methodology to quantify expression levels. Yet the authors use this to compare fed and starved females to compare expression levels of agrp1. They use a temporal staining comparison and compare 90-minute and 300-minute staining reactions. However, they do not explain why they use the 90-minute staining time point and why 300 minutes of staining is the &quot;saturation point of staining&quot;. They should provide compelling data for their claim and the selection of time points or else refrain from using these (at best) semi-quantitative ISH and provide more detailed (using serial sections) data to quantify the number of expressing cells.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the quantification of mRNA expression levels may not be that significant when trying to compare different states of gene function, as translational and post-translational steps can have large effects on gene function. This should be discussed adequately.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your comments. We conducted ISH by using medaka under LD or SD, not using those under fed or starved conditions. In addition, our previous study demonstrated that the slopes of the increase in the number of cells stained by ISH are also different if there is a difference in the expression level (Mitani et al., 2010). Although we do not have quantitative data of cell numbers, we confirmed that the number of cells expressing <italic>agrp1</italic> was saturated around 300 mins in our preliminary experiments, and therefore we terminated the chemogenic reactions at 300 mins. Based on these, we compared the cell ratio of 90 min (beginning of coloring) /300 min (saturation). However, since this analysis may not be worth discussing in detail, we moved this part to the supplementary figure as the reviewer suggested.</p>

<p>The molecular characterization of the agrp1 ko mutant is a bit thin.</p>
<p>Line 221: &quot;We obtained <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> medaka, which has lots of amino acid changes in functional site for AgRP1&quot; is a bit vague as a description for the ko-mutation. It would be really helpful if the authors could provide a scheme showing the wt protein with the relevant functional sites alongside the presumptive mutant protein.</p>
<p>How did the authors verify the molecular nature of their mutation? They should use suitable antibodies and western-blot analysis (maybe reagents from Shainer et al., 2019 work in medaka); in case this is not possible they could isolate &amp; clone the mutant transcript and use in-vitro translation systems to show that the presumptive mutant protein can actually be translated from this transcript. Another strategy could be to use a second non-allelic and (hopefully) non-complementing mutation (ko1/ko2 heterozygots for example) to show that ko-mutation acts the way the authors presume. The authors mention agrp1 ko medaka lines (plural!) in line 520, thus they may have an additional ko allele at hand.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your comments. We explained the mutation site in Figure 6-Supplementary Figure 1 (A: DNA sequences and B: predicted amino acid sequence, of WT and mutants).

<p>Thank you very much for your comment. As described above, <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> can spawn, which indicates that mechanisms for the downregulation of gonadotropins in <italic>agrp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> may be different from that in SD female.</p>

<p>Since the data for LD1, 2, and 3 (SD1, 2, and 3) were obtained from different individual fish, the variance may be reasonable. We conducted expression analyses by using RNA-seq to find candidate genes that show larger differences than individual ones.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The procedure of the food intake assay is not clear.</p>
<p>- Habituation Period: Medaka were placed into a white cup containing 100 mL of water and allowed to habituate for 5 minutes. However, is 5 minutes sufficient to reduce stress in the fish? A stressed fish does not exhibit the same feeding behavior as an unstressed one.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We confirmed that 5 minutes is enough for habituation in medaka, since medaka can swim freely in a few minutes after replacement from the tank and show normal feeding behavior.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Feeding Protocol: Medaka were fed with 200 Î¼L aliquots of brine shrimp-containing water. This procedure was repeated multiple times. How many times was this feeding procedure repeated? Was it 3, 10, or 100 times?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although there was a small variation in each trial, we usually applied tubes about 5 times or so.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Brine Shrimp Counting: You collected 10 mL of the breeding water to count the number of uneaten brine shrimp. Can you confirm that sampling 10% of the total volume is representative? Were any tests conducted to validate this? Given that you developed an automated tool to count the brine shrimp, why didn't you count them in all 100 mL?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reason for collecting 10 mL is to collect the leftover shrimp as soon as possible. Ten mins after the start of the experiment, we quickly placed a magnetic bar to stir the breeding water so that the shrimp concentration will be constant. Then we collected 10 mL aliquot from the experimental cup by using a micro pipette. In preliminary trials, we applied shrimps, the amount of which is almost the same as that applied to WT medaka in LD, to a white cup containing 100 mL water, and we divided it into 10 mL and 90 mL aliquots and separately counted the number of shrimps in each aliquot. Here, we confirmed that the variance between the numbers calculated by counting the shrimps in 10 mL aliquot and the total volume of 100 mL falls within the range of the variance of total applied shrimp. Thus, our present counting method can be considered reasonable.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Brine Shrimp Aliquot Measurement: You mentioned counting the number of brine shrimp in the 200 Î¼L solution three times before and after the experiments. What does this mean? Did you use this procedure to calculate the mean number of brine shrimp in each 200 Î¼L aliquot?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. As the reviewer commented, to calculate the mean number of brine shrimp in each 200 ÂµL aliquot, we counted the number of brine shrimp in the 200 ÂµL solution three times before and after the experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- How did you normalize the food intake data? This procedure is not detailed in the methods section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for pointing it out. We normalized food intake by subtracting the amount of shrimp by the average of those in LD or WT fish. This explanation was added in the Method section (L. 439).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Sample Size. Various tests were conducted with a low number of medaka (e.g., 2 brains for RNA-seq, 8 females for ovariectomy). Are these sample sizes sufficient to draw reliable conclusions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 1-Supplementary figure 2, RNAseq was performed to search for the candidate neuropeptides, and thatâs why the sample size was the minimum; we pooled two brains as one sample and used three samples per group. On the other hand, each group in the other experiments consist of n â¥ 5 samples, which is usually accepted to be adequate sample size in various studies (cf. Kanda et al., Gen Comp Endocrinol., 2011, Spicer et al., Biol Reprod., 2017).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Statistical Analysis.</p>
<p>- The authors used both parametric and non-parametric tests but did not specify how they assessed the normal distribution of the data. For example, if I understood correctly, a t-test was used to compare a small dataset (n=3). In such cases, a U-test would be more appropriate.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>While the authors mentioned using non-parametric tests, they did not specify in which contexts or conditions they were applied.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your comment. Kruskal-Wallis test statistically shows whether or not there are differences among any of three groups. To perform multiple comparisons among the three groups, we used Steel-Dwass test.</p>

<p>- The results section lacks details on the statistical tests used, including the specific test (e.g., Z, U, or W values) and degrees of freedom.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. As the reviewer pointed out, we added such statements in all the figure legends containing statistics.</p>

<p>(4) Previous studies have shown that photoperiod treatments alter the production of various hormones in medaka (e.g., Lucon-Xiccato et al., 2022; Shimmura et al., 2017), some of which, like growth hormone (GH), have been shown to influence feeding behavior (Canosa et al., 2007).</p>
<p>In your RNA-seq analysis, did you observe any changes in the expression of genes involved in other hormone synthesis pathways, such as pituitary hormones (GH and TSH), leptin, or ghrelin (e.g., see Volkoff, 2016; Blanco, 2020; Bertolucci et al., 2019)?</p>
<p>Including such evidence in the discussion would provide a broader perspective on the hormonal regulation of food intake in medaka.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your constructive comments. Unfortunately, since we performed RNA-seq using the whole brain after removal of the pituitary, we could not check such changes in the expression of pituitary hormone-related genes. As additional information about the feeding-related hormones, leptin did not show significant difference in our RNA-seq analysis, and we could not analyze ghrelin because ghrelin has not been annotated in medaka (NCBI and ensembl).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>There are some parts of the study that need to be developed further in order to provide a more comprehensive analysis.</p>
<p>(1) In the juvenile as well as ovariectomized female fish, the authors should confirm experimentally whether day length influences feeding activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your suggestion. We analyzed feeding behavior of juvenile (Figure 4-Supplementary Figure 1) and OVX female (Figure 5-Supplementary Figure 1). As shown in these figures, food intake in juvenile and OVX were not significantly different between LD and SD.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) More discussion as to the relevance of increasing feeding activity to support reproductive functions such as sustained egg production would be valuable. One assumes the metabolic costs of producing eggs on a daily basis in this species would inevitably require increased food intake. Is this a reasonable prediction?</p>
