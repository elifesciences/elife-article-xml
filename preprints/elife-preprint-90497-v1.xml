<title>Abstract</title>
<p>After exocytosis, release sites are cleared of vesicular residues to be replenished with transmitter-filled vesicles. Endocytic and scaffold proteins are thought to underlie this mechanism. However, physiological significance of the site-clearance mechanism among diverse central synapses remains unknown. Here, we tested this using action-potential evoked EPSCs in mouse brainstem and hippocampal slices in physiologically optimized condition. Pharmacological block of endocytosis enhanced synaptic depression at brainstem calyceal fast synapses, whereas it attenuated synaptic facilitation at hippocampal CA1 slow synapses. Block of scaffold protein activity likewise enhanced synaptic depression at calyceal synapses but had no effect at hippocampal synapses. At calyceal synapses, enhancement of synaptic depression by blocking endocytosis or scaffold activity occurred at nearly identical time courses with a time constant of several milliseconds starting immediately after the stimulation onset. Neither endocytic nor scaffold inhibitors prolonged the recovery from short-term depression. We conclude that endocytic release-site clearance can be a universal phenomenon supporting vesicle replenishment across fast and slow synapses, whereas presynaptic scaffold mechanism likely plays a specialized role in vesicle replenishment predominantly at fast synapses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chemical synaptic transmission depends upon fusion of transmitter-filled vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. At presynaptic terminals, there are a limited number of vesicular release sites, which can become refractory while discharged vesicles are remaining at the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Katz, 1993</xref>), inhibiting subsequent vesicle fusion. Following inactivation of the temperature-sensitive endocytic protein dynamin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant <italic>Shibire</italic>, short-term depression (STD) of neuromuscular transmission is enhanced within tens of milliseconds of the onset of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that vesicular endocytosis plays a significant role in release site-clearance, in addition to its well-established role in the vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>). At the calyx of Held, in slices from pre-hearing rats, pharmacological block of endocytosis enhances STD and prolongs the recovery from STD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, at cultured hippocampal synapses, blocking endocytosis enhances depression at high-frequency stimulation due to slow clearance of vesicular component from release-sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Hua et al., 2013</xref>). Genetic ablation of the endocytic adaptor protein AP-2<italic>μ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Jung et al., 2015</xref>), synaptobrevin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Rajappa et al., 2016</xref>), or the secretory carrier membrane protein SCAMP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Park et al., 2018</xref>) enhances synaptic depression in cultured cells, in agreement with the site-clearance role of endocytosis.</p>
<p>The active-zone (AZ) scaffold protein intersectin is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which activates the Rho-GTPase CDC42, thereby regulating the filamentous (F) actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hussain et al., 2001</xref>; Marie et al., 2004). At the calyx of Held in slices from pre-hearing rodents, genetic ablation of intersectin 1 or pharmacological block of CDC42 abolishes the fast component of the rate of recovery from STD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Sakaba et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that the scaffold protein cascade, comprising intersectin, CDC42 and F-actin, contributes to rapid vesicle replenishments possibly through release site-clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Japel et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the site-clearance hypothesis is widely accepted, its physiological significance among diverse central synapses remains unknown. To address this, we evoked EPSCs by afferent fiber stimulations, without intra-terminal perturbation, at brainstem calyces of Held and at hippocampal CA1 synapses in slices at physiological temperature (PT, 37°C; Sanchez-Alavej et al., 2011) and in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 1.3 mM-Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in reference to rodent CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Jones and Keep, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Silver and Erecinska, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Inglebert et al., 2020</xref>). At these synapses, we tested the effect of blocking endocytosis or scaffold activity on EPSCs evoked by a train of repetitive stimulations. These experiments indicated that the site-clearance mechanism normally supports synaptic strength, thereby enabling high-fidelity fast neurotransmission at brainstem synapses and boosting synaptic facilitation at hippocampal synapses. With respect to synaptic strengthening during high-frequency transmission, endocytosis plays significant roles among diverse synapses, whereas the role of scaffold seems more specific, working complimentarily with endocytosis-dependent site-clearance for rapid vesicle replenishment, restrictively at fast synapses.</p>

<title>Potency of endocytic blockers on slow and fast endocytosis at the calyx of Held</title>
<p>To clarify physiological roles of endocytosis in high-frequency synaptic transmission, we first examined the effect of different endocytic inhibitors on fast and slow endocytosis, using presynaptic membrane capacitance measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Sun et al.,2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Yamashita et al.,2010</xref>) at post-hearing calyces of Held (P13-15) at PT in aCSF containing 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Dynasore is a dynamin-dependent endocytosis blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Macia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Newton et al., 2006</xref>) blocking both clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>). A second endocytosis blocker Pitstop-2 is thought to preferentially block clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">von Kleist et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lopez-Hernandez et al., 2022</xref>) but it reportedly blocks clathrin-independent endocytosis as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Dutta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Willox et al., 2014</xref>). Since genetic ablation of endocytic proteins can be associated with robust compensatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Park et al., 2013</xref>), we adopted acute pharmacological block using endocytic inhibitors Dynasore and Pitstop-2.</p>

<p>At calyces of Held, a single short (5 ms) command pulse elicited an exocytic capacitance jump (<italic>Δ</italic>C<sub>m</sub>) followed by a slow endocytic decay rate (29 fF/s, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Bath-application of Dynasore (100 <italic>μ</italic>M) or Pitstop-2 (25 <italic>μ</italic>M) strongly inhibited this slow endocytosis without affecting <italic>Δ</italic>C<sub>m</sub> or presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (Table S1). In a repetitive stimulation protocol, the accelerating endocytosis can be induced by a 1-Hz train of 20-ms square pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>). Dynasore or Pitstop-2 significantly inhibited this fast endocytosis of 250 fF/s in the maximal rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Table S1). In another stimulation protocol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), 10 command pulses (20 ms duration) applied at 10 Hz induced a fast endocytosis with a decay rate (350 fF/s) by more than 10 times faster than the slow endocytosis elicited by a 5 ms pulse (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Dynasore or Pitstop-2 significantly inhibited this fast endocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Table S1). The potencies of bath-applied Dynasore or Pitstop-2 for blocking slow and fast endocytosis were comparable to that of dynamin-1 proline-rich domain peptide (Dyn-1 PRD peptide) directly loaded in calyceal terminals (1mM; Figure S1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, at calyces of Held, bath-application of Dynasore or Pitstop-2 can block both fast and slow endocytosis without perturbing presynaptic intracellular milieu.</p>

<title>Effects of endocytic blockers on synaptic depression and recovery from depression at brainstem calyceal synapses</title>
<p>Using Dynasore or Pitstop-2, we investigated the effect of blocking endocytosis on synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held in brainstem slices from post-hearing mice (P13-15). At PT in physiological aCSF (1.3mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]), EPSCs were evoked by a train of 30 stimulations applied to afferent fibers at 10 or 100 Hz (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Neither Dynasore nor Pitstop-2 affected the first EPSC amplitude in the train (Figure S2A). During a train of stimulations at 10 Hz, Dynasore slightly enhanced synaptic depression (from 45% to 52%, by 1.15 times), whereas Pitstop-2 had no effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>1). At 100-Hz stimulations, however, both Dynasore and Pitstop-2 markedly and equally enhanced synaptic depression within 10 ms from the stimulus onset, increasing magnitude of steady state STD (#26-30) from 58% to 75% (1.3 times; p &lt; 0.001, t-test; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>1). These results suggest that endocytosis-dependent rapid SV replenishment operates during high-frequency transmission at the mammalian central synapses like at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>). Postsynaptic mechanism is unlikely involved in this mechanism since results were essentially the same after minimizing postsynaptic receptor saturation using the low-affinity glutamate receptor ligand kynurenic acid (1 mM, Figure S3).</p>

<p>At pre-hearing calyces of Held at room temperature (RT), with a long command pulse stimulation under voltage-clamp, dynamin inhibitors markedly prolong the recovery of EPSCs from STD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, at post-hearing calyces, in the presence of the endocytic blockers, recovery of EPSCs from STD showed no prolongation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>2, 2B2, Table S2). Conversely, the recovery from STD caused by 100-Hz stimulation was significantly accelerated at both fast and slow recovery time constants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>2). To reduce the gap between these different results, we raised Ca <sup>2+</sup> concentration in aCSF to 2.0 mM at PT (Figure S4A) or RT (Figure S4B) or raised stimulation frequency to 200 Hz at PT (Figure S4C). None of these changes caused prolongation of recovery from STD (Figure S4). Remaining difference includes the species and age of animals (pre-hearing rats <italic>vs</italic> post-hearing mice) and stronger stimulation intensity in the whole-cell voltage-clamp command pulse protocol than afferent fiber stimulation.</p>

<title>Effects of scaffold protein inhibitors on vesicle endocytosis, synaptic depression, and recovery from depression at brainstem calyceal synapses</title>
<p>In presynaptic AZ, F-actin is assembled by the Rho-GTPase CDC42 activated by the scaffold protein intersectin, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hussain et al., 2001</xref>; Marie et al., 2004).

We examined the effect of blocking CDC42 using ML 141 (10 <italic>μ</italic>M) or inhibiting F-actin assembly using Latrunculin-B (15 <italic>μ</italic>M) on fast and slow endocytosis at the post-hearing (P13-15) calyx of Held at PT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) in aCSF containing 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].

<title>Kinetic comparison of synaptic depression enhanced by endocytic blockers and scaffold inhibitors and evaluation of their combined effect</title>
<p>During 100-Hz stimulation, enhancement of synaptic depression by endocytic blockers or scaffold inhibitors are prominent already in the second EPSCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>1, 4B1). Exponential curve fits to data points (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) indicated that the EPSCs underwent a single exponential depression in controls with a mean time constant of 37 ms (n = 11), whereas in the presence of endocytic blocker or scaffold inhibitor, EPSCs amplitude underwent double exponential decay with a fast time constant of 5-10 ms and a slow time constant of tens of milliseconds, the latter of which was similar to the time constant in control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These data indicate that endocytic and scaffold mechanisms for vesicle replenishment operate predominantly at the beginning of synaptic depression.

<p>Since both endocytic blockers and scaffold inhibitors enhanced synaptic depression with a similar time course, endocytosis-and scaffold-dependent synaptic strengthening likely operate simultaneously during high-frequency transmission. To clarify whether these mechanisms are additive or complementary, we co-applied Dynasore and Latrunculin-B during 100 Hz stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The magnitude of EPSC depression by the co-application was the same as that by single Latrunculin-B application (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that endocytosis and scaffold mechanisms complementarily maintain synaptic strength during high-frequency transmission.</p>

<title>Possible role of endocytosis and scaffold machineries at hippocampal synapses</title>
<p>Counteraction of synaptic depression by endocytosis or scaffold mechanism is highlighted at fast synapses of large structure such as neuromuscular junction or the calyx of Held. However, it remains open whether these mechanisms are conserved at more conventional bouton-type synapses involved in synaptic plasticity. Hence, we recorded EPSCs from CA1 pyramidal neurons evoked at high frequency (10 Hz or 25 Hz) by stimulating Schaffer collaterals (SCs) at PT and in aCSF containing 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In this physiologically optimized experimental condition, EPSCs underwent a prominent facilitation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Bath-application of Dynasore rapidly and strongly attenuated synaptic facilitation within 300 ms (4<sup>th</sup> stimulation) at 10 Hz, whereas, within 80 ms (3<sup>rd</sup> stimulation) at 25 Hz from the onset of stimulus train (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, 6B). Unexpectedly, Dynasore significantly enhanced the basal EPSC amplitude (Figure S2B), whereas Pitstop-2 had no such effect (Figure S2B). Although less potent than Dynasore, Pitstop-2 significantly attenuated synaptic facilitation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, 6C). Thus, at hippocampal CA1 synapses, like at fast synapses, endocytosis up-regulates synaptic strength during high-frequency transmission, thereby boosting short-term synaptic potentiation.</p>

<p>Strikingly, unlike endocytic blockers, neither ML141 nor Latrunculin-B affected the hippocampal short-term facilitation during stimulations at 10 Hz or 25 Hz (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, 6D). Thus, the presynaptic scaffold protein F-actin, CDC42 or intersectin unlikely plays a regulatory role on short-term synaptic plasticity at hippocampal synapses. At the CA1 synapse, block of vesicle acidification is reported to enhance synaptic depression at 10-30-Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ertunc et al., 2007</xref>), whereas at hippocampal synapses in culture, vesicle acidification block has no effect on the depression of repetitive exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Hua et al., 2013</xref>). Unlike in 2.0 mM [Ca <sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ertunc et al., 2007</xref>), in 1.3-mM [Ca <sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at PT, EPSCs showed a prominent facilitation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Figure S5), and blocking vesicle acidification with Folimicin (67 nM) or Bafilomycin A1 (5 <italic>μ</italic>M) had no significant effect on the short-term facilitation (Figure S5). Thus, vesicle acidification has no direct effect on synaptic strength at hippocampal CA1 synapses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In acute slices optimized to physiological conditions, blocking endocytosis by bath-application of the endocytic blocker enhanced activity-dependent depression of EPSCs evoked by high-frequency stimulation of afferent fibers at brainstem calyceal synapses. The enhancement of depression occurred immediately after the onset of stimulation and proceeded with a several millisecond time constant and then slowly merged into the control time course. Thus, the depression-counteracting effect of endocytosis was restricted to the early epoch of high-frequency transmission, when many vesicles occupy the release sites. As vesicles undergo exocytosis, the site-clearance becomes less demanding.</p>
<p>At the calyx of Held, Dynasore or Pitstop-2 blocked both fast and slow endocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The fast endocytosis is characterized with a rate of ∼350 fF/s, which was slowed by endocytic blockers to ∼150 fF/s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Table S1). This reduction of endocytic rate (200 fF/s) corresponds to 2.54 vesicles/ms (1 fF = 12.7 vesicles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>; 200 fF/s x 12.7 vesicles x 1/1000 ms). Since the mean amplitude of miniature EPSCs, representing a single vesicle response, was ∼55 pA in 1.3 mM [Ca <sup>2+</sup>] at PT (data not shown), endocytic block is estimated to reduce EPSC amplitude by ∼1.4 nA in 10 ms (2.54 vesicles/ms x 55 pA x 10 ms x 1/1000 nA). This is close to the EPSC size difference (1.6 nA) after 10 ms at 100-Hz stimulus onset between the absence and presence of endocytic blockers. Therefore, during high-frequency transmission, the site-clearance by fast endocytosis can fully compensate the initial strong depression. However, the rate of slow endocytosis is 10 times slower than fast endocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, Table S1), therefore slow endocytosis unlikely contributes to the millisecond-order site-clearance. However, without slow endocytosis, vesicular membrane remaining after spontaneous exocytosis would accumulate and congest release sites. Thus, slow endocytosis may play a house-keeping role in release site-clearance.</p>
<p>At the calyx of Held, scaffold protein inhibitors significantly enhanced synaptic depression with a time course closely matching to that enhanced by endocytic blocker (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, 5B). Unlike endocytic blockers scaffold protein inhibitors had no effect on endocytosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Compared with the effect of endocytic blockers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), the effect of scaffold protein inhibitors was not dependent on stimulation frequency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Co-application of endocytic and scaffold inhibitors revealed that the synaptic strengthening effects of endocytosis and scaffold machinery are complementary rather than additive (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These results together suggest that fast endocytosis quickly clears vesicle residues, whereas scaffold machinery simultaneously replenishes transmitter-filled vesicles to release sites during high frequency transmission (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Through this combinatory mechanism synaptic strength can be maintained above firing threshold, thereby maintaining high-fidelity neurotransmission at fast relay synapses such as the calyx of Held.</p>

<caption><title>Hypothetical scheme on the roles of endocytosis and scaffold machineries in vesicle replenishment during high-frequency transmission at brainstem relay synapses and hippocampal plastic synapses.</title>
<p>During high-frequency transmission, endocytosis plays site-clearance role allowing new vesicle to be replenished to release site. This endocytic function counteracts synaptic depression caused by vesicle depletion, thereby maintaining excitatory synaptic strength above firing threshold, enabling high-fidelity fast neurotransmission at sensory relay synapses. This synaptic strengthening function of endocytosis augments synaptic facilitation at synapses with long-term plasticity, thereby boosting its induction capability for memory formation. Presynaptic scaffold machinery plays a powerful vesicle replenishment role rapidly translocating new vesicles to open release sites or those just opened by endocytic site-clearance. This scaffold function is specifically devoted to fast synapses with high release probability but not to plastic synapses, where vesicle depletion is minimal due to low release probability.</p></caption>

<p>At hippocampal CA1 synapses the roles of endocytosis and scaffold in fast vesicle replenishment were different from those at the calyx of Held. In slices optimized to a physiological condition, short-term plasticity was depressive at calyceal synapses, whereas facilitatory at hippocampal CA1 synapses. Endocytic blockers attenuated synaptic facilitation, suggesting that endocytosis is normally boosting synaptic facilitation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Since synaptic strength at facilitatory synapses is determined by a sum of facilitation and depression mechanisms, attenuation of synaptic depression by endocytosis can boost synaptic facilitation. At hippocampal excitatory synapses, short-term facilitation of glutamate release induces long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory transmission. Thus, from physiological viewpoints, endocytosis-dependent site clearance can play an essential role in the induction of LTP underlying memory formation.</p>
<p>Strikingly, scaffold protein inhibitors had no effect on EPSCs at hippocampal CA1 synapses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, 6D). This is surprising since Latrunculin-A blocks ultra-fast endocytosis in hippocampal culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>) and Latrunculin-B attenuates vesicle docking at cerebellar synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the vesicle replenishing role of scaffold machinery is not common but limited to a subset of fast synapses. In contrast, the site-clearance role of endocytosis seems universal among fast high-fidelity and slow plastic synapses.</p>

Dynasore (100 µM), Pitstop-2 (25 µM), ML 141 (10 µM), Folimycin (also known as Concanamycin A; 67 nM), Latrunculin B (15 µM), and Bafilomycin A1 (5 µM) were dissolved in DMSO (final DMSO concentration, 0.1%), Since Latrunculin B and Folimycin are light sensitive, precautions were taken to minimize light exposure during handling and recording. Dynamin 1 proline-rich domain (PRD) peptide (sequence: PQVPSRPNRAP; GenScript) was dissolved in presynaptic pipette solution (1 mM).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study combines a comparative approach in different synapses with experiments that show how synaptic vesicle endocytosis in nerve terminals regulates short-term plasticity. The data presented support the conclusions and make a <bold>convincing</bold> case for fast endocytosis as necessary for rapid vesicle recruitment to active zones. Some aspects of the description of the data and analysis are however <bold>incomplete</bold> and would benefit from a more rigorous approach. With more discussion of methods and analysis, this paper would be of great interest to neurobiologists and biophysicists working on synaptic vesicle recycling and short-term plasticity mechanisms.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The study examines the role of release site clearance in synaptic transmission during repetitive activity under physiological conditions in two types of central synapses, calyx of Held and hippocampal CA1 synapses. After the acute block of endocytosis by pharmacology, deeper synaptic depression or less facilitation was observed in two types of synapses. Acute block of CDC42 and actin polymerization, which possibly inhibits the activity of Intersectin, affected synaptic depression at the calyx synapse, but not at CA1 synapses. The data suggest an unexpected, fast role of the site clearance in counteracting synaptic depression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study uses an acute block of the molecular targets with pharmacology together with precise electrophysiology. The experimental results are clear-cut and convincing. The study also examines the physiological roles of the site clearance using action potential-evoked transmission at physiological Ca and physiological temperature at mature animals. This condition has not been examined.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Pharmacology may have some off-target effects, though acute manipulation should be appreciated. Although this is a hard question and difficult to address experimentally, reagents may affect synaptic vesicle mobilization to the release sites directly in addition to blocking endocytosis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, Mahapatra and Takahashi report on the physiological consequences of pharmacologically blocking either clathrin and dynamin function during compensatory endocytosis or of the cortical actin scaffold both in the calyx of Held synapse and hippocampal boutons in acute slice preparations</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Although many aspects of these pharmacological interventions have been studied in detail during the past decades, this is a nice comprehensive and comparative study, which reveals some interesting differences between a fast synapse (Calyx of Held) tuned to reliably transmit at several 100 Hz and a more slow hippocampal CA1 synapse. In particular, the authors find that acute disturbance of the synaptic actin network leads to a marked frequency-dependent enhancement of synaptic depression in the Calyx, but not in the hippocampal synapse. This striking difference between both preparations is the most interesting and novel finding.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, however, these findings concerning the different consequences of actin depolymerization are not sufficiently discussed in comparison to the literature. My only criticism concerns the interpretation of the ML 141 and Lat B data. With respect to the Calyx data, I am missing a detailed discussion of the effects observed here in light of the different RRP subpools SRP and FRP. This is very important since Lee et al. (2012, PNAS 109 (13) E765-E774) showed earlier that disruption of actin inhibits the rapid transition of SRP SVs to the FRP at the AZ. The whole literature on this important concept is missing. Likewise, the role of actin for the replacement pool at a cerebellar synapse (Miki et al., 2016) is only mentioned in half a sentence. There is quite some evidence that actin is important both at the AZ (SRP to FRP transition, activation of replacement pool) and at the peri-active zone for compensatory endocytosis and release site clearance. Both possible underlying mechanisms (SRP to FRP transition or release site clearance) should be better dissected.</p>

<p>General comments:</p>
<p>(1) While Dynasore and Pitstop-2 may impede release site clearance due to an arrest of membrane retrieval, neither Latrunculin-B nor ML-141 specifically acts on AZ scaffold proteins. Interference with actin polymerization may have a number of consequences many of which may be unrelated to release site clearance. Therefore, neither Latrunculin-B nor ML-141 can be considered suitable tools for specifically identifying the role of AZ scaffold proteins (i.e. ELKS family proteins, Piccolo, Bassoon, α-liprin, Unc13, RIM, RBP, etc) in release site clearance which was defined as one of the principal aims of this study.</p>
<p>(2) Initial EPSC amplitudes more than doubled in the presence of Dynasor at hippocampal SC-&gt;CA1 synapses (Figure S2). This unexpected result raises doubts about the specificity of Dynasor as a tool to selectively block SV endocytosis.</p>
<p>(3) In this study, the application of Dynasore and Pitstop-2 strongly decreases 100 Hz steady-state release at calyx synapses while - quite unexpectedly - strongly accelerates recovery from depression. A previous study found that genetic ablation of dynamin-1 actually enhanced 300 Hz steady-state release while only little affecting recovery from depression (Mahapatra et al., 2016). A similar scenario holds for the Latrunculin-B effects: In this study, Latrunculin-B strongly increased steady-state depression while in Babu et al. (2020), Latrunculin-B did not affect steady-state depression. In Mahapatra et al. (2016), Latrunculin-B marginally enhanced steady-state depression. The authors need to make a serious attempt to explain all these seemingly contradicting results.</p>
<p>(4) The experimental conditions need to be better specified. It is not clear which recordings were obtained in 1.3 mM and which (if any?) in 2 mM external Ca. It is also unclear whether 'pooled data' are presented (obtained from control recordings and from separate recordings after pre-incubation with the respective drugs), or whether the data actually represent 'before'/'after' comparisons obtained from the same synapses after washing in the respective drugs. The exact protocol of drug application (duration of application/pre-incubation?, measurements after wash-out or in the continuous presence of the drugs?) needs to be clearly described in the methods and needs to be briefly mentioned in Results and/or Figure legends.</p>
<p>(5) The authors compare results obtained in calyx with those obtained in SC-&gt;CA1 synapses which they considered examples for 'fast' and 'slow' synapses, respectively. There is little information given to help readers understand why these two synapse types were chosen, what the attributes 'fast' and 'slow' refer to, and how that may matter for the questions studied here. I assume the authors refer to the maximum frequency these two synapse types are able to transmit rather than to EPSC kinetics?</p>
<p>(6) Strong presynaptic stimuli such as those illustrated in Figures 1B and C induce massive exocytosis. The illustrated Cm increase of 2 to 2.5 pF represents a fusion of 25,000 to 30,000 SVs (assuming a single SV capacitance of 80 aF) corresponding to a 12 to 15% increase in whole terminal membrane surface (assuming a mean terminal capacitance of ~16 pF). Capacitance measurements can only be considered reliable in the absence of marked changes in series and membrane conductance. Since the data shown in Figs. 1 and 3 are central to the argumentation, illustration of the corresponding conductance traces is mandatory. Merely mentioning that the first 450 ms after stimulation were skipped during analysis is insufficient.</p>
<p>(7) It is essential for this study to preclude a contamination of the results with postsynaptic effects (AMPAR saturation and desensitization). AMPAR saturation limits the amplitudes of initial responses in EPSC trains and hastens the recovery from depression due to a 'ceiling effect'. AMPAR desensitization occludes paired-pulse facilitation and reduces steady-state responses during EPSC trains while accelerating the initial recovery from depression. The use of, for example, 1 mM kynurenic acid in the bath is a well-established strategy to attenuate postsynaptic effects at calyx synapses. All calyx EPSC recordings should have been performed under such conditions. Otherwise, recovery time courses and STP parameters are likely contaminated by postsynaptic effects. Since the effects of AMPAR saturation on EPSC_1 and desensitization on EPSC_ss may partially cancel each other, an unchanged relative STD in the presence of kynurenic acid is not necessarily a reliable indicator for the absence of postsynaptic effects. The use of kynurenic acid in the bath would have had the beneficial side effect of massively improving voltage-clamp conditions. For the typical values given in this MS (10 nA EPSC, 3 MOhm Rs) the expected voltage escape is ~30 mV corresponding to a change in driving force of 30 mV/80 mV=38%, i.e. initial EPSCs in trains are likely underestimated by 38%. Such large voltage escape usually results in unclamped INa(V) which was suppressed in this study by routinely including 2 mM QX-314 in the pipette solution. That approach does, however, not reduce the voltage escape.</p>
<p>(8) In the Results section (pages 7 and 8), the authors analyze the time course into STD during 100 Hz trains in the absence and presence of drugs. In the presence of drugs, an additional fast component is observed which is absent from control recordings. Based on this observation, the authors conclude that '... the mechanisms operate predominantly at the beginning of synaptic depression'. However, the consequences of blocking or slowing site clearing are expected to be strongly release-dependent. Assuming a probability of &lt;20% that a fusion event occurs at a given release site, &gt;80% of the sites cannot be affected at the arrival of the second AP even by a total arrest of site clearance simply because no fusion has yet occurred. That number decreases during a train according to (1-0.2)^n, where n is the number of the AP, such that after 10 APs, ~90% of the sites have been used and may potentially be unavailable for new rounds of release after slowing site clearance. Perhaps, the faster time course into STD in the presence of the drugs isn't related to site clearance?</p>
<p>(9) In the Discussion (page 10), the authors present a calculation that is supposed to explain the reduced size of the second calyx EPSC in a 100 Hz train in the presence of Dynasore or Pitstop-2. Does this calculation assume that all endocytosed SVs are immediately available for release within 10 ms? Please elaborate.</p>
<p>(10) It is not clear, why the bafilomycin/folimycin data is presented in Fig. S5. The data is also not mentioned in the Discussion. Either explain the purpose of these experiments or remove the data.</p>
<p>(11) The scheme in Figure 7 is not very helpful.</p>
