<title>Summary</title>
<p>Osteoblast adherence to bone surfaces is important for remodeling of the bone tissue. This study demonstrates that deficiency of TG-interacting factor 1 (Tgif1) in osteoblasts results in altered cell morphology, reduced adherence to collagen type I-coated surfaces, and impaired migration capacity. Tgif1 is essential for osteoblasts to adapt a regular cell morphology and to efficiently adhere and migrate on collagen type I-rich matrices <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, Tgif1 acts as transcriptional repressor of p21-activated kinase 3 (PAK3), an important regulator of focal adhesion formation and osteoblast spreading. Absence of Tgif1 leads to increased PAK3 expression, which impairs osteoblast spreading. Additionally, Tgif1 is implicated in osteoblast recruitment and activation of bone surfaces in the context of bone regeneration and in response to parathyroid hormone 1-34 (PTH 1-34) treatment <italic>in vivo</italic>. These findings provide important novel insights in the regulation of the cytoskeletal architecture of osteoblasts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bone remodeling is a highly coordinated and continuously ongoing process involving osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes, that interact with each other and function in concert to maintain bone mass and preserve the integrity of the skeletal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Baron and Hesse, 2012</xref>). This process is essential for bone development, growth, maintenance, and repair as well as for the functionality of pharmacological interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kenkre and Bassett, 2018</xref>). Osteoblasts, derived from mesenchymal stem cells, play a pivotal role in synthesizing and depositing collagen type I-rich bone matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ponzetti and Rucci, 2021</xref>). To achieve this, osteoblasts undergo changes in cell shape and migrate on bone surfaces to lay down matrix at places where new bone needs to be formed, necessitating the regulation of cell movement and shape acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jones and Boyde, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eleniste et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Migration of osteoblasts involves movement from their origin to specific locations within the bone tissue and occurs during both embryonic development and adult bone remodeling. Multiple factors influence osteoblast migration, including growth factors, cytokines, signaling pathways like bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) as well as interactions with other cells and the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). These signals not only promote migration but also regulate the expression of adhesion molecules, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and cellular contractility.</p>
<p>Osteoblasts exhibit various morphological shapes based on their differentiation stage and the local microenvironment, ranging from elongated spindle-like morphology to cuboidal appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tsuji et al., 2022</xref>). The cytoskeleton, primarily composed of actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments, plays a central role in determining cell shape. Actin filaments, among other cytoskeletal elements, are involved in cell polarization, protrusion formation, and contractility during migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Schaks et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tang and Gerlach, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Etienne-Manneville, 2004</xref>). Signaling molecules, including Rho GTPases such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, regulate the cytoskeleton by controlling actin polymerization and organization, contributing to the formation of structures like lamellipodia, filopodia, and stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Schaks et al., 2019</xref>). These structures are essential for cell migration, enabling attachment to the extracellular matrix and generating the necessary force for movement. Integrins, transmembrane proteins mediating cell-extracellular matrix interactions, also play a critical role in osteoblast migration and cell shape regulation. They anchor cells to the matrix, transmit signals regulating migration and cytoskeletal dynamics, and activate intracellular pathways affecting cell shape, migration speed, and adhesion strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kechagia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">SenGupta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hood and Cheresh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, osteoblast migration and cell shape acquisition are interconnected processes crucial for bone development, growth, remodeling, and repair. Further investigation of the mechanisms underlying osteoblast migration and cell shape regulation is therefore important to better understand bone mass maintenance, treatment of bone-related disorders, and bone repair.</p>
<p>Fractures occur in the context of high-energy trauma but also due to bone fragility and represent a severe damage of bone integrity, requiring subsequent tissue regeneration. In response to fracture, inflammatory cells including neutrophils and macrophages are recruited to the site, releasing signaling molecules such as cytokines and growth factors. These molecules create a favorable environment for osteoblast migration and bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>). Osteoblast precursors derived from mesenchymal stem cells, or the periosteum migrate alongside sprouting vessels towards the fracture gap and differentiate into mature bone-forming osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Maes et al., 2010</xref>). Once osteoblasts have reached the fracture site, production and deposition of new bone matrix is initiated to facilitate fracture repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Maes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>). During this process, chemotactic signals released by surrounding tissues and cells, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) guide osteoblast migration (Dirckx et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, migration of osteoblasts is facilitated by the dynamic rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, primarily composed of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). Structures like lamellipodia and filopodia, enriched with actin, enable osteoblasts to extend and protrude in the direction of migration, interacting with the extracellular matrix and providing necessary traction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Casati et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jafari et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Movement of osteoblasts is an important but often underestimated component of the pharmacologically induced gain in bone mass in response to the treatment with bone anabolic drugs. Teriparatide, a recombinant form of the first 34 amino acids of human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH1-34; hereafter PTH), is a bone anabolic drug used to treat severe osteoporosis, characterized by low bone mineral density and an increased fracture risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Neer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Black and Rosen, 2016</xref>). PTH treatment stimulates bone formation by increasing the number, differentiation, and activity of osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pettway et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ogita et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, PTH promotes the recruitment of osteoblast precursor cells and activates quiescent lining cells on bone surfaces, transforming them into active matrix-forming osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nishida et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dobnig and Turner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, PTH increases the migration of mesenchymal precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lv et al., 2020</xref>) and augments bone remodeling (Saito et al., 2019), which attracts osteoblasts (Dirckx et al., 2013). During osteoblast migration, cytoskeletal dynamics promotes actin filament remodeling and the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lomri and Marie, 1990</xref>). These structures are essential for cell attachment to the extracellular matrix during migration. By enhancing cytoskeletal dynamics, PTH facilitates osteoblast movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). PTH also increases the expression and activation of integrins, which mediate interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gronthos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kaiser et al., 2001</xref>). These combined pharmacological effects of PTH treatment result in an increase in bone formation and bone mineral density, which improves bone strength and ultimately reduces fracture risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Neer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Black and Rosen, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, we reported the important role of the homeodomain protein TG-interacting factor 1 (Tgif1) in osteoblast differentiation, activity, and bone formation (Saito et al., 2019). Furthermore, Tgif1 was identified as PTH target gene, and in the absence of Tgif1, PTH treatment failed to increase bone mass in mice (Saito et al., 2019). These findings demonstrate the importance of Tgif1 as novel regulator of bone remodeling and emphasizes its essential involvement in mediating the full bone anabolic effect of PTH treatment. Building upon these observations, we investigated the role of Tgif1 in osteoblast morphology, adherence, and migration. Our findings demonstrate that Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts display an altered morphology, reduced adherence to collagen type I-coated surfaces, impaired migration capacity and decreased spreading compared to control cells. These deficits are associated with a compromised formation of focal adhesions and an upregulated expression of p21-activated kinase 3 (PAK3), which we further investigated due to its implication in cell migration and adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Mechanistically, Tgif1 exerts control over PAK3 expression through transcriptional repression. Thus, elevated PAK3 levels contribute to the observed defects in osteoblast spreading of Tgif1-deficient cells. By using translational approaches, we demonstrate that in the absence of Tgif1, the activation of bone surfaces by osteoblasts in response to bone repair and PTH treatment is diminished. Furthermore, we uncovered that PTH facilitates osteoblast spreading via Tgif1-PAK3 signaling.</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings increase the knowledge on processes governing osteoblast morphology, adherence, and migration. These novel insights are important to better understand mechanisms underlying bone remodeling and repair as well as the pharmacological effects of PTH treatment.</p>

<title>Tgif1-deficiency alters osteoblast morphology, adherence and migration</title>
<p>Recently, we reported that in Tgif1-deficient mice the number and activity of osteoblasts are reduced, which contributes to a low turnover bone remodeling (Saito et al., 2019). Further histological examination revealed that bone surfaces were scarcely occupied by small and flat osteoblasts in mice bearing a germline deletion of Tgif1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) or a deletion of Tgif1 targeted to osteoblasts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) compared to control littermates. This finding suggested that Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts might, in addition to an impaired bone matrix-producing capacity (Saito et al., 2019) be compromised in acquiring a physiological osteoblast morphology. This deficit could contribute to the low turnover bone phenotype of Tgif1-deficient mice.</p>

<p>Inactive and early-stage osteoblasts are rather small and flat in their morphological appearance but enlarge and adopt a more cuboidal shape upon activation. Active osteoblasts produce extracellular matrix and have the capacity to migrate to sites of bone remodeling and repair (Dirckx et al., 2013). These features require the ability to adhere to surfaces and to change cell morphology to facilitate cell migration. In support of our hypothesis that Tgif1-deficiency compromises morphological plasticity of osteoblasts, calvarial- and long bone-derived osteoblasts obtained from Tgif1-deficient mice were impaired in their ability to attach to collagen type I-coated surfaces throughout a 4-hour time-course (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-E</xref>). To determine the ability of Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts to migrate, we performed live cell video microscopy of osteoblasts seeded on collagen type I-coated surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dang and Gautreau, 2018</xref>). This analysis revealed that osteoblasts lacking Tgif1 were impaired in their migration capacity reflected by a shorter track length, a reduced velocity and a less straight and therefore more meandering track path (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> F-H, Fig. S1A). Thus, these <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data indicate that Tgif1 is important for osteoblasts to adhere and migrate on collagen type I-rich surfaces. To confirm these findings in a 3-dimensional functional context, we obtained long bone osteoblasts from Tgif1-defcient mice and control littermates and seeded them on a collagen type I matrix placed over a porous membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). In support of the previous observations, osteoblasts lacking Tgif1 adhered less to collagen type I matrix and were impaired in their capacities to migrate into the matrix compared to control cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). The experiment also confirmed that Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts were rather flat in morphology and smaller in size as determined by reduced cell area and perimeter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K-M</xref>). Collectively, these observations demonstrate that Tgif1 is indispensable for osteoblasts to adapt a regular cell morphology and to adhere and migrate on collagen type I-rich matrices <italic>in vitro</italic> and on bone surfaces <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts are impaired in spreading and in forming focal adhesions</title>
<p>Adherence on osseous matrices and migration alongside bone surfaces towards sites of remodeling or repair are crucial functional features of osteoblasts (Dirckx et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). Upon adherence and migration, osteoblasts undergo morphological changes and spread on bone surfaces, thereby decreasing their sphericity, a measure of how closely an object resembles the round shape of a sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cruz-Matías et al., 2019</xref>). To determine the ability of Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts to spread, calvarial osteoblasts were isolated from <italic>Tgif1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and control littermates and subject to spreading on collagen type I-coated slides for 60 minutes in the presence of Calcein-AM, a dye that is fluorescent in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dejaeger et al., 2017</xref>).

<p>Cell spreading is associated with the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments to form cell protrusions. Cell protrusions facilitate anchoring to the extracellular matrix via focal adhesion complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cronin and Demali, 2021</xref>). To determine whether Tgif1 is implicated in actin filament- and focal adhesion assembly, <italic>Tgif1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>and control osteoblasts were stained for phalloidin to visualize actin filaments and Paxillin, a major component of focal adhesions. Consistently, after 60 minutes of culture on collagen type I-coated surfaces, Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts were less spread and therefore had a greater sphericity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). Furthermore, Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts that underwent spreading formed less cellular processes and focal adhesions compared to control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, E</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm the findings obtained from osteoblasts bearing a germline deletion of <italic>Tgif1</italic>, we transiently silenced <italic>Tgif1</italic> in cells of the OCY454 cell line, a cell model system resembling motile osteocytes and mature osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Spatz et al., 2015</xref>), using siRNA (Fig. S1B). Consistent with the findings made by genetic deletion of <italic>Tgif1</italic>, siRNA-mediated silencing of Tgif1 in OCY454 cells resulted in an impaired cell spreading with a consecutive higher cell sphericity and a decrease in focal adhesion formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-H</xref>).</p>

<title>PAK3 expression is increased in the absence of Tgif1 and impairs focal adhesion formation and osteoblast spreading</title>
<p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the impaired ability of <italic>Tgif1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> osteoblasts to undergo morphological changes, expression and activation of the major focal adhesion components including FAK, Integrin β1, Src, talin, paxillin, p38 and LRG5 was quantified during cell spreading. However, no major changes were identified in the expression or activation of these molecules in the absence of Tgif1 (Fig. S2A).</p>
<p>Next, we examined the localization of Tgif1 to determine a possible interaction of Tgif1 with components of focal adhesions or actin filaments. Immunocytochemistry revealed that Tgif1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus and to some extend in the cytoplasm (Fig. S2B). However, cytoplasmic Tgif1 did not interact with focal adhesions, because no co-localization of eGFP-Tgif1 neither with paxillin nor with talin (Fig. S2B) was observed.</p>
<p>Given the predominantly nuclear localization of Tgif1 (Fig. S2B) and its established function as transcriptional repressor (Saito et al., 2019)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wotton et al., 1999</xref>), we investigated whether absence of Tgif1 might alter the expression of genes involved in actin cytoskeletal assembly and re-arrangement as prerequisite of cell adhesion and migration. First, we quantified the expression of members of the cell division control protein 42 homolog (Cdc42), which are small GTPases of the Rho family that participate in the control of multiple cellular functions including cell migration and cell morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hirsch et al., 2001</xref>). However, expression of none of the Cdc42 family members Cdc42es2, Cdc42ep1, Cdc42ep2 or Cdc42ep4 was changed in the absence of Tgif1 during osteoblast adhesion and spreading (Fig. S3 A-D). These data indicate that the impaired spreading of Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts is unlikely caused by Cdc42 family members and that other factors are implicated in this process. We therefore quantified the expression of p21-activated-kinase (PAK) family members, who have been shown to play a role cell adhesion and migration as well as in actin nucleation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kreis and Barnier, 2009</xref>). While expression of PAK 1, 2 and 4 was unchanged in Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts during adhesion and spreading (Fig. S3 E-G), expression of PAK3 was strongly increased in Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts compared to control cells at the mRNA and protein level prior to and 60 min after adhesion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A and B). Confirming this observation <italic>in vivo</italic>, expression of PAK3 mRNA showed a trend towards an increase in bones from <italic>Tgif1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to control littermates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). These findings suggest that the impaired adhesion and spreading of Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts might be related to a deregulated abundance of PAK3.</p>

<p>To further investigate the regulation of PAK3 expression by Tgif1, we performed an <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of the PAK3 promoter and identified 3 putative Tgif1 binding sites (Fig. S4A). Since only one site was species-conserved between rat and mouse, we verified the binding of Tgif1 to this site using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Indeed, Tgif1 bound to the predicted promoter binding site and to a site of the RAR promoter as positive control (Zhang et al., 2009), but not to a DNA sequence lacking predicted Tgif1 binding site as negative control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), suggesting a regulation of the PAK3 promoter activity by Tgif1. To address this question, Tgif1 expression was silenced in OCY454 osteoblast-like cells using siRNA followed by transfection of the cells with a 2.3kb fragment of the rat PAK3 promoter upstream of the luciferase gene. Silencing of Tgif1 lead to a significant increase in luciferase activity compared to control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>) demonstrating that Tgif1 is a transcriptional repressor of the PAK3 promoter.</p>
<p>To determine if an elevated abundance of PAK3 due to Tgif1-deficiency impairs osteoblast spreading, PAK3 expression was silenced in Tgif1-deficient OCY454 cells using siRNA (Fig. S4B). Indeed, attenuating PAK3 expression restored the Tgif1 deficiency-mediated impaired cell spreading (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Since cells are less spherical upon spreading, PAK3 silencing reduced the Tgif1 deficiency-dependent gain in cell sphericity and restored the number of focal adhesions per cell that were reduced by Tgif1 deficiency to the level of control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G and H</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that in the absence of Tgif1, the PAK3 promoter is de-repressed, leading to an increased transcriptional activity and PAK3 expression. A higher abundance of PAK3 in turn suppresses focal adhesion formation and osteoblast spreading.</p>

<p>To further investigate the role of Tgif1 during osteoblast spreading, we quantified Tgif1 expression during this process.

<p>Since binding of cells to collagen I-coated surfaces activates the ERK1/2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Emerson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fincham et al., 2000</xref>), we investigated the potential implication of ERK1/2 signaling in the increase of Tgif1 gene expression during osteoblast spreading. Experimentally, osteoblasts were treated with an ERK1/2 inhibitor, which greatly attenuated ERK1/2 phosphorylation after 20 min and 60 min of osteoblast spreading (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Although ERK1/2 inhibition prevented the increase of Tgif1 mRNA expression during the first 20 min of osteoblast spreading, it failed to suppress Tgif1 mRNA expression 60 min after initiation of osteoblast spreading (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). This finding suggests that the increase in Tgif1 mRNA expression at early stages of osteoblast spreading is mediated by ERK1/2 signaling while it is independent of ERK1/2 signaling at later stages of osteoblast spreading.</p>
<p>To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of Tgif1 transcription at later stages of osteoblast spreading, we performed progressive truncations of the 2.2 kb fragment of the human Tgif1 promoter (Saito et al., 2019). While the 2.2 kb and 1.7 kb fragments of the human Tgif1 promoter were fully activated after 60 minutes of osteoblast spreading, no activation of the 1.2 kb and 0.5 kb fragments was observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>), suggesting that the regulatory promoter region that is activated during osteoblast spreading must be located within the 500 bp between the 1.7 kb and the 1.2 kb promoter fragments.</p>
<p>Recently we reported the presence of an AP1 binding site in this region of the Tgif1 promoter (Saito et al., 2019), suggesting that AP1 signaling might be implicated in this process. Since the role of AP1 signaling in the context of cell spreading has not been fully elucidated, we first determined the activation of an AP1-responsive promoter element during osteoblast spreading. The findings demonstrate that AP1-signaling is activated 60 minutes after initiation of osteoblast spreading (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>), indicating a potential implication of AP1 signaling during advanced stages of osteoblast spreading. To further test this hypothesis, osteoblasts were transfected either with a plasmid encoding the wild-type Tgif1 promoter bearing an AP1 binding site or with a plasmid in which the AP1 binding site was disabled by site-specific mutation (Saito et al., 2019). Although the wild-type promoter was fully activated after 60 min of osteoblast spreading, the Tgif1 promoter bearing the disabled AP1 binding site was not activated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). These findings suggest that AP1 signaling is involved in the activation of Tgif1 gene expression during later stages of osteoblast spreading.</p>

<title>Tgif1 deficiency leads to fewer and less active osteoblasts during bone regeneration</title>
<p>Bone has a regenerative capacity to heal upon fracture. In fulfilling this function, osteoblast adherence and spreading are crucial features since osteoblasts migrate to sites of bone repair for subsequent matrix production and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>; Dirckx et al., 2013). Fracture healing involves various cell types and cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>). One important component is the activation of periosteal cells to migrate alongside vessels that sprout into the fracture zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Maes et al., 2010</xref>). Periosteal cells become active osteoblasts that produce a cartilage template, which then ossifies and forms new trabeculae to consolidate the fracture gap (Duchamp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">De Lageneste et al., 2018</xref>). Since this process involves adherence and spreading of osteoblasts, we hypothesized that Tgif1 might be important in the context of bone repair. To test this hypothesis, we performed open mid-shaft tibia fractures in 10-weeks old adult male mice bearing a germline deletion of Tgif1 and control littermates, followed by fracture stabilization using an intramedullary pin. Three weeks after fracture, newly formed trabeculae were densely occupied by cuboidal matrix-producing osteoblasts in control animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A-E). In contrast, in mice bearing a germline deletion of Tgif1, the callus was less ossified and the trabeculae in the repair zone were sparsely occupied by fewer, thinner, and less-active osteoblasts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A-F). These findings demonstrate that Tgif1 is important for bone regeneration.</p>

<title>Activation of bone surfaces by PTH is attenuated in the absence of Tgif1 in osteoblasts</title>
<p>Intermittent administration of PTH augments bone formation, leading to a remodeling-based increase in bone mass, bone mineral density and a consecutive decrease in fracture rate in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Neer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Taipaleenmäki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Baron and Hesse, 2012</xref>). This anabolic function requires multiple alterations at the cellular level. For instance, PTH induces the differentiation of mesenchymal precursor cells and reverts quiescent bone lining cells into active osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nishida et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dobnig and Turner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, PTH increases the number and bone-forming capacity of mature osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mizoguchi and Ono, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jilka et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, we identified Tgif1 as a PTH target gene in osteoblasts that is necessary for the full PTH-mediated bone mass accrual (Saito et al., 2019). In addition, the site of the Tgif1 promoter known to be activated by PTH signaling (Saito et al., 2019), is identical with the site identified here that is activated by AP1 signaling during osteoblast adhesion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). In this study we also uncovered that Tgif1 is a physiological regulator of osteoblast adherence, spreading and migration. Collectively, this evidence let us to propose that Tgif1 might also be implicated in the PTH-mediated bone surface activation.</p>
<p>To determine whether Tgif1 is implicated in the PTH-mediated activation of bone surfaces by osteoblasts, we performed histomorphometric analysis of bone sections from mice bearing a germline deletion of Tgif1 and control littermates that were injected with PTH or vehicle control. Consistent with the findings reported by others and in support of our hypothesis, PTH treatment greatly increased the number of active osteoblasts and induces the acquisition of a cuboidal shape and consequently the percentage of active bone surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kousteni and Bilezikian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tam et al., 1982</xref>), which all occurred at a much lesser extent in mice lacking Tgif1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). To determine whether this effect is osteoblast-autonomous, we performed histomorphometric analysis of bones obtained from mice in which Tgif1 deletion was targeted to mature osteoblasts using the Dmp1-promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bivi et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, while PTH treatment induced osteoblast recruitment, adaptation of a cuboidal morphology of matrix-producing osteoblasts and a profound activation of bone surfaces by osteoblasts in control animals, these effects were much less pronounced in mice lacking Tgif1 in osteoblasts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C and D</xref>). These findings therefore demonstrate that PTH-dependent bone surface activation is attenuated in the absence of Tgif1 in osteoblasts.</p>

<title>PTH facilitates spreading of osteoblasts via Tgif1-PAK3 signaling</title>
<p>The observation that Tgif1 is crucial for osteoblast adherence, spreading and migration <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as for the PTH-mediated activation of bone surfaces suggests that PTH may facilitate the spreading of osteoblasts and therefore the decrease in cell sphericity via Tgif1.

Immunofluorescence staining and quantification of cell sphericity revealed that PTH supports osteoblast spreading (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A and B</xref>). Furthermore, PTH treatment of cells in which Tgif1 expression was silenced failed to induce the spreading of osteoblasts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A and B</xref>), demonstrating that the PTH-mediated osteoblast spreading indeed depends on Tgif1.</p>

In addition, PTH treatment increased Tgif1 expression and reduced PAK3 protein abundance in control cells but not in osteoblasts in which Tgif1 expression was silenced by siRNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Next, we examined osteoblast spreading upon PTH treatment in the absence of Tgif1 alone or in combination with loss of PAK3. Immunofluorescence staining and quantification of cell sphericity revealed that silencing Tgif1 expression impaired osteoblast spreading induced by PTH treatment, which was restored by the concomitant silencing of PAK3 expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E and F</xref>). Furthermore, lack of both, Tgif1 and PAK3 prevented PTH-induced decrease in cell sphericity. These findings indicate that an increased abundance of PAK3 in response to Tgif1-deficiency impairs PTH-induced spreading of osteoblasts and that PTH facilitates osteoblast spreading via Tgif1-PAK3 signaling.</p>
<p>In summary, our results reveal that Tgif1 suppresses PAK3 expression in osteoblasts via the ERK1/2 and AP1 signaling pathways, which is important for osteoblasts to form focal adhesions, to spread on bone surfaces, and to migrate. This mechanism is implicated in bone regeneration and in the pharmacological effects of PTH treatment and is therefore of translational relevance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study revealed that Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts exhibit an altered morphology, reduced adherence to collagen type I-coated surfaces, impaired migration capacity, and decreased spreading compared to control cells. These defects in Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts are associated with compromised focal adhesion formation and increased expression of PAK3. The findings further demonstrate that Tgif1 regulates PAK3 expression through transcriptional repression and that elevated PAK3 abundance contributes to the impaired osteoblast spreading observed in Tgif1-deficient cells. Additionally, Tgif1 is shown to participate in the activation of bone surfaces in the context of bone regeneration and PTH treatment since in the absence of Tgif1, bone regeneration- and PTH-induced activation of bone surfaces is attenuated. Mechanistically, PTH promotes osteoblast spreading via Tgif1-PAK3 signaling, with PAK3 expression being reduced by PTH treatment in a Tgif1-dependent manner. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of Tgif1 in regulating osteoblast morphology, adherence, and migration through the modulation of PAK3 expression, providing novel and translationally relevant mechanistic insights into the regulation of the cytoskeletal architecture of osteoblasts.</p>
<p>Both, bone repair and PTH treatment are frequent and clinically relevant events. Fractures often occur in the context of high energy accidents, however, bone fragility syndromes such as osteoporosis also cause fractures upon minimal or no trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Malluche et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Löfman et al., 2009</xref>). Bone regeneration, a complex process involving osteoblast recruitment, matrix production, and tissue regeneration, is compromised in Tgif1-deficient mice. Activation of bone surfaces by osteoblasts, a critically important aspect of bone repair, is significantly reduced in the absence of Tgif1, leading to a reduced callus ossification. In addition, Tgif1-deficient mice also have a reduced number and activity of osteoclasts mice (Saito et al., 2019) and therefore an attenuated bone remodeling which might also contribute to an impaired bone healing. Nevertheless, the results presented here indicate that Tgif1 is important for osteoblast recruitment to the site of repair and subsequent bone surface activation, which extends the established function of Tgif1 beyond the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and activity.</p>
<p>Albeit mechanistically distinct, bone repair and PTH treatment have in common that osteoblasts are an important component for the successful execution of bone regeneration and the PTH pharmacological effects. In particular, the guided spatial relocation of activated osteoblasts is a critical feature to exert the respective functions at the right sites in a three-dimensional context since formation of new bone, regardless of whether in the cortical- or trabecular compartment, occurs in a timely but also in a spatially controlled manner to yield structurally supportive newly formed bone tissue. Various types of cells and tissues of the local microenvironment produce a plethora of signaling factors, which are induced by fractures or PTH treatment. However, little is known about signaling pathways in osteoblasts that receive and integrate these diverse external cues to facilitate the adherence, spreading and movement of osteoblasts in a coordinated manner. In this context, this study identified the functional importance of PAK3 in Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts. PAK3 expression was increased in the absence of Tgif1, leading to impaired focal adhesion formation and reduced osteoblast spreading. Silencing PAK3 expression restored osteoblast spreading in Tgif1-deficient cells, demonstrating that PAK3 plays a critical role in mediating the effects of Tgif1 on osteoblast morphology. This work therefore contributes to the better understanding of osteoblast dynamics by identifying Tgif1 and PAK3 as downstream signaling regulators that are important for osteoblasts to fulfill motility. Furthermore, the work underscores the physiological relevance of spatial osteoblast dynamics as integral component of bone remodeling and maintenance of skeletal integrity.</p>
<p>Tgif1 recently emerged as a key determinant of osteoblast activity, bone mass maintenance and essential component of the bone anabolic PTH signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Haider et al., 2020</xref>; Saito et al., 2019) This study also focused on investigating the role of PTH in regulating osteoblast spreading and revealed that PTH treatment facilitated osteoblast spreading via Tgif1-PAK3 signaling. PTH treatment reduced PAK3 expression and increased Tgif1 expression, leading to enhanced osteoblast spreading. Silencing Tgif1 expression impaired PTH-induced osteoblast spreading, which was restored by simultaneously silencing PAK3 expression. These new findings on PTH-Tgif1-PAK3 signaling provide novel insights into the function of PTH treatment of bone remodeling and the implication of Tgif1 in this process. As part of being required for bone mass accrual in response to PTH treatment (Saito et al., 2019), Tgif1 also contributes to the PTH-induced osteoblast recruitment and subsequent movement to sites where new bone needs to be formed. This adds a spatial component to a functional feature and demonstrates the complexity of bone remodeling and PTH anabolic actions.</p>
<p>This work has the limitation that the findings on the role of Tgif1 in osteoblast spreading and migration were obtained by <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, which do not necessarily fully reflect <italic>in vivo</italic> situations. Furthermore, limited evidence exists that the role of Tgif1-PAK3 signaling uncovered <italic>in vitro</italic> also plays a crucial role <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, future <italic>in vivo</italic> studies need to further validate our findings for instance by determining PAK3 expression in <italic>Tgif1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in fractures and upon PTH treatment as well as by pharmacologically suppressing PAK3 expression in Tgif1-deficient mice.</p>
<p>In summary, these findings highlight the pivotal role of Tgif1 in regulating osteoblast morphology, adherence, and migration. Notwithstanding the possibility that other mechanisms exist, our data reveal the involvement of PAK3 in mediating the effects of Tgif1 on osteoblast spreading. The dysregulation of these processes due to Tgif1 deficiency has profound implications for bone remodeling, bone regeneration, and the pharmacological effects of PTH. Reaching a better understanding of the intricate interplay between PTH, Tgif1 and PAK3, provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms governing osteoblast function and could have translational relevance in bone-related disorders and therapies targeting bone health.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors were trying to achieve that Tgif1 expression is regulated by EAK1/2 and PTH in a time-dependent manner, and its roles in suppressing Pak3 for facilitating osteoblast adhesion. The authors further tried to achieve that the Tgif1-Pak3 signaling plays a significant role in osteoblast migration to the site of bone repair and bone remodeling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- In a previous study, they demonstrated that Tgif1 is a target gene of PTH, and the absence of Tgif1 failed to increase bone mass by PTH treatment (Saito et al., Nat Commun., 2019). In this study, they found that Tgif1-Pak3 signaling prompts osteoblast migration through osteoblast adhesion to prompt bone regeneration. This novel finding provides a better understanding of how Tgif1 expression in osteoblasts regulates adherence, spreading, and migration during bone healing and bone remodeling.</p>
<p>
- The authors demonstrated that ERK1/2 and PTH regulate Tgif1 expression in a time-dependent manner and its role in suppressing Pak3 through various experimental approaches such as luciferase assay, ChIP assay, and gene silencing. These results contribute to the overall strength of the article.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>None after substantial revisions especially in vivo parts.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Bolamperti S. et al. 2023 investigates whether expression of TG-interacting factor (Tgif1) is essential for osteoblastic cellular activity regarding morphology, adherence, migration/recruitment, and repair. Towards this end, germ-line Tgif1 deletion (Tgif1-/-) mice or male mice lacking expression of Tgif1 in mature osteoblastic and osteocytic cells (Dmp1-Cre+; Tgif1fl/fl) and corresponding controls were studied in physiological, bone anabolic, and bone fracture-repair conditions. Both Tgif1-/- and Dmp1-Cre+; Tgif1fl/fl exhibited decreased osteoblasts on cancellous bone surfaces and adherent to collagen I-coated plates. Tgif1-/- mice exhibit impaired healing in the tibial midshaft fracture model, as indicated by decreased bone volume (BV/Cal.V), osteoid (OS/BS), and low osteoblasts (number and surface). Likewise, both Tgif1-/- and Dmp1-Cre+; Tgif1fl/fl show impaired PTH 1-34, (100 µg/kg, 5x/wk for 3 wks) osteoblast activation in vivo, as detected by increases in quiescent bone surfaces. Mechanistic in vitro studies then utilized primary osteoblasts isolated from Tgif1-/- mice and siRNA Tgif1 knockdown OCY454 cells to further investigate and identify the downstream Tgif1 target driving these osteoblastic impairments. In vitro, Tgif1-/- osteoblastic and Tgif1 knockdown OCY454 cells exhibit decreased migration, abnormal morphology, and decreased focal adhesions/cell. Unexpectantly though, localization assays revealed Tgif1 to primarily concentrate in the nucleus and not to co-localize with focal adhesions (paxillin, talin). Also, expression of major focal adhesion components (paxillin, talin, FAK, Src etc.) or the Cdc42 family was not altered by loss of Tgif1 expression. In contrast, PAK3 expression is markedly upregulated by loss of Tgif1. In silico analysis followed by mechanistic molecular assays involving ChIP, siRNA (Tgif1, PAK3), and transfection (rat PAK3 promoter) techniques show that Tgif1 physically binds to a specific site in the PAK3 promoter region. Further, the knockdown of PAK3 rescues the Tgif1-deficient abnormal morphology in OCY454 cells. This is the first study to identify the novel transcriptional repression of PAK3 by Tgif1 as well as the specific Tgif1 binding site within the PAK3 promoter.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work has a plethora of strengths. The co-authors achieved their aim in eliciting the role of Tgif1 expression to osteoblastic cellular functions (morphology, spreading/attachment, migration). Further, this work is the first to depict the novel mechanism of Tgif1 transcriptional repression of PAK3 by a through usage of mechanistic molecular assays (In silico analysis, ChIP, siRNA, transfection etc.). The conclusions are well supported and justified by these findings, as the appropriate controls, sample sizes (statistical power), statistics, and assays were fully utilized.</p>
<p>Claims and conclusions justified by data? Yes. absolutely</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>None. All reviewer comments were fully addressed.</p>

<p>We agree with this comment. We are confident that our work identified an important mechanism by which Tgif1 regulates cellular features of osteoblasts. However, it is certainly possible that other mechanisms may exist as well. We discuss this point in the revised manuscript (page 18, lines 16-17).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Re: We agree with this point and have modified the abstract accordingly by replacing “crucial” with “implicated in” as well as the text by changing “crucial” to “important” (page 2, line 9). Furthermore, we discuss this limitation in the revised manuscript (page 18, lines 9-14).</p>

Also, the expression of major focal adhesion components (paxillin, talin, FAK, Src, etc.) or the Cdc42 family was not altered by loss of Tgif1 expression. In contrast, PAK3 expression is markedly upregulated by loss of Tgif1. In silico analysis followed by mechanistic molecular assays involving ChIP, siRNA (Tgif1, PAK3), and transfection (rat PAK3 promoter) techniques show that Tgif1 physically binds to a specific site in the PAK3 promoter region. Further, the knockdown of PAK3 rescues the Tgif1-deficient abnormal morphology in OCY454 cells. This is the first study to identify the novel transcriptional repression of PAK3 by Tgif1 as well as the specific Tgif1 binding site within the PAK3 promoter.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work has a plethora of strengths. The co-authors achieved their aim of eliciting the role of Tgif1 expression in osteoblastic cellular functions (morphology, spreading/attachment, migration).</p>
<p>Further, this work is the first to depict the novel mechanism of Tgif1 transcriptional repression of PAK3 by a thorough usage of mechanistic molecular assays (in silico analysis, ChIP, siRNA, transfection etc.). The conclusions are well supported and justified by these findings, as the appropriate controls, sample sizes (statistical power), statistics, and assays were fully utilized.
The claims and conclusions are justified by the data.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The cell spreading and migration assay is quite artificial. Trypsinized osteoblasts and quiescent osteoblasts are totally different. The authors need to cite papers from other groups to justify whether the cell spreading and migration assay is appropriate to achieve the goals of this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Re: The reviewer is right that in vitro assays are often artificial and do not necessarily fully reflect in vivo situations. We have taken this aspect into account and discuss it in the revised manuscript (page 18, lines 9-10). In addition, we have included references from other groups who have used similar assays to study cell spreading and migration (Dejaeger M et al., 2017 and Dang et al., 2018).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Page 13 Line 15: The statement &quot;Osteoblasts are greatly impaired in the ability to migrate into the repair zone&quot; is an overstatement. The experiments in Figure 5 do not necessarily reflect osteoblast migration activities. The authors need to rephrase the sentence or need to show observation of earlier time points (e.g., 1 week after fracture) in their bone healing experiments. The number of osteoblasts/surface in Tgif1+/+ and Tgif1-/- mice at different time points during bone healing should be a good indicator for the migration of osteoblasts to the repair site.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Re: We understand the critique that a time course or lineage tracing experiments would provide better evidence for the statement of osteoblast migration into the repair zone. To avoid overinterpretations we have removed the sentence from the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Page 14, Line 24: Regarding the sentence &quot;The observation that Tgif1 is crucial for osteoblast adherence, spreading, and migration&quot;, the authors need to clearly mention this statement is based on the in vitro experiments. The animal studies are not enough to claim that the mechanism is crucial for adherence, spreading, and migration.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Re: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this limitation. We have clarified that the finding that Tgif1 is crucial for osteoblast adherence, spreading and migration was made in vitro (page 14, line 22).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors need to demonstrate the suppression of Pak3 expression in PTH-treated mice in vivo, in addition to the in vitro culture system (Fig. 7C and 7D).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Re: We agree with the reviewer that this experiment would be very insightful. However, this is beyond the scope of the current work. Nevertheless, to take this valid point into consideration, we mention it in the discussion as potential future direction (page 18, lines 11-14).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors need to demonstrate that the pharmacologic suppression of Pak3 in Tgif1-/- mice reduces the % of quiescent surface/BS in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Re: This point is also well taken, and we agree that a suppression of Pak3 in Tgif1-deficient mice would be very informative to support our in vitro findings. However, this may also be part of future investigations. This is emphasized in the discussion of the revised manuscript (page 18, lines 11-14).</p>

<p>Re: We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the quality of our microscopy studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Since the Tgif1-/- mouse has low osteoclast numbers, is it possible that this is a contributing factor to the delays/impairment in bone healing, given that resorption also has a role in fracture repair? Since the focus of these studies is on osteoblastic cells, this point is a little out of scope. However, would the authors consider exploring this further in the discussion section?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Re: This point is well taken by the reviewer, and we agree that osteoclasts could certainly play a role in the impaired fracture healing. To acknowledge this aspect, we followed the recommendation and discuss this aspect in the revised manuscript (page 16, lines 22-24).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Revisions</p>
<p>Would the authors consider slightly re-wording the title? Tgif1 suppresses PAK3 expression; however, Tgif1-deficiency leads to the unregulated elevation of PAK3 expression.</p>

<p>Re: Thank you for pointing this out. We agree with the reviewer and adapted the title accordingly.</p>

<p>Suggestions</p>
<p>(1) Is it possible that apoptosis and/or anoikis is being induced by Tgif1 deficiency in osteoblastic cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Re: We do not have data towards this direction and although Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts are overall viable and well expanding, we cannot fully exclude this possibility.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) For the fracture study, any differences in overall callus size? Would it be possible to perform micro-CT imaging with some of these samples?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Re: There is no difference in non-mineralized callus size between Tgif1+/+ and Tgif1-/- mice. However, there is less mineralized bone per callus area in Tgif1-/- mice, confirming an impaired osteoblast phenotype. As suggested by the reviewer, we added representative micro-CT images and the respective information to the revised manuscript (Fig 5F; pages 19-20).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Fracture repair experiment-is PAK3 expression downregulated with fracture injury; and/or, is PAK3 upregulated by loss of Tgif1 expression?</p>

<p>Re: Unfortunately, we do not have data to answer this very interesting question and it would need to be addressed in future studies. This is mentioned in the revised discussion (page 18, lines 12-14).</p>

<p>(4) Fig 7F. within PTH treated cells, is the light blue SCR sphericity statistically different than the light green siTgif1 + siPAK3 ? While the statement of the &quot;lack of both, Tgif1 and PAK3 prevented PTH-induced decrease in cell sphericity&quot; is supported by the lack of differences between dark green vs. light green; is it also possible that this is due to the siPAK3 returning sphericity to control (scr) levels? (i.e. hitting a floor limit of detection).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Re: We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful question. There is no statistically significant difference between light blue and light green. Silencing PAK3 restores the impaired capacity to spread that occurs in the absence of Tgif1 to the level of scr controls (significant difference between dark and light red vs. dark and light green and no difference between either dark or light blue vs. dark or light green). However, unlike in the (scr) controls, in the absence of both Tgif1 and PAK3, the cells do not respond to PTH (statistically significant difference between dark and light blue, no difference between dark and light green). Based on the data, cells can reach sphericity of less than 0.2 and thus it is unlikely that sphericity is “hitting the floor level of detection” in these groups.</p>
