<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Oscillations in insulin secretion, driven by islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves, are crucial for glycemic control. Prior studies, performed with single-plane imaging, suggest that subpopulations of electrically coupled β-cells have privileged roles in leading and coordinating the propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. Here, we used 3D light-sheet imaging to analyze the location and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of single β-cells within the entire islet at &gt;2 Hz. In contrast with single-plane studies, 3D network analysis indicates that the most highly synchronized β-cells are located at the islet center, and remain regionally but not cellularly stable between oscillations. This subpopulation, which includes ‘hub cells’, is insensitive to changes in fuel metabolism induced by glucokinase and pyruvate kinase activation. β-cells that initiate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave (‘leaders’) are located at the islet periphery, and strikingly, change their identity over time via rotations in the wave axis. Glucokinase activation, which increased oscillation period, reinforced leader cells and stabilized the wave axis. Pyruvate kinase activation, despite increasing oscillation frequency, had no effect on leader cells, indicating the wave origin is patterned by fuel input. These findings emphasize the stochastic nature of the β-cell subpopulations that control Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and identify a role for glucokinase in spatially patterning ‘leader’ β-cells.</p></abstract>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pulsatile insulin secretion from pancreatic islet β-cells is key to maintaining glycemic control. Insulin secretory oscillations increase the efficiency of hepatic insulin signaling and are disrupted in individuals with obesity and diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The primary stimulus for insulin release is glucose, which is intracellularly metabolized to generate a rise in ATP/ADP ratio, which closes ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>ATP</sub> channels) to initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and insulin secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. At elevated glucose, β-cells oscillate between electrically silent and electrically active phases with a period of minutes, both in vivo and in isolated islets. The depolarizing current can be transmitted between β-cells across the whole islet through gap junction channels. However, the activity of individual electrically coupled β-cells is functionally heterogenous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. This heterogeneity results in the emergence of β-cell subpopulations that may be crucial in maintaining the coordination of the whole islet and regulating pulsatile insulin release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Understanding the underpinnings of β-cell functional heterogeneity and islet cell communication is important to understand islet dysfunction and the pathogenesis of diabetes.</p>
<p>Similar to studies of neuronal networks, functional network analysis can be used to quantify interactions within the heterogenous β-cell system. Interactions (termed ‘edges’) are drawn between β-cell pairs with highly correlated Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Studies suggest that the β-cell functional network exhibits high clustering or ‘small-world’ properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, with a subpopulation of β-cells that are highly synchronized to other cells (‘hub cells’)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Silencing the electrical activity of these hub cells with optogenetics was found to abolish the coordination within that plane of the islet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Similarly, time series-based lagged cross correlation analysis has identified subpopulations of cells at the wave origin, termed ‘early-phase’ or ‘leader cells’, that lead the second-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave by depolarizing and repolarizing first<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, questions have been raised whether the highly networked or cross correlation-derived leader subpopulations have the power to control the entire islet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Underlying this controversy lies several unanswered questions: what mechanisms drive the existence of these functional subpopulations? Do these subpopulations arise primarily from mechanisms intrinsic to β-cells, making the subpopulations consistent over time? Alternatively, do they arise from the combination of intrinsic mechanisms and emergence due to surrounding cells, allowing the subpopulations to fluidly change over time? To date, experiments have been restricted to imaging a single two-dimensional (2D) plane of the islet which contains only a small fraction of the β-cells present in the three-dimensional (3D) islet tissue, limiting the ability to address these questions.</p>
<p>With these caveats in mind, prior studies using a mixture of computational and molecular approaches suggested that β-cell subpopulations are patterned by glucokinase, which is often referred to as the ‘glucose sensor’ for the β-cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. By phosphorylating glucose in the first step of glycolysis, glucokinase activation lengthens the active phase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations by committing more glucose carbons to glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Until recently, it was believed that downstream glycolysis was irrelevant to pulsatile insulin secretion. However, in conflict with this model, allosteric activation of pyruvate kinase accelerates Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and increases insulin secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. As a potential mechanistic explanation for these observations, plasma membrane-associated glycolytic enzymes, including glucokinase and pyruvate kinase, have been demonstrated to regulate K<sub>ATP</sub> channels via the ATP/ADP ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. However, it remains unknown whether these glycolytic enzymes influence β-cell heterogeneity and network activity.</p>
<p>To study single β-cell activity within intact islets, we engineered a 3D light-sheet microscope to simultaneously record the location and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of single β-cells over the entire islet during glucose-stimulated oscillations. In concert, we developed 3D analyses to investigate the spatial features of subpopulations that underlie the β-cell network and Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave, and the consistency of these features over time. We further examined the consequences of sampling islet heterogeneity in 2D compared to 3D. Finally, we investigated the role of the glycolytic enzymes glucokinase and pyruvate kinase in controlling β-cell subpopulations during glucose-stimulated oscillations.</p>

<title>Light-sheet microscopy enables high-speed 3D imaging of oscillations in single β-cells within intact islets</title>
<p>To acquire high-speed 3D time course imaging of β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations within intact islets, we utilized a lateral-interference tilted excitation light-sheet system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <italic>Methods</italic>). To image Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and spatially resolve individual β-cells in intact islets, islets were isolated from <italic>Ins1-Cre:Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>GCaMP6s/H2B-mCherry</italic></sup> mice that express cytosolic GCaMP6s Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensors and nuclear H2B-mCherry reporters selectively within β-cells. We first compared the images collected by the light-sheet system with a commercial spinning disk confocal using the same 40× water immersion objective. Similar to a widefield microscope, the axial resolution of the light-sheet microscope is dictated by the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens (∼1.1 μm for a 1.15 NA objective and GCaMP6s emission)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, whereas the spinning disk uses a pinhole array to enhance axial resolution. At a shallow depth of 24 µm from the coverslip, H2B-mCherry-labelled nuclei and GCaMP6s-labelled β-cells were resolved both by the light-sheet and the spinning disk confocal. However, the nuclei were only resolved by the light-sheet system at depths <italic>≥</italic> 60 μm due to the reduced light scatter from side illumination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Thus, the main advantage of the light-sheet system is the ability to image the entire islet in 3D (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Prior studies of β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations utilized 1 Hz imaging to resolve phase shifts for single β-cell traces within a single 2D plane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. To image the entire islet at similar acquisition speeds, the hardware was operated under triggering mode to minimize communication delays (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>). In this mode, the lasers and the piezo z-stage were triggered directly by the camera, which received a single set of instructions from the computer via the NiDAQ card. To image 132 µm into the islet at 2 Hz, 15 ms was allowed for photon collection and stage movement for each of the 4-µm z-steps. Initially, an hour-long delay was required to save 120,000 imaging files after running a continuous 30-minute experiment. Because this delay is only observed after the first 3 minutes of imaging, it was possible to eliminate the delay by separating the acquisition into a series of 3-minute loops (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Individual β-cell nuclei were located using the Spots function of Bitplane Imaris software (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). For each nucleus, a cellular region of interest (ROI) was defined by a sphere of radius 4.65 microns around the ROI center based on results from a computational automated radius detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The mean GCaMP6s intensity of each cell ROI for each time point were calculated and exported as single cell traces. We did not observe any significant photobleaching using continuous GCaMP6s and H2B-mCherry excitation over the course of the experiment. The combination of this light-sheet system, islet cell labeling, and analysis pipeline allows for imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from nearly all β-cells in the islet at speeds fast enough for spatio-temporal analyses to identify functionally heterogeneous β-cell subpopulations.</p>

<title>3D analyses of islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations reveal that the β-cell network is oriented radially while Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves begin and end on the islet periphery</title>
<p>To investigate the synchronization between β-cells across the islet in 3D space, we imaged and extracted Ca<sup>2+</sup> time-courses for <italic>Ins1-Cre:ROSA26</italic><sup><italic>GCaMP6s/H2B-mCherry</italic></sup> islets that exhibit slow oscillations. Following the network analysis methods set forth in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, we calculated the correlation coefficient between every cell pair and defined an “edge” between any cell pairs whose correlation coefficient was above threshold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This threshold was set such that the average number of edges per cell, also called the ‘cell degree’, was equal to 7. A fixed average degree rather than fixed threshold was used to mitigate inter-islet heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. An example 3D network for a single β-cell within an islet is shown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) along with the frequency distribution of all β-cells within the islet (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).

<p>Compared to average degree cells, the high degree cells were consistently located at the center of the islet while the low degree cells were located on the periphery, indicating that the islet network is oriented radially (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D,E</xref>).</p>
<p>To analyze the propagation and spatial orientation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave in 3D space, we calculated the lagged correlation coefficient between every β-cell and the islet average, and identified the phase lag with maximum correlation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). The spatial distribution of phases of an example islet is shown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), along with the frequency distribution of all β-cells within the islet (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). The early phase cells (top 10% of the total population that depolarize first and repolarize first, <italic>blue</italic>) and late phase cells (bottom 10% of the total population that depolarize last and repolarize last, <italic>red</italic>) were then mapped onto a 3D projection of the islet and onto the Ca<sup>2+</sup> time course (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). Unlike the islet network, for which the high degree cells emanate from the islet center (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D,E</xref>), the early phase and late phase cells were each located at the islet periphery, and show a clear temporal separation between depolarization and repolarization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I,J</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>The location of the β-cell network is stable over time while the wave progression varies</title>
<p>We next assessed the stability of high degree cells and early phase cells over time, by assessing their presence across consecutive oscillations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A,B</xref>; <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 3</xref>). The high degree cells and early phase cells have a similar ∼60% retention rate between oscillations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Strikingly, when we examined the center of gravity for each β-cell subpopulation, we found that the center of gravity of the early phase cells moved significantly more than that of the high degree cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). This indicates that the early phase cells tend to change their identity more with each oscillation. To further investigate the change in location of early phase cells, we used principal component analysis to identify the principal axis between early phase cells and late phase cells (wave axis) and calculated the rotation of the axis between each oscillation. Of the 25 islets examined, 57% show substantial changes in the wave axis over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Thus, β-cell depolarization is initiated at different locations within the islet over time, while the β-cell network location is relatively stable.</p>

<p>The analyses in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> are focused on the top and bottom 10% of the population. To understand the stability of all β-cells within the 3D network or the 3D wave propagation over time, we ranked every β-cell in the islet by their phase/degree (‘cellular consistency’), as well as the spatial proximity of every β-cell to the center of gravity of the top 10% of the subpopulation (‘regional consistency’) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We quantified the change in these distributions using a normalized non-parametric, information-theoretic metric termed Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (see <italic>Methods</italic>). If the ranking of high degree cell to low degree cell (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., A &gt; B &gt; C) for the first oscillation remains the same in the second oscillation, the KL divergence will be 0, indicating the cell ranking is completely predictable between oscillations. Alternatively, if the cell ranking changes between oscillations (A &gt; C &gt; B), the KL divergence will be 1, indicating the cell ranking is completely random (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). When examining the consistency of the network, the regional stability was much higher than the cellular stability over time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).

<p>Since biochemically distinct processes occur during the silent phase (i.e., the electrically-silent period when K<sub>ATP</sub> channels close and Ca<sup>2+</sup> remains low) and the active phase (i.e., the electrically-active period Ca<sup>2+</sup> is elevated and secretion occurs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, we quantified the duration of each phase along with the oscillation period and duty cycle (the ratio of active phase to full cycle) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). In the presence of vehicle control (0.1% DMSO), the Ca<sup>2+</sup> duty cycle remained stable, although an outlier in the control group resulted in a small decrease in the silent phase duration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). In 3 of 15 islets, GKa induced a Ca<sup>2+</sup> plateau (duty cycle = 1.0); out of necessity these islets were removed from the oscillation analysis. In the majority of islets, GKa increased the oscillation period and duty cycle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). The duty cycle increase was driven by an increase in the active phase duration, with no impact on the silent phase, the time when K<sub>ATP</sub> channels close (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). In contrast with activation of glucokinase, PKa increased the oscillation frequency by reducing the silent phase duration and the active phase duration in equal proportions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). The absence of any PKa effect on the duty cycle is expected since fuel input is controlled by glucokinase, whereas silent phase shortening is expected based on the ability of PKa to reduce the time required to close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and depolarize the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, a single cell 3D analysis of β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation upon GKa and PKa stimulation provides similar conclusions to prior 2D studies of intact islets.</p>
<p>Previous 2D studies have found metabolic differences along the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave, as measured by NAD(P)H fluorescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. We measured the 3D position of early or late phase cells in response to glucokinase or pyruvate kinase activation. A positional analysis showed that GKa strongly reinforced the islet region corresponding to early phase and late phase cells, while vehicle and PKa had no discernable effect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). The KL divergence for wave propagation was correspondingly reduced by GKa (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>), indicating increased consistency, and the wave axis was significantly stabilized by GKa (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Again, PKa had no discernable effect on the KL divergence for wave propagation or wave axis stability, a likely indication that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave origin is primarily, if not exclusively, controlled by glucokinase patterning.</p>

<p>As a second approach, we examined the percentage of early phase or late phase cells maintained following activation of glucokinase or pyruvate kinase. Early phase cells were maintained to a greater degree upon GKa application, indicating greater consistency, but again showed no change upon vehicle or PKa application (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Late phase cells showed no difference in their maintenance upon any of the treatments (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>), suggesting that the earliest phase cells drive the consistency of the wave propagation.</p>
<p>While metabolic differences have been suggested to underlie functional heterogeneity in the β-cell network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, we observed no changes in the consistency of the islet network upon either GKa or PKa application (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Suppl.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we used light-sheet microscopy of single mouse islets to provide a three-dimensional analysis of the β-cell subpopulations that initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and coordinate the islet network. While this <italic>ex vivo</italic> approach might not precisely mimic the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, our analyses show that 3D imaging is a more robust approach than 2D imaging, which does not accurately reflect heterogeneity and subpopulation consistency over the entire islet. Reinforcing the concept of distinct β-cell subpopulations, the most highly synchronized cells are located at the center of the islet, while those β-cells that control the initiation and termination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves (‘leaders’) were located on the islet periphery. We further observed that different regions of the islet initiate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave over time, challenging the view that leader cells are a fixed pacemaker population of cells defined by their biochemistry. As discussed below, technical advances in image capture and analysis provide several new insights into the features of β-cell subpopulation in 3D and illustrate how glycolytic enzymes influence the system.</p>
<p>Given that single-cell methods for assaying insulin secretory oscillations are not yet available, β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging has become an indispensable approach for understanding pulsatility. When studied by light-sheet imaging, islets exhibited similar ∼3-5-minute oscillations as <italic>in vivo</italic> 2-photon imaging of β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in live mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, as well as the high-speed confocal imaging used in prior <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Light-sheet imaging overcomes the speed and depth limitations, respectively, that prevent these approaches from single-cell analysis of the intact islet. Relative to spinning disk confocal, penetration depth increased &gt;2-fold with the light-sheet microscope (from 50-60 to 130-150 μm), allowing small and medium-sized islets to be imaged <italic>in toto</italic>. Abandoning confocal pinholes improved light collection, and therefore acquisition speed, ∼3-fold; this is an underestimate given the 0.4 e<sup>-</sup> read noise cameras on the spinning disk microscope versus 1.6 e<sup>-</sup> read noise cameras on the light-sheet microscope. The ∼1.1 μm axial resolution of the light-sheet, while lower than spinning disk confocal, was easily sufficient for Nyquist sampling of 5-6 μm nuclei used to identify each β-cell in 3D space (β-cells themselves are 12-18 μm). Together these features allowed sampling the islet at &gt;2 Hz, although future studies could be improved by employing a higher numerical aperture objective and/or a camera with lower read noise and higher quantum efficiency.</p>
<p>Phase and functional network analyses were used to understand the behavior of β-cell subpopulations and how they communicate. Importantly, in past heterogeneity studies, phase and network calculations were assessed over the entire time course<sup>10,15,26,35,36</sup>. Here, we assessed over individual oscillations to compare subpopulation stability over time. One population of cells are those which we termed ‘early phase cells’ and lead the propagating Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave. These have also been referred to as ‘leader cells’ or ‘pacemaker cells’ and regulate the oscillatory dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. To our surprise, the early phase cells (i.e. the leader cells) were not consistent over time. The late phase cells, located on the opposite end of the islet, showed a similar shift, with over half of the islets showing changes in the wave axis between the first cells to depolarize and the first to repolarize. Laser ablation or optogenetic inactivation of these early phase cells would be predicted to have little impact on islet function, as suggested previously by electrophysiological studies in which surface β-cells have been voltage-clamped with no impact on β-cell oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Studies have sought to define whether β-cell intrinsic or extrinsic factors are determining the oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Because of the shift in Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave axis between consecutive oscillations, we conclude that β-cell depolarization is dominated by stochastic properties rather than a pre-determined genetic or metabolic profile. Previous experimental and modeling studies have suggested that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave origin corresponds to the glucokinase activity gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Consistent with this prediction, pharmacologic activation of glucokinase reinforced the islet region of early phase cells and reduced the wave axis change. Pyruvate kinase activation, despite increasing oscillation frequency, had no effect on leader cells, indicating the wave origin is patterned by fuel input. Importantly, there is no evidence that the glucokinase gradient is the result of intentional spatial organization. Rather, in computational studies the glucokinase gradient emerges stochastically due to randomly placed high and low glucokinase-expressing cells, with multiple competing glucokinase gradients determining the degree of wave axis rotation. Our findings suggest that when glucokinase is activated, the strongest gradient is amplified, which is why the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave axis is now reinforced. Another compelling hypothesis for stochastic behavior, which is not mutually exclusive, is the heterogenous nutrient response of neighboring α-cells, which influence the excitability of neighboring β-cells via GPCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The preponderance of α-cells on the periphery of mouse islets, which influence β-cell oscillation frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, would be expected to disrupt β-cell synchronization on the periphery and stabilize it in the islet center – which is precisely the pattern of network activity we observed.</p>
<p>Functional network studies in the islet revealed a heterogeneity in β-cell functional connections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. A small subpopulation of β-cells, termed ‘hub’ cells, was found to have the highest synchronization to other cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Optogenetic silencing of hub cells was found to disrupt network activity within that plane, however it should be noted that hub cells are defined as the most highly coordinated cells within a randomly selected plane of the islet. Debates exist over whether the hub cells can maintain electrical control over the whole islet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Because our study investigated the 3D β-cell functional network over individual oscillations, our top 10% of highly coordinated cells are not the exact same population as hub cells defined in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, however the subpopulations likely overlap. In contrast with leader cells, we found that the highly synchronized cells are both spatially and temporally stable. However, in conflict with the description of hub cells as intermingled with other cells throughout the islet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, the location of such cells in 3D space is close to the center. This observation could be explained by the peripheral location of α-cells as discussed above for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave behavior.</p>
<p>Previous studies indicated that the intrinsic metabolic activity and thus oscillation profile may play a larger role in driving their high synchronization than the strength of gap junction coupling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. This included experimental 2D measurements but also computational 3D measurements. Nevertheless, we demonstrated here that perturbing glucokinase or pyruvate kinase had little effect on the consistency of the high degree or low degree cells within the 3D network. We further observed that the β-cell network was more regionally consistent than cellularly consistent, indicating a tendency for nearby cells within the islet center to ‘take over’ as high degree cells. The mechanisms underlying this are unclear. One explanation may be that paracrine communication within the islet determines which region of cells will show high or low degree. For example, more peripheral cells that are in contact with nearby δ-cells may show some suppression in their Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and thus reduced synchronization. Alternatively, more peripheral cells may show increased stochastic behavior that reduces their relative synchronization. Modulating α/δ-cell inputs to the β-cell in combination with 3D islet imaging will be important to test this in the future. Our study emphasizes that 3D studies are critical to fully assess the consistency and spatial organization of the β-cell network.</p>

The KL-divergence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> (<italic>DD</italic><sub><italic>KL</italic></sub><italic>)</italic> was defined by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation (1)</xref>, where <italic>n</italic> is the index of each cell, and <italic>i, j</italic> are indices for each oscillation.
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="608680v3_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
To compare across islets of differences sizes, we normalized the KL divergence by the maximum KL divergence for each islet identified by shuffling the distribution and calculating KL divergence 100 times.</p>

<title>Comparison of 2D and 3D analyses</title>
<p>Quarter- and half-depth 2D planes were selected from each the 3D islet. Cells were included in the 2D plane if their location on the z-axis was within 3 μm of the plane.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using GraphPad PRISM 9.0 software. Significance was tested using non-parametric Student’s two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests or one-way ANOVA as indicated. <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant and errors signify ±SEM.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for functional subpopulations of β-cells responsible for Ca2+ signal initiation and maintenance using novel three-dimensional light sheet microscopy imaging and analysis of pancreatic islets. The findings are <bold>important</bold> as they help decode the mechanistic underpinnings of islet calcium oscillations and the resulting pulsatile insulin secretion. The work will be of general interest to cell biologists and of particular interest to islet biologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Jin, Briggs, and colleagues use light sheet imaging to reconstruct the islet three-dimensional Ca2+ network. The authors find that early/late responding (leader) cells are dynamic over time, and located at the islet periphery. By contrast, highly connected or hub cells are stable and located toward the islet center. Suggesting that the two subpopulations are differentially regulated by fuel input, glucokinase activation only influences leader cell phenotype, whereas hubs remain stable.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The studies are novel in providing the first three-dimensional snapshot of the beta cell functional network, as well as determining the localization of some of the different subpopulations identified to date. The studies also provide some consensus as to the origin, stability, and role of such subpopulations in islet function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Experiments with metabolic enzyme activators do not take into account the influence of cell viability on the observed Ca2+ network data. Limitations of the imaging approach used need to be recognized and evaluated/discussed.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Erli Jin, Jennifer Briggs et al. utilizes light sheet microscopy to image islet beta cell calcium oscillations in 3D and determine where beta cell populations are located that begin and coordinate glucose-stimulated calcium oscillations. The light sheet technique allowed clear 3D mapping of beta cell calcium responses to glucose, glucokinase activation, and pyruvate kinase activation. The manuscript finds that synchronized beta-cells are found at the islet center, that leader beta cells showing the first calcium responses are located on the islet periphery, that glucokinase activation helped maintain beta cells that lead calcium responses, and that pyruvate kinase activation primarily increases islet calcium oscillation frequency. The study is well-designed, contains a significant amount of high-quality data, and the conclusions are largely supported by the results.</p>
<p>It has recently been shown that beta cells within islets containing intact vasculature (such as those in a pancreatic slice) show different calcium responses compared to isolated islets (such as that shown in PMID: 35559734). It would be important to include some discussion about the potential in vitro artifacts in calcium that arise following islet isolation (this could be included in the discussion about the limitations of the study).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Jin, Briggs et al. made use of light-sheet 3D imaging and data analysis to assess the collective network activity in isolated mouse islets. The major advantage of using whole islet imaging, despite compromising on the speed of acquisition, is that it provides a complete description of the network, while 2D networks are only an approximation of the islet network. In static-incubation conditions, excluding the effects of perfusion, they assessed two subpopulations of beta cells and their spatial consistency and metabolic dependence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors confirmed that coordinated Ca2+ oscillations are important for glycemic control. In addition, they definitively disproved the role of individual privileged cells, which were suggested to lead or coordinate Ca²⁺ oscillations. They provided evidence for differential regional stability, confirming the previously described stochastic nature of the beta cells that act as strongly connected hubs as well as beta cells in initiating regions (doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.168101).</p>
<p>The fact that islet cores contain beta cells that are more active and more coordinated has also been readily observed in high-frequency 2D recordings (e.g. DOI: 10.2337/db22-0952), suggesting that the high-speed capture of fast activity can partially compensate for incomplete topological information.</p>
<p>They also found an increased metabolic sensitivity of mantle regions of an islet with a subpopulation of beta cells with a high probability of leading the islet activity which can be entrained by fuel input. They discuss a potential role of alpha/delta cell interaction, however relative lack of beta cells in the islet border region could also be a factor contributing to less connectivity and higher excitability.</p>
<p>The Methods section contains a useful series of direct instructions on how to approach fast 3D imaging with currently available hardware and software.</p>
<p>The Discussion is clear and includes most of the issues regarding the interpretation of the presented results.</p>
<p>Some issues concerning inconsistencies between data presented and statements made as well as statistical analysis need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Taken together it is a strong technical paper to demonstrate the stochasticity regarding the functions subpopulations of beta cells in the islets may have and how less well-resolved approaches (both missing spatial resolution as well as missing temporal resolution) led us to jump to unjustified conclusions regarding the fixed roles of individual beta cells within an islet.</p>
