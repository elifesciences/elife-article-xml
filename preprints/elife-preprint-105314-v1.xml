<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Lipoproteins are essential for lipid transport in all bilaterians. A single Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) molecule is the inseparable structural scaffold of each ApoB-containing lipoprotein (B-lps), which are responsible for transporting lipids to peripheral tissues. The cellular mechanisms that regulate ApoB and B-lp production, secretion, transport, and degradation remain to be fully defined. In humans, elevated levels of vascular B-lps play a causative role in cardiovascular disease. Previously, we have detailed that human B-lp biology is remarkably conserved in the zebrafish using an <italic>in vivo</italic> chemiluminescent reporter of ApoB (LipoGlo) that does not disrupt ApoB function. Thus, the LipoGlo model is an ideal system for identifying novel mechanisms of ApoB modulation and, due to the ability of zebrafish to generate many progeny, is particularly amenable to large-scale phenotypic drug screening. Here, we report a screen of roughly 3000 compounds that identified 49 unique ApoB-lowering hits. Nineteen hits passed orthogonal screening criteria. A licorice root component, enoxolone, significantly lowered B-lps only in animals that express a functional allele of the nuclear hormone receptor Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4⍺ (HNF4⍺). Consistent with this result, inhibitors of HNF4⍺ also reduce B-lp levels. These data demonstrate that mechanism(s) of action can be rapidly determined from a whole animal zebrafish phenotypic screen. Given the well documented role of HNF4⍺ in human B-lp biology, these data validate the LipoGlo screening platform for identifying small molecule modulators of B-lps that play a critical role in a leading cause of worldwide mortality.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lipoproteins are critical particles that transport lipids in the aqueous plasma of animals and profoundly impact human physiology and disease. One subset of lipoproteins, the (ApoB)-containing lipoproteins (B-lps), transport lipids from sites of absorption and synthesis (e.g., intestine and liver) through the bloodstream to peripheral tissues. Excess serum B-lps are a well-established causative factor in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] and are associated with elevated risk for insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. CVD encompasses heart failure, stroke, and heart-related abnormalities and accounts for ∼1 million lost lives in the US every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. In cells that synthesize B-lps, each particle is formed by the transfer of lipids to a single ApoB molecule via the activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) at the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Since each B-lp contains only one ApoB molecule, the total ApoB level is directly proportional to the number of B-lps. Despite a rich literature on the factors that regulate MTP, ApoB, and B-lp levels, many mechanisms that modulate B-lp production, secretion, transport, uptake, and turnover remain unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Clinically, several effective therapies are currently used to reduce circulating B-lps in individuals with hyperlipidemia or CVD. Statins directly inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis, ultimately promoting hepatic uptake of cholesterol rich circulating B-lps reducing the atherogenic potential of excess B-lps (LDL) in circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. However, statins can also cause side effects, with the most severe being autoimmune myopathy and rhabdomyolysis and, more rarely, stroke, liver disease, and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Statin therapy is often used in conjunction with the intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. However, ezetimibe is rarely used as a monotherapy due to its relatively modest effect on serum B-lps. Moreover, some individuals do not respond to statin-based therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. One recently approved compound, Bempedoic acid, inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis similar to statins and demonstrates a B-lp lowering effect among statin-intolerant individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. However, long-term studies of bempedoic acid are ongoing. These compounds effectively reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, but often, patients on these compounds still die of CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>One strategy to reduce B-lp levels is through a small molecule inhibitor of MTP activity (e.g., lomitapide) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. While lomitapide effectively reduces B-lp levels, its use is associated with adverse side effects, including hepatic steatosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress, eventually causing hepatic fibrosis, and increased intestinal triglyceride accumulation, leading to elevated fecal lipids and gastrointestinal symptoms. Due to these severe side effects, lomitapide is prescribed mainly to individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia, which is characterized by elevated plasma B-lps and cholesterol from birth. Mipomersen, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting ApoB, reduces B-lps synthesis but is associated with severe hepatotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. A newer therapeutic strategy to reduce circulating B-lps is to block the activity of PCSK9 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9). PCSK9 promotes low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor (LDLR) degradation by blocking the recycling of this receptor back to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Thus, PCSK9 inhibitors promote liver LDLR recycling and increase B-lp uptake. Current PCSK9 therapies are monoclonal antibody-based and must be injected every several weeks, feature some adverse effects in patients, and are costly. Small molecule inhibitors and other approaches that target PCSK9 are currently in development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite an array of treatment options for hyperlipidemia, CVD is still the leading cause of death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Moreover, the strategies mentioned above are rarely effective in reducing another ApoB-containing lipoprotein, Lipoprotein(a), affecting approximately ∼20% of individuals in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. This largely genetic risk factor increases the chance of a sudden heart attack or stroke by 2 to 4 fold. Taken together, there remains a pressing need for new strategies that reduce circulating B-lps.</p>
<p>One factor that makes identifying B-lp-reducing compounds difficult is the challenge of replicating the multiple cell types and multiorgan physiology that are known to impact plasma levels of B-lps in a simple, easy-to-screen cell culture system. This issue is circumvented by using an intact whole vertebrate, though this is difficult with mammalian models due to cost and scale. We previously established the larval zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) as an excellent model for ApoB biology in that most of the genes known to regulate human B-lp synthesis and metabolism are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. This includes the gene that encodes cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a central regulator of human lipoprotein homeostasis that is deficient in mouse and rat models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Thus, the zebrafish plasma lipid profile is more similar to humans than many rodent models in that the bulk of plasma cholesterol is carried in B-lps (as opposed to ApoA1-containing lipoproteins like HDL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. To study ApoB biology in fish, we generated a reporter of B-lps called LipoGlo, where NanoLuciferase (NL) was fused to the gene that encodes nearly all ApoB protein in the zebrafish, <italic>apoBb.1</italic>, at its endogenous locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. This fusion does not disrupt normal B-lp biology. Since each B-lp is associated with a single ApoB molecule, the luminescence generated by LipoGlo-expressing animals is directly proportional to the total number of B-lps.</p>
<p>Another major advantage of the larval zebrafish model system is that during early development, zebrafish do not ingest food, and B-lps transport lipids from the nutrient-dense maternally deposited yolk to peripheral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Thus, any variability in B-lp levels due to the amount and type of food consumed is eliminated in early zebrafish development. Moreover, the zebrafish has developed all major digestive organs by five days post fertilization (dpf), a period where growth is not dependent on exogenous feeding. The larval zebrafish is also quite small (∼5 mm in length), making it amenable to large-scale robotic screening, and several drugs from zebrafish screens are currently in clinical development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Using these unique attributes of zebrafish larvae, we performed a whole-animal phenotypic drug screen to identify chemical modulators of B-lps. We screened a library of ∼3000 compounds and identified 49 unique compounds that lowered B-lp in larval zebrafish and validated 19 as lead compounds that are the basis of ongoing studies. One lead compound, enoxlone, has many reported potential activities that includes inhibition of Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4⍺ (HNF4⍺), an established transcriptional regulator of lipoprotein metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. We report that known HNF4⍺ inhibitors reduce B-lp levels to levels equivalent to genetic depletion of HNF4⍺ in larval zebrafish. Further, HNF4⍺ expression is required for enoxolone to exert its B-lp lowering effect in the fish. The finding that enoxolone suppresses B-lps in the zebrafish through modulation of HNF4⍺ demonstrates the remarkable conservation of B-lp metabolism in the zebrafish system and supports our phenotypic drug screening paradigm.</p>

<title>A whole-animal drug screen to identify B-lp-reducing compounds</title>
<p>Using the previously characterized B-lp zebrafish reporter line, LipoGlo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], we undertook a small-molecule screen to identify B-lp modulating compounds <italic>in vivo</italic>. The screen design was guided by the normal developmental profile of B-lp metabolism in the zebrafish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. The embryonic zebrafish begins to mobilize lipids stored within the yolk and starts to secrete B-lps from 1 to 3 dpf. After 4 dpf, as yolk lipids are depleted, B-lp numbers concomitantly decrease (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). During embryonic and larval stages that are yolk-dependent (lecithotrophic period), zebrafish do not require feeding, reducing the variability introduced by the amount and type of food consumed when experiments are performed at stages after the yolk is depleted. Thus, we developed an automated screening platform where animals are treated at 3 dpf for 48 h with test compounds, and then at 5 dpf they are fixed and assayed for whole-animal luminescence as a readout for total B-lp level. Animals treated on 3 dpf with lomitapide, an MTP inhibitor, for 48 hours typically exhibited a &gt;50% reduction in B-lp levels making it a strong positive control for a drug screen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>

<p>One established drug screening approach is a repositioning strategy, which identifies whether any approved or investigational drugs have new or unintended advantageous biological effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. This approach has identified new indications for numerous drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Drug repositioning screens are advantageous over novel screening as they feature a lower risk of failure, reduced time frame to development, and reduced cost (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]).</p>
<p>To accomplish such a large-scale effort, we utilized the ARQiv-HTS platform (Automated Reporter Quantification <italic>in vivo</italic> coupled to High-Throughput Screening robotics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] to array and dilute drugs from the Johns Hopkins Discovery Library (JHDL) in a 4-point serial dilution (8 µM, 4 µM, 2 µM, and 1 µM), in addition to positive (5 µM lomitapide) and negative (vehicle) controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The JHDL comprises roughly 3000 compounds – many of which have known mechanisms of action and are approved for human use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>]. Each treatment condition included 8 independent replicates, a number selected based on the typical variation observed in the B-lp assay observed in prior experiments and power calculations. LipoGlo-expressing larvae (3 dpf) were dispensed into their respective drug treatment and reared for 48 hours at 27°C on a 14:10 h light:dark cycle. Previously, we have characterized whole-animal B-lp levels from whole-animal homogenates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. However, in order to simplify the screening process, we turned to fixing whole animals in place before measuring total luminescence. At 5 dpf, animals were briefly fixed with paraformaldehyde, incubated in NanoLuciferase substrate, and B-lp levels were measured with a plate reader (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>We measured the effect of drug treatments across 1381 96-well plates, each plate containing negative controls, positive controls, and a serial dilution of two independent drugs (2762 total compounds) from the JHDL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To provide insight into our B-lp screen sensitivity in relation to effect size we quantified the effect of the positive control (5 µM lomitapide) treatment across all 1381 plates. On average, lomitapide produced 55.6% ± 23.2% reduction in B-lp levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with our prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. We then rank-ordered the fold change of B-lp levels for each 96-well plate following lomitapide treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The rank-ordered list of fold change further confirms that lomitapide reduces B-lps across many samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, values &lt; 0 and below solid black line), but there is a modest level of plate-to-plate variation. Thus, we defined compounds that reduce B-lps as those compounds with a fold change of &lt; −1.5 (log<sub>2</sub> scale; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, dashed line). Interestingly, we find that the inflection of rank-ordered fold change is −1.33 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, solid blue line) and likely represents a more specific hit-defining cutoff for this dataset.</p>
<p>We then set out to deploy a statistical measure to help us define a hit. In numerous prior high-throughput screens with many replicates per group, the Strictly Standardized Mean Difference (SSMD) was an ideal statistical measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. SSMD estimates the fold change penalized by the variability of that fold change and is robust to variation and outliers in screens. We calculated the SSMD for lomitapide treatment from each plate. We confirmed a reduction in B-lp levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, values &lt; 0 and below solid black line) with an average SSMD of −1.76 (n = 1381), which is considered “fairly strong” by the developers of this metric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Prior research uses an SSMD of 1.0 as a cutoff to define the significance threshold of a hit. Thus, we defined compounds that reduce B-lps as those compounds with an SSMD of &lt; −1.0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, dashed line). Interestingly, we determined that the inflection of rank-ordered SSMD scores for lomitapide treatments is −1.41 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, solid blue line), which likely represents a more specific hit-defining cutoff for this dataset. Ultimately, the robust reduction of B-lps following 5 µM lomitapide treatment on a large scale demonstrates proof of concept for a large scale drug screen to identify pharmacological agents that modulate ApoB levels in a whole animal.</p>
<p>We then quantified SSMD of each dose of each drug treatment to determine the overall effect size of that drug treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) and identified 487 unique drugs that lower B-lp levels with an SSMD cutoff of &lt; −1.0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). While the SSMD score is typically very robust, it is sensitive to weak effects with low variation, so biological effect size was also considered when calling screen hits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. We assessed the SSMD score and fold change of each drug dose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Taken together, we classified hits as those drugs with an SSMD &lt; −1 and fold change of &lt; −1.5 (log<sub>2</sub> scale), in line with cutoffs previously defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Using these cutoffs, we identified 50 (49 unique as fendiline was tested twice) B-lp-reducing compounds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Supplemental Table 1, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). However, as noted above, we identified the inflection of rank-ordered fold change values and SSMD scores across 1381 positive control experiments as −1.33 and −1.41, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Using the new hit cutoffs, there are minor changes in the profile of hit compounds; calcipotriene and diphenlylboric acid are no longer hits, and twelve compounds (2-phenpropylamino-5-nitrobenzoic acid, cetalkonium chloride, clioquinol, clomipramine, dioctylnitrosamine, docusate sodium, gliclazide, guaiacwood, quipazine maleate, rose bengal, sodium anthraquinone, and vitamin K1) are classified as hits. These 12 new hits are the subject of ongoing studies not presented here.</p>

<title>Validating the B-lp lowering effects of 49 unique hits</title>
<p>We identified 49 unique compounds with SSMD &lt; −1 and fold change of &lt; −1.5 (log<sub>2</sub> scale) and aimed to validate the B-lp lowering effects of each of these hits. Drug screening libraries are typically prepared in batches and stored for long periods of time. Thus, validating the effect of a fresh batch of each hit identified from a drug screen is essential. Of our 49 unique hits, one compound could not be identified (Supplemental Table 1, Drug 1), and 11 have yet to be obtained and/or validated (Supplemental Table 1). The remaining 37 hit compounds were purchased from commercial suppliers (Supplemental Table 1) and LipoGlo-expressing animals were treated with each compound using an 8-fold serial dilution with between 1 and 3 biological replicates, each with 8 technical replicates (Supplemental Table 1, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Gentian violet caused lethality at all doses tested (Supplemental Table 1 and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). Thirteen more compounds, acetaminophen, cytidine 5’-monophosphate, fenbendazole, ferron, hydroxyurea, ketoprofen, medroxyprogesterone acetate, maleic acid, NADIDE, piperacillin sodium, prochlorperazine dimaleate, ricobendazole, and strophanthin K failed to show any effect on B-lp levels (Supplemental Table 1 and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). Surprisingly, two compounds, sulconazole (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2AE</xref>) and thonzonium bromide (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2AH</xref>), caused an increase in B-lps levels (Supplemental Table 1). Notably, 21 compounds, 3-methylcholanthrene, cetrimonium bromide, cyproterone, calcipotriene, danazol, danthron, demarcarium bromide, doxycycline, emodin, enoxolone, fendiline, nabumetone, pergolide mesylate, pimethixene maleate, pomiferin, reserpine, riboflavin tetrabutyrate, triptonide, thiethylperazine malate, and verteporfin each significantly reduced B-lps at ≥1 dose examined, thus validating the primary screen effect (Supplemental Table 1 and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>While these hits reduce B-lp levels as measured by luminescence generated by the LipoGlo reporter, it is unclear whether this is due to a reduction of B-lps or if a hit interferes with the enzymatic activity of NanoLuciferase. To determine if a hit was a luciferase inhibitor, we generated a tissue homogenate from untreated 3 dpf LipoGlo expressing animals and briefly incubated aliquots of homogenate with vehicle or a dose series of each hit. Only verteporfin showed a dose-dependent decrease in luminescence activity, indicating it is a NanoLuciferase inhibitor and likely does not affect B-lp levels (Supplemental Table 1 and data not shown). Ultimately, our screening efforts identified 19 compounds that reduce B-lp levels through unknown mechanisms (Supplemental Table 1).</p>
<p>We classified these remaining hits according to their Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. We found amines (cetrimonium bromide, demarcarium bromide, and fendiline), biological pigments (riboflavin tetrabutyrate), heterocyclic compounds (pergolide mesylate, pomiferin, and reserpine), hormones, hormone substitutes, and hormone antagonists (cyproterone and danazol), hydrocarbons (3-methylcholanthrene, doxycycline, enoxolone, and triptonide), ketones (nabumetone), micronutrients (calcipotriene), quinones (danthron and emodin), and sulfur compounds (pimethixene maleate and thiethylperazine malate).</p>

<title>Enoxolone significantly reduces B-lps in the larval zebrafish</title>
<p>One hit of significant interest is the compound enoxolone, also known as 18β-Glycyrrhetinic acid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Supplemental Table 1, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1T</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2L</xref>). Enoxolone is a triterpenoid derived from licorice root (<italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Evidence suggests that enoxolone perturbs several biological pathways and has reported anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-viral, and antimicrobial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Further, several studies suggest enoxolone can modulate lipid metabolism, although the mechanism mediating these effects was poorly described or lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. For example, recent studies demonstrate that enoxolone treatment can ameliorate diet-induced hyperlipidemia, rescuing the effects of a high-fat diet on plasma lipoproteins and lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Consistent with this finding, we observed a significant reduction in B-lp levels following enoxolone treatment with two different experimental endpoints. First, we validated our primary screen assay and found a significant reduction in B-lp levels following 8 µM, 4 µM, 2 µM, 1 µM, 0.5 µM, and 0.0625 µM enoxolone treatments from whole fixed animals compared to vehicle treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Our lab previously defined the method to measure total B-lp levels from whole-animals by using the homogenate of a single zebrafish larva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. We confirmed that 8 µM enoxolone treatment significantly reduced total B-lp levels measured from homogenates collected from whole animals after treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Given that we assay B-lp levels by measuring NanoLuciferase activity, it was necessary to confirm that enoxolone specifically reduces B-lp levels and does not directly inhibit NanoLuciferase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>Immersing a live, developing animal in a compound has the potential to profoundly alter overall tissue development that could secondarily result in attenuating B-lp levels. To address this concern, we examined the effect of enoxolone on overall gross larval morphology. Animals treated with 8 µM enoxolone are shorter than vehicle-treated animals, lack inflated swim bladders, and have mild cardiac edema (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). However, the noted phenotypes are absent from 4 µM enoxolone treated animals, which appear strikingly similar to vehicle-treated animals. Treatment of larvae with 5 µM lomitapide (the positive control compound in our screen), a potent inhibitor of the lipid transfer activity of MTP, results in short animals and an observable phenotype that we have termed the ‘dark yolk’ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). Typically, MTP protein in the yolk syncytium is responsible for packaging lipids from the yolk into B-lps destined for circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. When MTP activity is disrupted, yolk lipids are not secreted in B-lps and instead are stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets within the yolk syncytium. These lipid droplets increase the opacity of the yolk, causing it to darken under transmitted light (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Notably, enoxolone does not cause a dark yolk phenotype.</p>
<p>A key feature of B-lps is their size, often a proxy for the total amount of lipid in the particle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Particle size can impact the particle’s lifetime (e.g. in metabolically healthy humans, small particles are cleared rapidly by the liver) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Thus, we also assessed whether enoxolone alters B-lp size distribution. Animals were treated for 48 h with vehicle, 8 µM enoxolone, or 5 µM lomitapide, and whole-animal homogenates were prepared and subjected to native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by chemiluminescent imaging. B-lps were classified into four classes based on gel migration: zero mobility (ZM), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. As expected, lomitapide treatment effectively reduces VLDL particles and increases LDL particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, while enoxolone treatment reduces total B-lps (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>), there are no overt changes in B-lp size distribution compared to vehicle-treated animals other than a slight increase in the zero mobility (ZM) fraction which contains very large particles and/or tissue aggregates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

<title>Pharmacological inhibitors of HNF4⍺ reduce B-lp levels in the larval zebrafish</title>
<p>Enoxolone effectively lowers B-lp levels in larval zebrafish and appears to do so in a mechanism unlike that of lomitapide (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Recent work has suggested that enoxolone may directly bind and inhibit the transcription factor HNF4⍺, contributing to changes in plasma lipids in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. To test if HNF4⍺ mediates the effect of enoxolone, we first evaluated whether pharmacological inhibition of HNF4⍺ alters B-lp levels. BIM5078 was recently defined as a novel and selective HNF4⍺ antagonist and was chemically modified to improve bioavailability (BI6015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. Treatment (48 h) of animals (3 dpf) with 8 µM BI6015 reduced LipoGlo levels in fixed animals compared to their respective vehicle controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Total luminescence from whole-animal homogenates collected after treatment was also reduced following BIM5078 (8 µM, 4 µM, 1 µM, 0.5 µM, 0.25 µM, 0.125 µM, and 0.0625 µM) and BI6015 (8 µM, 4 µM, 2 µM, 1 µM, and 0.125 µM) treatments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, neither BIM5078 nor BI6015 directly inhibit NanoLuciferase’s enzymatic activity (8 µM, 4 µM, and 0.05 µM; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). We also assessed each compound’s effect on B-lp size distribution. Besides a small but significant increase in VLDL particles caused by BIM5078 treatment, BIM5078 and BI6015 do not cause any significant overall changes in B-lp size distributions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

<title>HNF4⍺ is required for normal B-lp levels in the larval zebrafish</title>

In wild-type animals, the levels of B-lps rise as the animal utilizes the lipids found within the maternally deposited yolk (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. As the yolk lipids are depleted, there is a concurrent decrease in total B-lp levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We found that homozygous animals have reduced B-lp levels at 1, 2, 3, and 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Further, we observed a minor but significant reduction of B-lp levels at 4 dpf in heterozygous animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). By 5 dpf when yolk lipids are largely depleted, wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous animals have similar B-lp levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Thus, HNF4⍺ expression is required for proper B-lp production.</p>

<p>To further characterize how enoxolone treatment modulates B-lp levels, we took an unbiased approach to identify the transcriptional changes following enoxolone treatment. We treated LipoGlo expressing animals with 8 µM enoxolone or vehicle for 4, 8, 12, 16, or 24 hours. Following each treatment duration, we collected total RNA from whole animals for differential expression analysis using RNAseq. After 4 and 8 hours of enoxolone treatment, 39 and 34 genes were differentially expressed, respectively, with most genes upregulated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Following 12, 16, and 24 hours of treatment, we identified 57, 118, and 402 differentially expressed genes, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

<title>Enoxolone treatment causes changes in expression patterns similar to HNF4⍺ knockout</title>
<p>The roles of HNF4⍺ in larval zebrafish development have recently been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. HNF4⍺ loss is viable in the fish, likely due to partially redundant function with HNF4β and HNF4Ɣ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Interestingly, the transcriptional targets of HNF4⍺, HNF4β, and HNF4Ɣ only partially overlap, indicating that each transcription factor has specific and non-specific molecular targets. Thus, we hypothesized that if the molecular target of enoxolone is HNF4⍺, then enoxolone treatment would phenocopy the effect of HNF4⍺ knockout. We compared the differentially expressed genes following 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hours after enoxolone treatment to the subset of differentially expressed genes identified from intestines extracted from 6 dpf HNF4⍺ homozygous (relative to <italic>wild-type</italic> controls) animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Currently, the only known means to improve the outcomes of hyperlipidemia and reduce the risk of CVD-associated mortality is to reduce circulating levels of B-lps. The two major strategies for reducing B-lp levels are blocking B-lp synthesis (e.g., lomitapide and mipomersen) or promoting circulating B-lp uptake (e.g., statins, bempedoic acid, and PCSK9 targeting therapies). Continual statin use for more than 1 year reduced circulating B-lps and all-cause mortality by ∼30% in individuals with high B-lp levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. However, that still leaves significant mortality in people taking statins. While newer alternatives to statins are effective at reducing B-lp levels, they are costly and feature some undesirable off-target effects, limiting their use to the most severe forms of dyslipidemia, and their long-term outcomes have yet to be fully determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Thus, there is still a need to identify new mechanisms for reducing B-lps, thereby improving CVD therapeutics.</p>
<p>Recent work from our lab identified a new hypomorphic allele of MTP, reducing the lipid transfer activity of triglyceride but not phospholipid from the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Animals expressing this mutant MTP synthesize triglyceride-poor B-lps and are phenotypically normal in adulthood, unlike animals carrying a loss of function MTP mutation. The revelation that MTP lipid transfer activities can be modulated demonstrates the potential for developing a selective small molecule triglyceride transfer inhibitor to reduce B-lps lipid content. Further, B-lps are regulated by many different mechanisms and cell types, calling into question why B-lp lowering therapies are still limited to targeting B-lp synthesis and uptake. Consistent with the goal of finding new targets to reduce plasma B-lps, recent efforts have identified a number of new genes that regulate B-lps in the larval zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Thus, our understanding of B-lp regulation is not yet saturated, and we expect many druggable targets in the pathways of B-lp regulation that have yet to be defined.</p>
<p>We aimed to identify new strategies for lowering circulating B-lp levels using drug screening and directly measuring total B-lp levels in a whole-animal system. While limited, there have been incremental advances in identifying B-lp modulators in complex systems. Prior work from the Hekimi lab screened novel compounds that affect a slow defecation phenotype that correlates with lowering B-lp levels in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and identified one highly effective molecule, CHGN005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. More recently, the Duncan lab screened for ApoB-lowering compounds using iPSC-derived hepatocytes, identifying 46 ApoB-lowering compounds and confirming one, DL-1, in rodent models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. However, until now, there have not been any large-scale drug screens to identify B-lp modulators in a vertebrate whole-animal system.</p>
<p>Using zebrafish expressing the LipoGlo reporter, we examined the effects of 2762 compounds of the JHDL to identify new B-lp lowering drugs. An obstacle in drug screening is defining significant compounds or hits, especially considering the variance of biological replicates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Researchers commonly use arbitrarily defined cutoffs to identify the largest reasonable number of significant screen hits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. To identify significant B-lp-reducing compounds, we used a well-described statistical measure, SSMD, and considered the directly measured effect size of B-lp reduction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Using these methods, we identified 49 unique B-lp-reducing compounds. With our screening paradigm, we frequently examined our positive control (n = 1381), which consistently reduced B-lp levels. However, when we applied our hit cutoffs, we found that lomitapide treatment infrequently would have been called a hit (26.4%), suggesting that our hit cutoffs are very stringent. Further demonstrating this stringency, if we preformed a Student’s t-test for each 5 µM lomitapide treatment we examined (n = 1381), 81.7% of experiments (1129/1381) would have met statistical significant (p &lt; 0.05) (data not shown). Rank-ordered analysis of lomitapide fold change and SSMD defines the midpoints of these measurements as −1.33 and −1.41, respectively. We found that using this approach to define hit cut-offs increases the frequency that lomitapide treatments are called as a hit increases (34.4%), and the number of B-lp lowering compounds increases to 59 unique drugs (12 additional compounds that are the subject of ongoing studies). As many of our hit compounds validated, our approach to use the positive control in a drug screen to help define hit cutoffs is advantageous. However, this approach is possible only when the positive control is utilized frequently (e.g. on every plate) throughout the screening paradigm.</p>
<p>Our screen identified numerous B-lp-increasing compounds in addition to B-lp-reducing compounds. While each of these compounds may not be clinically advantageous, their mechanisms of action may define novel biological pathways that may provide new therapeutic targets to manipulate B-lps <italic>in vivo.</italic> When further examining B-lp-increasing compounds, we must be careful to consider that B-lp levels change throughout larval zebrafish development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Thus, the B-lp increasing effect of these compounds may act indirectly on B-lps as a result of the drug slowing larval development, delaying the eventual decrease in B-lps that happens over development time – a hypothesis we have yet to examine for each of these B-lps-increasing compounds.</p>
<p>We confirmed the B-lp-lowering effects of 19 hits from our screen with several orthogonal studies. We then reviewed the literature for each of these compounds and prioritized hits for further study based on their likelihood to modulate B-lp levels. We selected the licorice root derivative enoxolone, because many compounds from this plant are used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat a myriad of disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, dyslipidemia, and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. However, mechanistic insight into how licorice root and its components produce these clinically favorable outcomes is largely lacking.</p>
<p>While enoxolone reduces B-lp levels, its effects on larval morphology and B-lp profile differ from that of MTP inhibition. More specifically, treatment of larvae with the MTP inhibitor, lomitapide, causes lipid droplet accumulation in the yolk syncytium, resulting in a ‘dark yolk’ phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). While the highest concentration of enoxolone reduced larval standard length, no concentration of enoxolone tested produced a dark yolk. Further, lomitapide treatment results in only small B-lps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], while enoxolone treatment does not affect the profile of B-lp size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). These data demonstrate that enoxolone reduces B-lp levels by a mechanism distinct from MTP inhibition.</p>
<p>Prior studies of enoxolone have found it to be protective from high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia and alcohol-induced hepatic injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. However, it has also been found that enoxolone treatment is associated with the inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, which can promote hypertension in some patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. While, this effect reduces enthusiasm for the clinical use of enoxolone, it may be possible to separate the B-lp lowering and hypertensive mechanisms of enoxolone by altering its structure.</p>
<p>Recent studies found enoxolone was capable of inhibiting HNF4⍺-dependent transcription of genes necessary for B-lp biosynthesis in cells and mice and protected animals from high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Further, enoxolone docking analysis suggests that this drug interacts with HNF4⍺, which is a potent lipid and carbohydrate metabolism regulator in the liver and gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. However, those authors could not directly show that HNF4⍺ was required to suppress hyperlipidemia in an animal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that HNF4⍺ is required for the B-lp lowering effect of enoxolone and suggest that enoxolone directly targets HNF4⍺ or is a potent modulator of HNF4⍺ activity.</p>
<p>HNF4⍺ regulates many transcriptional targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. Thus, we performed differential expression analysis to define the altered transcriptional pathways following enoxolone treatment. The early response to enoxolone treatment is enriched in differentially expressed genes related to lipid regulatory processes like cholesterol and isoprenoid biosynthesis, lipid transport, and the metabolism of coenzyme A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Interestingly, many differentially expressed genes enriched at times immediately after treatment do not overlap with late response genes, and these late genes are associated with glucose/insulin signaling and other cellular pathways. However, one gene, <italic>insig1</italic>, is transcriptionally upregulated at every treatment duration measured (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 4B</xref>). Insulin-induced gene 1 (Insig1) is a cellular cholesterol sensor that controls fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis by regulating the activity of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) and levels of HMG CoA reductase protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]. Not surprisingly, insig1 is closely correlated to dyslipidemia and other metabolic disorders, and Insig1 targeting therapies have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]. We expect that <italic>insig1</italic> upregulation following enoxolone treatment signifies a response to the limited cholesterol mobilization associated with reduced B-lp levels following treatment.</p>
<p>Several transcriptional targets of enoxolone have recently been described; for example, enoxolone treatment downregulates the expression of genes key to B-lp synthesis, including MTP, ApoB, and PLA2G12B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]. Interestingly, we do not detect any changes in expression for MTP, ApoB, and PLA2G12B following enoxolone treatment (Supplemental Table 2). However, it is possible that enoxolone would affect the expression of these genes in a fish model of hyperlipidemia.</p>
<p>We also examined whether enoxolone treatment in the fish causes transcriptional changes similar to the genetic depletion of HNF4⍺. The transcriptional targets of HNF4⍺ and HNF4Ɣ in the larval zebrafish intestine were recently characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Many differentially expressed genes following enoxolone treatment were also differentially expressed in the intestines of HNF4⍺ knockout animals (22.1% to 35.3%, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). This similarity is lost when comparing HNF4Ɣ knockouts and enoxolone treatment. These data demonstrate that enoxolone treatment affects many of the transcriptional targets of HNF4⍺. It should be noted that these datasets do not entirely overlap; we hypothesize this may stem from differences between whole-animal enoxolone treatments and intestines from HNF4⍺ knockouts. Alternatively, the perturbation of the HNF4⍺-dependent transcriptional network may be one of several downstream effects of enoxolone treatment. However, this hypothesis is not well supported by the consistency of overlapping differentially expressed genes between different durations of enoxolone treatment. Ultimately, these data demonstrate that enoxolone treatment causes many transcriptional changes, and these changes phenocopy the effect of genetic loss of HNF4⍺, supporting that HNF4⍺ is a target of enoxolone treatment.</p>
<p>Here, we not only demonstrate that enoxolone reduces B-lp levels in the larval zebrafish through inhibition of HNF4⍺ activity but also show that phenotypic drug screens for compounds that alter lipid biology using a whole animal model is achievable. The conservation of enoxolone’s HNF4⍺ inhibition in the zebrafish provides strong proof of concept that our screen was successful. We also identified and confirmed many other B-lp-lowering compounds for which we have yet to define their mechanisms of action. Further, the drug screening paradigm we developed using the LipoGlo system is highly scalable and canlikely be deployed to screen large novel drug libraries to identify many additional B-lp-lowering compounds.</p>

<p>The Johns Hopkins Drug Library (JHDL) (2934 total compounds supplied at 10 mM in DMSO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>] was screened across a four-fold serial dilution (8 µM to 1 µM). Drug dilutions were prepared using the Automated Reporter Quantification <italic>in vivo</italic> (ARQiv) screening system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Briefly, each JHDL compound was prediluted to a concentration of 160 µM in a 2% DMSO/100 ppm Tween-20/E3 solution to make a working drug stock. Each 96-well drug treatment plate (Perkin Elmer 6005299) was pre-loaded 225 µL 100 ppm Tween-20/E3 in columns 3 and 7, while the remaining columns were pre-loaded with 125 µL 0.2% DMSO/100 ppm Tween-20/E3 using a Micro10x microplate dispenser (Hudson Robotics). A 25 µL aliquot of drug working stock was added to each well of either column 3 or 7 of the microplate, mixed, and serially diluted by a SOLO automated pipettor (Hudson Robotics). Each drug treatment plate was prepared with a positive control in each well of column 2 with a concentration of 10 µM lomitapide (Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, #AEGR-733)/0.2% DMSO/100 ppm Tween-20/E3. To prepare for the addition of 3 dpf larvae, 75 µL of E3 was added to each well of each drug treatment plate.</p>
<p>Concurrently, <italic>Fus(ApoBb.1-NanoLuciferase); Tg(ubi:mCherry-2A-Firefly Luciferase)</italic> embryos were collected from homozygous in-crosses, manually cleaned daily, and reared in E2 at 28.5°C and kept on a 14:10 h light:dark cycle until 3 dpf. Once 3 dpf, animals were transferred to E3 and loaded into each well of each drug treatment plate in 50 µL using the Complex Object Parametric Analyzer and Sorter (COPAS-XL, Union Biometrica). The final concentration of each well of every drug treatment plate was as follows:</p>
<p>Wells of column 1: 1 fish per well in 250 µL 0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E3</p>
<p>Wells of column 2: 1 fish per well in 250 µL 5 µM lomitapide/0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E3 (positive control)</p>
<p>Wells of column 3: 1 fish per well in 250 µL 8 µM drug A/0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E3</p>
<p>Wells of column 4: 1 fish per well in 250 µL 4 µM drug A/0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E3</p>
<p>Wells of column 5: 1 fish per well in 250 µL 2 µM drug A/0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E3</p>
<p>Wells of column 6: 1 fish per well in 250 µL 1 µM drug A/0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E3</p>
<p>Wells of column 7: 1 fish per well in 250 µL 8 µM drug B/0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E3</p>
<p>Wells of column 8: 1 fish per well in 250 µL 4 µM drug B/0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E3</p>
<p>Wells of column 9: 1 fish per well in 250 µL 2 µM drug B/0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E3</p>
<p>Wells of column 10: 1 fish per well in 250 µL 1 µM drug B/0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E3</p>
<p>Wells of column 11: 1 fish per well in 250 µL 0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E3 (negative control)</p>
<p>Wells of column 12: 1 fish per well in 250 µL 0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E3</p>
<p>After dispensing, animals in treatment were incubated at 27°C and kept on a 14:10 h light:dark cycle for 48 hours. At 5 dpf, a solution of anesthetic, fixative, and NanoGlo substrate (Promega N1110) was added to each well of each drug plate at a final concentration of 0.014% MESAB/4.6% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences)/12.2% NanoGlo Buffer/1% NanoGlo substrate. After a roughly 20-minute incubation, total well luminescence was measured using a Tecan M1000 Pro microplate reader with a 50 ms integration.</p>

<title>LipoGlo assays with fixation endpoint</title>
<p>Each hit compound identified from our high-throughput screen was obtained from a vendor (Supplemental Table 1) and subjected to validation LipoGlo assays. In addition, BI6015 (Cayman Chemical 12032) and BIM5078 (Cayman Chemical 12031) were subjected to validation LipoGlo assays with the fixation endpoint. Validation assays were prepared as described above for high-throughput screening with a wider range of concentrations (eight-point serial dilution ranging from 8 µM to 62.5 nM) and using E2 embryo media. However, robotics were not used to prepare validation LipoGlo assays, and each experiment was prepared manually. After the 48-hour drug treatment, animals were fixed, and luminescence was measured using a BioTek Synergy H1 microplate reader with 500 ms integration or a Tecan Spark microplate reader with 500 ms integration. Each compound was examined with three independent experiments, with the results of each experiment normalized to the average RLU of the negative control (fold change) to control for experiment-to-experiment variation.</p>

<title>LipoGlo assays with homogenization endpoint</title>
<p>Drug treatments of each hit compound, BI6015, and BIM5078 were prepared as described for LipoGlo assays with fixation endpoint. After the 48-hour drug treatment, animals were anesthetized and transferred to 96-well PCR plates (USA Scientific 1402-9598) in a homogenization buffer (10% sucrose/50 mM EGTA/1X cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche 11873580001)). Samples were homogenized via bath sonication in a shoehorn sonicator with an amplitude of 100, cycling pulses of 2 seconds on and 1 second off for a total cycle of 30 seconds. For each sample, an aliquot of 4 µL of homogenate was mixed with 66 µL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 10 µL NanoGlo buffer, and 0.2 µL NanoGlo substrate (Promega, N1110) and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Total luminescence was measured using a BioTek Synergy H1 microplate reader with 20 ms integration or a Tecan Spark microplate reader with 20 ms integration. Each compound was examined with three independent experiments, with the results of each experiment normalized to the average RLU of the negative control (fold change) to control for experiment-to-experiment variation.</p>

<title>NanoLuciferase activity assay</title>
<p>We tested whether each hit compound, BI6015, and BIM5078 interfered with NanoLuciferase enzymatic activity. Untreated 3 dpf <italic>Fus(ApoBb.1-NanoLuciferase); Tg(ubi:mCherry-2A-Firefly Luciferase)</italic> animals were homogenized as described above. Here, 4 µL of homogenate was briefly incubated with each drug treatment (eight-fold serial dilution ranging from 8 µM to 62.5 nM) in a 0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E2 solution in 96-well plates (Perkin Elmer 6005299). A solution of 30 µL PBS, 10 µL NanoGlo buffer, and 0.2 µL NanoGlo substrate (Promega N1110) was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Total luminescence was measured using a BioTek Synergy H1 microplate reader with 20 ms integration or a Tecan Spark microplate reader with 20 ms integration.

<title>Whole-mount bright-field microscopy and standard-length quantification</title>
<p>Fish were anesthetized following vehicle or drug treatment or at specific developmental points for microscopy. Individual animals were mounted in a solution of 3% methylcellulose and imaged using a Nikon SMZ1500 microscope with HR Plan Apo 1x WD 54 objective, Infinity 3 Lumenera camera, and Infinity Analyze 6.5 software. Images were rotated and cropped as necessary using FIJI (ImageJ V2.0.0, National Institutes of Health (NIH)). The standard length of individuals was measured in FIJI.</p>

<title>Quantification of lipoprotein size distribution with LipoGlo electrophoresis</title>
<p>Native-PAGE gels (3% acrylamide:bis-solution 19:1 (BioRad, 1610144)/0.08% ammonium persulfate/0.006% tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED)/1X TBE) were prepared for individual experiments. Gels were assembled into mini-protean electrophoresis rigs (BioRad) at 4 °C, filled with pre-chilled 1X TBE, and pre-run at 50V for 30 minutes to equilibrate the gel before sample addition. Twelve microliters of homogenate (prepared as described above) was then combined with 3 μL of 5X loading dye (40% sucrose/0.25% bromophenol blue/TBE), and 12.5 μL of the resulting solution was loaded per well (which corresponds to 10% of the larval homogenate per lane). A reference sample of DiI-labeled human LDL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L3482) was mixed with 5X loading dye and loaded on each gel. Gels were then run at 50 V for 30 min, followed by 125 V for 2 h. Following resolution, gels were briefly coated in a 0.2% NanoLuciferase substrate/TBE solution or directly soaked in a 0.01% NanoLuciferase substrate/TBE solution before imaging using a LI-COR Odyssey Fc imaging system. The chemiluminescent channel (NanoLuciferase detection) was imaged for 2 minutes, and the 600 nm channel (DiI-LDL detection) was imaged for 30 seconds. Raw images were exported for further analysis using FIJI (ImageJ V2.0.0, National Institutes of Health (NIH)) and Excel (Microsoft). Briefly, each lane on the gel was converted to a plot profile and divided into LDL, IDL, VLDL and Zero Mobility (ZM) bins based on migration relative to the Di-I LDL standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Pixel intensity from the plot profile was summed within each bin for comparison between genotypes.</p>

<title>Characterizing lipoproteins in HNF4⍺ mutants</title>
<p>To determine whether HNF4⍺ is required for normal lipoprotein levels, the <italic>HNF4</italic>⍺ allele <italic>rdu14</italic> was obtained from the Rawls laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>] and crossed into the LipoGlo background. We then crossed <italic>HNF4</italic>⍺<italic><sup>rdu14/+</sup>; Fus(ApoBb.1-NanoLuciferase)/+</italic> to <italic>HNF4</italic>⍺<italic><sup>rdu14/+</sup></italic>adults in pairs and collected embryos. Healthy embryos were maintained at 27°C on a 14:10 h light:dark cycle in E2 embryo media in 10-cm dishes in groups of 100 animals. At 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 dpf, a dish of animals was anesthetized (info), and individual animals were homogenized as described above. Homogenates were subjected to LipoGlo analysis as described above. As only half of our animals are <italic>Fus(ApoBb.1-NanoLuciferase)/+,</italic> we defined heterozygous animals as those samples with luminescence above the background and wild-type animals as those samples with luminescence below the background. We genotyped for the rdu14 allele to de-identify samples. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted in 50 mM sodium hydroxide from 10 µL of homogenate and finally buffered in 166 mM Tris pH 8.0. The locus containing the rdu14 allele was amplified by PCR, using the following primers (Forward: 5’-TGATTCACACTACTTACTTGTCTAG-3’, Reverse: 5’-GATTAAAAGTAGTTATCTCATCCTCAG-3’) and GoTaq polymerase (Promega,). The genotype of the locus was scored after resolving samples on 2.5% agarose gels as HNF4⍺<italic><sup>+/+</sup>, HNF4</italic>⍺<italic><sup>rdu14/+</sup>, HNF4</italic>⍺<italic><sup>rdu14/rdu14</sup>.</italic> Samples were collected from at least 3 independent experiments, and each experiment was normalized to the mean of 3 dpf <italic>HNF4</italic>⍺<italic><sup>+/+</sup>; Fus(ApoBb.1-NanoLuciferase)/+</italic> animals, as this time point was common across all experiments.</p>

<title>RNA extraction, RNAseq, and downstream analysis</title>
<p>Individual 3 dpf <italic>Fus(ApoBb.1-NanoLuciferase); Tg(ubi:mCherry-2A-Firefly Luciferase)</italic> larvae were incubated in either vehicle (0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E2) or 8 µM enoxolone (8 µM enoxolone/0.1% DMSO/50 ppm tween-20/E2). After 4, 8, 12, 16, or 24 hours, 5 larvae from each treatment were collected and pooled for RNA extraction. After 48 hours, total lipoproteins were measured from the remaining animals from each treatment duration, following the LipoGlo assay with the fixation endpoint described above, to confirm the efficacy of enoxolone treatment in the experiment. Samples were prepared and collected from three independent clutches.</p>
<p>Grouped samples were homogenized using 0.5 mm zirconium oxide beads (Next Advance, ZrOB05) with a Bullet Blender (Next Advance) in TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher, 15596026). Homogenates were mixed with 100% ethanol 1:1, and RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol RNA Microprep Kit (Zymo Research, R2060). RNA concentration and quality were assessed via the Thermo Scientific NanoDrop One and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNASeq libraries were prepared from approximately 500ng total RNA using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep kit (Illumina, 20020595) and TruSeq RNA CD Index plate (Illumina, 20019792), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing was done on the Illumina NextSeq 500, using a 75bp run with 8×8 indexing, yielding between 23 and 45 million reads per sample. RNA sequencing data were processed using the nf–core/rnaseq v3.11.1 pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>]. Briefly, adapter sequences were trimmed from the reads, and ribosomal RNA reads were filtered. The remaining reads were mapped to the GRCz11 genome with Ensembl 110 annotation. Differential expression was examined using a custom R pipeline and the DEseq2 1.42 package for R. Each treatment duration was analyzed as an independent experiment to robustly analyze the difference between early and late effectors of enoxolone treatment. Samples from 8 hours post-treatment were run through a batch correction algorithm using the sva package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>]. Differentially expressed genes were identified as those with a fold change (log<sub>2</sub> scale) beyond 1.5 (0.9 for 4 and 8 hours post-treatment) and adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05. Gene ontology analysis was performed using the topGO package.</p>

<sec id="s4j">
<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>All data processing and analyses were completed using custom scripts using R; see supplemental file 1 for all code used. Drug screen data were analyzed in near real-time, calculating the fold change and the Strictly Standardized Mean Difference (SSMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] of each drug treatment compared to the negative control. Every drug-dose concentration that resulted in an SSMD score of ≤ −1.0 and fold change (log2 scale) of ≤ −1.5 was considered a significant luminescence-reducing hit. Statistically significant differences between drug treatments in the remaining experiments were identified by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by a Dunnett’s test (with the negative control as the reference group) with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>A whole-organism drug screen was performed to identify molecules that decrease Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) as a target for agents to reduce atherosclerosis. Kelpsch et al. used a zebrafish reporter line, LipoGlo, which is a fusion of the Nano-luciferase protein to the ApoB protein as a proxy for the presence of ApoB-containing lipoproteins (B-lps) in larval stages. The LipoGlo line was screened against a well-characterized drug library and identified 49 hits from their primary screen. Follow-up studies further refined this list to 19 molecules that reproducibly reduced B-lps significantly. The authors focused their studies on enoxolone, a licorice root extract, and showed that larvae treated with this agent can reduce the production of B-lps. As enoxolone has been reported to suppress Hepatocyte Nuclear factor 4a (HNF4a), the authors investigated whether loss-of-hnf4a or pharmacological inhibition of hnf4a in zebrafish also produced similar phenotypes as enoxolone treatment. Their studies showed that this was the case. Transcriptomic studies after enoxolone treatment resulted in altered expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and in glucose/insulin signaling pathways. This study highlights the utility of a zebrafish whole-organism chemical screen for modifiers of B-lps production and/or its clearance. A significant finding is that enoxolone inhibits hnf4a in zebrafish to reduce B-lps production and supports targeting HNF4a as a therapeutic means to reduce the emergence of atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors performed a whole-organism chemical screen with over 3000 agents. Such screens are challenging, and the authors used strict criteria for determining hits. The conclusions of this study are well supported by the presented data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are areas within the study and writing that can be improved and extended, specifically within the gene expression studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to develop a large-scale drug screen to identify B-lp modulators in a vertebrate whole-animal system. Using the zebrafish LipoGlo system that the authors had previously published and validated, the authors screened 2762 drug candidates to generate 49 hits and ultimately validated 19 drugs as genuine ApoB-lowering drugs. Using LipoGlo-Electrophoresis, the authors are able to obtain insights into the ApoB-lipoprotein size/subclass distribution. The authors further validate and study the mechanism of a strong hit, Enoxolone, known as also known as 18β-Glycyrrhetinic acid, which has previously been reported to modulate lipid metabolism. The authors also show that Enoxolone effects are mediated through HNF4⍺, which has been previously shown in the mouse system, but this is the first time it has been shown in the zebrafish.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study was methodical and robust, using a published and well-validated zebrafish LipoGlo model. The authors validated the hits from the screen independently and considered the possibility that some drugs may have been detected as false positive results due to effects on the enzymatic activity of NanoLuciferase; only one hit, verteporfin, was shown to be a false positive. Using LipoGlo-Electrophoresis, the authors are able to obtain extra insights into the ApoB-lipoprotein size/subclass distribution. They showed that while enoxolone treatment reduces total B-lps, there are no overt changes in B-lp size distribution compared to vehicle-treated animals, other than a slight increase in the zero mobility (ZM) fraction, which contains very large particles and/or tissue aggregates. In contrast, the positive control, lomitapide, does show a change in B-lp size distribution compared to vehicle-treated animals - an increase in frequency of LDLs (low-density lipoprotein), but a decrease in VLDLs (very low-density lipoprotein). This study also assesses the LipoGlo-Electrophoresis profile of HNF4⍺ inhibitors. Work in the zebrafish larvae means that the effect on overall development and an entire vertebrate organism can also be assessed. Finally, the authors applied a thorough statistical measure to define a hit, using the Strictly Standardized Mean Difference (SSMD) method.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the screen was thorough and well-validated, the authors missed a chance to provide a lot of extra significance to a wide range of readership. While the hits were thoroughly validated and displayed, the authors could have also presented the LipoGlo-Electrophoresis for all validated hits or at least a number of them. This would hugely increase the insights into these compounds. Also, the authors chose to validate and follow up a mechanism for Enoxolone, yet this hit was already known to modulate lipid metabolism through HNF4⍺, therefore, hugely limiting the impact of the paper. So what the authors have shown that is novel is only subtly added to this - consistent in vertebrate models, RNA sequencing of pathways, further validation of the HNF4⍺ pathway, and a profile of resulting B-lp size distribution. It seemed an easy way out to pick such a candidate, and they could have followed up by validating more thoroughly a completely novel drug. Also, the authors' prior paper showing the methodology also depicted complementary EM and LipoGlo-microscopy approaches. The microscopy especially, would have been an easy complementary add-on to the screen to really give extra insights into B-lp metabolism in a whole organism for all candidates. This felt like a missed opportunity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In &quot;A‬‭ whole-animal‬‭ phenotypic‬‭ drug‬‭ screen‬‭ identifies‬‭ suppressors‬‭ of‬‭ atherogenic‬ lipoproteins&quot;, Kelpsch et al seek to identify new, chemically targetable pathways that regulate ApoB function and could ultimately serve as treatments for elevated lipid disorders and/or cardiovascular disease. Given the interconnected nature of lipid regulation in the whole organism with interdependent organs and secreted components (i.e. lipoproteins), they use the vertebrate model zebrafish to screen a large library of ~3000 compounds for their ability to lower the important ApoB-containing lipoproteins. They find 49 hits with 19 compounds passing a higher level of scrutiny, and focus on the role of enoxolone in modulating B-Ip levels at least partly through the HNF4alpha transcription factor and, putatively, through downstream cholesterol/lipid biosynthetic pathways.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study uses a well-validated in vivo stain (LipoGlo) for measuring lipoproteins in the context of a developing whole organism with a quantitative read-out on a high-throughput platform, allowing for screening of thousands of compounds altering the complex metabolic/physiologic functions necessary for lipoprotein production.</p>
<p>The use of genetic mutant HNF4alpha to assign the mechanism of action to the prime candidate compound studied (enoxolone) is a powerful approach for this challenging aspect of chemical genetics studies. See caveats in weaknesses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 5A, the HNF4alpha mutant homozygous -/- already lowers lipoproteins. Is it just that the mutant level is already at a minimum in this homozygous mutant (and thus enoxolone can not induce even lower lipoprotein levels), or is it true that the enoxolone molecule is primarily acting through this TF (i.e. HNF4alpha homozygous mutant is truly epistatic to enoxolone function) as favored in the text.</p>
<p>While it is definitely interesting to study enoxolone effects during whole embryo development, the link to HNF4alpha had previously been described in the literature, as pointed out by the authors. The generalizability of the approach to identify truly novel pathways remains to be fully realized, but sharing this available screen data to date will invite further inquiry and be very valuable to the community.</p>
<p>Figure 5 - The same allele of HNF4alpha loss of function/hypomorph (rdu14) is used in both 5A and 5B, but labeled differently in each subpanel. This is explained in the figure legend, but could be updated to use the same nomenclature in both panels to clarify the Figure presentation.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the editors and reviewers for their time and their helpful feedback. We largely agree with the reviewer recommendations and comments, which we will address for the next Version on Record of this manuscript. We plan to address reviewer comments in the following ways.</p>
<p>Reviewers requested a more comprehensive analysis of our RNA-seq experiment comparing vehicle treatment to enoxolone treatment over time. We will improve our analysis by providing clear, accessible, and organized tables defining differentially expressed genes at each time point, gene set lists that comprise our gene ontology analysis, and the lists of shared differentially expressed genes from enoxolone treatment and HNF4⍺ knockout. While some of this data was provided in the supplementary files, we recognize that it should be more accessible for the reader. Furthermore, as suggested by the Reviewer, we will enhance our transcriptomic analysis by utilizing bioinformatic tools such as Enrichr.</p>
<p>The Reviewers noted that we identified a number of lipoprotein-lowering compounds through our drug screen, but limited the impact of our manuscript by focusing on enoxolone, a known inhibitor of HNF4⍺ and modulator of lipid metabolism. While we understand with the sentiment that other novel compounds would be interesting to study, we aimed to demonstrate proof of concept in this manuscript. We view the characterization of novel compounds as beyond the direct scope of this manuscript. We did not perform LipoGlo imaging and electrophoresis experiments on each drug because these experiments are low-throughput given the number of drugs and doses we examined. In light of the Reviewer’s comments, we will add some additional characterizations of our validated hits with LipoGlo imaging and electrophoresis studies.</p>
<p>The reviewers also identified a number of typos in text and figures that will be addressed in the next Version on Record. We believe that the recommended changes will strengthen our manuscript and broaden its appeal. We are grateful for the opportunity to improve our work based on the reviewers’ valuable suggestions.</p>
