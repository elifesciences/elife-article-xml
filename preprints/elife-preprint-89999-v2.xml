<title>Abstract</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been used worldwide to combat COVID-19 pandemic. To elucidate the factors that determine the longevity of spike (S)-specific antibodies, we traced the characteristics of S-specific T cell clonotypes together with their epitopes and anti-S antibody titers before and after BNT162b2 vaccination over time. T cell receptor (TCR) αβ sequences and mRNA expression of the S-responded T cells were investigated using single-cell TCR- and RNA-sequencing. Highly expanded 199 TCR clonotypes upon stimulation with S peptide pools were reconstituted into a reporter T cell line for the determination of epitopes and restricting HLAs. Among them, we could determine 78 S epitopes, most of which were conserved in variants of concern (VOCs). In donors exhibiting sustained anti-S antibody titers (designated as “sustainers”), S-reactive T cell clonotypes detected immediately after 2nd vaccination polarized to follicular helper T (Tfh)-like cells, which was less obvious in “decliners”. Even before vaccination, S-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clonotypes did exist, most of which cross-reacted with environmental or symbiotic bacteria. However, these clonotypes contracted after vaccination. Conversely, S-reactive clonotypes dominated after vaccination were undetectable in pre-vaccinated T cell pool, suggesting that highly-responding S-reactive T cells were established by vaccination from rare clonotypes. These results suggest that <italic>de novo</italic> acquisition of memory Tfh-like cells upon vaccination contributes to the longevity of anti-S antibody titers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The pandemic COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has expanded worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Many types of vaccines have been developed or in basic and clinical phases to combat infection and deterioration of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Among them, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines, BNT162b2/Comirnaty and mRNA-1273/Spikevax, have been approved with over 90% efficacy at 2 months post-2nd dose vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], and widely used. Pathogen-specific antibodies are one of the most efficient components to prevent infection. Yet, mRNA vaccine-induced serum antibody titer is known to be waning over 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Accordingly, the effectiveness of the vaccines decreases over time, and thus multiple doses and repeated boosters are necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>The production and sustainability of spike (S)-specific antibody could be related to multiple factors, especially in the case of humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Among them, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells is critically involved in the affinity and longevity of the antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Elucidation of the key factors of T cell responses that contribute to the durable immune responses induced by vaccination would provide valuable information for the vaccine development in the future. However, the relationship between antibody sustainability and the types of antigen-specific T cells has not been investigated in a clonotype resolution.</p>
<p>Recent studies reported that S-reactive T cells pre-existed before exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Common cold human coronaviruses (HCoVs) including strains 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 are considered major cross-reactive antigens that primed these pre-existing T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], while bacterial cross-reactive antigens were also reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. However, the functional relevance of cross-reactive T cells during infection or vaccination is still in debate.</p>
<p>In this study, both humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated at 3, 6 and 24 weeks after BNT162b2/Comirnaty vaccination. S-specific T cells before and after vaccination were analyzed on clonotype level using single cell-based T cell receptor (TCR) and RNA sequencing to determine their characteristics and epitopes in antibody sustainers and decliners. These analyses suggest the importance of early acquisition of S-specific Tfh cells in the longevity of antibodies.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine elicits transient humoral immunity</title>
<p>Blood samples were collected from a total of 43 individuals (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) who had no SARS-CoV-2 infection history when they received two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. Samples were taken before and after the vaccination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Consistent with the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], most participants exhibited more severe side effects after 2nd dose of vaccination than 1st dose locally (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and systemically (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). At 3 weeks, anti-S IgG antibody titer increased in most participants. At 6 weeks, anti-S antibody titer was at its peak. S antibody titer gradually decreased over 24 weeks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The antibody titer was reduced by 56.8% on average. Donors of different genders or age groups showed no significant difference in anti-S antibody titer (Fig. S1). The neutralization activity of the post-vaccinated sera showed similar tendency with the anti-S antibody titer during the study period (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The above results indicate that the mRNA vaccine effectively activated humoral immune responses in healthy individuals, but decreased by 24 weeks over time as reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>

<title>Antibody sustainers had highly expanded S-reactive Tfh clonotypes</title>
<p>To address the role of T cells in maintaining the antibody titer, we analyzed the S-responsive T cells in the post-vaccination samples from 8 donors, among whom 4 donors showed relatively sustained anti-S antibody titer during 6 weeks to 24 weeks (reduction &lt; 30%) (sustainers, donors #8, #25, #27 and #28), while the other 4 donors showed largely declined anti-S antibody titer (reduction &gt; 80%) (decliners, donors #4, #13, #15 and #17) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and Fig. S2A). The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection of sustainers was ruled out by analyzing anti-nucleocapsid protein (N) antibody titer in the sera samples at 24 weeks (Fig. S2B). Antibody sustainability did not correlate with bulk T cell responses to S protein, such as IFNψ production (Fig. S2C).</p>

</fig>
<p>To enrich the S-reactive T cells, we labeled the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a cell proliferation tracer and stimulated the PBMCs with an S peptide pool for 10 days. Proliferated T cells were sorted and analyzed by single-cell TCR- and RNA-sequencing (scTCR/RNA-seq). Clustering analysis was done with pooled samples of 3 time points from 8 donors, and various T cell subtypes were identified (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We found that, overall, the S-reactive T cells did not skew to any particular T cell subset (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, by grouping the cells from decliners and sustainers separately, we found difference in the frequency of the cells within the circled population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), and overall, the sustainer individuals had more cells in this region (Fig. S3). These cells showed high Tfh signature scores and expressed characteristic genes of Tfh cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). This tendency became more pronounced when we selected highly expanded (top 16) clonotypes in each donor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). In sustainers, S-specific Tfh clusters appeared from 6 weeks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), suggesting that vaccine-induced Tfh-like cells that have potency of deriving to Tfh cells were established immediately after 2nd vaccination.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Identification of dominant S epitopes recognized by vaccine-induced T cell clonotypes</title>
<p>To elucidate the epitopes of the highly expanded clonotypes, we reconstituted their TCRs into a T cell hybridoma lacking endogenous TCRs and having an NFAT-GFP reporter gene. These cell lines were stimulated with S peptides using transformed autologous B cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The epitopes of 53 out of 128 reconstituted clonotypes were successfully determined (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, Figs. S4A–S4D). Epitopes of expanded Tfh cells were not limited in any particular region of S protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). About 72% of these epitopes conserved in Delta and Omicron variants (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Tables 4</xref> and <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Within the rest of 28% of epitopes which were mutated in variants of concerns (VOCs), although some mutated epitopes located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of VOCs lost antigenicity, recognition of most epitopes outside the RBD region was maintained or rather increased in the variants (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and Figs. S4E and S4F). These results suggest that the majority of S-reactive clonotypes after vaccination can respond to antibody-escaping VOCs.</p>

<title>Identification of S epitopes and cross-reactive antigens of pre-existing T cell clonotypes</title>
<p>Before the pandemic, T cells cross-reacting to S antigen were present in the peripheral blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. To characterize these pre-existing S-reactive cells, we analyzed the PBMCs collected from donors who consented to blood sample donation before vaccination (#4, #8, #13, #15, and #17). PBMCs were stimulated with the S peptide pool for 10 days, and proliferated T cells were sorted and analyzed by scTCR/RNA-seq. Similar to vaccine-induced S-reactive T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), characteristics of pre-existing S-reactive T cells were diverse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). To track the dynamics of cross-reactive clones after vaccination, we combined the single-cell sequencing data of pre- and post-vaccinated PBMCs and analyzed the clonotypes that have more than 50 cells in total (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We did find some cross-reactive clonotypes that were further expanded by vaccination, and most of these clonotypes had cytotoxic features, being CD8<sup>+</sup> effector memory T cells (Tem) or minor CD4<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). In contrast, most of the cross-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells became minor clonotypes after vaccination.</p>

Clonotypes that have an expansion ratio larger than 1 are considered as expanded post-vaccination. Cell fractions at individual time points are shown as heat map.

<p>We also explored the epitopes of the top 16 expanded clonotypes in each pre-vaccinated donor by reconstituting the TCRs into reporter cell lines. We identified 18 epitopes from S protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) and determined some possible cross-reactive antigens. Most of these cross-reactive antigens originated from environmental or symbiotic microbes (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Furthermore, majority of the reactive T clonotypes showed regulatory T cell (Treg) signatures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Six of these 80 analyzed clonotypes could also be frequently detected in the public TCR database Adaptive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Notably, most of these clonotypes, except for one case, showed comparable frequencies between pre-pandemic healthy donors and COVID-19 convalescent patients (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting that these clonotypes did not expand upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite they were present before the pandemic. Thus, it is unlikely that these cross-reactive T clonotypes contribute to the establishment of S-reactive T cell pools during either vaccination or infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies showed that Tfh function and germinal center development were impaired in deceased COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] and Tfh cell number correlated with neutralizing antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Consistent with the above studies, we found that the donors having sustained antibody titers between 6 to 24 weeks post-vaccination had more S antigen-responsive Tfh-like clonotypes maintained in the periphery as a memory pool. As circulating Tfh clonotypes can reflect the population of germinal center Tfh cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], it is possible that these maintained S-responsive Tfh cells contribute to the prolonged production of anti-S antibodies. These results imply that Tfh polarization of S-reactive T cells in the blood after 2nd vaccination can be a marker for the longevity of serum anti-S antibodies. Although monitoring of S-specific Tfh cells in germinal center is ideal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], it is currently difficult for outpatients in clinics.</p>
<p>Since the antigen used for BNT162b2 is a full-length S protein from the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, it is important to estimate whether vaccine-induced Wuhan S-reactive T cells recognize neutralizing antibody-evading VOCs, such as Omicron variants. To investigate the dominant T cell epitopes of vaccine-developed T cells, we utilized a proliferation-based sorting strategy to enrich the S-responsive T cells. The limitation of this strategy is that a 10-day stimulation would change the transcriptional profile and repertoire of T cells. However, This strategy allowed us to select the T cell clonotypes that vigorously responded to the S antigen stimulation, while weakly responsive cells and anergic cells will be less considered, which is exactly in line with our purpose. Consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], most of the epitopes determined in the current study were conserved in Delta and Omicron (BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/5) strains, suggesting that vaccine-induced T cells are able to recognize the mutated S proteins from these variants, despite B epitopes being largely mutated in these VOCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2-recognizing T cells existed prior to exposure to the S antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], which is consistent with our observation with PBMCs from donors who were uninfected and pre-vaccinated. Among these pre-existing S-reactive clonotypes, CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T clonotypes were expanded by the vaccination, whereas most of CD4<sup>+</sup> T clonotypes became less dominant after vaccination (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Currently, the reason for the opposite tendency is unclear. In the present study, we showed that pre-existing T clonotypes cross-reacting to S protein are unlikely to contribute to vaccine-driven T cell immunity. This could be due to the fact that cross-reactive T cells had relatively low avidity to S protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusively, considering that most of these cross-reactive T clonotypes have Treg signature (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), they could be developed to tolerate symbiotic or environmental antigens, and might be ineffective to the defense against SARS-CoV-2 and thus replaced by the other effective T clonotypes induced by vaccination. One exceptional pre-existing clonotype was #15-Pre_2, as they vigorously expanded in COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). This clonotype was clustered within a CD4<sup>+</sup> Tem population and cross-reactive to environmental bacteria, <italic>Myxococcales bacterium</italic> (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Thus, in some particular settings, clonotypes primed by common bacterial antigens might potentially contribute during infection.</p>
<p>Common cold human coronavirus (HCoV)-derived S proteins are reported as potential cross-reactive antigens for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. However, the highly responding SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive clonotypes in pre-vaccinated donors did not react with HCoV S proteins in the present study (Fig. S5), which might be partly due to the difference of cohorts or ethnicities. Instead, most of those T cells cross-reacted with environmental or symbiotic bacteria. These observations suggest that these cross-reactive T cells might have been developed to establish tolerance against less harmful microbes, and thus unlikely to efficiently contribute to the protective viral immunity. Vaccination may induce opposite tendencies on T cell clonotypes that recognize the same antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], which is hardly detected by the bulk T cell analyses. The current study highlights the necessity of dynamic tracing of T cell responses in an epitope-specific clonotype resolution for the evaluation of vaccine-induced immunity.</p>
<p>The limitation of this study is the number of individuals we analyzed. However, chronological and clonological analysis of antigen-specific T cells in characteristic groups followed by epitope determination has not been performed before. This study suggests that mRNA vaccine is potent enough to prime rare T cell clonotypes that become dominant afterwards. Furthermore, we propose that the types of CD4<sup>+</sup> T clonotypes developed shortly after two doses of vaccination could be an indication of the longevity of antibodies in the following months. Tfh-inducing adjuvants or Tfh-skewing epitope would be a promising “directional” booster in the post-vaccine era when most people worldwide were exposed with the same antigen in multiple doses within a short period. Furthermore, in addition to SARS-CoV-2, this strategy can also be applicable for the prevention of other infectious diseases of which neutralizing antibody titers are effective for protection.</p>

Briefly, recombinant ancestral S protein (S1+S2, Cell Signaling Technology; 1 µg/ml) or recombinant nucleocapsid protein (Acrobiosystems; 1 µg/ml) was coated on 96-well plate at 4 °C overnight. On the second day, wells were blocked with blocking buffer (PBS-T (0.05% tween®20) containing 5% skim milk) for 2 h at room temperature. The sera were diluted from 10 to 31,250 folds in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, wells were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies (GE Healthcare) for 3 h at room temperature. After being washed with PBS-T, wells were incubated with the peroxidase chromogenic substrate 3,3’-5,5’-tetramethyl benzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at room temperature, then the reaction was stopped by 0.5 N sulfuric acid (Sigma Aldrich). The absorbance of wells was immediately measured at 450 nm with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). The value of the half-maximal antibody titer of each sample was calculated from the highest absorbance in the dilution range by using Prism 8 software. The calculated antibody titer was converted to BAU/ml by using WHO International Standard 20/136 (NIBSC) for ancestral S-specific antibody titer.</p>

<p>• A summary of what the authors were trying to achieve.</p>
<p>The authors cultured pre- and Post-vaccine PBMCs with overlapping peptides encoding S protein in the presence of IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 for 10 days, and extensively analyzed the T cells expanded during the culture; by including scRNAseq, scTCRseq, and examination of reporter cell lines expressing the dominant TCRs. They were able to identify 78 S epitopes with HLA restrictions (by itself represents a major achievement) together with their subset, based on their transcriptional profiling. By comparing T cell clonotypes between pre- and post-vaccination samples, they showed that a majority of pre-existing S-reactive CD4+ T cell clones did not expand by vaccinations. Thus, the authors concluded that highly-responding S-reactive T cells were established by vaccination from rare clonotypes.</p>
<p>• An account of the major strengths and weaknesses of the methods and results.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• Selection of 4 &quot;Ab sustainers&quot; and 4 &quot;Ab decliners&quot; from 43 subjects who received two shots of mRNA vaccinations.</p>
<p>
• Identification of S epitopes of T cells together with their transcriptional profiling. This allowed the authors to compare the dominant subsets between sustainers and decliners.</p>
<p>Weaknesses were properly addressed in the revised manuscript, and I do not have any additional concerns.</p>

<p>Summary: The paper aims to investigate the relationship between anti-S protein antibody titers with the phenotypes&amp;clonotypes of S-protein-specific T cells, in people who receive SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccines. To do this, the paper recruited a cohort of Covid-19 naive individuals that receives the SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccines and collect sera and PBMCs samples on different timepoints. Then they mainly generate three sets of data: 1). Anti-S protein antibody titers on all timepoints. 2) Single-cell RNAseq/TCRseq dataset for divided T cells after stimulation by S-protein for 10 days. 3) Corresponding epitopes for each expanded TCR clones. After analyzing these result, the paper reports two major findings&amp;claims: A) Individuals having sustained anti-S protein antibody response also have more so-called Tfh cells in their single-cell dataset. B). S-reactive T cells do exist before the vaccination, but they seems to be unable to response to Covid-19 vaccination properly.</p>
<p>The paper's strength is it uses a very systemic and thorough strategy trying to dissect the relationship between antibody titers, T cell phenotypes, TCR clonotypes and corresponding epitopes, and indeed it reports several interesting findings about the relationship of Tfh clonotypes/sustained antibody and about the S-reactive clones that exist before the vaccination. The conclusion is solid in general but some claims are overstated. My suggestion is the authors should further limit their claims in abstract, for example,</p>
<p>&quot;Even before vaccination, S-reactive CD4+ T cell clonotypes did exist, most of which (MAY) cross-reacted with environmental or symbiotic bacteria&quot; -- The paper don't have experimental evidence to show these TCR clones respond to these epitopes.</p>
<p>&quot;These results suggest that de novo acquisition of memory Tfh-like cells upon vaccination (LIKELY) contributes to the longevity of anti-S antibody titers.&quot; --Given the small sample size and the statistical analysis was not significant, this claim was overstated.</p>
<p>&quot;S-reactive T cell clonotypes detected immediately after 2nd vaccination polarized to follicular helper T (Tfh)-like cells (UNDER IN VITRO CULTURE)&quot;. -- the conclusion was based on vitro cultured cells, which had limitation.</p>

</list-item></list>
<p>The authors cultured pre- and Post-vaccine PBMCs with overlapping peptides encoding S protein in the presence of IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 for 10 days, and extensively analyzed the T cells expanded during the culture; by including scRNAseq, scTCRseq, and examination of reporter cell lines expressing the dominant TCRs. They were able to identify 78 S epitopes with HLA restrictions (by itself represents a major achievement) together with their subset, based on their transcriptional profiling. By comparing T cell clonotypes between pre- and post-vaccination samples, they showed that a majority of pre-existing S-reactive CD4+ T cell clones did not expand by vaccinations. Thus, the authors concluded that highly-responding S-reactive T cells were established by vaccination from rare clonotypes.</p>

<list-item><p>Fig. 3 provides the epitopes, and the type of T cells, yet the composition of subsets per subject was not provided.

To exclude this possibility, the data on the composition of the T cell subset per subject (all 8 subjects) should be provided.</p>

<p>In accordance with the reviewer’s suggestion, we provided the composition of the T cell subset per subject (all 8 subjects) in the revised manuscript (shown below).</p>

<list-item><p>S-specific T cells were obtained after a 10-day culture with peptides in the presence of multiple cytokines. This strategy tends to increase a background unrelated to S protein. Another shortcoming of this strategy is the selection of only T cells amenable to cell proliferation. This strategy will miss anergic or less-responsive T cells and thus create a bias in the assessment of S-reactive T cell subsets. This limitation should be described in the Discussion.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising the question related to our experimental strategy. We chose this method because a background unrelated to S protein was lower than widely used AIM methods, which is verified by reconstituting many TCRs and testing the responses in vitro. One more reason is this method can identify S-reactive functional (proliferative) T cell clonotypes than anergic or less-responsive T cells as the reviewer mentioned, which is our objective in this study. In accordance with the reviewer’s suggestion, we have carefully described our limitation and rationale of our experimental strategy in the revised manuscript.</p>

<list-item><p>Fig. 5 shows the epitopes and the type of T cells present at baseline. Do they react to HCoV-derived peptides? I guess not, as it is not clearly described. If the authors have the data, it should be provided.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer mentioned, the pre-existing highly expanded clonotypes that we analyzed did not react to HCoV-derived peptides. After we determined the epitopes of the clonotypes, the S peptide sequences were analyzed for homology in HCoVs. The only two clonotypes whose epitope sequences were relatively conserved in HCoV strains (clonotypes #8-pre_9 and #8-pre_10) were tested for their reactivity to the similar HCoV epitope counterparts, but no activation was observed (shown below). We added these data in the revised manuscript.</p>

<list-item><p>As the authors discussed (L172), pre-existing S-reactive T cells were of low affinity. The raw flow data, as shown in Fig. S3, for pre-existing T cells may help discuss this aspect.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer mentioned, some pre-existing S-reactive T cells might appear to react with S peptides judging from the NFAT-GFP expression of their reporter cell lines. However, the percentage of GFP-expressing cells is affected by many factors such as TCR expression level and HLA molecule expression level. Thus, the affinity of pre-existing S-reactive T cells was not fully deduced from the activation of reporter cell lines as shown in Fig. S3 in the present manuscript. We thank the reviewer for this constructive suggestion, but we therefore decided not to use these data quantitatively to evaluate affinity in this manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>A short-term comparison of durability of S antibody levels after 2-dose vaccination, showing that better or more poorly sustained responses correlate with the presence of Tfh cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Novelty of approach in expanding, sequencing and expressing TCRs for functional studies from the implicated populations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Somewhat outdated question, short timeline, small numbers, over-interpretation of sequence homology data</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In line with my above comments, it might be useful for the authors to look at moderating some of the assertions in what is a rather small-scale descriptive account of correlates of some quite nuanced, short-term, S antibody response differences</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We clearly described that some homologous microbe-derived peptides were indeed recognized by S-reactive T cells. Also, we have removed our overstatement from the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper aims to investigate the relationship between anti-S protein antibody titers with the phenotypes&amp;clonotypes of S-protein-specific T cells, in people who receive SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccines. To do this, the paper recruited a cohort of Covid-19 naive individuals who received the SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccines and collected sera and PBMCs samples at different timepoints. Then they mainly generate three sets of data: 1). Anti-S protein antibody titers on all timepoints. 2) Single-cell RNAseq/TCRseq dataset for divided T cells after stimulation by S-protein for 10 days. 3) Corresponding epitopes for each expanded TCR clones. After analyzing these results, the paper reports two major findings &amp; claims: A) Individuals having sustained anti-S protein antibody response also have more so-called Tfh cells in their single-cell dataset, which suggests Tfh-polarization of S-specific T cells can be a marker to predict the longevity of anti-S antibody. B). S-reactive T cells do exist before the vaccination, but they seem to be unable to respond to Covid-19 vaccination properly.</p>
<p>The paper's strength is it uses a very systemic and thorough strategy trying to dissect the relationship between antibody titers, T cell phenotypes, TCR clonotypes and corresponding epitopes, and indeed it reports several interesting findings about the relationship of Tfh/sustained antibody and about the S-reactive clones that exist before the vaccination. However, the main weakness is these interesting claims are not sufficiently supported by the evidence presented in this paper. I have the following major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The biggest claim of the paper, which is the acquisition of S-specific Tfh clonotypes is associated with the longevity of anti-S antibodies, should be based on proper statistical analysis rather than just a UMAP as in Fig2 C, E, F. The paper only shows the pooled result, but it looks like most of the so-called Tfh cells come from a single donor #27. If separating each of the 4 decliners and sustainers and presenting their Tfh% in total CD4+ T cells respectively, will it statistically have a significant difference between those decliners and sustainers? I want to emphasize that solid scientific conclusions need to be drawn based on proper sample size and statistical analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In accordance with the reviewer’s request, we have also analyzed the T cells separately (shown below). We observed the average frequency was much lower in decliners than sustainers, while the difference did not reach statistical significance partly because of the large deviation due to one sustainer (#27) who possessed quite a high Tfh%. We modified our description in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) The paper does not provide any information to justify its cell annotation as presented in Fig 2B, 4A. Moreover, in my opinion, it is strange to see that there are two clusters of cells sit on both the left and right side of UMAP in Fig2B but both are annotated as CD4 Tcm and Tem. Also Tfh and Treg belong to a same cluster in Fig 2B but they should have very distinct transcriptomes and should be separated nicely. Therefore I believe the paper can be more convincing if it can present more information and discussion about the basis for its cell annotation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s concern. Since antigen stimulation only induced the proliferation of antigen-specific T cells, the multiple clusters were mostly due to the fluctuation of cell cyclerelated genes. We therefore carefully and manually annotated these clusters by selecting the cell type-related genes (Kaech et al, Nat. Rev. Immunol., 2002; Sallusto et al, Annu Rev Immunol., 2004) and determined their subsets regardless of the automatic clustering based on the whole transcriptome. Indeed, antigen-responded Tfh and Treg are close, as ICOS and PDCD1 are expressed. We mainly used IL21 and FOXP3 to distinguish the Tfh and Treg populations, respectively. We thank the reviewer for pointing out this important process that we carefully addressed. We added the description of annotation methods to the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 103-104, the paper claims that the Tfh cluster likely comes from cTfh cells. However considering the cells have been cultured/stimulated for 10 days, cTfh cells might lose all Tfh features after such culture. To my best knowledge there is no literature to support the notion that cTfh cells after stimulated in vitro for 10 days (also in the presence of IL2, IL7 and IL15), can still retain a Tfh phenotype after 10 days. It is possible that what actually happens is, instead of having more S-specific cTfh cells before the cell culture, the sustainers' PBMC can create an environment that favors the Tfh cell differentiation (such as express more pro-Tfh cytokines/co-stimulations). Thus after 10-days culture, there are more Tfh-like cells detected in the sustainers. The paper may need to include more evidence to support cTfh cells can retain Tfh features after 10-days' culture.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important issue. As the reviewer pointed out, culturing T cells for 10 days indeed changed the repertoire and features, so the Tfh clonotypes we detected after the expansion may not correspond to the cTfh clonotypes in vivo. Because our observation and analysis were mostly based on the dominant T cell clonotypes expanded in vitro, we modified our description and conclusion accordingly in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It is in my opinion inaccurate to use cell number in Fig4B to determine whether such clone expands or not, given that the cell number can be affected by many factors like the input number, the stimulation quality and the PBMC sample quality. A more proper analysis should be considered by calculating the relative abundance of each TCR clone in total CD4 T cells in each timepoint.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out our inaccuracy. As the reviewer suggested, we used percentages to demonstrate the relative abundance of each clonotype in Fig. 4B of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) It is well-appreciated to express each TCR in cell line and to determine the epitopes. However, the author needs to make very sure that this analysis is performed correctly because a large body of conclusions of the paper are based on such epitope analysis. However, I notice something strange (maybe I am wrong) but for example, Table 4 donor #8 clonotype post_6 and _7, these two clonotypes have exactly the same TRAV5 and TRAJ5 usage. Because alpha chain don't have a D region, in theory these clonotypes, if have the same VJ usage, they should have the same alpha chain CDR3 sequences, however, in the table they have very different CDR3α aa sequences. I wish the author could double check their analysis and I apologize in advance if I raise such questions based on wrong knowledge.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for carefully reading our manuscript. Although the two clonotypes, donor #8 clonotype post_6 and _7, have the exactly same TRAV5 and TRAJ5 usage, they have different CDR3a aa sequences due to random nucleotide addition in the rearrangement. Likewise, donor #27 clonotype post_1 and donor #13 clonotype post_15 had the same TRAV9-2 and TRAJ17 usage but different CDR3a.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Related to my public review 1. To make a solid conclusion, I think the author can include more sustainers and decliners if possible, can just stimulate their PBMCs for 10 days and check the Tfh features in proliferated CD4 T cells (e.g. IL21 secretion, PD-1 expression etc). And then compare these values in sustainers vs decliners</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Unfortunately, additional PBMCs from more sustainers and decliners are not available to us. Instead, we carefully described the current observation in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Related to my public review 3. The author can attempt to sort CXCR5+ cTfh and CXCR5- non cTfh, stimulate in vitro for 10 days and compare whether the stimulated cTfh still have more Tfh-related features such as increased IL-
21 secretion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer recommended, sorting and culturing the cTfh and non cTfh separately will clarify this issue. Due to the limitation of the samples, we could not perform these experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) I couldn't find information about the availability of data and code to analyze the single cell RNA-seq dataset in the manuscript</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We clarified the availability of data and added the codes for the single cell RNA-seq dataset in the revised manuscript.</p>
