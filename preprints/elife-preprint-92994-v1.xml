<title>Abstract</title><p>The balanced gut microbiota in intestinal mucus layer plays an instrumental role in the health of the host. However, the mechanisms by which the host regulates microbial communities in the mucus layer remain largely unknown. Here, we discovered that the host regulates bacterial colonization in the gut mucus layer by producing a protein called Chitinase 3-like protein 1 (Chi3l1). Intestinal epithelial cells are stimulated by the gut microbiota to express Chi3l1. Once expressed, Chi3l1 is secreted into the mucus layer where it interacts with the gut microbiota, specifically through a component of bacterial cell walls called peptidoglycan. This interaction between Chi3l1 and bacteria is beneficial for the colonization of bacteria in the mucus, particularly for gram-positive bacteria like <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. Moreover, a deficiency of Chi3l1 leads to an imbalance in the gut microbiota, which exacerbates colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). By performing fecal microbiota transplantation from Villin-cre mice or replenishing <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice, we were able to restore their colitis to the same level as that of Villin-cre mice. In summary, this study shows a “scaffold model” for microbiota homeostasis by interaction between intestinal Chi3l1 and bacteria cell wall interaction, and it also highlights that an unbalanced gut microbiota in the intestinal mucus contributes to the development of colitis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intestinal homeostasis is crucial for maintaining human health[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Alterations in gut microbiota composition have been linked to various diseases including cancer, obesity, and neurological disorders[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Dysbiosis, which refers to an imbalance in gut microbiota, is characterized by decreased microbial diversity, the presence of harmful microbes, or absence of beneficial ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Studies in mice models lacking key components of mucus have shown increased susceptibility to colitis and dysbiosis in the mucosal layer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence gut microbiota is a fundamental goal in microbiome research[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Growing evidence suggests that colonization of the gut mucosal layer can affect the susceptibility and progression of intestinal diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome, and celiac disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), are characterized by chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Although the cause of the inflammatory bowel disease is unclear, mouse models lacking the key components of the mucus are predisposed to colitis, accompanied by dysbiosis in mucosa[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], which is in accordance with increased epithelial-adherent microbial communities in biopsies from patients with IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the gut microbiota of CD patients compared with healthy controls, and these differences were only present in mucosal samples (not stool samples), suggesting that bacteria in the mucosal layer may be more important for the development of IBD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Donaldson et al. discovered that the intestinal flora utilizes host immunoglobulin A (IgA) for mucosal colonization, indicating that the host may secrete certain factors to maintain intestinal flora homeostasis in the mucus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. However, the mechanisms regulating gut microbiota colonization in the mucosal layer remain largely unknown. We aim to investigate the regulation of microbial communities in gut mucus and its implications in intestinal diseases.</p>
<p>Chitinase 3-like protein 1 (Chi3l1, also known as YKL-40 in humans) is a secreted protein that belongs to the glycosylhydrolase 18 family[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Despite its name, Chi3l1 can bind to chitin but does not have chitinase activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. In our investigation, we noticed that chitin and peptidoglycan, a major component of bacterial cell walls, have similar structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Based on this information, we speculate that Chi3l1 might also interact with peptidoglycan and, therefore, interact with bacteria. Interestingly, Chi3l1 is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and the lamina propria. We hypothesize that Chi3l1 may be secreted by intestinal epithelial cells and regulate the gut microbiota through its interaction with peptidoglycan in the mucous layer. In our study, we discovered that gut microbiota induce the expression of Chi3l1 in epithelial cells. Once expressed, Chi3l1 is secreted into the mucosa and interacts with bacteria, particularly with the bacterial cell wall component peptidoglycan. This interaction promotes bacterial colonization, especially of beneficial bacteria such as <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. As a result, mice with higher levels of Chi3l1 are less susceptible to colitis.</p>

<title>Intestinal epithelial cells express Chi3l1 induced by gut microbiota</title>
<p>The gut microbiota’s composition is shaped by host factors, including IgA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], RegIIIγ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], and TLR-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Yet, specific host factors which maintain the homeostasis of the microbiota remain largely undefined. Drawing on the theory of co-evolution between the host and microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], we propose that host factors, which are induced by bacteria in the gut, could play a pivotal role in regulating bacterial colonization and composition. In a previous study, it was observed that both live <italic>E.coli</italic> and heat-killed <italic>E.coli</italic> treatment resulted in a significant increase in the expression of the gene encoding Chi3l1 in human intestinal organoids[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. To verify this finding, we conducted immunohistochemical staining on intestinal tissue sections of germ-free and specific pathogen free (SPF) C57BL/6J wildtype mice. We observed a substantial increase of Chi3l1 expression in SPF mice compared to germ-free mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The intestinal epithelium comprises various cell types, including intestinal cells, goblet cells, endoentercrine cells, Tuft cells, Paneth cells, M cells, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. To identify the cellular sources of Chi3l1, we performed co-staining with markers for specific cell types, including Chromogranin A (ChgA) for enteroendocrine cells, Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin I (UEA-1) for goblet cells and Paneth cells, and Double cortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) for tuft cells. Our results revealed that Chi3l1 is primarily expressed in enteroendocrine cells in the ileum and goblet or Paneth cells in the colon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, Chi3l1 expression was not observed in tuft cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, we isolated total bacteria from wildtype mouse feces and treated DLD-1 cells (a colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line) with the bacterial extract for 12 hours. We found that the bacterial extract directly induced Chi3l1 expression in DLD-1 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). To examine whether the induction of Chi3l1 expression require a specific bacteria strain, we further identified the bacterial extract using 16S rRNA sequencing. Our results revealed that <italic>E.coli</italic> specifically stimulated Chi3l1 expression in DLD-1 cells, while <italic>Staphylococcus Sciuri</italic> did not have the same effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Next, we wondered what component of bacteria can induce Chi3l1 expression. We tried heat-killed <italic>E.coli</italic>, which maintains bacterial cell wall integrity. We found that treatment of DLD-1 cells with heat-killed <italic>E.coli</italic> also led to an induction of Chi3l1 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). These findings suggest that the induction of Chi3l1 expression does not necessarily require live bacteria and that bacterial components alone are sufficient to induce this response. To further investigate the specific bacterial component responsible for Chi3l1 induction, we tested lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a classical component of <italic>E.coli</italic>. Our results showed that LPS treatment of DLD-1 cells can induce Chi3l1 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Collectively, these findings provide evidence that the gut microbiota can induce Chi3l1 expression in intestinal epithelial cells.</p>

<title>Chi3l1 interact with bacteria via peptidoglycan</title>
<p>Chi3l1 belongs to a group of proteins called non-enzymatic chitinase-like proteins, which are known to bind chitin. Chitin is a polysaccharide present in the exoskeleton of arthropods and the cell walls of fungi[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. By comparing the structure of chitin with that of peptidoglycan (PGN), a component of bacterial cell walls, we observed that they have similar structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that Chi3l1 may interact with gut bacteria through PGN. To test our hypothesis, we conducted co-incubation experiments where we mixed recombinant mouse Chi3l1 (rmChi3l1) with either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria and then precipitated the bacteria through centrifugation. We found that rmChi3l1 was present in the pellet obtained from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting that Chi3l1 can directly interact with bacteria.</p>

<p>To further investigate the interaction between Chi3l1 and PGN, we also co-incubated PGN with rmChi3l1 and precipitated the PGN through centrifugation. PGN is an insoluble substance and hence can be precipitated by centrifugation. Consistent with our previous results, we observed that rmChi3l1 was present in the pellet obtained from PGN but not in the pellet obtained from bovine serum albumin (BSA), which served as a negative control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, we also examined the interaction between PGN and recombinant human Chi3l1 (rhChi3l1) and obtained similar results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). These findings indicate that Chi3l1 interacts with bacteria through PGN.</p>

<title>Intestinal bacteria are disordered in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice, especially Gram-positive bacteria</title>
<p>To gain initial insights into how the expression of Chi3l1 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) affects the colonization of gut microbiota, we created mice with a specific deficiency of Chi3l1 in IECs (referred to as IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). We then conducted bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing analysis of the colon contents of both Villin-cre and IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> littermates. Our analysis of alpha diversity revealed that the bacterial population was relatively lower in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> littermates compared to Villin-cre littermates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This finding was further confirmed by conducting universal bacterial 16S rRNA qPCR analysis of the feces and ileum contents of IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> and Villin-cre littermates, which also showed lower bacterial enrichment in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, principal component analysis demonstrated significant differences in bacterial diversity between Villin-cre and IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> littermates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>When we examined the relative abundance of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria between Villin-cre and IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> littermates, we observed that Gram-positive bacteria were significantly reduced in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice, while there was no notable difference in Gram-negative bacteria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This result was further validated by staining lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a component present on Gram-positive bacteria, which revealed a lower abundance of Gram-positive bacteria in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> compared to Villin-cre littermates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Moreover, visualization of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> by bacteria FISH staining, a dominant group of Gram-positive bacteria in the gut, also showed reduced levels of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in the colon lumen of IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice compared to Villin-cre mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Analysis of the relative abundance of specific Gram-positive bacterial species demonstrated a significant reduction in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice compared to Villin-cre mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Similar results were observed in Chil1<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to wildtype mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). These findings suggest that Chi3l1 plays a role in regulating the colonization of Gram-positive bacteria, particularly <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, in the murine gut.</p>

<title>Chi3l1 promotes the colonization of Gram-positive bacteria in intestinal mucus</title>
<p>Chi3l1 was found in secretory cells like goblet cells and Paneth cells, suggesting that it may be secreted into the intestinal lumen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Immunohistochemistry staining of Chi3l1 in the colon revealed a large amount of Chi3l1 signals in the mucus layer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Immunofluorescence co-staining of Chi3l1 with UEA-1 in the colon yielded similar results (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Furthermore, Chi3l1 was also detected in the ileum and colonic tissues and mucus layer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). These findings indicate that mouse Chi3l1 is specifically expressed in intestinal secretory epithelial cells and secreted into the intestinal lumen. Since large amounts of Chi3l1 is secreted into the mucus and Chi3l1 interact with bacteria, we hypothesize that Chi3l1 may regulate the colonization of Gram-positive bacteria in the mucus layer. To test this hypothesis, we isolated bacterial DNA from the ileum and colon mucus of both wildtype and Chi11<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Quantification of Gram-positive bacteria and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> using qPCR revealed that both the ileum and colon mucus of Chi11<sup>-/-</sup> mice had significantly lower levels of Gram-positive bacteria and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> compared to that of wildtype mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>&amp;F).</p>

<p>To rule out the effects of Chi3l1 on the host contributed to colitis, we pretreated the mice with antibiotics to eliminate gut microbiota before inducing colitis (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). The Universal bacterial 16S rRNA qPCR data indicated that the majority of gut microbiota were eliminated after antibiotics treatment (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). However, the IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice exhibited a milder colitis phenotype, including slower body weight loss, longer colon length, and less inflammation compared to the Villin-cre mice (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4C-E</xref>). We believe that this could be due to the relationship between Chi3l1 and inflammation. Based on these findings, it is apparent that Chi3l1’s effects on gut microbiota play a more significant role in colitis.</p>
<p>To further elucidate the role of Chi3l1-regulated gut microbiota in colitis, we conducted fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> transplantation experiments. We first eliminated gut microbiota through a 10-day course of antibiotics and then performed FMT from Villin-cre mice or administered oral gavage of <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> to IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> mice for 2 weeks, followed by a 7-day period of 2% DSS feeding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The intricate relationship between gut bacteria and their host organisms plays a crucial role in maintaining health. Key to this relationship are the processes of co-evolution and co-speciation, which help maintain balance within the gut microbiota community. Understanding how the host influences these bacterial communities is critical to comprehend the complex interplay between host and gut bacteria. In this study, we uncovered the direct interaction between Chi3l1 and gut microbiota via bacterial cell wall component-peptidoglycan, thereby helping mucous colonization of gut microbiota, especially Lactobacillus, which is beneficial for host against colitis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Furthermore, the “scaffold model” of host Chi3l1 directly interacting with microbial PGN, as reported in our study, could significantly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms through which other bacteria colonize the gut.</p>

<caption><title>A schematic working model.</title>
<p>Intestinal epithelial cells are stimulated by the gut microbiota to express Chi3l1. Once expressed, Chi3l1 is secreted into the mucus layer where it interacts with the gut microbiota, specifically through a component of bacterial cell walls called peptidoglycan. This interaction between Chi3l1 and bacteria is beneficial for the colonization of bacteria in the mucus, particularly for gram-positive bacteria like <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. Moreover, a deficiency of Chi3l1 leads to an imbalance in the gut microbiota, which exacerbates colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="560754v1_fig6.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Several studies have suggested a potential correlation between Chi3l1 and bacteria. For instance, it has been demonstrated that Chi3l1 is produced by intestinal epithelial cells in enteritis disease and aids in the elimination of pathogenic bacteria in the gut by neutrophils[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Another study observed an increase in Chi3l1 expression in mammary tissues of dairy cows infected with pathogenic E. coli, which promoted the recruitment of neutrophils[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, Chi3l1 was found to be induced during <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infection, where it enhanced bacterial elimination by preventing the death of lung macrophages and improving host tolerance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Additionally, a study in mouse colonic epithelial cells showed that Chi3l1 enhances bacterial infection and adhesion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. However, the specific mechanism underlying the relationship between Chi3l1 and the gut microbiota has not been fully explored, likely due to a lack of Chi3l1-specific knockout mice. Here, by using intestinal Chi3l1-specific knockout mice, we demonstrated a new function of Chi3l1 in gut, which shapes bacterial colonozation through direct interaction with bacterial cell wall component, PGN. Moreover, Chi3l1-regulated gut microbiota, especially <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, offers protection against colitis.</p>
<p>In our study, we demonstrated that heat-killed bacteria can induce the expression of Chi3l1 in intestinal epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). This suggests that the component of the bacterial cell wall is sufficient to induce Chi3l1 expression. The bacterial cell wall is a complex structure mainly composed of peptidoglycan, but it may also contain other components such as teichoic acids and lipoteichoic acid in gram-positive bacteria, or an outer membrane containing various polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins in gram-negative bacteria[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Our findings indicated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the bacterial cell wall, can slightly increase Chi3l1 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">G</xref>), but higher levels of LPS do not further enhance Chi3l1 expression (data not shown). This suggests that there might be other components of the cell wall that can induce Chi3l1 expression in intestinal epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Peptidoglycan, which is a major component of the bacterial cell wall, is composed of polysaccharide chains alternating with N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM). These chains are crosslinked through a tetrapeptide[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. We showed that Chi3l1 can directly interact with peptidoglycan (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C&amp;D</xref>). Given the structural similarity between chitin and peptidoglycan (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), it is likely that Chi3l1 binds to the polysaccharide chains rather than the tetrapeptide in peptidoglycan. Previous studies have investigated the crystal structure of human Chi3l1 in complex with chitin, revealing a binding groove with different subsites for chitin fragments[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Other studies have also identified specific amino acids in chitinases that play a key role in the interaction with chitin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, further investigation is necessary to better understand the binding sites in Chi3l1 for peptidoglycan.</p>
<p>In the colon, there are two distinct parts of the mucus layer. The inner layer is attached and has a low number of microbes, while the outer layer is looser and densely populated by microorganisms. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The diversity of bacteria in the mucus layer is similar to that found in the gut lumen[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Our study found that mice lacking the Chi3l1 gene had fewer Gram-positive bacteria, particularly <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, compared to normal mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-H</xref>). This was confirmed by qPCR data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). However, not all Gram-positive bacteria were reduced in these mice, as we found an increase in <italic>Turicibacter</italic> in the colon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>) and feces (data not shown). We believe this may be due to a combined effect of the host and gut microbiota. Another important factor for microbial growth in the colon is the integrity of the mucus barrier[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].We noticed a thinning of the mucus barrier in the mice lacking Chi3l1 compared to normal mice (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3 A</xref>&amp;<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). However, we did not observe an increase in mucin-degrading bacteria such as <italic>Bacteroides</italic> or <italic>Allobaculum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] or a decrease in mucin-producing cells in these mice. We think that there may be bacteria that aid in the formation of the gut mucus, and these bacteria are decreased in mice lacking Chi3l1.</p>
<p>In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the density and diversity of the microbial community in the intestines are reduced. Specifically, there is a decrease in <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and an increase in <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and facultative anaerobic bacteria like <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. However, the cause of colitis in IBD is still a subject of debate. Our data shows that a deficiency of Chi3l1 in intestinal epithelial cells leads to dysbiosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Mice without Chi3l1 are more susceptible to colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) compared to normal mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-E</xref>). However, when we transplanted fecal microbiota from normal mice or supplemented with <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> in mice without Chi3l1, DSS-induced colitis was significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-I</xref>). These results suggest that disruptions in the gut microbiota contribute to colitis. In summary, our study demonstrates that bacterial challenge induces the expression of Chi3l1 in intestinal epithelial cells. Once produced, Chi3l1 is released into the mucus layer where it interacts with the gut microbiota, particularly through peptidoglycan, a primary component of bacterial cell walls. This interaction is beneficial for the colonization of bacteria, especially gram-positive bacteria like <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, in the mucus layer. Dysbiosis resulting from a lack of Chi3l1 exacerbates DSS-induced colitis, highlighting the role of dysbiosis as a contributing factor to colitis.</p>

<title>Immunoblot and silver staining</title>
<p>Protein extraction from cultured cells involved lysing the cells in 2% SDS lysis buffer, which is prepared by dissolving 2g of SDS powder in 100ml of sterilized ddH2O. Bacteria or peptidoglycan precipitates were resuspended in MES buffer, which contained 25mM MES, 25mM NaCl, and had a pH of 6.0. For protein extraction from mice ileum and colon tissues, 30mg of snap-frozen tissues were homogenized in 1ml of RIPA buffer, which contained 10mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 1% TritonX-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 140mM NaCl, 1mM PMSF, and a proteinase inhibitor. The lysates were then supplemented with 5x SDS loading buffer to a final concentration of 1x. The resulting mixture was subsequently boiled at 100°C for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 4°C and 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatants were collected for western blot analysis. The supernatants were separated using a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST buffer (containing 0.1% Tween-20 in tris-buffered saline) and sequentially incubated with primary antibodies and appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies. Protein bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent with a Minichemi Chemiluminescence Imaging System. The primary antibodies used included anti-Chi3l1 (RD, MAB2649, 1:2000) and anti-alpha-Actinin (Cell Signaling, 69758S, 1:1000). The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-Rat-IgG (Cell Signaling, 7077s, 1:1000) and goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen, 62-6520, 1:1000). For silver staining, the PAGE gel was subjected to silver staining using a fast-silver staining kit (Beyotime, P0017S) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<title>DNA extraction for 16S rRNA analysis</title>
<p>For isolation of luminal contents from murine ileum and colon, a 9 cm section of ileum and 3 cm section of colon were cut open longitudinally, and luminal contents were scratched off into a pre-weighed 2-ml sterile freezing vial. The weight of the contents was recorded for further processing. For isolation of mucus from murine ileum and colon, tissues were flushed with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS into a pre-weighed 2-ml sterile freezing vial after removal of the liminal contents. The mucus was then pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was removed. For feces isolation, fresh murine feces were collected into a sterile freezing vial weighing 2 ml, and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For bacterial DNA extraction, DNA was extracted and purified following the manufacture’s protocol using the EIANamp stool DNA kit (TIANGEN, DP328-02).</p>

<title>Microbiota 16S rRNA gene sequencing</title>
<p>Fecal samples, ileum contents, and colon contents were collected from wildtype, Chil1<sup>-/-</sup> littermates, or Villin-cre, IEC<sup>ΔChil1</sup> littermates and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The microbial genomic DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA sequencing was performed by Biomarker Technologies. The hypervariable regions V3 and V4 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were sequenced using universal primers that flank these regions V3 (338F 5’-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-3’) and V4 (806R 5’-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3’). The sequencing was done using the IIIumina Sequencing platform. The resulting 16S rRNA gene sequences were analyzed using scripts from the BMK Cloud platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biocloud.net">www.biocloud.net</ext-link>). The microbial classification was performed using the SILVA138 and hierarchical clustering algorithms. The OTUs were determined by clustering the sequences with 97% similarity and were classified into different taxonomic ranks. The relative abundance of each bacterial species was visualized using R software. The raw 16S rRNA gene sequencing data can be accessed on the BMKCloud platform under the project ID Microbial_updateReport_20211221092022313.</p>

<title>16S qPCR analysis</title>
<p>Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR green master mix (Thermo Fisher, A25742) in triplicates. This was done on a Real-Time PCR QuatStudio1 with accompanying software, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). The abundance of specific bacterial groups in the intestine was determined using qPCR with either universal or bacteria-specific 16S rRNA gene primers. Standard curves were constructed with <italic>E.Coli OP50</italic> 16S rRNA gene, which was amplified using conserved 16S rRNA primers. It should be noted that qPCR measures the number of 16S gene copies per sample, not the actual bacterial numbers or colony forming units.

<p>The manuscript by Chen et al. investigated the interaction between CHI3L1, a chitinase-like protein in the 18 glycosyl hydrolase family, and gut bacteria in the mucosal layers. The authors provided evidence to document the direct interaction between CHI3L1 and peptidoglycan, a major component of bacterial cell walls. In doing so, Chi3l1 produced by gut epithelial cells regulates the balance of the gut microbiome and diminishes DSS-induced colitis, potentially through the colonization of protective gram-positive bacteria such as lactobacillus.</p>
<p>The study is the first to systemically document the interactions between Chi3L1 and microbiome. Convincing data were shown to characterize the imbalance of gram-positive bacteria in the newly generated gut epithelial-specific Chi3L1 deficient mice. Comprehensive FMT experiments were performed to demonstrate the contributions of gut microbiome using the mouse colitis model. However, the manuscript could've been strengthened by additional mechanistic studies concerning the binding between Chi3l1 and peptidoglycan, and how this interaction could facilitate the colonization of gram-positive bacteria. Additionally, the conclusion by the authors that disordered intestinal bacteria in gut epithelial-specific Chi3L1 deficient mice, rather than an effect by host cells, contributes to exacerbated colitis, needs further validation. In fact, the fact that FMT did not completely rescue the phenotype may point to the role of host cells in the processes. On the contrary, there is an existing body of literature demonstrating the detrimental roles of Chi3l1 in the mouse IBD model, conflicting with the current study. The differences in study design and approaches in these studies that lead to controversial findings will need to be discussed.</p>
<p>Specifically,</p>
<p>1. In Figure 1, it is curious that the authors only chose E.coli and staphytlococcus sciuri to test the induction of Chi3l1. What about other bacteria? Why does only E.coli but not staphytlococcus sciuri induce chi3l1 production? It does not prove that the gut microbiome induces the expression of Chi3l1. If it is the effect of LPS, does it trigger a cell death response or inflammatory responses that are known to induce chi3l1 production? What is the role of peptidoglycan in this experiment? Also, it is recommended to change WT to SPF in the figure and text, as no genetic manipulation was involved in this figure.</p>
<p>2. In Figure 2, the binding between Chi3l1 and PGN needs better characterization, regarding the affinity and how it compares with the binding between Chi3l1 and chitin. More importantly, it is unclear how this interaction could facilitate the colonization of gram-positive bacteria.</p>
<p>3. In Figure 3, the abundance of furmicutes and other gram-positive species is lower in the knockout mice. What is the rationale for choosing lactobacillus in the following transfer experiments?</p>
<p>4. FDAA-labeled E. faecalis colonization is decreased in the knockouts. Is it specific for E. faecalis, or it is generally true for all gram-positive bacteria? What about the colonization of gram-negative bacteria?</p>
<p>5. In Figure 5, the fact that FMT did not completely rescue the phenotype may point to the role of host cells in the processes. The reason that lactobacillus transfer did completely rescue the phenotypes could be due to the overwhelming protective role of lactobacillus itself, as the experiments were missing villin-cre mice transferred with lactobacillus.</p>
<p>6. Conflicting literature demonstrating the detrimental roles of Chi3l1 in mouse IBD model needs to be acknowledged and discussed.</p>

<p>Chen et al. investigated the regulatory mechanism of bacterial colonization in the intestinal mucus layer in mice and its implications for intestinal diseases. They demonstrated that Chi3l1 is a protein produced and secreted by intestinal epithelial cells into the mucus layer upon response to the gut microbiota, which has a turnover effect on facilitating the colonization of gram-positive bacteria in the mucosa. The data also indicate that Chi3l1 interacts with the peptidoglycan of the bacteria cell wall, supporting the colonization of beneficial bacteria strains such as Lactobacillus, and that deficiency in Chi3l1 predisposes mice to colitis. The inclusion of a small but pertinent piece of human data added to solidify their findings in mice.</p>
<p>Overall, the experiments performed were appropriate and well executed, but the data analysis is incomplete and needs to be extended. Also, additional experiments are necessary for clarification and stronger support for their conclusions.</p>
<p>1. Images are of great quality but lack proper quantification and statistical analysis. Statements such as &quot;substantial increase of Chi3l1 expression in SPF mice&quot; (Fig.1A), &quot;reduced levels of Firmicutes in the colon lumen of IECChil1&quot; (Fig.3F), &quot;Chil1-/- had much lower colonization of E.faecalis&quot; (Fig.4G), or &quot;deletion of Chi3l1 significantly reduced mucus layer thickness&quot; (Supplemental Figure 3A-B) are subjective. Since many conclusions were based on imaging data, the authors must provide reliable measures for comparison between conditions, as long as possible, such as fluorescence intensity, area, density, etc, as well as plots and statistical analysis.</p>
<p>2. In the fecal/Lactobacillus transplantation experiments, oral gavage of Lactobacillus to IECChil1 mice ameliorated the colitis phenotype, by preventing colon length reduction, weight loss, and colon inflammation. These findings seem to go against the notion that Chi3l1 is necessary for the colonization of Lactobacillus in the intestinal mucosa. The authors could speculate on how Lactobacillus administration is still beneficial in the absence of Chi3l1. Perhaps, additional data showing the localization of the orally administered bacteria in the gut of Chi3l1 deficient mice would clarify whether Lactobacillus are more successfully colonizing other regions of the gut, but not the mucus layer. Alternatively, later time points of 2% DSS challenge, after Lactobacillus transplantation, would suggest whether the gut colonization by Lactobacillus and therefore the milder colitis phenotype, is sustained for longer periods in the absence of Chi3l1.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Chen et al. are addressing a fundamental question in mammalian gut biology, namely how the host controls a mutualistic host-microbiota symbiosis. The authors focus on a protein called Chitinase 3-like protein 1 (Ch3l1) and its interaction with the protective colonic mucus layer. The rationale for the study comes from previous work showing that microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) can induce Ch3l1 in vitro, but its biological functions in the colon are unknown. In this study, the authors provide evidence supporting the claim that the gut microbiota induces the expression of Ch3l1 in vivo, mainly in mucus-producing goblet cells. Insightfully, the authors note that Ch3l1, although it lacks enzyme (chitinase) activity, still binds Chitin, a glycan that has structural similarity to bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan. This leads the authors to hypothesize that Ch3l1 binds microbial cell walls, particularly those of peptidoglycan-rich Gram-positive probiotic bacteria within the mucus, to promote their retention in the colon. Using a combination of in vivo work with mice conditionally lacking Ch3l1 in gut epithelium (IEC Ch3l1 KO); microbiota profiling; imaging of host-microbiota interactions with labeled microbes; and fecal transplants, the authors provide compelling evidence that Ch3l1 is secreted into the gut mucus layer and that the presence of Ch3l1 is associated with increased levels of beneficial Gram+ bacteria, including Lactobacillus spp. In turn, using a well-characterized colitis model, the authors show that Ch3l1 is associated with protection from intestinal injury caused by Dextran Sodium Sulfate. While these studies are novel and informative, there are several issues that undermine the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors nicely link microbial induction of Ch3l1 to mucosal protection from intestinal injury. This is done through the use of germ-free and ex-germ-free studies and by comparing Ch3l1 expression in situ between them; microbial sequencing between Control and IEC Ch3l1 KO mice, and clinical and histological injury metrics between these strains. The authors convincingly demonstrate the presence of Ch3l1 in the gut mucus through imaging, and that the deletion of this protein in mice alters the microbiota by reducing the relative abundance of Gram-positive species.</p>
<p>The study employs a technically diverse set of analyses to address their hypothesis, including fluorescent labelling of microbial species for add-back studies, fecal transplants to distinguish the role(s) of the microbiota vs. host in the IEC Ch3l1 KO phenotypes in the intestinal challenge models.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The claim that mucus-associated Ch3l1 controls colonization of beneficial Gram-positive species within the mucus is not conclusive. The study should take into account recent discoveries on the nature of mucus in the colon, namely its mobile fecal association and complex structure based on two distinct mucus barrier layers coming from proximal and distal parts of the colon (PMID: ). This impacts the interpretation of how and where Ch3l1 is expressed and gets into the mucus to promote colonization. It also impacts their conclusions because the authors compare fecal vs. tissue mucus, but most of the mucus would be attached to the feces. Of the mucus that was claimed to be isolated from the WT and IEC Ch3l1 KO, this was not biochemically verified. Such verification (e.g. through Western blot) would increase confidence in the data presented. Further, the study relies upon relative microbial profiling, which can mask absolute numbers, making the claim of reduced overall Gram-positive species in mice lacking Ch3l1 unproven. It would be beneficial to show more quantitative approaches (e.g. Quantitative Microbial Profiling, QMP) to provide more definitive conclusions on the impact of Ch3l1 loss on Gram+ microbes.</p>
<p>Other weaknesses lie in the execution of the aims, leaving many claims incompletely substantiated. For example, much of the imaging data is challenging for the reader to interpret due to it being unfocused, too low of magnification, not including the correct control, and not comparing the same regions of tissues among different in vivo study groups. Statistical rigor could be better demonstrated, particularly when making claims based on imaging data. These are often presented as single images without any statistics (i.e. analysis of multiple images and biological replicates). These images include the LTA signal differences, FISH images, Enterococcus colonization, and mucus thickness.</p>
