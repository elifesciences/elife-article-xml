<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Exercise is generally beneficial for health but strenuous exercise can have detrimental effects on the gastrointestinal tract. The combination of ischemia and heat shock during exercise is a crucial contributor to intestinal epithelial damage. Growing evidence points towards an important regulatory role of gut microbes in intestinal homeostasis. Here, we characterize and compare the effects of moderate and vigorous exercise training on intestinal epithelial damage, stress response, inflammatory response, and gut microbiota alterations in mice and investigate the mechanisms underlying exercise-induced intestinal injury. Exercise training for six weeks caused heat stress in the intestine, resulting in the disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and local inflammation. This was characterized by increased colonic HSP-70 and HSF-1 protein expression, increased epithelial permeability, decreased colonic expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin and intestinal morphological changes. Daily moderate exercise training caused hereby more severe injury than vigorous training on alternating days. Furthermore, exercise training altered the gut microbiota profile. The abundance of <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> was reduced, potentially contributing to the deteriorated intestinal status, while the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> was increased, especially following vigorous training. This increase in short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria following vigorous training possibly counteracted the impairment of the intestinal barrier function. In summary, exercise disrupts the intestinal barrier function, with vigorous exercise training with intermittent rest days being less damaging than daily moderate exercise training.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Exercise has favourable effects on the human body and its benefits on the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and endocrine systems are well-documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. However, an increasing number of studies points to simultaneous adverse effects of exercise on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and our previous study demonstrated that endurance exercise increases the gut permeability in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Strenuous exercise, such as marathon running, cycling or triathlon events, is considered a contributing factor to gastrointestinal symptoms and can induce the so-called exercise-induced GI syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. This syndrome, characterized by bloating, nausea or diarrhoea, is caused by two distinct pathways: the neuroendocrine-GI pathway and the circulatory-GI pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. The first pathway is associated with an increase in sympathetic activation and a consequent inhibition of GI function. The core of the latter pathway is the redistribution of blood flow to working muscles and peripheral circulation, reducing visceral perfusion. Exercise can lead to a reduction in superior mesenteric artery blood flow by up to 43% in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. This results in local ischemia and hypoxia in the intestine, increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activating signalling pathways that lead to increased gut permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Moreover, exercise raises the body core temperature and causes heat stress that activates signalling pathways that reduce epithelial barrier function and causes widespread damage to intestinal epithelium, including shrinking and sloughing of villi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Although there is great inter-individual variation, the threshold and degree of intestinal injury may correlate with exercise intensity and environmental temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The negative impact of strenuous exercise on the GI environment involves disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity formed by protein complexes called tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs). These junctional complexes form a “seal” between adjacent cells and act as gatekeeper of the gut barrier. Our previous study showed that combined hypoxic and hyperthermal exposure to co-cultured colonic epithelial cells increases paracellular permeability and activates oxidative stress and heat stress pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), acting as molecular “chaperones” protecting cells from environmental stress, are upregulated under heat stress, assisting with protein synthesis, assembly, and degradation and maintaining the viability and proliferative capacity of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Increased HSPs observed in the gut of athletes after endurance competitions prevent TJ breakdown and protect the cytoskeleton of intestinal epithelial cells from hypoxia and hyperthermia-related damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition, exercise training modulates the composition of the intestinal microbiota which may affect the normal intestinal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], however, the underlying mechanisms of this effect remain elusive. This is the first murine study that compares intestinal alterations induced by exercise training at different intensities (moderate and vigorous) and durations (2, 4 and 6 weeks) and investigates the mechanisms behind exercise-induced intestinal injury. The aim was to identify the key regulators of this “destruction and reconstruction process” following exercise.</p>

<label>2.1.</label><title>Animals and experimental design</title>
<p>Male C57BL/6J mice at 9 weeks of age were randomly divided into the following groups: control (CON, n = 60), moderate treadmill exercise training (MOD-EX, n = 60), and vigorous treadmill exercise training (VIG-EX, n = 60). In each group, the mice were randomly divided into 3 subgroups by their euthanasia time points: 2, 4, and 6 weeks of intervention (n = 20, respectively). For details see Supplementary Information.</p>

<label>2.2.</label><title>Treadmill running exercise protocol</title>
<p>A 3-day progressive exercise training regime was adapted to familiarize the MOD-EX and VIG-EX mice to a rodent treadmill where the speed and incline of the track were incrementally increased. From day 4 to 15, the mice followed a fixed training regime. To ensure that the exercise straining remained strenuous, starting from day 15 and day 29, the running speed of the MOD-EX group and the VIG-EX group was increased. The outline of the time points for exercise training, rest and sacrifice are depicted in Supplementary Fig. S1. For details see Supplementary Information.</p>

<p>Exercise-induced changes in gut permeability following 2, 4 or 6 weeks of treadmill training were evaluated by measuring the leakage of the fluorescent molecule FITC-Dextran (4 kDa) into the blood after oral administration. Neither moderate (MOD-EX) nor vigorous (VIG-EX) treadmill training affected intestinal FITC-Dextran permeability after 2 weeks of training. Four weeks of MOD-EX, however, significantly increased the serum FITC-Dextran concentration, indicating increased barrier leakage across the intestinal epithelium. After 6 weeks of training, the serum FITC-Dextran concentration was significantly elevated in both MOD-EX and VIG-EX compared to the control mice (CON) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Immunofluorescent staining for TJ protein occludin (OCLN) was conducted to visualize its localization in the colonic villus structures. In the colon of untrained CON mice, OCLN formed a continuous mesh-like pattern in longitudinal villi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-i</xref>) and a clear ring pattern in cross-sectional villi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-iv</xref>). A brush-like appearance of OCLN was observed in compact columnar cells at the tips of the villi in CON (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-i</xref>, arrowhead). Exercise training of either intensity induced a disturbed cellular distribution of OCLN and significant loss of columnar cells in mouse colonic villi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-ii, -iii</xref>). Moreover, concentrated protein clusters and a more diffuse and cytosolic distribution were observed in cross sections of the villi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-v, -vi</xref>). In addition, the OCLN localization was evaluated in proximal small intestinal (duodenal) and distal small intestinal (ileal) sections where group differences were less pronounced (Supplementary Fig. S3). OCLN localized at the cell membrane showed continuous chain-like structures forming the rim of normal duodenal and ileal villi in CON, which is less clear following exercise training (Supplementary Fig S3).</p>
<p>The changes in the TJ network after exercise were confirmed by Western blotting. Both MOD-EX and VIG-EX decreased OCLN protein expression in the mouse colon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In addition, the protein expression of ZO-1 significantly decreased in MOD-EX, while VIG-EX did not affect ZO-1 expression but enhanced CLDN3 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, E</xref>).</p>

<label>3.2.</label><title>Exercise elevates rectal temperature and induces a heat stress response in mouse colon</title>
<p>The thermal effects of exercise on the mouse intestine were determined by measuring rectal temperature and the expression of heat shock-related proteins/transcription factors. During the 6 weeks of treadmill training, the rectal temperature of CON narrowly fluctuated around the baseline (37.8 ± 0.1°C, mean ± SEM, <italic>sic passim</italic>) within approx. 0.5°C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The rectal temperatures of MOD-EX and VIG-EX were significantly increased 15 min after exercise compared to CON and reached 39.0 ± 0.1°C and 38.7 ± 0.1°C, respectively, at week 6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, the rectal temperature between the two exercise groups was not significantly different.</p>

<p>At week 6, after the final running session, the mouse colon tissue was collected and the protein levels of HSP-70, the conserved ubiquitously expressed protein of the heat shock protein family, and the transcription factor HSF-1, the primary mediator of transcriptional responses to heat stress, were determined. Both MOD-EX and VIG-EX significantly enhanced the abundance of HSF-1 in the colon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Correspondingly, the protein abundance of chaperone HSP-70 was increased in both exercise groups, without significant differences between MOD-EX and VIG-EX (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<label>3.3.</label><title>Exercise training alters intestinal morphology and induces local intestinal inflammation in mice</title>
<p>Following 6 weeks of training, proximal and distal small intestine and colonic sections were examined to determine the effect of exercise training on intestinal histomorphology. In CON, limited inflammatory infiltration was observed. CON showed well-distended villi from base to tip in the proximal small intestine (duodenum), distal small intestine (ileum) and colon, and the mucosal and submucosal architecture was intact (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Intestinal villus length is correlated to the digestive and absorptive functions of the intestine, as it affects surface area of the digestive tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. The duodenal villus length was significantly shorter in MOD-EX compared to CON (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D</xref>), while this effect was less pronounced in VIG-EX. No significant changes in villus length were observed in the ileum after exercise training (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), but blunted and deformed villi were distinct characteristics in the duodenum and ileum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, asterisk) of both exercise groups.</p>

<p>However, significantly fewer goblet cells were counted in the ileum of VIG-EX, suggesting a possibly impaired mucus production, while no significant differences were observed between MOD-EX and CON (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). No significant changes in the number of goblet cells were observed in the duodenum after exercise training (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>In MOD-EX and VIG-EX, mucosal or submucosal infiltration of leukocytes combined with occasional intestinal haemorrhage was detected in the duodenum, ileum and colon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, solid arrows, and arrowheads). Additionally, in MOD-EX, ulceration and submucosal widening were observed in all parts of the intestine of MOD-EX (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, Uc) and submucosal widening and submucosal oedema were observed in duodenal, ileal and colonic sections in VIG-EX (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, asterisks, solid arrows, dashed arrows and Sw). These alterations caused a significantly higher morphological score of duodenum and ileum in MOD-EX and VIG-EX and of colon in MOD-EX compared to CON (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the serum concentration of CRP, a marker for global inflammation secreted by the liver, was increased following 6 weeks of MOD-EX (Supplementary Fig. S4A) but not VIG-EX, suggesting mildly elevated systemic inflammation with MOD-EX. However, quantification of several circulating cytokines/chemokines showed that the levels of pro-inflammatory G-CSF, CXCL1 and CCL2 were not significantly different between the groups (Supplementary Fig. S4B-D).

<p>Following 6 weeks of exercise training, caecal contents were collected and the concentrations of the six most abundant SCFAs (formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate and valerate), lactate and four amino acids that are universally utilized by gut microbes to produce SCFAs (alanine, methionine, valine and threonine) were determined 1 h after the final exercise bout. VIG-EX, but not MOD-EX, increased caecal levels of acetate, butyrate and propionate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-D</xref>), but decreased formate and valerate concentrations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, F</xref>).

<p>The microbiome of all groups was dominated by bacteria belonging to the phylae <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> or <italic>Firmicutes,</italic> and MOD-EX and VIG-EX only caused a decrease of <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic> (from 2.31 ± 0.90% to 0.02 ± 0.00% and 0.03 ± 0.01%, respectively) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). However, the microbial composition of MOD-EX and VIG-EX differed from that of CON at family level. <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> accounted for 10.3 ± 4.0% of total caecal bacteria in CON but their abundance was reduced to less than 1% in MOD-EX and VIG-EX (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Microbiome taxonomic abundance was further analysed using LEfSe analyses which identifies discriminating bacterial taxa between groups based on statistical significance and biological relevance.

<label>4.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Strenuous exercise can dysregulate the intestinal homeostasis that is tightly linked to the function of the intestinal barrier, affecting nutrient absorption and the defence against pathogens and toxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Here we investigated the intestinal alterations induced by exercise training of different intensities (moderate and vigorous) and outlined the mechanisms behind exercise-induced intestinal injury. This study found that continuous moderate intensity exercise imposed greater damage on the mouse intestine than vigorous intensity exercise with intermittent rest days. Increased intestinal SCFA production observed with vigorous exercise training may hereby have compensated the exercise-induced intestinal damage.</p>
<p>In this study, the difference in exercise intensity was reflected in different average running speeds, durations and frequencies. The average running speed of VIG-EX was 43-49% higher than that of MOD-EX but VIG-EX only ran 30% of the MOD-EX running time. This resulted in a lower total distance run by VIG-EX compared to MOD- EX (11,835 m vs 26,174 m). Notably, 4 weeks of MOD-EX (16,674 m) was sufficient to increase intestinal permeability, which was first observed at week 6 in VIG-EX (11,835 m). Substantial differences in running speed and distance may lead to distinct changes in energy metabolism, which can be the underlying cause of the differences observed in intestinal parameters (e.g. microbiota composition and metabolite levels) between the two exercise groups. Exercise training can modulate energy metabolism by affecting caloric intake and our recent study indeed demonstrated that mice that trained at a moderate treadmill running speed ate more high fat high cholesterol diet than untrained mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Strenuous exercise in humans, on the other hand, suppresses appetite and food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Here, no significant differences in body weight or food intake between the groups were observed. As we did not assess the feeding events throughout training and rest days separately, we cannot exclude that different exercise training intensities affected dietary patterns.</p>
<p>As a response to heat stress during exercise, heart rate and blood flow are increased to accelerate heat dissipation. Molecular chaperones, such as heat shock proteins HSP-70 and HSP-90, dissociate from HSF-1 to perform their reparative roles by assisting protein refolding and by promoting the degradation of misfolded proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. This also allows HSF-1 to stimulate the transcription of target genes that help to cope with such proteotoxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. We observed that the expression of HSP-70 and HSF-1 in the colon was elevated one hour after the final training, indicating that the effect of heat stress caused by both moderate and vigorous exercise continues after exercising and may cause (intestinal) tissue damage. Interestingly, after 6 weeks, only MOD-EX elevated the level of serum CRP, potentially suggesting more severe intestinal damage and systemic inflammation following moderate rather than vigorous exercise training. This was in line with elevated morphological scores and significantly shortened villi with MOD-EX. However, circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were undetectable or not significantly elevated after 6 weeks, indicating overall low systemic inflammation in these healthy mice. It may be of interest to study the inflammatory response to moderate and vigorous exercise over time to establish whether CRP levels in MOD-EX subside after an initial induction or whether VIG-EX also elevates circulating CRP after a longer training period. Here, it would also be meaningful to assess whether the frequency of intermittent rest days can modulate whole-body and intestinal inflammation and whether these effects are directly linked to the intestinal barrier function. A clinical study showed a link between exercise intensity and small intestinal permeability, however, all groups trained at the same frequency, making it difficult to assess the importance of rest days in the recovery of the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Of note, high-intensity interval training was found to have superior beneficial effects on cardiovascular function and the metabolic syndrome compared to moderate intensity continuous training [71,72]. Nonetheless, clinical studies on the effects of exercise intensity and frequency on intestinal injury and pro-inflammatory disease drivers are lacking.</p>
<p>Functionally, both MOD-EX and VIG-EX after 6 weeks increased intestinal leakage which correlated positively with rectal temperature. This increase in intestinal permeability is likely causally linked to impaired intestinal epithelial tight junction expression and localization. After 6 weeks of exercise training that induced elevated rectal temperatures, occludin and ZO-1 protein expression was lower in MOD-EX colon compared to CON, implicating heat stress as the causal factor. Another <italic>in vivo</italic> study also showed that heat stress can induce severe intestinal barrier damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, claudin-3 protein expression increased after 6 weeks of exercise. This might be a compensatory mechanism to help maintain the integrity of the tight junctions, since Poritz <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that the increase of claudin-1 compensated the loss of ZO-1 in a murine colitis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> we previously observed an increase of AJ protein E-cadherin, accompanied by a decrease of the TJ proteins ZO-1, claudin-3 and occludin, in a hypoxia- and heat-exposed Caco-2/HT-29 co-culture model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Conversely, several other studies described an exercise-induced upregulation of TJ proteins (e.g. claudin-1, claudin-5 and occludin) as markers of enhanced barrier function in the gut and even in other organs with mild exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Together, these studies highlight the complexity of the intestinal tight junction network in response to physical exercise.</p>
<p>Both intensities of exercise training altered the the gut microbiota composition which may directly affect the integrity of the intestinal epithelium. For example, the effects of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and its derivatives on preserving TJ protein expression and distribution in the intestinal tract have been proven in various <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Here, both intensities of exercise training diminished the presence of caecal <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, potentially contributing to the observed intestinal barrier disruption. In future studies, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-enriched diets or gut microbiota transplants could be introduced to observe whether the addition of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> can counteract the intestinal leakage from moderate to vigorous exercise training.</p>
<p>SCFAs are the products of microbial fermentation of non-digestible oligosaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. These metabolites, like butyrate, can improve gut barrier function by enhancing mucin and TJ protein ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], and exert a general protective effect on the host by enhancing immunity and their anti-inflammatory capacity under stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Bacteria such as <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, <italic>Prevotellaceae</italic>, and <italic>Butyricicoccaceae</italic>, which are strongly associated with SCFA production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], were significantly more abundant in both exercise groups. This may arise from the decrease of commensal lactobacilli, lifting the inhibitory effect of environmental acidification on the growth of e.g. <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Moreover, the increased activity of endogenous antioxidants after SCFA supplementation has been demonstrated in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], suggesting that SCFAs also modulate the oxidative stress pathways. The increase of SCFA production in the gut may also contribute to increased muscle strength/growth and whole-body energy expenditure through increased fatty acid oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], or interact specifically with GPR41 and GPR43, stimulating the secretion of incretins involved in whole-body metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. This underlines the important reciprocal link between SCFAs and whole-body homeostasis. In fact, VIG-EX, with increased abundance of <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> spp. and significantly elevated SCFAs, which correlated with GPR41 and 43 expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], demonstrated less severe intestinal damage than MOD-EX. Accordingly, we speculate that exercise training with intermittent rest days (VIG-EX) is more favourable (or less harmful) to the colonization and reproduction of these SCFA-producing species than daily exercise (MOD-EX). While exercise can cause intestinal epithelial damage and activation of HSPs, changes to the microbiota composition and the enhanced production of SCFAs may be part of the positive adaptation to chronic exercise training that compensate for exercise-induced GI stress.</p>
<p>In addition, 6 weeks of VIG-EX significantly reduced caecal amino acid concentrations. This decrease could be related to increased intestinal leakiness or associated with elevated SCFA production, since total caecal SCFAs correlated negatively with total caecal amino acids. Amino acids can be utilized by intestinal microorganisms to synthesize structural proteins and serve as precursors of SCFAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Increased leakiness, on the other hand, could also promote increased influx of muscle-derived lactate during exercise that can also serve as precursor of microbially produced SCFAs, thus providing extra energy by subsequent fatty acid oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. As no significantly increased caecal lactate levels were observed after exercise, it can be speculated that lactate was quickly converted and/or metabolized soon after exercise. Lactate production increases significantly with increasing running speed in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. In line, we speculate that in VIG-EX, higher circulating lactate levels during and immediately after the vigorous exercise contributed to the increased SCFA production. This and other exercise-induced fluxes of metabolites and their effect on gut microbes should be investigated further.</p>
<p>In summary (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), exercise elevated the core body temperature, leading to heat stress and increased intestinal epithelial permeability characterized by disruption of the TJ network. Meanwhile, exercise training also altered the gut microbiota and reduced the abundance of <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> that may have contributed to the deteriorated intestinal status, indicating a novel cause of intestinal injury from exercise training. On the other hand, exercise training increased the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria such as <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, potentially as a compensatory response to alleviate intestinal injury.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study examines how different exercise training intensities affect intestinal barrier function and gut microbiota composition over a 6-week period in mice. The evidence supporting the main claims about exercise-induced intestinal injury and microbiota changes is <bold>solid</bold>, featuring comprehensive histological analysis, molecular characterization, and metabolomic profiling, though key mechanistic insights and causal relationships remain to be established. The findings have practical implications for understanding exercise-induced gastrointestinal stress, particularly the observation that daily moderate exercise may be more damaging to intestinal integrity than vigorous exercise with rest days. Additional experimental validation would strengthen these conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This article investigated the relationship between different intensities of exercise training and intestinal barrier dysfunction, and further explores the possible mechanisms, including the contribution of stress response, inflammatory response, gut microbiota alterations, and derived metabolites.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This article mainly focused on different aspects of the phenotypes and the morphology of intestinal barrier dysfunction induced by exercise training.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This article lacks the verification of the association of causality among various phenotypes and lacks a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of how exercise contributes to intestinal barrier dysfunction.</p>
<p>(1) For example, the author claimed that heat shock and ischemia are the causes of intestinal epithelial damage caused by exercise, and it is not only evidenced by detecting the expression of a few regulators, such as HSF and HSP70 after exercise; and by Immunohistochemical analysis of intestinal morphology and inflammation.</p>
<p>(2) Many kinds of intestinal bacteria could produce short-chain fatty acids, such as Faecalibacterium Prausnitzii, did the authors check their abundance in the intestine after exercise training?</p>
<p>(3) How to define exercise intensity? Was VO2 Max testing used in this study?</p>
<p>(4) As the strict control, it is recommended to set 4 groups of exercise training groups: daily vigorous exercise training, daily moderate exercise training, daily vigorous exercise training with intermittent rest days, and daily moderate exercise training with intermittent rest days.</p>
<p>(5) Are there any differences in diet and metabolism between different groups of mice, which may affect the phenotypes, especially the composition and the the diverstiy of gut microbiota?</p>

<p>Lian et al. provide novel and exciting findings related to exercise-induced intestinal injury that have many implications for those engaging in any kind of training protocol. The authors continue to provide data demonstrating that different forms of exercise training impart a unique signature to the gut microbiota. The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and contains ample information in all sections. The figures are displayed in a clear and comprehensible format, with elegant images. I do have a few concerns regarding some aspects of the paper listed below, but otherwise, I feel that the authors clearly state their objectives, implement valid methods, and summarize their findings with the appropriate conclusions given their experimental constraints.</p>
<p>(1) The authors performed extensive experiments demonstrating the immediate effects of a bout of exercise on intestinal integrity throughout a 6-week training program. Additionally, the authors go as far as to show that successive exercise sessions appear to augment the observed damage. This is very important and noteworthy data. But I wonder, had the endpoint collections been taken 24 hours+ after the last exercise bout, would the findings be different? My concern is that the 1-hour time point is biased towards seeing more damage. I understand the acute effects of exercise occur and are important to report, but they can be transient, and adaptations ensue. My main concern is that the data shows the onset of the initial damage, but nothing addresses an adaptive or recovery response that could counter the observed exercise-induced intestinal injury. Even metrics such as stool consistency/ pellets per hour/ abnormal defecation measurements could indicate the function of the GI system after exercise and may offer more information related to damage vs recovery.</p>
<p>(2) An additional concern arises with the model of forced treadmill running. It was previously shown that forced treadmill running resulted in more gut damage compared to voluntary wheel running, with or without dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis (PMID: 23707215). This type of training appears to be very important in initiating damage to the GI. Understanding how much of this is related to the chosen exercise protocol, forced treadmill running, will be very important for future experiments. Exercise intensity has been suggested to be a major factor in exercise-induced intestinal damage. Therefore, the group designated as MOD-EX in this paper may be over the intensity threshold that limits GI damage. The protocols used in this manuscript may be inherently biased towards enhancing exercise-induced GI damage, which is not necessarily negative, especially when a damaging protocol is needed. However, how much this relates to and can be translated to humans is not clear and needs further experimentation.</p>
<p>(3) I think the comparison between groups at the specified time point is important, but I believe additional comparisons should be included that show within-group differences across each time point. For example, in the Mod group, does FITC- dextran change between 4 and 6 weeks? Are there morphological change differences between 2, 4, and 6 weeks within each group? Essentially addressing a progression in damage as a function of the duration of exercise training. The authors clearly show exercise-induced damage to the GI, but we do not know how this damage is handled or if the continuation of exercise continues to reinforce the disruption in the epithelial cells.</p>
<p>(4) The authors describe the purpose of this study as being to identify key regulators of the destruction and reconstruction process of the GI after exercise (introduction lines 128-129). While the authors did sufficient work to describe certain contributing factors, I do not believe they have provided compelling data on the key regulators of exercise-induced intestinal injury, at least experimentally they did not perform exhaustive experiments to identify such. Nor did the authors include data showing any kind of reconstruction that occurs in the GI after exercise. I believe the authors need to revise this statement to reflect that they investigated certain or specific regulators of the damage response in the intestines after exercise training.</p>
<p>(5) Was water intake monitored and recorded per group? If so I think it would be important to include in the supplemental data. Fluid intake/proper hydration can also contribute to changes in the microbiome and if the data is available, it would complement the food intake. If for any reason the exercise groups were taking in less fluid it may be a confounding factor that should be considered.</p>
<p>(6) Methods section - Treadmill running exercise protocol, line 143, I think there is a typo with &quot;exercise straining&quot;. Did the authors mean to write &quot;exercise training&quot;? If it is indeed a typo, the same appears in the supplemental material under the same section.</p>
<p>(7) The microbiome analysis is sufficient, and the authors speculate on the possible consequences of the observed changes to the microbiota. However, I believe Figures 5E-G are misleading. The positive correlation is present because of the increase in gut leakiness and the observed exercise-induced increase in microbes. However the same correlation could be made with any positive adaptation to exercise and the observed gut leakiness. I believe those correlations, as described now, postulate these microbes (members of the family Lachnospiraceae) are associated with increased gut leakiness. However, this correlation is not compelling as it is, and additional experiments are warranted to justify this. It cannot be ruled out that the microbes are increasing due to exercise itself. Additionally, reports have suggested species within the Lachnospiraceae family do increase in response to exercise in mice and are associated with positive adaptations to exercise (PMID: 28862530, PMID: 37940330, PMID: 36517598). With this, it should be noted that Lachnospiraceae was also found to be negatively associated with endurance performance (PMID: 35002754). Therefore, specific species or stains of Lachnospiraceae may be highly responsive to exercise while others are not. Without deeper sequencing it is impossible to tease this out and therefore, the authors should be careful with any interpretation beyond discussing what is observed. Additionally, these correlations between Lachnospiraceae and gut leakiness should be interpreted cautiously or more experiments should be included which demonstrate these microbes are connected to gut leakiness. Much more research is needed to determine exactly what strains are positively and negatively associated with exercise adaptations and performance.</p>
