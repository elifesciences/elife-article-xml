<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Posttranslational modifications of epigenetic modifiers provide a flexible and timely mechanism for rapid adaptations to the dynamic environment of cancer cells. SIRT1 is an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent epigenetic modifier whose activity is classically associated with healthy aging and longevity, but its function in cancer is not well understood. Here, we reveal that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, calcitriol), the active metabolite of vitamin D (VD), promotes SIRT1 activation through auto-deacetylation in human colon carcinoma cells, and identify lysine 610 as an essential driver of SIRT1 activity. Remarkably, our data show that the post-translational control of SIRT1 activity mediates the antiproliferative action of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. This effect is reproduced by the SIRT1 activator SRT1720, suggesting that SIRT1 activators may offer new therapeutic possibilities for colon cancer patients who are VD deficient or unresponsive. Moreover, this might be extrapolated to inflammation and other VD deficiency-associated and highly prevalent diseases in which SIRT1 plays a prominent role.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last decades the study of genetic lesions in tumour cells provided key insights into the deregulated signalling pathways that promote cell proliferation and invasiveness and suppress senescence. In addition, increasing evidence from epidemiological studies suggests a significant impact of non-genetic modifiable factors on the oncogenic process by affecting cell epigenetics and thus, gene expression and phenotype. The key metabolic sensor SIRT1 acts an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase and a critical post-translational modifier and epigenetic regulator. As such, SIRT1 promotes efficient energy utilisation and cellular defences in response to environmental challenges, whereas its dysregulation accelerates age-related diseases such as diabetes and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bonkowski and Sinclair, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most diagnosed malignancy in women, the third in men, and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with an incidence estimated to increase by 60% by 2030 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bray et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>). Many observational/epidemiological studies suggest that vitamin D (VD) deficiency is a risk factor for developing and dying of cancer, particularly for CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Feldman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Grant et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">2021</xref>), albeit data from supplementation studies in the human population are controversial. Confirmation of a clinically relevant anti-CRC effect of VD in well-designed prospective randomized studies is still pending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chandler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Henn et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Manson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Muñoz and Grant, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Song et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>VD in humans has two origins: synthesis in the skin by the action of solar ultraviolet radiation on 7-dehydrocholesterol and the diet. The active VD metabolite is 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, calcitriol), which results from two consecutive hydroxylations of VD, the first in the liver and the second in the kidney or in many epithelial and immune cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bikle and Christakos, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Feldman et al., 2014</xref>). VD actions are mediated by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> binding to a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, the VD receptor (VDR). Upon ligand binding, VDR regulates the expression of hundreds of target genes, many of which are involved in calcium and phosphate homeostasis, bone biology, immune response, metabolism, detoxification, and cell survival, proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bikle and Christakos, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carlberg and Muñoz, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carlberg and Velleuer, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Feldman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fernández-Barral et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with a protective role of VD against CRC, the colonic epithelium expresses high levels of VDR. Many studies in CRC cells and associated fibroblasts and in experimental animals have shown a large series of VDR-mediated VD anti-CRC effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carlberg and Muñoz, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carlberg and Velleuer, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Feldman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fernández-Barral et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ferrer-Mayorga et al., 2019</xref>) In support, germline deletion of <italic>Vdr</italic> in mice with constitutively active Wnt/β-catenin signalling, as a main driver of CRC, results in increased intestinal tumour load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Larriba et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, certain evidence links SIRT1 and VD. First, decreased SIRT1 activity has been linked to the pathogenesis of CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Strycharz et al., 2018</xref>). However, using SIRT1 level as a marker of malignancy is controversial since both increased or decreased SIRT1 tumour expression have been described in different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carafa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Firestein et al., 2008</xref>), which points to a discrepancy between SIRT1 level and activity. Second, SIRT1 deacetylates the VDR to enhance its activity in kidney and bone cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sabir et al., 2017</xref>) and, consequently, decreased SIRT1 activity may drive VD insensitivity. Third, promoter-bound VDR increases <italic>SIRT1</italic> gene expression in kidney and liver cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>) and thus, VD deficiency may decrease SIRT1 levels leading to reduced activity. However, whether VD alters SIRT1 activity <italic>per se</italic> and/or SIRT1 protein expression in CRC remains unclear.</p>
<p>Here we reveal that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> induces specific SIRT1 activity at multiple levels in human CRC cells. Notably, liganded VDR post-translationally increases SIRT1 activity through auto-deacetylation. Mechanistically, SIRT1 K610 is identified as a critical player for 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3-</sub>enhanced VDR-SIRT1 interaction, SIRT1 auto-deacetylation and activation. This occurs independently of increased SIRT1 RNA and protein expression and elevated cofactor (NAD<sup>+</sup>) levels. Discrepant SIRT1 level and activity may explain the controversial role of SIRT1 as tumor suppressor or tumor promoter in CRC. Our results provide a new mechanistic insight into the association of VD deficiency with CRC and suggest potential therapeutic benefit for SIRT1 activators in SIRT1-positive CRC.</p>

<title>1,25(OH)2D3 increases SIRT1 level via the VDR in CRC cells</title>
<p>The question of whether VD governs SIRT1 activity in CRC was first approached in two well characterized CRC cell lines, HCT 116 and HT-29. Immunofluorescence analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>) revealed that SIRT1 protein level doubled in response to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, a result confirmed by Western blotting of nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The increased expression of SIRT1 protein by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> could be explained by a 2-fold upregulation of SIRT1 RNA revealed by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1C</xref>). The induction of <italic>CYP24A1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>), a major VDR target gene in many cell types served as control for 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> activity.</p>

<p>VDR expression is the main determinant of cell responsiveness to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and is downregulated in a proportion of patients with advanced CRC, implying that these patients would probably not benefit from the anticancer effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ferrer-Mayorga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Larriba and Muñoz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pálmer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peña et al., 2005</xref>). To model CRCs patients with low VDR tumour level or with VD deficiency, we used an HCT 116-derived cell line stably depleted of VDR using shRNA (hereafter named ShVDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Larriba et al., 2011</xref>). Induction of <italic>SIRT1</italic> gene expression by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> was confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis in ShControl but not in ShVDR cells, although basal SIRT1 levels were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>). At the protein level, confocal imaging showed reduced SIRT1 protein in ShVDR as compared to ShControl cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>), suggesting that VDR contributes to maintaining basal SIRT1 protein expression. Western blot analyses on nuclear extracts confirmed that ShControl cells responded to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> with increased SIRT1 protein levels in contrast to the unresponsiveness of ShVDR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Moreover, the upregulating effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> was specific for SIRT1, since the expression of the other nuclear sirtuin, SIRT7, was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Together, these data indicated that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> specifically increased SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels in CRC cell lines via VDR. This is important because SIRT1 depletion and/or sirtuin activity decay might represent an important neglected mediator of VD deficiency and a target for intervention in CRC. Whether VD controls sirtuin activity independently of sirtuin level in CRC is a critical issue that deserved further exploration.</p>

<title>1,25(OH)2D3 induces SIRT1 deacetylase activity in CRC cells</title>
<p>Evaluation of global sirtuin activity in the nuclei of CRC cells revealed that treatment with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> increased NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase activity 1.5-fold as compared to control untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). NAD<sup>+</sup> is a cofactor required for sirtuin activity. Metabolic control of the level of NAD<sup>+</sup> represents an important node for sirtuin regulation and could explain the induction of general sirtuin activity by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. Indeed, nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> level doubled in response to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in human CRC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, whether 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> could specifically increase SIRT1 activity remained unknown.</p>

<p>Liganded VDR interacts with SIRT1 in kidney and bone cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sabir et al., 2017</xref>) suggesting that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> might alter SIRT1 expression or activity via post-transcriptional mechanisms. Since protein-protein interactions regulate stability and activity of proteins, the ability of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> to promote VDR-SIRT1 interaction in CRC cells was evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation assays. The results revealed that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> potently (4-fold) enhanced VDR/SIRT1 complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>). To test if this interaction alters SIRT1 activity, the acetylation status of two specific SIRT1 substrates (FOXO3a and H3K9) was evaluated as a read out of SIRT1 deacetylase activity in response to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. Acetyl-lysine immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting demonstrated efficient deacetylation of FOXO3a in response to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Likewise, the level of acetylated histone H3K9 (Ace H3K9) dramatically decreased in response to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref>), indicating specific activation of SIRT1 by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. The effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> was mediated by VDR since ShVDR cells did not show Ace H3K9 deacetylation in response to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, whereas ShControl cells maintained the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Importantly, the specific SIRT1 activator SRT1720 reduced Ace H3K9 levels in both ShControl and ShVDR cells, thus mimicking 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> action independently of VDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>The ability of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> to increase protein deacetylation mediated by SIRT1 could be driven either by elevated SIRT1 level or by increased SIRT1 activity. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> deacetylase assay using equivalent amounts of immunoprecipitated SIRT1 from cells treated or not with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. SIRT1-specific deacetylase activity was enhanced 3-fold in cells treated with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> despite similar levels of immunoprecipitated SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these results indicated that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> induces nuclear SIRT1 activity. This implies that VD deficiency and/or loss of tumour VDR expression (both observed in a proportion of CRC patients) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Evans et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ferrer-Mayorga et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Giardina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Larriba et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pálmer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peña et al., 2005</xref>) may negatively impact SIRT1 deacetylase activity and prompted us to examine samples of CRC patients.</p>

<p>Immunohistochemical analysis of human colon tumor tissue microarrays (TMAs) from the Biobank of Hospital Clínico San Carlos (HCSC, Madrid) revealed a significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.017) positive association between the levels of VDR and SIRT1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). An additional TMA containing healthy colon samples was used to compare tumor and nontumor tissues. The level of VDR protein was usually lower in tumour samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>), while SIRT1 protein expression showed high variability between tumors and high cellular intratumor heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D-E</xref>). Globally, TMA data suggested that SIRT1 protein levels in tumor samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>), are subjected to high variability, which hampers statistical significance even though for SIRT1 gene expression, differences were statistically significant as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p>
<p>Global acetylation also showed high cellular intratumor heterogeneity and variability between samples without statistically significant differences between tumor and nontumor samples (data not shown), showing that is not a valid, specific read out of SIRT1 activity. As an alternative approach, the levels of SIRT1 protein and its substrate Ace H3K9 were compared first in intestinal cell lines and then in human tumours. Surprisingly, SIRT1 protein level increased in CRC cells as compared to normal HIEC6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F</xref>). However, increased SIRT1 levels coincided with elevated Ace H3K9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F</xref>), indicating SIRT1 inactivation in CRC cells. The results in cell lines encouraged us to evaluate the potential discordance of SIRT1 and Ace H3K9 levels in fresh-frozen samples from paired tumor and nontumor colonic tissue of patients from Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón (HUFA). All tissues were evaluated to have at least 85% of tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Western blotting allowed simultaneous detection of SIRT1 and Ace H3K9. Notably, whereas the level of SIRT1 protein variably increased or decreased from nontumor to tumor tissues in different patients, acetylation of its specific substrate H3K9 consistently increased in tumor samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3G</xref>), reflecting SIRT1 inactivation as found in carcinoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> deacetylation assays performed on SIRT1 immunoprecipitated from SIRT1-positive patient samples confirmed a common decrease of SIRT1 activity in colon tumor tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3H</xref>). Western blotting illustrated the variability of SIRT1 level among tumors and its correlation with VDR level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3I</xref>), while Ace H3K9 levels are generally high, but variable. Importantly, in vitro deacetylation assays on SIRT1 immunoprecipitated from the same samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3J</xref>) confirmed Ace H3K9 as a <italic>bona fide</italic> read out of SIRT1 inactivation. The discrepancy between the levels of SIRT1 protein expression and activity in tumor samples may solve the controversy previously reported regarding the use of SIRT1 as a tumor biomarker and poses the question of how 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> specifically enhances SIRT1 deacetylase activity.</p>

<title>1,25(OH)2D3 induction of SIRT1 activity is mediated through auto deacetylation</title>
<p>Since SIRT1 catalyses its auto deacetylation as a mechanism to increase its deacetylase activity towards other substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fang et al., 2017</xref>) and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> facilitates VDR-SIRT1 interaction, we explored the possibility that liganded VDR increases SIRT1 activity by facilitating SIRT1 auto deacetylation. To evaluate SIRT1 acetylation status upon exposure to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, nuclear extracts from CRC cells challenged or not with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> were immunoprecipitated using anti-acetyl-lysine antibodies and subjected to Western blotting. 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> greatly reduced the nuclear pool of acetylated SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Remarkably, the specific SIRT1 activator SRT1720 also drove SIRT1 deacetylation in HCT 116 CRC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Consistently, ShVDR cells did not reduce acetylated SIRT1 in response to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> but retain their response to SRT1720 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref>).

<p>Next, we sought to get further insight into the mechanism of regulation of SIRT1 activity by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. As the acetyltransferase EP300 acetylates and inactivates SIRT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Han et al., 2008</xref>) and is critical for CRC cell signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chocarro-Calvo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gutiérrez-Salmerón et al., 2020</xref>), we used the ASEB engine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) to search for SIRT1 residues potentially acetylated by EP300. This approach identified K610, a lysine conserved from mouse to human, as a potential EP300 target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>). The role of K610 in the regulation of SIRT1 activity was assessed by generating a non-acetylable K610R mutant, which should be resistant to inactivation through acetylation. We compared the enzymatic activity of K610R SIRT1 with that of wild type (WT) and inactive H363Y SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Vaziri et al., 2001</xref>). Nuclear extracts from cells transfected with MYC-tagged SIRT1 WT or mutants were immunoprecipitated using anti-acetyl-lysine antibodies. Western blotting using an anti-MYC antibody revealed that exogenous WT SIRT1 was acetylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>), as it was endogenous SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>). Of note, catalytically inactive H363Y SIRT1 was highly acetylated, in striking contrast with the lack of acetylation of the K610R SIRT1 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>), This highlights the importance of K610 for the regulation of SIRT1 activity.</p>
<p>Since interaction with VDR was important for SIRT1 deacetylation activity, the ability of each mutant to interact with VDR was compared in immunoprecipitation assays. The results revealed that the K610R SIRT1 mutation facilitated the interaction with VDR, whereas the inactive H363Y SIRT1 showed low interaction with VDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4F</xref>). This suggested that acetylation of SIRT1 might interfere with or destabilize its interaction with VDR, and that the ability of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> to favour VDR-SIRT1 interaction may allow SIRT1 auto deacetylation, and thus enhance its activity. The activity of mutant SIRT1 enzymes was first inferred from the level of Ace H3K9, which was lower in cells expressing K610R SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4G</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase assays were next used to compare the activity of WT and mutant SIRT1. Using equivalent amounts of immunoprecipitated MYC-tagged enzymes, we found a 10-fold higher deacetylase activity for the K610R mutant than for WT SIRT1, whereas as expected the H363Y inactive mutant exhibited very low activity as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4H</xref>).</p>

<title>SIRT1 activation mimics the antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in CRC cells unresponsive to VD</title>
<p>Collectively, our data indicated that the acetylation status of SIRT1 K610 is critically controlled and governs SIRT1 activity in the nuclei of CRC cells. By promoting VDR-SIRT1 interaction, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> facilitates SIRT1 auto deacetylation and enhances SIRT1 activity. These results suggest that SIRT1 is an effector of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and prompted us to ask whether the pharmacological activation of SIRT1 would rescue CRC cells that are unresponsive to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>The anticancer effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> are exerted at least partially through the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carlberg and Muñoz, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Muñoz and Grant, 2022</xref>). 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> strongly reduced the percentage of CRC cells in S-G<sub>2</sub>M cell-cycle phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>) and consequently, it lengthened the cell cycle and reduced CRC cell proliferation. We aimed to analyse the effect of the modulation of SIRT1 activity on the proliferation of CRC cells and on the antiproliferative action of 1,25(OH)2D3. Inhibition of general sirtuin activity with Nicotinamide (NAA) abolished the antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on CRC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Moreover, activation of SIRT1 by the small molecule SRT1720 mimicked the response to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and efficiently reduced the percentage of cells in S-G<sub>2</sub>M cell cycle phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>).

<p>As expected, in contrast with ShControl cells, ShVDR CRC cells did not extend the cell cycle in response to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Accordingly, an early and strong reduction in the proliferation rate in response to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> was noted in ShControl cells but it was almost absent in ShVDR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Specific SIRT1 activation with SRT1720 reduced the proliferation of ShControl cells at a comparable magnitude to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and, importantly, also reduced proliferation of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-unresponsive ShVDR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.5E</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results show that SIRT1 acts downstream of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-activated VDR in the inhibition of CRC cell proliferation. They also suggest that activation of SIRT1 in CRC patients with vitamin D deficiency or with VD unresponsive tumors (conditions frequently observed in advanced CRC), could be a therapeutic strategy to effectively antagonize cell proliferation.</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we reveal that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> activates the epigenetic regulator SIRT1 by acting at multiple levels. Ligand-activated VDR post-translationally upregulates SIRT1 activity by facilitating its auto deacetylation. Mechanistically, SIRT1 K610 is identified as essential to control VDR-SIRT1 interaction and SIRT1 acetylation status and activity. Notably, both SRT1720 and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> activate SIRT1 through auto deacetylation. Modulation of SIRT1 activity by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> through deacetylation occurs in addition to increased mRNA and protein levels as well as to an elevation of cofactor (NAD<sup>+</sup>) availability. Thus, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> activates SIRT1 acting at multiple levels, from gene expression to activity, and these findings broaden our understanding of how VD deficiency is associated with CRC.</p>
<p>We also show that SIRT1 deacetylase activity mediates the anti-proliferative action of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in CRC, which is in line with the recent proposal that SIRT1 activity opposes several cancer cell hallmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yousafzai et al., 2021</xref>). In cases of VD deficiency and/or unresponsiveness such as advanced colorectal tumor lacking VDR expression due to transcriptional repression by SNAIL1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pálmer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Larriba et al., 2009</xref>), the activation of SIRT1 by compounds other than 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> may be especially relevant. Clinical trials that explore SIRT1 activators in CRC are rare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov">https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>). Some trials are designed to study doses and pharmacokinetics of resveratrol, a known sirtuin activator that has many other targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Patel et al., 2011</xref>). Currently there are not known clinical trials using SRT1720 or alternative SIRT1 specific activators.</p>
<p>Consideration of SIRT1 protein level as a prognostic marker for cancer has received much attention, but conflicting results reporting both, tumor SIRT1 increases and decreases raised controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, some studies propose SIRT1 either as tumour suppressor or as tumor promoter in CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carafa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ren et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, SIRT1 protein level might not always reflect SIRT1 activity, and some tumors could possibly increase SIRT1 protein expression to counteract inactivation. Our results, which indicate the existence of discrepancies between SIRT1 levels and activity in human colorectal tumors, may help to resolve the controversy. Interestingly, alternative posttranslational SIRT1 modifications may have a similar outcome. For example, proteolytic cleavage of SIRT1 induced by TNFα in osteoarthritis renders accumulation of a catalytically inactive 75 kDa resistant fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Oppenheimer et al., 2012</xref>) that could be detected by immunohistochemistry. Since inflammation (in general) and especially TNFα is an important mediator of CRC, understanding if this fragment is generated in CRC patients and whether its presence would also lead to decreased SIRT1 activity in samples strongly positive for SIRT1 remains as an interesting unexplored issue.</p>
<p>The ability of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> to activate SIRT1 may have further major implications for physiological and pathological processes other than CRC since SIRT1 target proteins control several processes such as mitochondria physiology, apoptosis, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Strycharz et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> may not only regulate gene expression via direct transcriptional regulation of VDR-bound targets, but it can secondarily impact a wide range of events and processes via the control of SIRT1 activity. This may explain how 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> regulates the activity of FOXO3a, an important modulator of cell proliferation and the immune response that is targeted by SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">An et al., 2010</xref>). SIRT1 also modulates the activity of the tumour suppressor p53, whose mutation is a relatively early event in a high proportion of CRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Polidoro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Strycharz et al., 2018</xref>). In this way, SIRT1 activation greatly broaden the known vitamin D regulatory action, albeit whether 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> directs SIRT1 activity towards specific substrates remains to be elucidated. The accumulating evidence for SIRT1 involvement in chronic inflammation (Mendes et al., 2017) suggests a potential benefit of SIRT1 activation by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in chronic inflammation-linked CRC and other diseases. Moreover, the mechanism revealed here for SIRT1 activation by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> may be relevant for diseases associated with VD deficiency beyond CRC, including autoimmune disorders and diabetes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the multilevel activation of SIRT1 deacetylase by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> broadens the range of known 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> targets and positions SIRT1 as an important mediator of the protective action of VD against CRC and potentially other neoplasias and non-tumoral diseases. These data support SIRT1 activators as useful agents in situations of dysfunction of the VD system.</p>

<title>TMA, immunohistochemistry, and quantification</title>
<p>Tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 92 cores of stage 2 human CRC samples, were constructed using the MTA-1 tissue arrayer (Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie) for immunohistochemistry analysis. Each core (diameter 0.6 mm) was punched from pre-selected tumour regions in paraffin-embedded tissues. We chose central areas from the tumour, avoiding foci of necrosis. Staining was conducted in 2-μm sections. Slides were deparaffinized by incubation at 60°C for 10 min and incubated with PT-Link (Dako, Agilent) for 20 min at 95°C in low pH to detect VDR, SIRT1 and acetyl lysines. To block endogenous peroxidase, holders were incubated with peroxidase blocking reagent (Dako, Agilent) and then with (1:50) dilutions of antibodies: anti-VDR, anti-SIRT1 and (1:300) anti-acetyl lysine, overnight at 4°C. All previously described antibodies presented high specificity. After that, slides were incubated for 20 min with the appropriate anti-Ig horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polymer (EnVision, Dako, Agilent). Sections were then visualized with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (Dako, Agilent) as a chromogen for 5 min and counterstained with Harrys’ Haematoxylin (Sigma Aldrich, Merck). Photographs were taken with a stereo microscope (Leica DMi1). According to the human protein atlas (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org">http://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>), a human colon tissue was used as a positive control for immunohistochemical staining to determine anti-VDR concentration and a human testis tissue for anti-SIRT1. Immunoreactivity was quantified blind with a Histoscore (H score) that considers both the intensity and percentage of cells stained for each intensity (low, medium, or high) following this algorithm (range 0–300): H score = (low%) × 1 + (medium%) × 2 + (high %) × 3. Quantification for each patient biopsy was calculated blindly by 2 investigators (MJFA and JMU). VDR and SIRT1 showed nuclear staining, whereas acetyl lysines were nuclear and extranuclear.

<p>This study demonstrates that vitamin D-bound VDR increased the expression of SIRT1 and that vitamin D-bound VDR interacts with SIRT1 to cause auto-deacetylation on Lys610 and activation of SIRT1 catalytic activity. This is an <bold>important</bold> finding that is relevant to the actions of VDR on colorectal cancer. The data presented to support the presented conclusion are <bold>convincing</bold>.</p>

<p>This study demonstrates that vitamin D-bound VDR increased the expression of SIRT1 and that vitamin D-bound VDR interacts with SIRT1 to cause auto-deacetylation on Lys610 and activation of SIRT1 catalytic activity. This is an important finding that is relevant to the actions of VDR on colorectal cancer. The data presented to support the presented conclusion is convincing.</p>
<p>A strength of the study is that it is focused on a narrow group of conclusions.</p>
<p>The major weakness of the study is that the site of SIRT1 regulatory lysine acetylation is defined by mutational analysis rather than by direct biochemical analysis. This issue is partially mitigated by previous reports of K610 acetylation using mass spec (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.phosphosite.org/proteinAction.action?id=5946&amp;showAllSites=true">https://www.phosphosite.org/proteinAction.action?id=5946&amp;showAllSites=true</ext-link>). However, Fig. 4E is reassuring because it shows that the apparent acetylation of the K610 mutant SIRT1 appears to be lower than WT SIRT1</p>
<p>A second weakness of the study relates to the use of shRNA-mediated knockdown of VDR for some studies in which a previously reported cell line was employed. The analysis presented would be more compelling if similar data was obtained using more than one shRNA. Similarly, only a single siRNA for SIRT1 is presented in Table 1.</p>
<p>A third weakness of the study is that the conclusion that the VDR interaction with SIRT1 is the cause of auto-deacetylation rather than an associated event mediated by another mechanism would be more strongly supported by mutational analysis of SIRT1 and VDR residues required for the binding interaction. Will VDR increase SIRT1 activity when mutations are introduced to block the interaction? While the finding that catalytically inactive SIRT1 does not interact with VDR is helpful, this does not address the role of the binding surface.</p>
<p>A fourth weakness of the study is that it would be improved by testing the proposed hypothesis through in vitro reconstitution with purified proteins. Does VDR cause auto-deacetylation and activation of Sirt1 in vitro?</p>

<p>The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of vitamin D-mediated signaling through VDR, SIRT1, and Ace H3K9. They specifically emphasize the significance of K610 in SIRT1 within this signaling pathway. The article effectively presents a convincing and straightforward argument. The experiments conducted are meticulously executed, and the statistical analysis is sound. The inclusion of complex biochemistry details adequately covers the topic at hand. These findings hold great relevance to both normal and pathological physiology across different cell lineages, making them of considerable interest.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewers and appreciate their recommendations to improve this work.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p>
<p>Reviewer 1 recognizes that ‘This is an important finding that is relevant to the actions of VDR on colorectal cancer. The data presented to support the presented conclusion is convincing’.</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 identifies as a major weakness ‘that the site of SIRT1 regulatory lysine acetylation is defined by mutational analysis rather than by direct biochemical analysis.</p>
<p>However, as the reviewer mentions “previous reports of K610 acetylation using mass spec <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.phosphosite.org/proteinAction.action?id=5946&amp;showAllSites=true">https://www.phosphosite.org/proteinAction.action?id=5946&amp;showAllSites=true</ext-link>), and the absence of SIRT1 mutant K610R in the immunoprecipitates using anti-acetylated lysine antibodies presented in Fig. 4E clearly overcome this weakness”.</p>
<p>In addition, overall SIRT1 acetylation is reduced by vitamin D and by the specific SIRT1 activator SRT1720 as shown by decreased SIRT1 in the anti-acetyl-lysine immunoprecipates, (Fig. 4A and B).
The second weakness identified by Reviewer 1 concerns “the use of only one shRNA to deplete VDR in CRC cells.”</p>
<p>We have made efforts to demonstrate that the results are specific, though we do not have results with alternative shRNAs for a variety of reasons. To mitigate this issue, we have compared two colon cancer cells originating from the same patient which differ in the presence/absence of VDR. SW480, derive from the primary tumor and express VDR, whereas SW620 cells were derived from a lung metastasis and lack VDR. Similar, to the comparison of HCT116 with shVDR HCT116 cells presented in this study, VD induced SIRT1 levels in SW480 in contrast to a lack of induction in SW620, as shown in Author response image 1. This result provides support for the specificity of the shVDR.</p>

<p>The referee noticed the inclusion of an siRNA for SIRT1 in Table 1. We apologize for that, since this is an error, and no results are presented in this study with SIRT1 depletion. Table 1 has been modified accordingly.</p>
<p>Concerning the third and fourth weaknesses that Reviewer 1 identifies, we agree that mapping the interacting domains in both VDR and SIRT1 and in vitro reconstitution would improve the present study. However, we believe that these would constitute long-term studies that themselves are not strictly necessary at this stage. Consequently, we favor the publication of the present body of work. In vitro reconstitution of the present work and the putative relevance of the proposed mechanism of vitamin D action via SIRT1 on types of cancer other than colon (eg breast etc), are certainly very interesting and warrant further investigation.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p>
<p>This reviewer acknowledges that “…this study provides very interesting and solid information on the link between vitamin D and colorectal cancer. It is likely that this study will provide insight into the importance of vitamin D in other types of cancer. It may also lead to new therapeutic strategies for specific cases. This article is convincing, although the authors can improve their study as outlined…”</p>
<p>We acknowledge the proposed changes and recommendations, and have changed the text and Figures as suggested the by Reviewer as follows:</p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>Figure 1E and F: the cell lines used were described in the figure legend, but we agree that including the name in the figure brings more clarity and these are now added.</p>
<p>Figure 1G: the statistical analysis was for all panels of Figure 1 as described in the Figure legend (lines 731-32), We have amended the original omission of panels 1G and 1H. In panel G, * represents statistical analysis by ANOVA (comparing the four groups) whereas # was the analysis by Students t test (comparing the two indicated groups), where * or #p&lt;0.05. We hope to have clarified this point now.</p>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>Figure 2C: We showed originally the SIRT1/VDR interaction by immunoprecipitation of VDR and detection of SIRT1 in immunoprecipitates. We also showed immunoprecipitation of exogenously expressed Myc-SIRT1 (WT or mutants) and detection of VDR in immunoprecipitates (Figure 4F). The reviewer requests that we perform the inverse IP for endogenous SIRT1, that is immunoprecipitate SIRT1 and detect VDR in the immunoprecipates, which we now supply for the reviewer in Author response image 2.</p>

<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Figure 3D: ‘The authors should indicate the color of the different stainings’. Immunostainings have been revealed with DAB (diaminebenzidine); thus, positiveness is highlighted by light or dark brown according to their low or high protein expression. Counterstaining has been performed with hematoxilin, which stains nuclei in dark blue and cytoplasm in light blue.</p>
</list-item></list>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Do the authors mean that the secondary antibody marks in brown/red? If so, these results are inconsistent with the text considering that hematoxylin was used for non-tumor tissue. This part needs to be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for asking us to clarify this issue. Neither the primary nor anti-Ig horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies presented positiveness resulting from these antibodies individually. Therefore, secondary antibody does not mark in any color. Hematoxylin has been used as counterstaining for both non-tumor as well as for tumor tissues.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What about the level of FOXO3A in these tissues/tumors?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not prove the tumor sections for specific SIRT1 substrates such as FoxO3A since their levels may not entirely depend on SIRT1 specific deacetylation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What is the level of 1,25(OH)2D3 in these patients?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this referee that this information would be very useful, but unfortunately, we do not have data on vitamin D levels for these patients since they were not specifically recruited for this study and vitamin D levels are not routinely measured.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3D, the following information is missing: &quot;A detailed amplification is shown in the lower left of each micrograph.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We decided not to include the amplification in micrographs because the aim of the manuscript is focused on protein levels, not localization and including the amplification was more confusing than enlightening. This has been amended now in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3E, it says p=0.325, in the legend p&lt;0.01, and in the text there is a trend. Which is the correct version?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We really apologize for this misunderstanding. As stated in the Figure, p=0.325 and therefore it does not reach statistical significance. We have amended the main text and figure legend to report that differences between SIRT1 expression levels of healthy and cancer human colon samples are not statistically significant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 4</p>
<p>Figure 4F. The quality of the presented blots is not optimal. It needs to be improved. In addition, the number of independent biological experiments is not indicated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have substituted the representative western-blot and included statistical analysis of four independent biological replicates. Since 4F is now a bigger panel, it has required a slight reorganization of the whole Figure, but the rest of panels remain with the originals. Now we indicate in the figure legend that at least three independent biological replicas were analyzed. In addition, we supply below the four experiments for the reviewer in Author response image 3.</p>

<p>Regarding the last general comment concerning the number of independent experiments performed, this is indicated in the Figure legends (lines 732-36, 757-58, 82324, 840-41). All the in vitro experiments were performed at least as three independent experiments and not by repeating a western blot. A representative western blot is shown, and the statistical analysis corresponds to the analysis of the three biological replicates. For experiments with patient samples, the number of patients appears clearly indicated in the corresponding panel.</p>
