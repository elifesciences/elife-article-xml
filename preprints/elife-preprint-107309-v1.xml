<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The biological activities of organisms are closely linked to seasonality. Phenology, the temporal orchestration of biological activities, is governed by gene expression, yet the evolutionary dynamics underlying seasonal gene expression remain unclear. To investigate these dynamics, we compared genome-wide expression dynamics (molecular phenology) in four dominant evergreen Fagaceae species in Asia (<italic>Quercus glauca</italic>, <italic>Q. acuta</italic>, <italic>Lithocarpus edulis</italic>, and <italic>L. glaber</italic>), using leaf and bud tissues over two seasonal cycles. We assembled high-quality reference genomes, identifying 11749 single-copy orthologous genes. Seasonal transcriptomic profiling of these orthologous genes revealed highly conserved gene expression across species in winter when temperatures fall below ∼10°C. Rhythmic gene expression with significant periodic oscillations was more prevalent in buds (51.9%) than in leaves (40.6%), with most rhythmic genes (78.4–92.0%) exhibiting annual periodicity, while a smaller fraction (1.2–11.9%) followed half-annual cycles. The seasonal peaks of rhythmic genes were highly synchronized across species in winter but diverged during the growing season, reflecting species-specific timing of leaf flushing and flowering. These findings suggest that the four species share a common molecular calendar in winter, which constrains the evolution of gene expression under seasonal environments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fundamental biological processes, such as growth, mortality, and reproduction, rarely remain constant over time; instead, they exhibit pronounced variation in response to seasonal environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fretwell, 1972</xref>). This temporal organization of a series of biological activities, known as phenology, plays a critical role in the evolution of life histories in response to seasonal fluctuating environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Forrest and Miller-Rushing, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Morellato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Piao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Schwartz, 2013</xref>). Phenology is regulated by the coordinated expression of genes that enable organisms to exhibit essential functions at the appropriate times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kudoh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Satake et al., 2024a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">2022</xref>). However, gene expression dynamics underpinning seasonal responses in organisms remain not fully understood.</p>
<p>To explore the evolution of gene expression, transcriptome analyses are widely employed to compare transcript profiles across organs, sexes, species, and developmental stages within a given environment. Such studies have been conducted in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brawand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Naqvi et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lemos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nuzhdin et al., 2004</xref>), and Tanzanian cichlids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">El Taher et al., 2021</xref>), providing key insights into the evolutionary dynamics of gene expression and its central role in shaping phenotypic diversity. These studies have revealed that gene expression profiles tend to be more conserved across species within the same tissue, whereas the evolutionary rate of gene expression varies among organs. In mammals, for instance, nervous tissue exhibits a slower rate of gene expression change compared to the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brawand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Naqvi et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting the presence of tissue-specific functional constraints that influence the evolution of gene expression.</p>
<p>In addition to tissue-dependent constraints, seasonal environmental changes may play a crucial role in shaping the evolution of gene expression, particularly by influencing the temporal coordination of gene expression under natural conditions. Gene expression responses to certain seasons may be more resistant to change, whereas in other seasons, divergence in gene expression timing across species may occur, contributing to temporal niche differentiation. Despite its potential importance, the influence of seasonal environmental fluctuations on the gene expression evolution remains poorly understood, largely because most transcriptomic analyses have been conducted under tightly controlled laboratory conditions.</p>
<p>To investigate the evolution of gene expression in seasonal environments, we performed a molecular phenology analysis on Fagaceae tree species, which are widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, with its center of diversity in subtropical Southeast Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hipp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kremer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Manos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Molecular phenology refers to transcriptome analysis conducted under natural fluctuating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Komoto et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kudoh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nagano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Satake et al., 2023</xref>) and provides a valuable framework for studying gene–environment interactions and their role in orchestrating the temporal biological functions essential for adaptation to environmental fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Satake et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we selected four evergreen Fagaceae species—two <italic>Quercus</italic> species (<italic>Q. glauca</italic> and <italic>Q. acuta</italic>) and two <italic>Lithocarpus</italic> species (<italic>L. edulis</italic> and <italic>L. glaber</italic>)—that co-occur in the same locality in Japan. <italic>Q. glauca</italic>, <italic>L. edulis</italic> and <italic>L. glaber</italic> inhabit nearly identical environment, while <italic>Q. acuta</italic> is restricted to the high-altitude regions with slightly colder environment compared to the other three species. Leaf flushing and flowering phenology vary across species, with <italic>Q. glauca</italic> and <italic>Q. acuta</italic> flowering in early spring, almost simultaneously with leaf flushing, <italic>L. edulis</italic> flowering in late spring, and <italic>L. glaber</italic> flowering in autumn, approximately one to two months after leaf flushing. This setting enabled us to compare seasonal gene expression profiles across species with diverse phenology, both within and between genera, under nearly identical environmental fluctuations. By assessing and comparing seasonal transcriptomic dynamics across Fagaceae species, our study provides new insights into the evolution of gene expression and adaptation to seasonal natural environments.</p>

<title>Genome assemblies of <italic>Q. glauca</italic> and <italic>L. edulis</italic></title>
<p>To quantify transcript abundance of non-model Fagaceae species, we first constructed reference genomes for <italic>Q. glauca</italic>, as a representative of genus <italic>Quercus</italic>, and <italic>L. edulis,</italic> as a representative of genus <italic>Lithocarpus</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To obtain high-quality chromosome-level reference genomes, we conducted a hybrid genome assembly for the HiFi reads and the high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) reads (Table S1).The resultant scaffolds were 867.7 and 835.7 Mb and consisted of 797 and 750 scaffolds including 12 chromosome-level scaffolds with contig N50 of 71.7 Mb and 68.8 Mb for <italic>Q. glauca</italic> and <italic>L. edulis</italic>, respectively (Table S1). Approximately 94.8% and 97.2% of the final assemblies were assigned to 12 pseudochromosomes of <italic>Q. glauca</italic> and <italic>L. edulis</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The number of chromosome-scale scaffolds were identical to the known numbers in other <italic>Quercus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zoldos et al., 1999</xref>) and <italic>Lithocarpus</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). The genomes were estimated to contain 39758 and 34059 protein-coding genes (33947 and 30246 genes were annotated within 12 chromosomes), covering 98.3% and 95.0% of complete Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) genes (eudicots_odb10) for <italic>Q. glauca</italic> and <italic>L. edulis</italic>, respectively. The genome sizes of <italic>Q. glauca</italic> and <italic>L. edulis</italic> were estimated to be 891.2 Mb and 868.7 Mb, respectively, using KmerGenie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chikhi and Medvedev, 2014</xref>) and GenomeScope2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ranallo-Benavidez et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<p>Overall, the abundance and distribution of protein-coding genes, GC content, and repeat sequences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>; Table S1) and syntenic structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) were similar between <italic>Q. glauca</italic> and <italic>L. edulis</italic>. Using OrthoFinder2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Emms and Kelly, 2019</xref>), we clustered genes from the two newly assembled genomes into orthologous groups. We identified 13427 single-copy orthologs, enabling pairwise comparisons between species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Single-copy genes exhibited significantly higher average expression levels than multi-copy genes (Steel-Dwass test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F, G</xref>). These single-copy orthologous genes were used for further analyses.</p>

<title>Seasonal gene expression dynamics</title>
<p>To characterize the evolution of seasonal gene expressions, we generated a total of 483 transcriptome profiles every four weeks over two years using leaf and bud tissues from <italic>Q. glauca</italic>, <italic>Q. acuta</italic>, <italic>L. edulis</italic>, and <italic>L. glaber</italic> during 2021–2023. Reads from the two <italic>Quercus</italic> species were mapped to the newly constructed <italic>Q. glauca</italic> reference genome, achieving a mean mapping rate of 87.0 ± 5.6%. Similarly, reads from the two <italic>Lithocarpus</italic> species were mapped to the newly constructed <italic>L. edulis</italic> reference genome, with a mean mapping rate of 90.0 ± 3.0%. The number of reads uniquely mapped on the reference genome was 19.9 million reads per sample, on average. Among the single copy orthologous genes, we excluded genes with low expression levels (mean of Reads Per Kilobase (RPK) across samples for each species &lt; 1) and normalized the transcript count data using the GeTMM method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Smid et al., 2018</xref>). This process resulted in a high-quality expression dataset for 11749 genes (Fig. S1A). For further analyses, we used the mean expression levels across three biological replicates (three individuals per species), except for <italic>L. edulis</italic>, where only one individual was available.</p>
<p>To gain an initial overview of gene expression dynamics in a seasonal environment, we assessed the relative magnitude of seasonal variation in expression levels for each gene by calculating the standard deviation divided by the mean for each gene (<italic>σ<sub>i</sub></italic>/<italic>μ<sub>i</sub></italic>) and compared it to the overall variation across all genes in the genome (<italic>σ<sub>g</sub></italic>/<italic>μ<sub>g</sub></italic>) (Fig. S1B). A prior study using 3025 yeast RNA-seq experiments reported that the dynamic range of individual genes across experiments was considerably smaller than the overall genomic variation under laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zrimec et al., 2021</xref>). Consistently, our results demonstrate that despite substantial seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions (Fig. S2), individual gene expression remains relatively conserved. On average, the magnitude of genome-wide variation was 15.8 times greater than the seasonal variation observed for individual genes (Fig. S1B).</p>
<p>To assess the similarity of gene expression profiles across tissues, species, and seasons, we performed a hierarchical clustering of seasonal transcriptome profiles from leaf and bud tissues across four species and identified five distinct clusters (cluster L1, L2, B1–B3) according to the Elbow method (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>; Fig. S3A; Dataset S1). Transcriptional profiles first grouped into leaves (cluster L1 and L2) and buds (cluster B1–B3), irrespective of seasons and species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), except that newly flushed leaf samples were grouped closely with buds (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>; Fig. S4). Within the leaf cluster, transcriptome profiles were first clustered by genus and then by species in <italic>Lithocarpus</italic> (cluster L1; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In contrast, samples from <italic>Quercus</italic> species formed a mixture of two species (cluster L2; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Notably, the winter samples of <italic>Q. acuta</italic>, collected during periods of low mean temperatures, were distinctly separated from those collected in other seasons (cluster L2; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Within the bud cluster, transcriptome profiles were predominantly grouped by season—winter (cluster B3; November to February, with the exception of a March sample from <italic>L. edulis</italic>; Dataset S1) versus the other growing seasons (cluster B1 and B2; March to November; Dataset S1)—and subsequently organized by genus and species. This suggests that the winter season exerts a stronger influence on gene expression in buds than phylogenetic relationships.</p>

<p>Within the bud cluster, transcriptional profiles in the winter cluster were observed under significantly lower temperatures, approximately below 10°C, compared to other seasons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>; Fig. S5A). In contrast, no such temperature-related distinction was evident within the leaf cluster (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Additionally, photoperiods were markedly shorter in the winter cluster in buds (Fig. S5B). These findings suggest that the buds of the four species exhibit a conserved response to environmental factors characteristic of the winter season. To further investigate the relationships among all samples, we conducted a principal component analysis (PCA). The first principal component (PC1) clearly separated samples by tissue type, while the second (PC2) and the third principal component (PC3) gradually differentiated winter samples from those collected during other seasons (Fig. S6).</p>
<p>To investigate seasonal expression dynamics of each gene, we conducted hierarchical clustering on the transcriptional dynamics of 11749 genes and identified five distinct gene sets characterizing different transcriptional modes (gene set I–V; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>; Fig. S3B; Dataset S2). Gene set I exhibited predominant expression in buds, with seasonal peaks during summer, whereas gene set II was primarily expressed in leaves, highlighting clear tissue-specificity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). Gene sets III and V demonstrated genus-specific expression patterns, with higher expression levels observed in <italic>Lithocarpus</italic> and <italic>Quercus</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). In contrast, gene set IV was expressed during winter across both leaf and bud tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>).</p>

<title>Detection of rhythmic genes</title>
<p>To identify genes revealing seasonal expression dynamics and determine the period and seasonal peaks in gene expression, we applied the RAIN algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Thaben and Westermark, 2014</xref>). This approach enabled us to detect genes with rhythmic expression (hereafter rhythmic genes) and analyze their periods and phases (peak months). Our analysis revealed that 44.6–58.8% of genes in bud tissues and 33.9–45.9% in leaf tissues exhibited significant rhythmic expression across species (Fig. S7A; Dataset S3). Notably, bud tissues demonstrated a higher proportion of rhythmic genes, with 51.9% across four species on average, compared to 40.6% in leaf tissues (Fig. S7A).</p>
<p>Among the rhythmic genes, the majority (78.4–92.0%) exhibited annual periodicity, with a period of 12 ± 1 month observed across species and tissues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>, Dataset S3). Additionally, hundreds of genes (1.2–11.9%) displayed half-annual periodicity (6 ± 1 month) with these genes being most frequently observed in the bud samples of <italic>L. edulis</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). The fraction of genes exhibiting other periodicities was relatively small (5.7–14.1%; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Based on the observed period distributions, we classified genes with periods within the range of 8–16 months as exhibiting annual periodicity (96.0%) and those with periods shorter than 8 months as having half-annual periodicity (4.0%), accounting for detection noise (Fig. S7A). Rhythmic genes with longer periods (&gt;17 months) were also identified, although their periodicity may be less reliable due to the limited number of time points. Many genes with annual periodicity were shared across all species, including 1280 genes in leaves and 1894 genes in buds (Fig. S7B). In contrast, most genes exhibiting half-annual periodicity were species-specific, with no genes shared among all the species (Fig. S7C).</p>

<title>Peak month distribution of rhythmic genes and intra-genus and inter-genera comparison</title>
<p>To determine the seasonal timing of gene expression peaks, we focused on genes with annual or half-annual periodicity and visualized the density and direction of these peaks throughout the year using a circular histogram (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D</xref>; Dataset S3). On average, 34.9% and 41.3% of annual rhythmic genes peaked in winter The biological activities of organisms are closely linked to seasonality. Phenology, the temporal orchestration of biological activities, is governed by gene expression, yet the evolutionary dynamics underlying seasonal gene expression remain unclear. To investigate these dynamics, we compared genome-wide expression dynamics (molecular phenology) in four dominant evergreen Fagaceae species in Asia (<italic>Quercus glauca</italic>, <italic>Q. acuta</italic>, <italic>Lithocarpus edulis</italic>, and <italic>L. glaber</italic>), using leaf and bud tissues over two seasonal cycles. We assembled high-quality reference genomes, identifying 11749 single-copy orthologous genes. Seasonal transcriptomic profiling of these orthologous genes revealed highly conserved gene expression across species in winter when temperatures fall below ∼10°C. Rhythmic gene expression with significant periodic oscillations was more prevalent in buds (51.9%) than in leaves (40.6%), with most rhythmic genes (78.4–92.0%) exhibiting annual periodicity, while a smaller fraction (1.2–11.9%) followed half-annual cycles. The seasonal peaks of rhythmic genes were highly synchronized across species in winter but diverged during the growing season, reflecting species-specific timing of leaf flushing and flowering. These findings suggest that the four species share a common molecular calendar in winter, which constrains the evolution of gene expression under seasonal environments.</p>
<p>(December–February) in leaf and bud samples, respectively. Additionally, another peak corresponding to or occurring slightly after leaf flushing and flowering events was observed, with its timing varying by species: April in <italic>Q. glauca</italic> (15.6%), July in <italic>Q. acuta</italic> (15.3%), June in <italic>L. edulis</italic> (16.0%), September in <italic>L. glaber</italic> (18.1%), for leaf tissues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Similar peaks corresponding to leaf flushing or flowering were also detected in bud samples, occurring approximately one to two months earlier than in leaf samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). For genes with half-annual periodicity, the majority (63.2 ± 4.8%) exhibited expression peaks both in spring (March–May) and autumn (September–November) in both tissues (Fig. S7D; Dataset S3), with the exception of <italic>L. glaber</italic>, an autumn flowering species. Interestingly, <italic>WRKY22</italic>, a transcription factor regulating ethylene biosynthesis and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhu et al., 2024</xref>), exhibited half-annual periodicity in <italic>L. glaber</italic> (Fig. S7<italic>E</italic>). In addition, <italic>SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE REGULATORY SUBUNIT GAMMA 1</italic> (<italic>KINγ1</italic>), a subunit of SNF1-related kinase (<italic>SnRK</italic>) involved in stress response such as starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Emanuelle et al., 2016</xref>), showed two distinct peaks in <italic>Q. glauca</italic> and <italic>L. edulis</italic>, occurring in both summer (July) and winter (January) (Fig. S7E). This result suggests that both summer and winter pose stressful conditions for these species.</p>
<p>To compare the peak month of gene expression with annual periodicity across species, we quantified the number of genes within each peak combination for both intra-genus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and inter-genera species pairs in buds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) and leaves (Fig. S8A, B). During winter, a large number of genes exhibited highly synchronized expression peaks across species, with high pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficients observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). In contrast, the peak timing of gene expression from spring to autumn varied across species, aligning with differences in leaf flushing and flowering times (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). Some genes exhibited pronounced divergence, showing negative Pearson’s correlation coefficients (&lt; −0.3) between species. Notably, the number of such genes was larger in inter-genera comparisons (11–77 genes; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) than in intra-genus comparisons (4–12 genes; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). A similar pattern was observed in leaf samples (Fig. S8A, B). When comparing seasonal expression peaks between tissues, the majority of genes were synchronously activated in winter in both tissues (Fig. S8C). During spring to summer, slight variations in seasonal expression peaks were observed among tissues (Fig. S8C).</p>

<p>We quantified the degree of divergence in seasonal gene expression patterns across species by calculating the peak month differences between two species, where one species exhibits an expression peak in the given month. We defined the molecular phenology divergence index (<italic>D</italic>) for each month by quantifying the proportion of genes with peak month differences greater than 2 months between two species, relative to the total number of genes with expression peaks in that month. From spring to autumn, the mean of <italic>D</italic> over all species pairs in buds ranged from 0.47 to 0.66, but it declined sharply during winter, reaching a minimum of 0.12 in January in buds (Nemenyi test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). A similar trend was observed in leaf samples, with another trough in summer (Fig. S8D). The values of <italic>D</italic> were not consistently smaller in inter-genera pairs compared to intra-genus pairs. These findings suggest that there is a seasonal constraint in gene expression in which the degree of molecular phenology divergence is not constant but varies significantly across seasons, with the least divergence occurring in winter.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic constraints in the evolution of seasonal gene expression</title>
<p>We next investigated whether phylogenetic relationship influences the evolution of seasonal gene expression by calculating pairwise Pearson’s correlations of seasonal expression for each gene across all species pairs (Dataset S4).

<p>Rhythmic genes exhibited more conserved expression patterns than arrhythmic genes in both tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>; Fig. S9A). In particular, genes with seasonal expression peaks in winter showed high correlation across species in both tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>; Fig. S9B). The proportion of rhythmic genes with annual periodicity declined as the mean correlation coefficient across species decreased, with a more rapid decline observed for genes peaking in winter compared to those with peak expression during the growing seasons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>; Fig. S9B). Additionally, the mean absolute difference in seasonal gene expression dynamics was significantly smaller between species within the same genus than between species from different genera in both tissues (Fig. S10A, B). The relationship between the mean absolute difference and the proportion of rhythmic genes was less clear compared to that of the mean correlation coefficient (Fig. S10C, D). These findings suggest that, in addition to seasonal constraints, the overall dynamics of seasonal gene expression are also shaped by phylogenetic constraints.</p>

<title>Functional annotation of genes with conserved or divergent expression across species</title>
<p>To functionally annotate genes with conserved or divergent expression across species, we extracted genes with the top and bottom 5% based on the distribution of mean correlation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>; Fig. S9B) and conducted Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. GO analysis revealed that the top 5% of genes in leaves were associated with photosynthesis, while those in buds were linked to cell fate determination (Fig. S11A; Dataset S5). The gene with the highest correlation in leaves was <italic>STRESS RESPONSE SUPPRESSOR1</italic> (<italic>STRS1</italic>; mean of pairwise correlation = 0.91; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), a DEAD-box RNA helicase previously reported to enhance tolerance to abiotic stresses such as cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kant et al., 2007</xref>).

<title>Relating seasonal gene expression divergence to sequence divergence</title>
<p>If divergence of seasonal timing of gene expression is related to selective constraint, we would expect a correlation between sequence divergence patterns and the divergence in seasonal expression peaks. To explore the relationship between the divergence of seasonal gene expression and protein sequence evolution, we calculated synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous substitution rates (dN) and their ratio (dN/dS) for each gene using coding sequences from newly assembled genomes of <italic>Q. glauca</italic> and <italic>L. edulis</italic>. We first confirmed that the highly expressed genes evolve more slowly by identifying a significant negative correlation between evolutionary rate (dN/dS) and mean of the gene expression (<italic>r</italic> = −0.21, <italic>p</italic> = 1.8 × 10<sup>−118</sup> for dN/dS; Fig. S12A; Dataset S6). This finding aligns with previous studies in yeasts, mammals, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Drummond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gaut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liao and Zhang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yang and Gaut, 2011</xref>). By targeting the genes that exhibited annual periodicity across both species and tissues, we examined the relationship between these evolutionary measures and peak month differences in seasonal gene expression between species (Δ<italic>φ</italic>) in leaves and bud tissues using linear regression. Assessment of the significance of the regression coefficient using a <italic>t</italic>-test revealed that genes with smaller peak month differences between species exhibited lower values of dN/dS in buds (<italic>r</italic> = 0.072, <italic>p</italic> =2.6 × 10⁻<sup>2</sup>) and marginally lower values of dN/dS in leaves (<italic>r</italic> = 0.062, <italic>p</italic> = 5.7 × 10⁻<sup>2</sup>). The lower values were also found in dN in both leaves (<italic>r</italic> = 0.086, <italic>p</italic> = 8.1 × 10⁻<sup>3</sup>) and buds (<italic>r</italic> = 0.086, <italic>p</italic> = 7.8 × 10⁻<sup>3</sup>), whereas no significant trend was observed for dS in both tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>; Fig. S12B, C; Dataset S6). This finding suggests that genes with conserved seasonal expression patterns tend to evolve at a slower rate. We further investigated whether the association between the divergence in seasonal expression peaks and sequence divergence patterns varies between genes expressed in winter and in the growing season. We classified genes that exhibited annual periodicity across both species and tissues into four groups based on their expression peak timing (winter or growing seasons) and tissue specificity (leaves or buds) and compared the extent of protein sequence divergence across these groups. We found no significant differences in dN/dS (Kruskal Wallis test, <italic>p</italic> = 2.8 × 10⁻<sup>1</sup>; Fig. S12<italic>D</italic>; Dataset S6) between genes expressed in winter in both tissues and those in growing seasons. The same result was observed even when focusing only on genes with conserved peaks (peak month difference &lt; 2), with no significant differences in dN/dS between these gene sets (Kruskal Wallis test, <italic>p</italic> = 3.5 × 10⁻<sup>1</sup>; Fig. S12E; Dataset S6). These results suggest that, regardless of the season, genes with conserved expression peaks tend to evolve at slower rates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A central goal in biology is to unravel the molecular basis of phenotypic evolution, with gene expression serving as a fundamental driver of this process. In this study, we investigated the impact of seasonal environmental fluctuations on the evolution of gene expression and its relationship with phenological traits in four dominant <italic>Fagaceae</italic> tree species in forest ecosystems. We found that gene expression profiles were more resistant to change during winter compared to the growing season, indicating the presence of a seasonal constraint on the evolution of gene expression. This constraint becomes particularly pronounced in buds during winter when temperatures fall below approximately 10°C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). This temperature threshold aligns with previous findings, where winter-specific transcript profiles were reported at temperatures below 8.7–11.3°C in cherry trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Miyawaki - Kuwakado et al., 2024</xref>), 11.3°C in ever-green <italic>Fagaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Satake et al., 2023</xref>), and 10.5°C in perennial <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aikawa et al., 2010</xref>). These results suggest the presence of a conserved mechanism for gene expression regulation under low-temperature environments across different species. The greater conservation of gene expression patterns in buds compared to leaves across species may be attributed to their functional role protecting essential meristematic tissues, including the shoot apex and leaf and flower primordia. Additionally, buds likely play a crucial role in maintaining common physiological functions necessary for the resumption of growth in spring. This functional consistency may impose evolutionary constraints on gene expression, contributing to its conservation across species.</p>
<p>It is intriguing to compare the seasonal constraints identified in this study with developmental constraints in gene expression evolution, where evolutionary conservation and variation across developmental stages during the life cycle have been observed, such as in the early conservation model and the developmental hourglass model (Fig. S13A)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Irie and Kuratani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lotharukpong et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Quint et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that certain developmental stages exhibit remarkably similar gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Drost et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kalinka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Levin et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings highlight that such highly similar gene expression patterns are observed during the winter season (Fig. S13B), suggesting that a common physiological state is essential for enduring harsh winter conditions. This seasonal constraint on gene expression evolution may have the potential to limit temporal niche partitioning at the phenotypic level and slow species divergence rates in seasonal environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cleland and Wolkovich, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kubo and Iwasa, 1996</xref>). Although completely disentangling the effects of developmental stages and seasonal changes on gene expression is challenging when using molecular phenology data collected from natural environments, the observation that species with different phenology—i.e., different developmental timing in seasonal environments—exhibit convergent gene expression patterns during winter underscores the profound influence of winter environmental conditions on the evolution of gene expression. Future research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms driving the establishment of such conserved gene expression patterns, including the dynamic reorganization of chromatin architecture in response to cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fischl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nishio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that the evolution of coding-sequences was weakly correlated with the divergence of seasonal peaks in gene expression across species. This suggests that weak functional constraints exist for specific proteins that are expressed in certain seasons, such as photosynthesis in summer and stress response to winter. However, among genes with conserved seasonal peaks, the evolutionary rate of coding-sequences was similarly slow regardless of whether they were expressed in winter or during the growing season. Therefore, to understand the evolutionary mechanism underlying the seasonal constraint on gene expression that results in similar expression patterns during winter, it is essential to consider evolution of non-coding sequences that modulate gene expression levels in response to seasonal environmental changes. Regulatory variation has been recognized as a major driver of evolutionary innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Prud’homme et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">True and Haag, 2001</xref>). Recent deep learning studies utilizing genome and transcriptome data from yeast and humans have highlighted the significance of co-evolution between coding and non-coding sequences in shaping gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zrimec et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">2020</xref>). Understanding how seasonal environments drive the co-evolution of coding and regulatory sequences, as well as the divergence of molecular phenology and its phenological outputs, will require expanding analyses to a broader range of species. Such efforts will facilitate the development of predictive models for evolutionary processes influenced by seasonal dynamics. Comparison of molecular phenology across wide climatic zones, including both tropical and temperate zones, will also be effective to identify key genes for the phenological response to on-going climate change.</p>

The Omni-C library sequences were aligned to the contigs assembled by Hifiasm using bwa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). The separations of Omni-C reads from paired-end mapped within the contigs were analyzed by HiRise to produce a likelihood model for genomic distance between paired-end reads, and the model was used to identify and break putative misjoins, to score prospective joins, and make joins above a threshold.</p>

<title>Sample collection for RNA sequencing</title>
<p>To monitor the genome-wide gene expression profiles, we collected leaf, bud, and flower samples from four Fagaceae species, <italic>Q. glauca</italic>, <italic>Q. acuta</italic>, <italic>L. edulis</italic> and <italic>L. glaber</italic>, every four weeks spanning from May 2019 to June 2023 across Fukuoka and Saga prefectures in Kyushu, Japan.

Given the consistent expression patterns observed among individuals in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Satake et al., 2023</xref>), we focused on only one individual for <italic>L. edulis</italic>. Study sites for <italic>Q. glauca</italic> is the biodiversity reserve on the Ito campus of Kyushu University (33°35′ N, 130°12′ E, 20 to 57 m a.s.l). <italic>Q. acuta</italic> was monitored in Sefuri mountains (33°26′ N, 130°22′ E, 970 to 974 m a.s.l). <italic>L. edulis</italic> and <italic>L. glaber</italic> were studied at the Imajuku Field Activity Center (33°33′ N, 130°16′ E, 84 to 111 m a.s.l). Environmental data from Ito Campus and the Imajuku Field Activity Center were obtained from the Japan Meteorological Agency, while data from Sefuri Mountain were collected using a logger installed at the sampling site.</p>
<p>Samples for RNA-seq were taken from the sun-exposed crown (approximately 2–5 m from the ground) using long pruning shears from 11:30 to 12:30 h. For each sample, 0.2–0.4 g of tissue was preserved in a 2 ml microtube containing 1.5 ml of RNA-stabilizing reagent (RNAlater; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) immediately after harvesting. The samples were transferred to the laboratory within 2 hr after sampling, stored at 4°C overnight and then stored at −80°C until RNA extraction. During transport to the laboratory, the samples were kept in a cooler box with ice to maintain a low temperature.</p>

Total RNA of the leaf sample was extracted in accordance with the method described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Miyazaki et al., 2014</xref>). Total RNA of the bud sample was extracted using the PureLink™ Plant RNA Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and subsequently processed with DNase using the TURBO DNA-free kit™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to their protocols and purified using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to its RNA cleanup protocol. RNA integrity was examined using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies), and the RNA yield was determined using a NanoDrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Five to six micrograms of RNA extracted from each sample were sent to Hangzhou Veritas Genetics Medical Institute Co., Ltd., where a cDNA library was prepared with a NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina, and 150 base paired-end transcriptome sequencing of each sample was conducted using an Illumina NovaSeq6000 sequencer (Illumina).</p>
<p>The quantification of gene expression followed a three-step process.

Second, RNA-seq reads were mapped to the reference genome using STAR v2.7.10b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Third, RNA-seq reads were quantified using RSEM v1.3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>). We excluded the genes with low expression level using the threshold, the value of mean Reads Per Kilobase (RPK) &lt; 1 for each species. Then, we further normalized the expression level using the value of Gene length corrected Trimmed Mean of M-values (GeTMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Smid et al., 2018</xref>) using an R package “edgeR” v3.42.4.

To ensure reliability, genes exhibiting signs of saturated divergence or underestimated dS values were excluded, as codeml produces robust results only within a moderate range of sequence divergence. Specifically, we removed 43 orthologs with dN/dS ≧ 99 and 483 genes with dS &gt; 10, dS &lt; 0.001, or dN &lt; 0.0003. The thresholds of dN and dS were determined by examining the relationship between dN and dS and excluding outliers that deviated from the main distribution.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors performed genome assemblies for two Fagaceae species and collected transcriptome data from four natural tree species every month over two years. They identified seasonal gene expression patterns and further analyzed species-specific differences.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study of gene expression patterns in natural environments, as opposed to controlled chambers, is gaining increasing attention. The authors collected RNA-seq data monthly for two years from four tree species and analyzed seasonal expression patterns. The data are novel. The authors could revise the manuscript to emphasize seasonal expression patterns in three species (with one additional species having more limited data). Furthermore, the chromosome-scale genome assemblies for the two Fagaceae species represent valuable resources, although the authors did not cite existing assemblies from closely related species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study design has a fundamental flaw regarding the evaluation of genetic or evolutionary effects. As a basic principle in biology, phenotypes, including gene expression levels, are influenced by genetics, environmental factors, and their interaction. This principle is well-established in quantitative genetics.</p>
<p>In this study, the four species were sampled from three different sites (see Materials and Methods, lines 543-546), and additionally, two species were sampled from 2019-2021, while the other two were sampled from 2021-2023 (see Figure S2). This critical detail should be clearly described in the Results and Materials and Methods. Due to these variations in sampling sites and periods, environmental conditions are not uniform across species.</p>
<p>Even in studies conducted in natural environments, there are ways to design experiments that allow genetic effects to be evaluated. For example, by studying co-occurring species, or through transplant experiments, or in common gardens. To illustrate the issue, imagine an experiment where clones of a single species were sampled from three sites and two time periods, similar to the current design. RNA-seq analysis would likely detect differences that could qualitatively resemble those reported in this manuscript.</p>
<p>One example is in line 197, where genus-specific expression patterns are mentioned. While it may be true that the authors' conclusions (e.g., winter synchronization, phylogenetic constraints) reflect real biological trends, these conclusions are also predictable even without empirical data, and the current dataset does not provide quantitative support.</p>
<p>If the authors can present a valid method to disentangle genetic and environmental effects from their dataset, that would significantly strengthen the manuscript. However, I do not believe the current study design is suitable for this purpose.</p>
<p>Unless these issues are addressed, the use of the term &quot;evolution&quot; is inappropriate in this context. The title should be revised, and the result sections starting from &quot;Peak months distribution...&quot; should be either removed or fundamentally revised. The entire Discussion section, which is based on evolutionary interpretation, should be deleted in its current form.</p>
<p>If the authors still wish to explore genetic or evolutionary analyses, the pair of L. edulis and L. glaber, which were sampled at the same site and over the same period, might be used to analyze &quot;seasonal gene expression divergence in relation to sequence divergence.&quot; Nevertheless, the manuscript would benefit from focusing on seasonal expression patterns without framing the study in evolutionary terms.</p>
<p>To better support the seasonal expression analysis, the early RNA-seq analysis sections should be strengthened. There is little discussion of biological replicate variation or variation among branches of the same individual. These could be important factors to analyze. In line 137, the mapping rate for two species is mentioned, but the rates for each species should be clearly reported. One RNA-seq dataset is based on a species different from the reference genome, so a lower mapping rate is expected. While this likely does not hinder downstream analysis, quantification is important.</p>
<p>In Figures 2A and 2B, clustering is used to support several points discussed in the Results section (e.g., lines 175-177). However, clustering is primarily a visualization method or a hypothesis-generating tool; it cannot serve as a statistical test. Stronger conclusions would require further statistical testing.</p>
<p>The quality of the genome assemblies appears adequate, but related assemblies should be cited and discussed. Several assemblies of Fagaceae species already exist, including Quercus mongolica (Ai et al., Mol Ecol Res, 2022), Q. gilva (Front Plant Sci, 2022), and Fagus sylvatica (GigaScience, 2018), among others. Is there any novelty here? Can you compare your results with these existing assemblies?</p>
<p>Most importantly, Figure 1B-D shows synteny between the two genera but also indicates homology between different chromosomes. Does this suggest paleopolyploidy or another novel feature? These chromosome connections should be interpreted in the main text-even if they could be methodological artifacts.</p>
<p>In both the Results and Materials and Methods sections, descriptions of genome and RNA-seq data are unclear. In line 128, a paragraph on genome assembly suddenly introduces expression levels. RNA-seq data should be described before this. Similarly, in line 238, the sentence &quot;we assembled high-quality reference genomes&quot; seems disconnected from the surrounding discussion of expression studies. In line 632, Illumina short-read DNA sequencing is mentioned, but it's unclear how these data were used.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study explores how gene expression evolves in response to seasonal environments, using four evergreen Fagaceae species growing in similar habitats in Japan. By combining chromosome-scale genome assemblies with a two-year RNA-seq time series in leaves and buds, the authors identify seasonal rhythms in gene expression and examine both conserved and divergent patterns. A central result is that winter bud expression is highly conserved across species, likely due to shared physiological demands under cold conditions. One of the intriguing implications of this study is that seasonal cycles might play a role similar to ontogenetic stages in animals. The authors touch on this by comparing their findings to the developmental hourglass model, and indeed, the recurrence of phenological states such as winter dormancy may act as a cyclic form of developmental canalization, shaping expression evolution in a way analogous to embryogenesis in animals.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The evolutionary effects of seasonal environments on gene expression are rarely studied at this scale. This paper fills that gap.</p>
<p>(2) The dataset is extensive, covering two years, two tissues, and four tree species, and is well suited to the questions being asked.</p>
<p>(3) Transcriptome clustering across species (Figure 2) shows strong grouping by season and tissue rather than species, suggesting that the authors effectively controlled for technical confounders such as batch effects and mapping bias.</p>
<p>(4) The idea that winter imposes a shared constraint on gene expression, especially in buds, is well argued and supported by the data.</p>
<p>(5) The discussion links the findings to known concepts like phenological synchrony and the developmental hourglass model, which helps frame the results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the hierarchical clustering shown in Figure 2A largely supports separation by tissue type and season, one issue worth noting is that some leaf samples appear to cluster closely with bud samples. The authors do not comment on this pattern, which raises questions about possible biological overlap between tissues during certain seasonal transitions or technical artifacts such as sample contamination. Clarifying this point would improve confidence in the interpretation of tissue-specific seasonal expression patterns.</p>
<p>(2) While the study provides compelling evidence of conserved and divergent seasonal gene expression, it does not directly examine the role of cis-regulatory elements or chromatin-level regulatory architecture. Including regulatory genomic or epigenomic data would considerably strengthen the mechanistic understanding of expression divergence.</p>
<p>(3) The manuscript includes a thoughtful analysis of flowering-related genes and seasonal GO enrichment (e.g., Figure 3C-D), providing an initial link between gene expression timing and phenological functions. However, the analysis remains largely gene-centric, and the study does not incorporate direct measurements of phenological traits (e.g., flowering or bud break dates). As a result, the connection between molecular divergence and phenotypic variation, while suggestive, remains indirect.</p>
<p>(4) Although species were sampled from similar habitats, one species (Q. acuta) was collected at a higher elevation, and factors such as microclimate or local photoperiod conditions could influence expression patterns. These potential confounding variables are not fully accounted for, and their effects should be more thoroughly discussed or controlled in future analyses.</p>
<p>(5) Statistical and Interpretive Concerns Regarding Δφ and dN/dS Correlation (Figures 5E and 5F):</p>
<p>(a) Statistical Inappropriateness: Δφ is a discrete ordinal variable (likely 1-11), making it unsuitable for Pearson correlation, which assumes continuous, normally distributed variables. This undermines the statistical validity of the analysis.</p>
<p>(b) Biological Interpretability: Even with the substantial statistical power afforded by genome-wide analysis, the observed correlations are extremely weak. This suggests that the relationship, if any, between temporal divergence in expression and protein-coding evolution is negligible.</p>
<p>Taken together, these issues weaken the case for any biologically meaningful association between Δφ and dN/dS. I recommend either omitting these panels or clearly reframing them as exploratory and statistically limited observations.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors performed genome assemblies for two Fagaceae species and collected transcriptome data from four natural tree species every month over two years. They identified seasonal gene expression patterns and further analyzed species-specific differences.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study of gene expression patterns in natural environments, as opposed to controlled chambers, is gaining increasing attention. The authors collected RNA-seq data monthly for two years from four tree species and analyzed seasonal expression patterns. The data are novel. The authors could revise the manuscript to emphasize seasonal expression patterns in three species (with one additional species having more limited data). Furthermore, the chromosome-scale genome assemblies for the two Fagaceae species represent valuable resources, although the authors did not cite existing assemblies from closely related species.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your careful assessment of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Comment; The study design has a fundamental flaw regarding the evaluation of genetic or evolutionary effects. As a basic principle in biology, phenotypes, including gene expression levels, are influenced by genetics, environmental factors, and their interaction. This principle is well-established in quantitative genetics.</p>
<p>In this study, the four species were sampled from three different sites (see Materials and Methods, lines 543-546), and additionally, two species were sampled from 2019-2021, while the other two were sampled from 2021-2023 (see Figure S2). This critical detail should be clearly described in the Results and Materials and Methods. Due to these variations in sampling sites and periods, environmental conditions are not uniform across species.</p>
<p>Even in studies conducted in natural environments, there are ways to design experiments that allow genetic effects to be evaluated. For example, by studying co-occurring species, or through transplant experiments, or in common gardens. To illustrate the issue, imagine an experiment where clones of a single species were sampled from three sites and two time periods, similar to the current design. RNA-seq analysis would likely detect differences that could qualitatively resemble those reported in this manuscript.</p>
<p>One example is in line 197, where genus-specific expression patterns are mentioned. While it may be true that the authors' conclusions (e.g., winter synchronization, phylogenetic constraints) reflect real biological trends, these conclusions are also predictable even without empirical data, and the current dataset does not provide quantitative support.</p>
<p>If the authors can present a valid method to disentangle genetic and environmental effects from their dataset, that would significantly strengthen the manuscript. However, I do not believe the current study design is suitable for this purpose.</p>
<p>Unless these issues are addressed, the use of the term &quot;evolution&quot; is inappropriate in this context. The title should be revised, and the result sections starting from &quot;Peak months distribution...&quot; should be either removed or fundamentally revised. The entire Discussion section, which is based on evolutionary interpretation, should be deleted in its current form.</p>
<p>If the authors still wish to explore genetic or evolutionary analyses, the pair of L. edulis and L. glaber, which were sampled at the same site and over the same period, might be used to analyze &quot;seasonal gene expression divergence in relation to sequence divergence.&quot; Nevertheless, the manuscript would benefit from focusing on seasonal expression patterns without framing the study in evolutionary terms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the detailed and thoughtful comments. We fully recognize the importance of carefully distinguishing genetic and environmental contributions in transcriptomic studies, particularly when addressing evolutionary questions. The reviewer identified two major concerns regarding our study design: (1) the use of different monitoring periods across species, and (2) the use of samples collected from different study sites. We addressed both concerns with additional analyses using 112 new samples and now present new evidence that supports the robustness of our conclusions.</p>
<p>(1) Monitoring period variation does not bias our conclusions</p>
<p>To address concerns about the differing monitoring periods, we added new RNA-seq data (42 samples each for bud and leaf samples for L. glaber and 14 samples each for bud and leaf samples for L. edulis) collected from November 2021 to November 2022, enabling direct comparison across species within a consistent timeframe. Hierarchical clustering of this expanded dataset (Fig. S6) yielded results consistent with our original findings: winter-collected samples cluster together regardless of species identity. This strongly supports our conclusion that the seasonal synchrony observed in winter is not an artifact of the monitoring period and demonstrates the robustness of our conclusions across datasets.</p>
<p>(2) Site variation is limited and does not confound our findings</p>
<p>Although the study included three sites, two of them (Imajuku and Ito Campus) are only 7.3 km apart, share nearly identical temperature profiles (see Fig. S2), and are located at the edge of similar evergreen broadleaf forests. Only Q. acuta was sampled from a higher-altitude, cooler site. To assess whether the higher elevation site of Q. acuta introduced confounding environmental effects, we reanalyzed the data after excluding this species. Hierarchical clustering still revealed that winter bud samples formed a distinct cluster regardless of species identity (Fig. S7), consistent with our original finding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we recalculated the molecular phenology divergence index D (Fig. 4C) and the interspecific Pearson’s correlation coefficients (Fig. 5A) without including Q. acuta. These analyses produced results that were similar to those obtained from the full dataset (Fig. S12; Fig. S14), indicating that the observed patterns are not driven by environmental differences associated with elevation.</p>
<p>(3) Justification for our approach in natural systems</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that experimental approaches such as common gardens, reciprocal transplants, and the use of co-occurring species are valuable for disentangling genetic and environmental effects. In fact, we have previously implemented such designs in studies using the perennial herb Arabidopsis halleri (Komoto et al., 2022, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.14716">https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.14716</ext-link>) and clonal Someiyoshino cherry trees (Miyawaki-Kuwakado et al., 2024, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.10548">https://doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.10548</ext-link>) to examine environmental effects on gene expression. However, extending these approaches to long-lived tree species in diverse natural ecosystems poses significant logistical and biological challenges. In this study, we addressed this limitation by including three co-occurring species at the same site, which allowed us to evaluate interspecific differences under comparable environmental conditions. Importantly, even when we limited our analyses to these co-occurring species, the results remained consistent, indicating that the observed variation in transcriptomic profiles cannot be attributed to environmental factors alone and likely reflects underlying genetic influences.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we added four new figures (Fig. S6, Fig. S7, Fig. S12 and Fig. S14) and revised the manuscript to clarify the limitations and strengths of our design, to tone down the evolutionary claims where appropriate, and to more explicitly define the scope of our conclusions in light of the data. We hope that these efforts sufficiently address the reviewer’s concerns and strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To better support the seasonal expression analysis, the early RNA-seq analysis sections should be strengthened. There is little discussion of biological replicate variation or variation among branches of the same individual. These could be important factors to analyze. In line 137, the mapping rate for two species is mentioned, but the rates for each species should be clearly reported. One RNA-seq dataset is based on a species different from the reference genome, so a lower mapping rate is expected. While this likely does not hinder downstream analysis, quantification is important.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer 1 for the helpful comment. To evaluate the variation among biological replicates, we compared the expression level of each gene across different individuals. We observed high correlation between each pair of individuals (Q. glauca (n=3): an average correlation coefficient r = 0.947; Q. acuta (n=3): r = 0.948; L. glaber (n=3): r = 0.948)). This result suggests that the seasonal gene expression pattern is highly synchronized across individuals within the same species. We mentioned this point in the Result section in the revised manuscript. We also calculated the mean mapping rates for each species. As the reviewer expected, the mapping rate was slightly lower in Q. acuta (88.6 ± 2.3%) and L. glaber (84.3 ± 5.4%), whose RNA-Seq data were mapped to reference genomes of related but different species, compared to that in Q. glauca (92.6 ± 2.2%) and L. edulis (89.3 ± 2.7%). However, we minimized the impact of these differences on downstream analysis. These details have been included in the revised main text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figures 2A and 2B, clustering is used to support several points discussed in the Results section (e.g., lines 175-177). However, clustering is primarily a visualization method or a hypothesis-generating tool; it cannot serve as a statistical test. Stronger conclusions would require further statistical testing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful comment. As noted, we acknowledge that hierarchical clustering (Fig. 2A) is primarily a visualization and hypothesis-generating method. To assess the biological relevance of the clusters identified, we conducted a Mann-Whitney U test or the Steel-Dwass test to evaluate whether the environmental temperatures at the time of sample collection differed significantly among the clusters. This analysis (Fig. 2B) revealed statistically significant differences in temperature in the cluster B3 (p &lt; 0.01), indicating that the gene expression clusters are associated with seasonal thermal variation. These results support the interpretation that the clusters reflect coordinated transcriptional responses to environmental temperature. We revised the Results section to clarify this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The quality of the genome assemblies appears adequate, but related assemblies should be cited and discussed. Several assemblies of Fagaceae species already exist, including Quercus mongolica (Ai et al., Mol Ecol Res, 2022), Q. gilva (Front Plant Sci, 2022), and Fagus sylvatica (GigaScience, 2018), among others. Is there any novelty here? Can you compare your results with these existing assemblies?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that genome assemblies of Fagaceae species are becoming increasing available. However, our study does not aim to emphasize the novelty of the genome assemblies per se. Rather, with the increasing availability of chromosome-level genomes, we regard genome assembly as a necessary foundation for more advanced analyses. The main objective of our study is to investigate how each gene is expressed in response to seasonal environmental changes, and to link genome information with seasonal transcriptomic dynamics. To address the reviewer’s comment in line with this objective, we added a discussion on the syntenic structure of eight genome assemblies spanning four genera within the Fagaceae, including a species from the genus Fagus (Ikezaki et al. 2025, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.31.667835">https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.31.667835</ext-link>). This addition helps to position our work more clearly within the context of existing genomic resources.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Most importantly, Figure 1B-D shows synteny between the two genera but also indicates homology between different chromosomes. Does this suggest paleopolyploidy or another novel feature? These chromosome connections should be interpreted in the main text-even if they could be methodological artifacts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A previous study on genome size variation in Fagaceae suggested that, given the consistent ploidy level across the family, genome expansion likely occurred through relatively small segmental duplications rather than whole-genome duplications. Because Figure 1B-D supports this view, we cited the following reference in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Chen et al. (2014)  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11295-014-0736-y">https://doi.org/10.1007/s11295-014-0736-y</ext-link></p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In both the Results and Materials and Methods sections, descriptions of genome and RNA-seq data are unclear. In line 128, a paragraph on genome assembly suddenly introduces expression levels. RNA-seq data should be described before this. Similarly, in line 238, the sentence &quot;we assembled high-quality reference genomes&quot; seems disconnected from the surrounding discussion of expression studies. In line 632, Illumina short-read DNA sequencing is mentioned, but it's unclear how these data were used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We relocated the explanation regarding the expression levels of single-copy and multi-copy genes to the section titled “Seasonal gene expression dynamics.” Additionally, we clarified in the Materials and Methods section that short-read sequencing data were used for both genome size estimation and phylogenetic reconstruction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study explores how gene expression evolves in response to seasonal environments, using four evergreen Fagaceae species growing in similar habitats in Japan. By combining chromosome-scale genome assemblies with a two-year RNA-seq time series in leaves and buds, the authors identify seasonal rhythms in gene expression and examine both conserved and divergent patterns. A central result is that winter bud expression is highly conserved across species, likely due to shared physiological demands under cold conditions.

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the hierarchical clustering shown in Figure 2A largely supports separation by tissue type and season, one issue worth noting is that some leaf samples appear to cluster closely with bud samples. The authors do not comment on this pattern, which raises questions about possible biological overlap between tissues during certain seasonal transitions or technical artifacts such as sample contamination. Clarifying this point would improve confidence in the interpretation of tissue-specific seasonal expression patterns.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Leaf samples clustered into the bud are newly flushed leaves collected in April for Q. glauca, May for Q. acuta, May and June for L. edulis, and August and September for L. glaber. To clarify this point, we highlighted these newly flushed leaf samples as asterisk in the revised figure (Fig. 2A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>comment; (2) While the study provides compelling evidence of conserved and divergent seasonal gene expression, it does not directly examine the role of cis-regulatory elements or chromatin-level regulatory architecture.

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. As noted in the Discussion section, we hypothesize that such genome-wide seasonal expression patterns—and their divergence across species—are likely mediated by cis-regulatory elements and chromatin-level mechanisms. While a direct investigation of regulatory architecture was beyond the scope of the present study, we fully agree that incorporating regulatory genomic and epigenomic data would significantly deepen the mechanistic understanding of expression divergence. In this regard, we are currently working to identify putative cis-regulatory elements in non-coding regions and are collecting epigenetic data from the same tree species using ChIP-seq. We believe the current study provide a foundation for these future investigations into the regulatory basis of seasonal transcriptome variation. We made a minor revision to the Discussion to note that an important future direction is to investigate the evolution of non-coding sequences that regulate gene expression in response to seasonal environmental changes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The manuscript includes a thoughtful analysis of flowering-related genes and seasonal GO enrichment (e.g., Figure 3C-D), providing an initial link between gene expression timing and phenological functions. However, the analysis remains largely gene-centric, and the study does not incorporate direct measurements of phenological traits (e.g., flowering or bud break dates). As a result, the connection between molecular divergence and phenotypic variation, while suggestive, remains indirect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to note that phenological traits have been observed in the field on a monthly basis throughout the sampling period and the phenological data were plotted together with molecular phenology (e.g. Fig. 2A, C; Fig. 3C, D). Although the temporal resolution is limited, these observations captured species-specific differences in key phenological events such as leaf flushing and flowering times. We revised the manuscript to clarify this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Although species were sampled from similar habitats, one species (Q. acuta) was collected at a higher elevation, and factors such as microclimate or local photoperiod conditions could influence expression patterns. These potential confounding variables are not fully accounted for, and their effects should be more thoroughly discussed or controlled in future analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with the reviewer that local environmental conditions, including microclimate and photoperiod differences, could potentially influence gene expression patterns. To assess whether the higher elevation site of Q. acuta introduced confounding environmental effects, we reanalyzed the data after excluding this species. Hierarchical clustering still revealed that winter bud samples formed a distinct cluster regardless of species identity (Fig. S7), consistent with our original finding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we recalculated the molecular phenology divergence index D (Fig. 4C) and the interspecific Pearson’s correlation coefficients (Fig. 5A) without including Q. acuta. These analyses produced results that were qualitatively similar to those obtained from the full dataset (Fig. S12; Fig. S14), indicating that the observed patterns are not driven by environmental differences associated with elevation.</p>
<p>We believe these additional analyses help to decouple the effects of environment and genetics, and support our conclusion that both seasonal synchrony and phylogenetic constraints play key roles in shaping transcriptome dynamics. We added four new figures (Fig. S6, Fig. S7, Fig. S12 and Fig. S14) and revised the text accordingly to clarify this point and to acknowledge the potential impact of site-specific environmental variation.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment. We would like to clarify that the analysis presented in Figures 5E and 5F was based on linear regression, not Pearson’s correlation. Although Δφ is a discrete variable, it takes values from 0 to 6 in 0.5 increments, resulting in 13 levels. We treated it as a quasi-continuous variable for the purposes of linear regression analysis. This approach is commonly adopted in practice when a discrete variable has sufficient resolution and ordering to approximate continuity. To enhance clarity, we revised the manuscript to explicitly state that linear regression was used, and we now reported the regression coefficient and associated p-value to support the interpretation of the observed trend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) Biological Interpretability: Even with the substantial statistical power afforded by genome-wide analysis, the observed correlations are extremely weak. This suggests that the relationship, if any, between temporal divergence in expression and protein-coding evolution is negligible.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. While we retained the original panels, we reframed our interpretation to emphasize that, despite statistical significance, the observed correlation is very weak—suggesting that coding region variation is unlikely to be the primary driver of seasonal gene expression patterns. Accordingly, we revised the “Relating seasonal gene expression divergence to sequence divergence” section in the Results, as well as the relevant part of the Discussion.</p>
