<title>Abstract</title><p>Tgt is the enzyme modifying the guanine (G) in tRNAs with GUN anticodon to queuosine (Q). <italic>tgt</italic> is required for optimal growth of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> in the presence of sub-lethal aminoglycoside concentrations. We further explored here the role of the Q34 in the efficiency of codon decoding upon tobramycin exposure. We characterized its impact on the overall bacterial proteome, and elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of Q34 modification in antibiotic translational stress response. Using molecular reporters, we showed that Q34 impacts the efficiency of decoding at tyrosine TAT and TAC codons. Proteomics analyses revealed that the anti-SoxR factor RsxA is better translated in the absence of <italic>tgt</italic>. RsxA displays a codon bias towards tyrosine TAT and overabundance of RsxA leads to decreased expression of genes belonging to SoxR oxidative stress regulon. We also identified conditions that regulate <italic>tgt</italic> expression. We propose that regulation of Q34 modification in response to environmental cues leads to translational reprogramming of transcripts bearing a biased tyrosine codon usage. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis further identified candidate genes which could be subject to such translational regulation, among which DNA repair factors. Such transcripts, fitting the definition of modification tunable transcripts, are central in the bacterial response to antibiotics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly serious threat to global public health. Our recent finding that many tRNA modification genes are involved in the response to antibiotics from different families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babosan et al., 2022</xref>) led to further investigate the links between environmental factors (e.g. traces of antibiotics), tRNA modifications and bacterial survival to antibiotics.</p>
<p>The regulatory roles of RNA modifications was first proposed for eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Pollo-Oliveira &amp; de Crecy-Lagard, 2019</xref>) and their importance in human diseases has recently emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chujo &amp; Tomizawa, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Suzuki, 2021</xref>). In bacteria, while some tRNA modifications are essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zhong et al., 2019</xref>), the absence of many RNA modification shows no growth phenotype in unstressed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">de Crecy-Lagard &amp; Jaroch, 2021</xref>). At the molecular level, the roles of tRNA modifications in differential codon decoding have been described in various species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bruni, Colantuoni, Sbordone, Cortese, &amp; Blasi, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Parker, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Taylor, Trieber, Trescher, &amp; Bekkering, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Urbonavicius, Qian, Durand, Hagervall, &amp; Bjork, 2001</xref>). In most cases, no growth phenotype was associated with these variations in decoding in bacteria. Recent studies, however, do highlight the links between tRNA modifications and stress responses in several bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aubee, Olu, &amp; Thompson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chionh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">de Crecy-Lagard &amp; Jaroch, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Fleming et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hou, Matsubara, Takase, Masuda, &amp; Sulkowska, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Thompson &amp; Gottesman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Thongdee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Vecerek, Moll, &amp; Blasi, 2007</xref>), and new modifications are still being discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kimura, Dedon, &amp; Waldor, 2020</xref>). Until recently, few tRNA modification factors have been clearly linked with resistance and persistence to antibiotics, via differential codon decoding in cell membrane and efflux proteins (TrmD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Masuda et al., 2019</xref>), MiaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Taylor et al., 1998</xref>)). A link between stress and adaptation was described to occur via the existence of modification tunable transcripts, or MoTTs.</p>
<p>MoTTs were first (and mostly) defined in eukaryotes as transcripts that will be translated more or less efficiently depending on the presence or absence of tRNA modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Endres, Dedon, &amp; Begley, 2015</xref>), namely upon stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Advani &amp; Ivanov, 2019</xref>). In bacteria, links between tRNA modifications and the response to several stresses are highlighted by studies focusing on the following MoTT/codon and tRNA modification couples (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">de Crecy-Lagard &amp; Jaroch, 2021</xref>)): differential translation of RpoS/leucine codons via MiaA (<italic>E. coli</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aubee et al., 2016</xref>); Fur/serine codons via MiaB, in response to low iron (<italic>E. coli</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Vecerek et al., 2007</xref>); MgtA/proline codons via TrmD, in response to low magnesium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hou et al., 2017</xref>); catalases/phenylalanine and aspartate codons via TrmB, during oxidative stress (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Thongdee et al., 2019</xref>). Mycobacterial response to hypoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chionh et al., 2016</xref>) also features MoTTs. In this latter study, specific stress response genes were identified <italic>in silico,</italic> through their codon usage bias, and then experimentally confirmed for their differential translation. tRNA modification-dependent translational reprogramming in response to antibiotic stress has not been the focus of a study so far in bacteria.</p>
<p>During studies in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, we recently discovered that t/rRNA modifications play a central role in response to stress caused by antibiotics with very different modes of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babosan et al., 2022</xref>), not through resistance development, but by modulating tolerance. The identified RNA modification genes had not previously been associated with any antibiotic resistance phenotype. The fact that different tRNA modifications have opposite effects on tolerance to different antibiotics highlights the complexity of such a network, and shows that the observed phenotypes are not merely due to a general mistranslation effect. Since tRNA modifications affect codon decoding and accuracy, it is important to address how differential translation can generate proteome diversity, and eventually adaptation to antibiotics.</p>
<p>In particular, deletion of the <italic>tgt</italic> gene encoding tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> confers a strong growth defect in the presence of aminoglycosides at doses below the minimal inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babosan et al., 2022</xref>). Tgt incorporates queuosine (Q) in the place of guanosine (G) in the wobble position of four tRNAs with GUN anticodon (tRNA<sup>Asp</sup><sub>GUC</sub>, tRNA<sup>Asn</sup><sub>GUU</sub>, tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup><sub>GUA</sub>, tRNA<sup>His</sup><sub>GUG</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ehrenhofer-Murray, 2017</xref>). The tRNAs with “AUN” anticodons are not present in the genome, and thus each one of the four GUN tRNAs decodes two synonymous codons (aspartate GAC/GAT, asparagine AAC/AAT, tyrosine TAC/TAT, histidine CAC/CAT which differ in the third position). Q34 is known to increase or decrease translation error rates in eukaryotes in a codon and organism specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ehrenhofer-Murray, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Meier, Suter, Grosjean, Keith, &amp; Kubli, 1985</xref>). Q34 was shown to induce mild oxidative stress resistance in the eukaryotic parasite <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, the causative agent of amebic dysentery, and to attenuate its virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Nagaraja et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the absence of Q34 modification was found to decrease mistranslation rates by tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, while increasing it for tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Manickam, Joshi, Bhatt, &amp; Farabaugh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Manickam, Nag, Abbasi, Patel, &amp; Farabaugh, 2014</xref>). No significant biological difference was found in <italic>E. coli Δtgt</italic> mutant, except for a slight defect in stationary phase viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Noguchi, Nishimura, Hirota, &amp; Nishimura, 1982</xref>), and more recently an involvement in biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Diaz-Rullo &amp; Gonzalez-Pastor, 2023</xref>). Recent studies show that the <italic>E. coli tgt</italic> mutant is more sensitive to aminoglycosides but not to ampicillin nor spectinomycin and is more sensitive to oxidative stress but the molecular mechanisms were not elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Pollo-Oliveira et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>We asked here how queuosine (Q) modification by Tgt modulates the response to low doses of aminoglycosides. We find that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> Δ<italic>tgt</italic> displays differential decoding of tyrosine TAC versus TAT codons. Molecular reporters, coupled to proteomics and <italic>in silico</italic> analysis, reveal that several proteins with codon usage biased towards TAT (versus TAC) are more efficiently translated in Δ<italic>tgt</italic>. One of these proteins is RsxA, which prevents activation of SoxR oxidative stress response regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Koo et al., 2003</xref>). We propose that tobramycin treatment leads to increased expression of <italic>tgt</italic> and Q34 modification, which in turn allows for more efficient Sox regulon related oxidative stress response, and better response to tobramycin. Lastly, bioinformatic analysis identified DNA repair gene transcripts with TAT codon bias as transcripts modulated by Q34 modification, which was confirmed by decreased UV susceptibility of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> Δ<italic>tgt</italic>.</p>

<p><bold>Competition experiments</bold> were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babosan et al., 2022</xref>): overnight cultures from single colonies of mutant <italic>lacZ</italic>+ and WT <italic>lacZ</italic>-strains were washed in PBS (Phosphate Buffer Saline) and mixed 1:1 (500 μl + 500 μl). At this point 100 μl of the mix were serial diluted and plated on MH agar supplemented with X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside) at 40 μg/mL to assess T0 initial 1:1 ratio. At the same time, 10 μl from the mix were added to 2 mL of MH or MH supplemented with sub-MIC antibiotics (concentrations, unless indicated otherwise: TOB: tobramycin 0.6 μg/ml; GEN: 0.5 µg/ml; CIP: ciprofloxacin 0.01 μg/ml, CRB: carbenicillin 2.5 μg/ml), PQ: paraquat 10 µM, or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>: 0.5 mM. Cultures were incubated with agitation at 37°C for 20 hours, and then diluted and plated on MH agar plates supplemented with X-gal. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C and the number of blue and white CFUs was assessed. Competitive index was calculated by dividing the number of blue CFUs (<italic>lacZ</italic>+ strain) by the number of white CFUs (<italic>lacZ</italic>-strain) and normalizing this ratio to the T0 initial ratio. When a plasmid was present, antibiotic was added to maintain selection: kanamycin 50 µg/ml for pSEVA.</p>

Trypsin was selected as protease allowing for up to two missed cleavages. The minimum peptide length was set to 5 amino acids. The false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide and protein identification was set to 0.01. The main search peptide tolerance was set to 4.5 ppm and to 20 ppm for the MS/MS match tolerance. One unique peptide to the protein group was required for the protein identification. A false discovery rate cut-off of 1 % was applied at the peptide and protein levels.</p>
<p>The statistical analysis of the proteomics data was performed as follows: three biological replicates were acquired per condition. To highlight significantly differentially abundant proteins between two conditions, differential analyses were conducted through the following data analysis pipeline: (1) deleting the reverse and potential contaminant proteins; (2) keeping only proteins with at least two quantified values in one of the three compared conditions to limit misidentifications and ensure a minimum of replicability; (3) log2-transformation of the remaining intensities of proteins; (4) normalizing the intensities by median centering within conditions thanks to the normalizeD function of the R package DAPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Wieczorek et al., 2017</xref>), (5) putting aside proteins without any value in one of both compared conditions: as they are quantitatively present in a condition and absent in another, they are considered as differentially abundant proteins and (6) performing statistical differential analysis on them by requiring a minimum fold-change of 2.5 between conditions and by using a LIMMA t test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) combined with an adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg correction of the <italic>p</italic>-values thanks to the adjust.p function of the R package cp4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Giai Gianetto et al., 2016</xref>).

<p>Quantification of queuosine in tRNA-Tyr from purified tRNA-enriched RNA fractions was performed using a non-radioactive Northern blot method: the procedure for pouring and running N-acryloyl-3-aminophenylboronic acid (APB) gels was based on the method detailed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cirzi &amp; Tuorto, 2021</xref>). tRNA-Tyr were detected using the following 3’-end digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probe: 5’ - CTTTGGCCACTCGGGAACCCCTCC - 3’DIG.</p>
<p>For 1 gel, ABP gel buffer was prepared by mixing 4.2g urea, 50mg 3-(Acrylamido) phenylboronic acid (Sigma Aldrich Cat No. 771465), 1ml 10X RNase-free TAE, 3.2ml 30% acrylamide and bis-acrylamide solution 37.5:1 and adding water to adjust the final volume to 10ml. After stirring to facilitate dissolution and right before pouring, 10µl TEMED and 60 μL 10% APS were added to the 10ml ABP buffer to catalyze and initiate polymerization respectively. Gels were casted using the Mini-PROTEAN® Bio-Rad handcast system, short plates (70×100 mm), 0.75 mm spacers and 10-well gel combs. Gels were left to polymerize at room temperature for 50 minutes.</p>
<p>Alkaline hydrolysis in 100mM of Tris-HCl pH 9 of our tRNA-enriched RNA extracts was carried out at 37°C for 30 min to break the ester bonds between tRNAs and their cognate amino acids. 10µl of the deacylated tRNA-enriched RNA samples were mixed with 8 µl of 2X RNA loading dye (Thermo Scientific™ Cat No. R0641), denatured for 3 min at 72°C and the whole volume was loaded onto the gel. Electrophoresis of the gels were carried out in the Mini-PROTEAN® Tetra Vertical Electrophoresis Cell for 30 min at 85V at room temperature followed by 1h30 at 140 V at 4°C. Gels were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with shaking in 50 ml 1X RNAse-free TAE mixed with 10 µl of 10000X SYBR Gold nucleic acid staining solution (Invitrogen™ S11494) and nucleic acids were visualized using a transilluminator. Transfers of the nucleic acids to positively charged nylon membranes were performed at 5 V/gel for 40 min at room temperature using a semi dry blotting system. RNAs were crosslinked to the membrane surface through exposure to 254 nm UV light at a dose of 1.2 Joules.</p>
<p>Membranes were transferred into glass bottles containing 5ml of pre-warmed hybridization buffer and incubated for 1 hour at 42°C at a constant rotation in a hybridization oven.

Membranes were washed 2 time with 2X SSC/5% SDS for 15 min at 42°C and 1 time with 1X SSC/1% SDS for 15min at 42°C.</p>
<p>Nucleic acids wash and immunological detection of the DIG-labeled probes were performed using the DIG Wash and Block Buffer Set (Roche, Cat No. 11585762001) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Membranes were placed in a plastic container filled with 15ml of the blocking solution for nonspecific binding sites blocking. After 30min incubation at room temperature with rotation, 3µl of the alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-DIG antibody (Fab fragments, Roche, Cat No. 11093274910) were added to the buffer and incubation at room temperature on a belly-dancer was allowed for 30 more min. Next, membranes were washed 3 times 15 min with DIG-wash buffer and once with DIG-detection buffer for 5min. For chemiluminescence visualization of the probe, 1ml of CDP-Star® Chemiluminescent Substrate (Disodium 2-chloro-5-(4-methoxyspiro[1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5-chlorotricyclo[3.3.1.13.7]decan])-4-yl]-1-phenyl phosphate) (Roche, Cat No. 11685627001) was added to 9ml of DIG-detection buffer and membranes were then incubated with the substrate for 5 min.

Sequencing reads are first trimmed to remove adaptors then aligned to the two <italic>V. cholerae</italic> chromosomes (NC_002505 and NC_002506). Reads aligned uniquely are used to perform the differential gene expression analysis.

Due to this specificity and A-T biases in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome, ribosome profiling data exhibit a high level of noise that prevents the obtention of a resolution at the nucleotide level. The effect of ribosome stalling at TAT codons on total mRNA ribosome occupancy is likely highly variable, depending on the location of the TAT codon(s) within the CDS and the gene’s expression level. We therefore interpreted genes in the “Up” category as ones that mainly correspond to genes that are more translated because the impact of pausing at TAT codons is probably not strong enough.</p>

The codon usage bias for a given codon and a given gene was then computed by subtracting the corresponding proportion obtained from the global counts from the proportion obtained for this gene. Codon usage biases were then standardized by dividing each of the above difference by the standard deviation of these differences across all genes, resulting in standardized codon usage biases “by amino acid” (“SCUB by aa” in short).

The following tRNAs-<sub>AUN</sub> are synthetic tRNAs which are not present in the genome: Tyr<sub>AUA</sub>, His<sub>AUG</sub>, Asn<sub>AUU</sub>, Asp<sub>AUC</sub>. tRNA<sup>Phe</sup><sub>GAA</sub> was also used as non Tgt-modified control. Overexpression of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, but not tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> rescues the <italic>Δtgt</italic> mutant’s growth defect in sub-MIC TOB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). Overexpression of tRNA<sup>His</sup><sub>AUG</sub> also seemed to confer a benefit compared to empty plasmid (p0), but not as strong as tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Sup. Fig. S1B</xref>). We do not observe any major rescue of tobramycin sensitive phenotypes when the other tRNAs are overexpressed, suggesting that changes in Tyr codon decoding is mostly responsible for the <italic>Δtgt</italic> mutant’s tobramycin susceptibility phenotype.</p>

<title>Q modification influences amino acid incorporation at tyrosine codons</title>
<p>We decided to measure the efficiency of amino acid incorporation at corresponding codons in <italic>Δtgt</italic>, using <italic>gfp</italic> reporters. First, we confirmed that GFP fluorescence from native GFP (encoded by <italic>gfpmut3</italic>) is not affected in <italic>Δtgt</italic> compared to WT (<italic>gfp+</italic> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), indicating that there are no major differences on expression or folding of the GFP in <italic>Δtgt</italic>. We next constructed <italic>gfp</italic> fluorescent reporters by introducing within their coding sequence, stretches of repeated identical codons, for Asp/Asn/Tyr/His. This set of reporters revealed that the absence of Q34 leads to an increase of amino acid incorporation at Tyr TAT codons, both without and with tobramycin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> NT and TOB). This was not the case for Asp (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), nor for Asn (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), and we observed a slighter and more variable change for His (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). No significant effect of <italic>tgt</italic> was observed for 2<sup>nd</sup> near-cognate codons obtained by changing 1 base of the triplet for TAC and TAT codons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>): Phe TTC/TTT, Cys TGT/TGC, Ser TCT/TCC (the 3<sup>rd</sup> near-cognate stop codons TAA and TAG were not tested in this setup). Thus, Q34 modification strongly impacts the decoding of Tyr codons, and to a lesser extent His codons in this reporter system.</p>

<p>We also tested decoding reporters for TAT/TAC in WT and <italic>Δtgt</italic> overexpressing tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> in trans (Fig. S1C). The presence of the plasmid (empty p0) amplified differences between the two strains with decreased decoding of TAC (and increased TAT, as expected) in <italic>Δtgt</italic> compared to WT. Overexpression of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup><sub>GUA</sub> did not significantly impact decoding of TAT and increased decoding of TAC, as expected. Since overexpression of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup><sub>GUA</sub> rescues <italic>Δtgt</italic> in tobramycin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>) and facilitates TAC decoding, this suggests that issues with TAC codon decoding contribute to the fitness defect observed in <italic>Δtgt</italic> upon growth with tobramycin. Overexpression of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup><sub>AUA</sub> increased decoding of TAT in WT but did not change it in <italic>Δtgt</italic> where it is already high. Unexpectedly, overexpression of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup><sub>AUA</sub> also increased decoding of TAC in WT. Thus, overexpression of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup><sub>AUA</sub> possibly changes the equilibrium between the decoding of TAC vs TAT and may restore translation of TAC enriched transcripts.</p>
<p>GFP reporters tested above with codon stretches were pivotal for the identification of codons for which decoding efficiency differs between WT and <italic>Δtgt</italic>, even though it’s not a natural setup. We next developed a biologically relevant β-lactamase reporter tool to assess differences in the decoding of the tyrosine codons in WT and <italic>Δtg</italic>t strains. The amino acids Tyr103 and Asp129 of the β-lactamase, were previously shown to be important for its function in resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, such as carbenicillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Doucet, De Wals, &amp; Pelletier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Escobar, Miller, &amp; Fink, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jacob, Joris, Lepage, Dusart, &amp; Frere, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>We replaced the native Tyr103 TAC with the synonymous codon Tyr103 TAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). While in the WT, both versions of β-lactamase conferred similar growth in carbenicillin with or without sub-MIC TOB, in the <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain the Tyr-TAT version grows better than the Tyr TAC version upon exposure to TOB stress. This suggests a more efficient translation of the Tyr103 TAT β-lactamase mRNA, compared to the native Tyr103 TAC version, in stressed <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain.</p>

<title>Q modification impacts decoding fidelity in <italic>V. cholerae</italic></title>
<p>To test whether a defect in Q34 modification influences the fidelity of translation in the presence and absence of tobramycin, previously developed reporter tools were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Fabret &amp; Namy, 2021</xref>), to measure stop codons readthrough in <italic>V. cholerae Δtgt</italic> and wild-type strains. The system consists of vectors containing readthrough promoting signals inserted between the <italic>lacZ</italic> and <italic>luc</italic> sequences, encoding β-galactosidase and luciferase, respectively. Luciferase activity reflects the readthrough efficiency, while β-galactosidase activity serves as an internal control of expression level, integrating a number of possible sources of variability (plasmid copy number, transcriptional activity, mRNA stability, and translation rate). We found increased readthrough at stop codons UAA and to a lesser extent at UAG for <italic>Δtgt</italic>, and this increase was amplified for UAG in presence of tobramycin (Fig. S2, stop readthrough). In the case of UAA, tobramycin appears to decrease readthrough, this may be artefactual, due to the toxic effect of tobramycin on <italic>Δtgt</italic>.</p>
<p>Mistranslation at specific codons can also impact protein synthesis. To further investigate mistranslation levels by tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> in WT and <italic>Δtgt</italic>, we designed a set of <italic>gfp</italic> mutants where the codon for the catalytic tyrosine required for fluorescence (TAT at position 66) was substituted by near-cognate codons (Fig. S2). Results suggest that in this sequence context, particularly in the presence of tobramycin, non-modified tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> mistakenly decodes Asp GAC, His CAC and also Ser UCC, Ala GCU, Gly GGU, Leu CUU and Val GUC codons, suggesting that Q34 increases the fidelity of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>.</p>
<p>In parallel, we replaced Tyr103 of the β-lactamase described above, with Asp codons GAT or GAC. The expression of the resulting mutant β-lactamase is expected to yield a carbenicillin sensitive phenotype. In this system, increased tyrosine misincorporation (more mistakes) by tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> at the mutated Asp codon, will lead to increased synthesis of active β-lactamase, which can be evaluated by carbenicillin tolerance tests. As such, amino-acid misincorporation leads here to phenotypic (transient) tolerance, while genetic reversion mutations result in resistance (growth on carbenicillin). The rationale is summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>. When the Tyr103 codon was replaced with either Asp codons, we observe increased β-lactamase tolerance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, left</xref>), suggesting increased misincorporation of tyrosine by tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> at Asp codons in the absence of Q, again suggesting that Q34 prevents misdecoding of Asp codons by tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>.</p>
<p>In order to test any effect on an additional tRNA modified by Tgt, namely tRNA<sup>Asp</sup>, we mutated the Asp129 (GAT) codon of the β-lactamase. When Asp129 was mutated to Tyr TAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, right</xref>), we observe reduced tolerance in <italic>Δtgt,</italic> but not when it was mutated to Tyr TAC, suggesting less misincorporation of aspartate by tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> at the Tyr UAU codon in the absence of Q. In summary, absence of Q34 increases misdecoding by tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> at Asp codons, but decreases misdecoding by tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> at Tyr UAU.</p>
<p>This supports the fact that tRNA Q34 modification is involved in translation fidelity during antibiotic stress, and that the effects can be different on different tRNAs, e.g. tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> and tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> tested here.</p>

<title>Proteomics study identifies RsxA among factors for which translation is most impacted in <italic>Δtgt</italic></title>
<p>These observations show a link between Q34 modification of tRNA, differential decoding of Tyr codons (among others) and susceptibility to aminoglycosides. We hypothesized that proteins that are differentially translated according to their Tyr codon usage could be involved in the decreased efficiency of the response to aminoglycoside stress in <italic>Δtgt.</italic> We conducted a proteomics study comparing WT vs <italic>Δtgt,</italic> in the absence and presence of tobramycin (proteomics <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Loss of Q34 results in generally decreased detection of many proteins in tobramycin (shift towards the left in the volcano plot <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4AB</xref>), and in increases in the levels of 96 proteins. Among those, RsxA (encoded by VC1017) is 13-fold more abundant in the <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain compared to WT in tobramycin. RsxA is part of an anti-SoxR complex. SoxR is an oxidative stress response regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Koo et al., 2003</xref>) that controls <italic>sodA</italic> (VC2694, superoxide dismutase) and <italic>acrA</italic> (VC0913, efflux), among other genes of the regulon. The Rsx complex reduces and inactivates SoxR, preventing the induction of the regulon. Consistently, we find that the levels of SodA and AcrA proteins are decreased in <italic>Δtgt</italic> compared to WT in TOB (indicated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>With 83% of Tyr TAT codons, instead of the expected 53% average, RsxA has a clear codon usage bias. To test whether some of the differentially abundant protein groups in the Q34 deficient mutant show similar biases, the Tyr codon usage was calculated for the 96 more abundant and 195 less abundant proteins expressed in TOB. More abundant proteins in <italic>Δtgt</italic> TOB with a codon usage bias towards TAT vs TAC are represented as light blue dots in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4AB</xref>. No statistically significant difference was detected for TAT codon usage in neither sets of proteins. Thus, one cannot draw conclusions or infer predictions about codon decoding efficiencies in a tRNA modification mutant such as <italic>Δtgt</italic> from the proteomics data alone.</p>
<p>We thus performed Ribo-seq (ribosome profiling) analysis on extracts from WT and <italic>Δtgt</italic> strains grown in presence of sub-MIC TOB. Unlike for eukaryotes, technical limitations (e.g. the RNase which is used displays significant sequence specificity), do not necessarily allow to obtain codon resolution in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Mohammad, Green, &amp; Buskirk, 2019</xref>). However, we determined 159 transcripts with increased and 197 with decreased translation in <italic>Δtgt</italic> and we plotted their standardized codon usage bias for codons of interest (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4DEFG</xref>). The calculation of this value is explained in details in the materials and methods section, and shown for <italic>rsxA</italic> as example in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>. Briefly, we took as reference the mean proportion of the codons of interest in the genome (e.g. for tyrosine: TAT= 0.53 and TAC= 0.47, meaning that for a random <italic>V. cholerae</italic> gene, 53% of tyrosine codons are TAT). For each gene, we calculated the proportion of each codon (e.g. for <italic>rsxA</italic>: TAT=0.83 and TAC=0.17). We next calculated the codon usage bias as the difference between a given gene’s codon usage and the mean codon usage (e.g. for <italic>rsxA</italic>, the codon usage bias for TAT is 0.83-0.53=+0.30). Finally, in order to consider the codon distribution on the genome and obtain statistically significant values, we calculated standardized bias by dividing the codon usage bias by standard deviation for each codon (e.g. for <italic>rsxA</italic>, 0.30/0.25 = +1.20). This is done to adjust standard deviation to 1, and thus to get comparable (standardized) values, for each codon.</p>
<p>Ribo-seq data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>) shows that TAT codon usage was decreased in the list of transcripts with decreased translation efficiency in <italic>Δtgt</italic>, while it was increased in the list of transcripts with increased translation efficiency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4DE</xref>). No difference was detected for AAT and CAT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4FG</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to mistranslation and codon decoding efficiency, other factors also influence detected protein levels, such as transcription, degradation, etc. Moreover, the localization and sequence context of the codons for which the efficiency of translation is impacted, may be important. Nevertheless, as translation of proteins with a codon usage bias towards TAC or TAT may be impacted in <italic>Δtgt</italic>, and as the most abundant protein RsxA in <italic>Δtgt</italic> in TOB shows a strong TAT bias, we decided to evaluate whether RsxA is post-transcriptionally regulated by the Q34 modification and whether it may affect fitness in the presence of tobramycin.</p>

<title>RsxA is post-transcriptionally upregulated in <italic>Δtgt</italic> due to more efficient decoding of tyrosine TAT codons in the absence of Q34 modification</title>
<p>Transcriptomic analysis comparing at least 2-fold differentially expressed genes between <italic>V. cholerae Δtgt</italic> and WT strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Table S3</xref>) showed that, respectively, 53 and 26 genes were significantly downregulated in MH and tobramycin, and 34 were up in tobramycin.

<p>RsxA carries 6 tyrosine codons among which the first 5 are TAT and the last one is TAC.

Since increased <italic>rsxA</italic> expression appeared to be somewhat toxic for growth, and in order to test translation on a reporter which confers no growth defect, we chose to test directly the translation of <italic>gfp</italic>, which originally carries 4 TAT (36%) and 7 TAC (64%) codons in its native sequence. We constructed two synonymous versions of the GFP protein, with all 11 tyrosine codons either changed to TAT or to TAC. Similar to what we observed with <italic>rsxA</italic>, the GFP<sup>TAT</sup> version, but not the GFP<sup>TAC</sup> one, generated more fluorescence in the <italic>Δtgt</italic> background, (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> and detailed flow cytometry data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Sup.

<p>Since not all TAT biased proteins are found to be enriched in <italic>Δtgt</italic> proteomics data, the sequence context surrounding TAT codons could affect their decoding. To illustrate this, we inserted after the <italic>gfp</italic> start codon, various tyrosine containing sequences displayed by <italic>rsxA</italic> (Fig. S3G). The native tyrosines were all TAT codons, our synthetic constructs were either TAT or TAC, while keeping the remaining sequence unchanged. We observe that the production of GFP carrying the TEY<sup>TAT</sup>LLL sequence from RsxA is increased in <italic>Δtgt</italic> compared to WT, while it is unchanged with TEY<sup>TAC</sup>LLL. However, production of the GFP with the sequences LY<sup>TAT</sup>RLL/LY<sup>TAC</sup>RLL and EY<sup>TAT</sup>LR/ EY<sup>TAC</sup>LR was not unaffected (or even decreased for the latter) by the absence of <italic>tgt</italic>. Overall, our results demonstrate that RsxA is upregulated in the <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain at the translational level, and that proteins with a codon usage bias towards tyrosine TAT are prone to be more efficiently translated in the absence of Q modification, but this is also dependent on the sequence context.</p>

<title>Increased expression of RsxA hampers growth in sub-MIC TOB</title>
<p>We asked whether high levels of RsxA could be responsible of <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain’s increased sensitivity to tobramycin. <italic>rsxA</italic> cannot be deleted since it is essential in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (see our TN-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babosan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Negro et al., 2019</xref>)). We overexpressed <italic>rsxA</italic> from an inducible plasmid in WT strain. In the presence of tobramycin, overexpression of <italic>rsxA</italic> in the WT strain strongly reduces growth (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D with inducer, black curve compared to blue</xref>), while overexpression of <italic>tgt</italic> restores growth of the <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D with inducer, green curve</xref>). This shows that increased <italic>rsxA</italic> levels can be toxic during growth in sub-MIC TOB and is consistent with decreased growth of the <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain.</p>
<p>Unlike for <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, <italic>rsxA</italic> is not an essential gene in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and does not bear a TAT bias. It has however the same function. Note that this is not the first instance where we observe differences between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> regarding oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baharoglu, Krin, &amp; Mazel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baharoglu &amp; Mazel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baharoglu &amp; Mazel, 2014</xref>) and respiration processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Krin, Carvalho, Lang, Mazel, &amp; Baharoglu, 2023</xref>): the dispensability of <italic>rsxA</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic> could either be due to the presence of an additional redundant pathway in this species, or alternatively to general differences in how the two species respond to stress.</p>
<p>In order to confirm that the presence of RsxA can be toxic during growth in tobramycin, we additionally performed competition experiments in <italic>E. coli</italic> with simple and double mutants of <italic>tgt</italic> and <italic>rsxA</italic>. Since <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain’s growth is more affected than WT at TOB 0.5 µg/ml (indicated with an arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Sup.

The results confirm that inactivation of <italic>rsxA</italic> in <italic>Δtgt</italic> restores fitness in tobramycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Sup.

<p>Regarding induction by tobramycin, the mechanism remains to be determined. We previously showed that sub-MIC TOB induces the stringent response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babosan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Carvalho, Krin, Korlowski, Mazel, &amp; Baharoglu, 2021</xref>). Since induction of <italic>tgt</italic> expression by SHX and by tobramycin seems to be in the same order of magnitude, we hypothesized that tobramycin could induce <italic>tgt</italic> through the activation of the stringent response. Using a <italic>P1rrnB-gfp</italic> fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babosan et al., 2022</xref>), which is down-regulated upon stringent response induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Kolmsee, Delic, Agyenim, Calles, &amp; Wagner, 2011</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), we found that the stringent response is significantly induced by tobramycin, both in WT and <italic>Δtgt</italic>. Tobramycin may induce <italic>tgt</italic> expression through stringent response activation or through an independent pathway.</p>

<title>Q modification levels can be dynamic and are directly influenced by <italic>tgt</italic> transcription levels</title>
<p>We have identified conditions regulating <italic>tgt</italic> expression. We next addressed whether up/down-regulation of <italic>tgt</italic> affects the actual Q34 modification levels of tRNA. We measured Q34 levels by mass spectrometry in WT and the <italic>Δcrp</italic> strain, where the strongest impact on <italic>tgt</italic> expression was observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). We find a significant 1.6-fold increase in Q34 levels in <italic>Δcrp</italic>. We also tested the effect of sub-MIC TOB, but smaller differences are probably not detected using our approach of mass spectrometry in bulk cultures.</p>
<p>In order to get deeper insight into modification level of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> tRNAs potentially having Q34 modification, we decided to adapt a recently published protocol for the detection and quantification of queuosine by deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Katanski et al., 2022</xref>). This allowed us to validate the presence of Q34 modification in the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> tRNAs Asp, His and Asn GTT2 and precisely measure its level and modulation under different growth conditions (Fig. S5). We also showed that Q34 detection is robust and reproducible, and reveals increased Q34 content for tRNA<sup>His</sup> and tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> in <italic>Δcrp</italic> strain where <italic>tgt</italic> expression was induced, while for tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> Q34 level remains relatively constant. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> tRNA<sup>Asn</sup>GTT1 is very low expressed and likely contains only sub-stoichiometric amounts of Q34, while analysis of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> is impeded by the presence of other modifications in the anticodon loop (namely i<sup>6</sup>A37 or its derivatives), which prevents the correct mapping and quantification of Q34 modifications using deletion signature.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate Q34 levels in tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> more specifically, we performed APB northern blots allowing visualization and quantification of Q-modified and unmodified tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cirzi &amp; Tuorto, 2021</xref>). As anticipated from increased <italic>tgt</italic> expression, Q-modified tRNA levels were strongly increased in <italic>Δcrp</italic> strain. Sub-MIC TOB also increases the proportion of Q34 containing tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> compared to the non-treated condition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). However, this result was variable suggesting a subtle fine-tuning of the Q34 levels depending on growth state (optical density) and TOB concentration. These results show that tRNA Q34 modification levels are dynamic and correlate with variations in <italic>tgt</italic> expression, depending on the tRNA.</p>

<title>DNA repair genes are TAT-biased</title>
<p>We further analyzed <italic>in silico</italic> the codon usage of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome, and for each gene, we assigned a codon usage value to each codon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C and</xref> doi:10.5281/zenodo.6875293). This allowed the generation of lists of genes with divergent codon usage, for each codon.</p>
<p>For genes with a tyrosine codon usage bias towards TAT in <italic>V. cholerae,</italic> gene ontology enrichment analysis (Sup.

We hypothesized that translation of DNA repair transcripts could be more efficient in <italic>Δtgt</italic>, and that such basal pre-induction would be beneficial during genotoxic treatments as UV irradiation (single stranded DNA breaks). UV associated DNA damage is repaired through RecA, RecFOR and RuvAB dependent homologous recombination. Five of these genes, <italic>recO, recR, recA</italic> and <italic>ruvA-ruvB</italic>, are biased towards TAT in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, red arrows), while their repressor LexA bears a strong bias towards TAC. DNA repair genes (e.g. <italic>ruvA</italic> with 80% TAT, <italic>ruvB</italic> with 83% TAT, <italic>dinB</italic> with 75% TAT) were also found to be up for Δ<italic>tgt</italic> in the Ribo-seq data, with unchanged transcription levels. <italic>V. cholerae Δtgt</italic> appears to be 4 to 9 times more resistant to UV irradiation than the WT strain (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Better response to UV in the <italic>V. cholerae Δtgt</italic> strain is consistent with the possibility of increased DNA repair efficiency, although the results do not exclude another mechanism underlying the UV phenotype, such as oxidative stress response.</p>

We also analyzed tyrosine codon usage for the DNA repair genes in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and did not observe the same bias (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>), with 51% TAT bias, i.e. the expected level for a random group of genes of the <italic>E coli</italic> genome, and with a TAC bias for <italic>recOR</italic> and <italic>recA</italic> (red arrows) and strong TAT bias for <italic>lexA</italic> (blue arrow) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Sup.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We show here that Q34 modification levels can be dynamic in bacteria and respond to external conditions; and that Q34 levels on <italic>V. cholerae</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> correlate with <italic>tgt</italic> expression. This is clearer in conditions where <italic>tgt</italic> transcription is highly induced (<italic>Δcrp</italic>), and more variable in conditions where this induction is low (tobramycin). As summarized in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, we propose that exposure to aminoglycosides increases <italic>tgt</italic> expression in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, and impacts the decoding of tyrosine codons. As a consequence, transcripts with biased tyrosine codon usage are differentially translated. One such transcript codes for RsxA, an anti-SoxR factor. SoxR controls a regulon involved in oxidative stress response and sub-MIC aminoglycosides trigger oxidative stress in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baharoglu et al., 2013</xref>), pointing to an involvement of oxidative stress response in the response to sub-MIC tobramycin stress. A link between Q34 and oxidative stress has previously been found in eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Nagaraja et al., 2021</xref>). Note that our results do not exclude the involvement of additional Q-regulated translation of other transcripts in the response to tobramycin. Q34 modification leads to reprogramming of the whole proteome, not only for other transcripts with codon usage bias, but also through an impact on the levels of stop codon readthrough and mistranslation at specific codons, as supported by our data.</p>

<caption><title>Model.</title>
<p>Upon exposure to sub-MIC aminoglycosides, the expression of <italic>tgt</italic> is up-regulated in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and influences the decoding of tyrosine TAC vs TAT codons. This leads to differential translation from transcripts bearing a codon usage bias for tyrosine codons. The <italic>rsxA</italic> transcript bears a tyrosine codon bias and its translation can be tuned by tRNA Q modification. RsxA is an anti-SoxR factor. SoxR controls a regulon involved in oxidative stress response. When RsxA levels are high, SoxR is increasingly inactivated and oxidative stress response efficiency decreases. It has been previously shown that sub-MIC aminoglycosides trigger oxidative stress in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>{Baharoglu, 2013 #720}. Increasing RsxA levels thus reduces fitness in TOB by hampering efficient oxidative stress response. As a corollary, decreased RsxA would lead to increased expression of the SoxR regulon, which would allow for more efficient response to oxidative stress, and increased fitness in the presence of sub-MIC TOB. We propose that when Tgt/Q levels in tRNA increase, RsxA synthesis is low and active SoxR levels are high, facilitating the bacterial response to aminoglycoside dependent oxidative stress.

<p>In the tested conditions, we observe more efficient decoding of TAT versus TAC codons in the absence of Q, in <italic>V. cholerae.</italic> This is consistent with findings in human tRNAs, where the presence of Q34 increases translation of transcripts biased in C-ending codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Huber et al., 2022</xref>). However, the opposite was shown in <italic>E. coli</italic> regarding tyrosine codon decoding efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Diaz-Rullo &amp; Gonzalez-Pastor, 2023</xref>). Recent studies in eukaryotes also indicate slower translation of U-ending codons in the absence of Q34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cirzi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Kulkarni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Tuorto et al., 2018</xref>). It’s important to note here, that in <italic>V. cholerae Δtgt</italic>, better decoding of U-ending codons is observed only with tyrosine, and not with the other three NAC/U codons (Histidine, Aspartate, Asparagine). This is interesting because it suggests that what we observe with tyrosine here, may not adhere to a general rule about the decoding efficiency of U- or C-ending codons, but instead seems to be specific to tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, at least in the context of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. Such exceptions may also exist in other organisms. For example, in human cells, Q34 increases efficiency of decoding for U-ending codons and slows decoding of C-ending codons except for AAC, i.e. tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> (X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>). In mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Tuorto et al., 2018</xref>), ribosome pausing at U-ending codons is strongly seen for Asp, His and Asn, but less with Tyr. In <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Kulkarni et al., 2021</xref>), reporters with a combination of the 4 NAC/NAU codons for Asp, Asn, Tyr, His have been tested, showing slow translation at U-ending version of the reporter in the absence of Q, but the effect on individual codons (e.g. Tyr only) was not tested. In mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cirzi et al., 2023</xref>), ribosome slowdown is seen for the Asn, Asp, His U-ending codons but not for the Tyr U-ending codon. In summary, Q34 generally increases decoding efficiency of U-ending codons in multiple organisms, but there appears to be additional parameters which affect tyrosine UAU decoding, at least in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. Additional factors such as mRNA secondary structures or mistranslation may also contribute to the better translation of UAU versions of tested genes. Mistranslation could be an important factor. If codon decoding fidelity impacts decoding speed, then mistranslation could also contribute to decoding efficiency of Tyr UAU/UAC codons and proteome composition.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings are in accordance with the concept of the so-called modification tunable transcripts (MoTTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Endres et al., 2015</xref>). We show that in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, a proteins’ codon content can influence its translation in a Q34 modification dependent way, and that this can also impact the translation of antibiotic resistance genes (here β-lactamase). Finally, we show that we can predict <italic>in silico</italic>, candidates for which translation can be modulated by the presence or absence of Q34 modification (e.g. DNA repair genes), which was confirmed using phenotypic tests (UV resistance).</p>
<p>Essential/housekeeping genes are generally TAC biased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Sup. Fig. S6AB</xref>), as well as ribosomal proteins, which carry mostly tyrosine TAC codons both in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. It has been proposed that codon bias corresponding to abundant tRNAs at such highly expressed genes, guarantees their proper expression and avoids titration of tRNAs, allowing for efficient expression of the rest of the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Frumkin et al., 2018</xref>). Induction of <italic>tgt</italic> by stress could also possibly be a signal for the cell to favor the synthesis of essential factors. Our results are also consistent with the fact that synonymous mutations can influence the expression of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Kudla, Murray, Tollervey, &amp; Plotkin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies, mostly in eukaryotes, reveal that tRNA modifications are dynamic and not static as initially thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Torrent, Chalancon, de Groot, Wuster, &amp; Madan Babu, 2018</xref>). Modification levels depend on growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Keith, Rogg, Dirheimer, Menichi, &amp; Heyham, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Moukadiri, Garzon, Bjork, &amp; Armengod, 2014</xref>), environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Frey, McCloskey, Kersten, &amp; Kersten, 1988</xref>) and stress (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Barraud &amp; Tisne, 2019</xref>)). Stress regulated tRNA modification levels have an impact on the translation of regulators, which in turn trigger translational reprogramming and optimized responses to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Galvanin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Persson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Pollo-Oliveira &amp; de Crecy-Lagard, 2019</xref>). We show here that <italic>tgt</italic> expression is regulated by tobramycin, the stringent response and the carbohydrate utilization regulator CRP, and that tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> Q34 modification levels increase with <italic>tgt</italic> expression. The fact that such correlation between <italic>tgt</italic> expression and Q34 levels does not occur for all tRNAs (e.g. tRNA<sup>Asp</sup>), indicates that other parameters also influence Q34 modification levels. One possibility is that other modifications, such as those on the anticodon loop of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, may influence the way Tgt modifies these tRNAs, as documented for other modification circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ehrenhofer-Murray, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Han &amp; Phizicky, 2018</xref>). Tgt may also bind these tRNAs differently (for a review on modification specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Barraud &amp; Tisne, 2019</xref>)).</p>
<p>Our results also demonstrate that we can identify other Q-dependent MoTT candidates using <italic>in silico</italic> codon usage analysis. In fact, since we now have extensively calculated the codon usage biases at all codons for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> genes, this approach is readily adaptable to any tRNA modification for which we know the differentially translated codons. Such regulation may be a possible way to tune the expression of essential or newly acquired genes, differing in GC-content. It may also, in some cases, explain antibiotic resistance profiles in bacterial collections with established genome sequences, and for which observed phenotypic resistance does not always correlate with known resistance factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Oprea et al., 2020</xref>). Further studies are needed to characterize the determinants of tRNA modification-dependent translational reprogramming.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Ideas and Speculation</title>
<p>Q34 modification is dynamically regulated. How tobramycin increases <italic>tgt</italic> expression remains an open question. Since there is a correlation between tobramycin and stringent response dependent induction of <italic>tgt</italic>, one hypothesis could be that tobramycin induces <italic>tgt</italic> through stringent response activation. The stringent response is usually triggered upon starvation, for example when amino acids are scarce. <italic>tgt</italic> expression was recently shown to be regulated by tyrosine levels and to affect tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> codon choice in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Dixit et al., 2021</xref>). Tyrosine import into cells occurs through the TyrP transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Whipp &amp; Pittard, 1977</xref>). Note that in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, sub-MIC TOB strongly decreases <italic>tyrP</italic> (VCA0772) expression (Carvalho, Krin, et al., 2021), and thus likely decreases tyrosine intake. We could not detect the TyrP protein in our proteomics data, we can thus not compare TyrP levels in <italic>Δtgt</italic> vs WT. We wondered whether supplementation with tyrosine or TyrP overexpression would reverse the <italic>Δtgt</italic> TOB sensitive fitness phenotype, but we observed no notable difference (not shown). Nevertheless, TyrP downregulation could be a signal mimicking tyrosine shortage and inducing <italic>tgt,</italic> leading to more efficient translation of TAC biased proteins, such as TyrP itself.</p>
<p>Regarding CRP, the carbon catabolite regulator, it represses transcription of <italic>tgt</italic>. Interestingly, <italic>V. cholerae crp</italic> carries only TAC codons for tyrosine, and is strongly down-regulated in <italic>Δtgt</italic> in our Ribo-seq data, while its transcription levels remain unchanged. The downregulation of CRP translation when Q34 modifications are low (as in the <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain), could be a way to de-repress <italic>tgt</italic> and increase Q34 modification levels. Note that CRP is involved in natural competence of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, during growth on crustacean shells where horizontal gene transfer occurs. One can thus speculate that during exogenous DNA uptake, <italic>tgt</italic> repression by CRP could lead to better decoding of AT rich (i.e. TAT biased) mRNAs. Thus, modulation of <italic>tgt</italic> levels during natural transformation may modulate the expression of horizontally transferred genes, which by definition may bear different GC content and codon usage. Moreover, if <italic>tgt</italic> expression is repressed by CRP during competence state, this would favor the translation of TAT-biased DNA repair genes and possibly recombination of incoming DNA into the chromosome. Translational reprogramming in response to DNA damage can thus be an advantageous property selected during evolution.</p>
<p><italic>V. cholerae</italic> is the model organism for different species of <italic>Vibrio</italic>. We have previously shown that <italic>V. cholerae’s</italic> response to sub-MIC antibiotic stress can be applied to other Gram-negative pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baharoglu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Gutierrez et al., 2013</xref>), while there are differences between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, in the response to sub-MIC antibiotics and oxidative stress phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baharoglu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baharoglu &amp; Mazel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Gutierrez et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we have also addressed some of the effects of TOB in <italic>E. coli Δtgt</italic> mutant. In <italic>E. coli,</italic> the deletion of <italic>tgt</italic> has a less dramatic effect on the susceptibility to TOB ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babosan et al., 2022</xref>) and Sup. Fig S4). <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> globally show similar tyrosine codon usage in their genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Sup. Fig. S6AB</xref>). However, <italic>E. coli rsxA</italic> does not display a codon bias towards TAT, and neither do DNA repair genes. One can think that in regard to MoTTs, different organisms have evolved according to the environments where they grow, selecting the integration of specific stress response pathways under specific post-transcriptional regulations.</p>
<p>It was recently shown that <italic>E. coli Δtgt</italic> strain is more resistant than the WT to nickel toxicity, most certainly because the nickel importer genes <italic>nikABCDE</italic> are less expressed, but the underlying molecular mechanism had not been elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Pollo-Oliveira et al., 2022</xref>). As NikR, the repressor of the <italic>nik</italic> operon is enriched in TAT codons (100%), a more efficient translation of the <italic>nikR</italic> gene in the absence of Q34 would lead to the observed repression phenotype. In addition, the nickel exporter gene <italic>rcnA</italic> is also enriched is TAT (100%), while one of the genes for subunits of the nickel importer <italic>nikD</italic> is enriched in TAC codons (100%). In combination this could explain the clear resistance of the <italic>tgt</italic> strain to high levels of nickel.</p>
<p>However, protein levels are not always in line with the codon bias predictions. The positions of the codons of interest and their sequence context may also be important for differential translation. There could be an interplay or synergies between different codons decoded by Q-modified tRNAs. The presence of the codons of interest in the 5’-end vs 3’-end of a transcript could have a bigger impact on the efficiency of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Boel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Osterman et al., 2020</xref>). A recent study testing TAC/TAT codons placed between two genes in a translational fusion yielded different results compared to our constructs with the tested codons at the 5’ of the transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kimura et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, the distance between two codons of interest, or the identity of the nearby codons may be important. The translation of highly transcribed genes and genes with low levels of mRNAs could be dissimilar. Codon usage may also directly impact gene expression at mRNA levels with an effect on transcription termination (F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>), especially for constitutive genes. Thus, the search for MoTTs could be facilitated by comparing transcriptomics to proteomics data, and additional experiments need to be performed to elucidate post-transcriptional regulation-related phenotypes, but the differential expression of specific TAT/TAC biased proteins finally allows to propose a model for the pleiotropic phenotype caused by Q34 deficiency in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, the presence or absence of a modification could also affect aminoacylation of the tRNA. Both TAT and TAC codons are decoded by the same and only one tRNA, tRNA<sup>TYR</sup><sub>GUA</sub>. In this case, a defect in aminoacylation of this tRNA would impact the decoding of both codons. Our results do not support such an aminoacylation problem, because the efficiency of decoding decreases for one codon (TAC) and not for the other (TAT) in <italic>Δtgt</italic>, and the difference is clearer in TOB. These results are also consistent with rescue of TOB-sensitive phenotype by tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> but not tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> overexpression in <italic>Δtgt</italic>.</p>
<p>This study, and others mentioned in the introduction, indicate that stress regulated tRNA modifications can facilitate homeostasis by reprogramming the translation of stress response genes. The diversity of tRNA modifications, their specific effects on various proteins and stress responses thus them a promising field of study.</p>

<caption><title>Impact of tRNA overexpression on fitness during growth in sub-MIC TOB.</title>
<p>A. Absence of <italic>tgt</italic> does not visibly affect endogenous tRNA-GUN levels. qRTPCR. A: relative tRNA abundance in <italic>Δtgt</italic> compared to WT strain in the absence of treatment (NT) and in the presence of sub-MIC tobramycin (TOB). <bold>B.</bold> In vitro competition experiments between <italic>V. cholerae</italic> WT and <italic>Δtgt</italic> strains, carrying a plasmid overexpressing the indicated tRNA; in the absence (NT) or presence of sub-MIC tobramycin (50% of the MIC, TOB 0.6 μg/ml). NT: no antibiotic treatment. The Y-axis represents log10 of competitive index calculated as described in the methods. A competitive index of 1 indicates equal growth of both strains. The X-axis indicates which tRNA is overexpressed, from the high copy pTOPO plasmid. The anticodon sequence is indicated (e.g. tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>AUA decodes the TAT codon). The following tRNAs-GUN are the canonical tRNAs which are present in the genome, and modified by Tgt: TyrGUA, HisGUG, AsnGUU, AspGUC. The following tRNAs-AUN are synthetic tRNAs which are not present in the genome: TyrAUA, HisAUG, AsnAUU, AspAUC. tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>GAA is used as non Tgt-modified control. p0 is the empty plasmid. C. Codon specific translation efficiency in WT and <italic>Δtgt</italic> using 6xcodon stretches inserted in GFP. Left: Y axis represents the relative fluorescence of the indicated gfp variant in WT and <italic>Δtgt</italic> strains carrying indicated tRNA overexpression plasmid normalized to fluorescence with empty plasmid (no tRNA overexpression). Right: ratio of <italic>Δtgt</italic> over WT. Y axis represents the relative fluorescence of a given GFP in <italic>Δtgt</italic> over the same construct in WT. Each specified codon is repeated 6x within the coding sequence of the GFP (e.g. TACTACTACTACTACTAC). P0: both WT <italic>Δtgt</italic> carry empty plasmid. ptRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>GUA: overexpressing tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> with GUA anticodon. ptRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>AUA: overexpressing tRNA-Tyr with AUA anticodon. For multiple comparisons, we used one-way ANOVA on GraphPad Prism. **** means p&lt;0.0001, ** means p&lt;0.01, * means p&lt;0.05. Number of replicates for each experiment: 3&lt;n&lt;8. In A, only significant differences are indicated. ns means non-significant.</p></caption>

The other graphs show mean fluorescence of gfp reporters where the tyrosine codon at position 66 was replaces with indicated non-cognate or near-cognate codons. Fluorescence was measured on overnight cultures grown either in MH medium without treatment (NT: non-treated), or with sub-MIC TOB (0.2 µg/ml). In black: fluorescence in the WT strain. Red: fluorescence in the <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain. Number of biological replicates: between 3 and 8. For comparisons between 2 groups (WT vs <italic>Δtgt)</italic>, first an F-test was performed in order to determine whether variances are equal or different between comparisons. For comparisons with equal variance, Student’s t-test was used. For comparisons with significantly different variances, we used Welch’s t-test.

<p>This study investigates the role of queuosine (Q) tRNA modification in aminoglycoside tolerance in Vibrio cholerae and presents <bold>convincing</bold> evidence to conclude that Q is essential for the efficient translation of TAT codons, although this depends on the context. The absence of Q reduces aminoglycoside tolerance potentially by reprogramming the translation of an oxidative stress response gene, rxsA. Overall, the findings point to an <bold>important</bold> mechanism whereby changes in Q modification levels control the decoding of mRNAs enriched in TAT codons under antibiotic stress.</p>

<p>Fruchard et al. investigate the role of the queuosine (Q) modification of the tRNA (Q-tRNA) in the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae. First, the authors state that the absence of Q-modified tRNAs (tgt mutant) increases the translation of TAT codons and proteins with a high TAT codon bias. Second, the absence of Q increases rsxA translation, because rsxA gene has a high TAT codon bias. Third, increased RsxA in the absence of Q inhibits SoxR response, reducing resistance towards the antibiotic tobramycin (TOB). Authors also predict in silico which genes harbor a higher TAT bias and found that among them are some involved in DNA repair, experimentally observing that a tgt mutant is more resistant to UV than the wt strain. It is worth noting that authors employ a wide variety of techniques, both experimental and bioinformatics.</p>
<p>The authors have satisfactorily responded to most of the comments that needed clarification. Particularly interesting was the addition of the new results section &quot;Q modification impacts decoding fidelity in V. cholerae&quot;, after the suggestion to explore the role of Q in prevention of stop codon readthrough. Although it is not a major problem, since the article is very complete and interesting, the interpretation of the results of RiboSeq data carried out in this work remains controversial. This technique, at least when it has been used in eukaryotes to investigate whether there is a bias in the translation of certain codons affected by Q (Tuorto et al., EMBO J. 2018; doi: 10.15252/embj.201899777), has been interpreted as meaning that ribosomes spend less time in the optimal codons and therefore there is an increase in occupancy at codons where translation slows down. On the other hand, it has been observed that &quot;in ribosome profiling experiments conducted without cycloheximide pretreatment, there is a clear inverse relationship between tRNA abundance and ribosome occupancy, showing that ribosomes spend less time at optimal codons and specifically this has been observed in experiments in which a translation inhibitor such as cycloheximide is not used (see review: Hanson G &amp; Coller J. Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. doi: 10.1038/nrm.2017.91, and experiments in yeast: Hussmann JA et al. PLoS Genet. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005732). On the other hand, we believe that the comparison between RiboSeq and proteomic data would be interesting to check whether this interpretation of the RiboSeq data is correct. It should not be a problem that the proteomics data could be incomplete, it would just be a more limited study. If the correct interpretation of the RiboSeq results is as proposed by the authors, a correlation should be observed between the abundance of TAT-enriched RNA fragments and the most abundant proteins. Therefore, it would be interesting to perform this comparison and see if significant results are obtained that help to understand the correct interpretation of the RiboSeq experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript the authors begin with the interesting phenotype of sub inhibitory concentrations of the aminoglycoside tobramycin proving toxic to a knockout of the tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) of the important human pathogen, Vibrio cholerae. Tgt is important for incorporating queuosine (Q) in place of guanosine at the wobble position of GUN codons. The authors go on to define a mechanism of action where environmental stressors control expression of tgt to control translational decoding of particularly tyrosine codons, skewing the balance from TAC towards TAT decoding in the absence of the enzyme. The authors use advanced proteomics and ribosome profiling to reveal that the loss of tgt results in increased translation of proteins like RsxA and a cohort of DNA repair factors, whose genes harbor an excess of TAT codons in many cases. These findings are bolstered by a series of molecular reporters, mass spectrometry, and tRNA overexpression strains to provide support for a model where Tgt serves as a molecular pivot point to reprogram translational output in response to stress. The manuscript therefore improves our understanding of the phenotype of focus and will prove useful for the field in our understanding of Modification Tunable Transcripts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript has many strengths. The authors use a variety of strains, assays, and advanced techniques to discover a mechanism of action for Tgt in mediating tolerance to sub inhibitory concentrations of tobramycin. They observe a clear phenotype for a tRNA modification in facilitating reprogramming of the translational response, and the manuscript certainly has value in defining how microbes tolerate antibiotics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions of the manuscript are mostly very well-supported by the data, but a few experimental directions remain inconclusive. The finding linking Tgt and UV damage susceptibility is one example where the phenotype is striking, but the mechanism remains somewhat unclear. Future work in this direction will likely be required to fully understand how Tgt influences the repair of DNA after UV.</p>

<p>The experiments are well-designed and conducted and the conclusions, for the most part, are well supported by the data. However, a few clarifications will significantly strengthen the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major:</p>
<p>Figure S4 A-D. These growth curves are important data and should be presented in the main figures. Moreover, given that it is not possible to make a rsxA mutant, I wonder if it would be possible to connect rsx and tgt using the following experiment: expression of tgt results in resistance to TOB (in B), while expression of only rsx lower resistance to TOB (in D). Then simultaneous overexpression of both tgt/rsx in the WT strain should have either no effect on TOB resistance or increased resistance, relative to the WT. Perhaps the authors have done this, and if so, the data should be included as it will significantly strengthen their model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, we have tried to overexpress both tgt and rsxA simultaneously. However, this appears to be toxic as cells form small colonies and cannot grow well in liquid. We think that the presence of 2 plasmids and corresponding selection antibiotics amplify the toxicity of overexpressing <italic>rsxA</italic>, and even <italic>tgt</italic>. In fact, it can be seen that <italic>tgt</italic> overexpression in WT is already slightly deleterious, in the absence of tobramycin (figure 1B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure S4 - Is there a rationale for why it is possible to make rsx mutants in E. coli, but not in V. cholerae? For example, does E. coli have a second gene/protein that is redundant in function to rsxA, while V. cholerae does not? I think your data hint at this, since in the right panel growth data, your double mutant does not fully rescue back to rsx single mutant levels, suggesting another factor in tgt mutant also acts to lower resistance to TOB. If so, perhaps a line or two in text will be helpful for readers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This point raised by the referee is an interesting one that we have also asked ourselves at multiple occasions. In fact, the Rsx operon is linked with oxidative stress and respiration. Vibrio cholerae and E. coli show differences on genes involved in these pathways. V. cholerae lacks the cyo/nuo respiratory complex genes, and does not encode a Suf operon. Moreover, deletion of the anaerobic respiration Frd pathway leads to strong decrease of V. cholerae growth even in aerobic conditions. (10.1128/spectrum.01730-23). We have previously also generally seen differences between the 2 species in response to stress (10.1128/AAC.01549-10) and the way they deal with ROS (10.1371/journal.pgen.1003421). Therefore, we think that the fact that rsx is essential in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and not <italic>E. coli</italic> could either be due to the presence of an additional redundant pathway in <italic>E. coli</italic> as suggested by the referee, or to more general differences in respiration and treatment of ROS. We thank the referee for highlighting this and we have now included a comment about this in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- For growth curves in Figure 2 and relative comparisons like in Figure 5D and Figure S4 (and others in the paper), statistics and error bars, along with replicate information should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We had mentioned this in the methods section, we have now added the specific information also on figure legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Figure 6A - Is the transcript fold change in linear or log? If linear, then tgt expression should not be classified as being upregulated in TOB. It is barely up by ~2-fold with TOB- 0.6....which is a mild phenotype, at best.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think that 2-fold change of tgt expression can be sufficient to lead to changes in tRNA modification levels. We agree that this is a mild induction, we have thus changed “increase” to “mildly increase” in the results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Line 779- 780: &quot;This indicates that sub-MIC TOB possibly induces tgt expression through the stringent response activation.&quot; To me, the data presented in this figure, do not support this statement. The experiment is indirect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree, we rephrased: “Tobramycin may induces <italic>tgt</italic> expression through stringent response activation or through an independent pathway. “</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Figure 3B and D. - These samples only have tobramycin, correct? The legend says both carbenicillin and tobramycin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The legend is correct, samples also have carbenicillin because we are testing here the growth with 2 synonymous beta-lactamase genes in presence of beta-lactams.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Figure 5. The color schemes in bars do not match up with the color scheme in cartoons below panels B and C. That makes it confusing to read. Please fix.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Fruchard et al. investigate the role of the queuosine (Q) modification of the tRNA (Q-tRNA) in the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae. First, the authors state that the absence of Q-modified tRNAs (tgt mutant) increases the translation of TAT codons and proteins with a high TAT codon bias. Second, the absence of Q increases rsxA translation, because rsxA gene has a high TAT codon bias. Third, increased RsxA in the absence of Q inhibits SoxR response, reducing resistance towards the antibiotic tobramycin (TOB). Authors also predict in silico which genes harbor a higher TAT bias and found that among them are some involved in DNA repair, experimentally observing that a tgt mutant is more resistant to UV than the wt strain. It is worth noting that authors employ a wide variety of techniques, both experimental and bioinformatic. However, some aspects of the work need to be clarified or reevaluated.</p>
<p>(1) The statement that the absence of Q increases the translation of TAT codons and proteins encoded by TAT-enriched genes presents the following problems that should be addressed:</p>
<p>(1.1) The increase in TAT codon translation in the absence of Q is not supported by proteomics, since there was no detected statistical difference for TAT codon usage in proteins differentially expressed. Furthermore, there are some problems regarding the statistics of proteomics. Some proteins shown in Table S1 have adjusted p-values higher than their pvalues, which makes no sense. Maybe there is a mistake in the adjusted p-value calculation.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s thorough examination of our findings. In our study, we employed an adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure to control the false discovery rate in our list of selected proteins, as explained in the Data Analysis part of the Proteomics MS and analysis part of our material and methods. The classical BH procedure (10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02031.x) calculates the 𝑚×𝑝(𝑗) adjusted p-value for the i-th ranked p-value as min<inline-formula id="sa4equ1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-96317-sa4-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> where 𝑝(𝑗) is the j-th ranked pvalue and 𝑚 is the number of tests (e.g. number of proteins) (see 10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00170 for details). Since m/j &gt; 1 and 𝑝(𝑗) &gt; 𝑝(𝑖) for 𝑗≥𝑚, it follows that <inline-formula id="sa4equ2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-96317-sa4-equ2.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> for 𝑗≥<italic>i</italic>, resulting in adjusted p-values being higher or equal than the original p-values. Therefore, contrary to the reviewer's comment, it is a mathematical property that the adjusted p-value is greater than the original p-value when using the classical Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.</p>
<p>However, we want to underline that we used an « adaptive » BH procedure, which calculates the adjusted p-value for the i-th ranked p-value as min <inline-formula id="sa4equ3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-96317-sa4-equ3.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, where 𝜋0 is an estimate of the proportion of true null hypotheses (see 10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00170 for details). Indeed, the classical BH procedure makes the assumption that 𝜋0 = 1, which is a strong assumption in MS-based proteomics context.  Consequently, the mathematical property that the adjusted p-value is greater than the original p-value does not always hold true in our approach (that depends also on the 𝜋0 parameter).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, it is not common to assume that proteins that are quantitatively present in one condition and absent in another are differentially abundant proteins. Proteomics data software typically addresses this issue and applies some corrections. It would be advisable to review that.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. Indeed, some software impute a random small value to replace missing values and then produces statistics based on this imputed data (10.1038/nmeth.3901). However, the validity and relevance of generating statistics in the absence of actual data is questionable.</p>
<p>There are no universally accepted guidelines for handling this situation, and we believe it is more logical to set these values aside as potential interesting proteins. It is well-established that intensity values are often missing due to the detection limits of the spectrometer, suggesting that the missing values observed in several replicates of a condition are actually due to low values (see 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp362 and 10.1093/bioinformatics/bts193 for instance). It is thus logical to consider the associated proteins as potentially differentially abundant when comparing their complete absence in all replicates of one condition to their presence in several replicates of another condition.</p>

<p>(1.2) Problems with the interpretation of Ribo-seq data (Figure 4D). On the one hand, the Ribo-seq data should be corrected (normalized) with the RNA-seq data in each of the conditions to obtain ribosome profiling data, since some genes could have more transcription in some of the conditions studied. In other articles in which this technique is used (such as in Tuorto et al., EMBO J. 2018; doi: 10.15252/embj.201899777), it is interpreted that those positions in which the ribosome moves most slowly and therefore less efficiently translated), are the most abundant. Assuming this interpretation, according to the hypothesis proposed in this work, the fragments enriched in TAT codons should have been less abundant in the absence of Q-tRNA (tgt mutant) in the Rib-seq experiment. However, what is observed is that TAT-enriched fragments are more abundant in the tgt mutant, and yet the Ribo-seq results are interpreted as RNA-seq, stating that this is because the genes corresponding to those sequences have greater expression in the absence of Q.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended by the reviewer, we normalized the RiboSeq data with the RNAseq data to account for potential RNA variations. The updated Figure 4 demonstrates that this normalization does not alter our findings, confirming that variations at the RNAseq level do not contradict changes at the translational level.</p>
<p>The reviewer's observation that pauses at TAT codons would lead to ribosome accumulation and subsequent categorization as &quot;up&quot; genes is accurate. We must emphasize, however, that this category of “up genes” is probably quite diverse. The effect of ribosome stalling at TAT codons on total mRNA ribosome occupancy is likely highly variable, depending on the location of the TAT codon(s) within the CDS and the gene's expression level. We therefore think that genes in the &quot;Up&quot; category mainly correspond to genes that are more translated because the impact of pausing at TAT codons is probably not strong enough. Note that unlike what is usually done in bacterial riboseq experiments, we did not use any antibiotics to artificially freeze the ribosomes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>On the other hand, it would be interesting to calculate the mean of the protein levels encoded by the transcripts with high and low ribosome profiling data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While this is a common request, we believe that comparing RiboSeq and proteomics data is not particularly informative. RiboSeq data directly measures translation, while proteomics provides information about protein abundance at steady state, reflecting the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. Furthermore, the number of proteins detectable by mass spectrometry is significantly smaller than the number of genes quantified by RiboSeq. Given these factors, there is often a low correlation between translation and protein abundance, making a direct comparison less relevant</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.3) This statement is contrary to most previously reported studies on this topic in eukaryotes and bacteria, in which ribosome profiling experiments, among others, indicate that translation of TAT codons is slower (or unaffected) than translation of the TAC codons, and the same phenomenon is observed for the rest of the NAC/T codons. This is completely opposed to the results showed in Figure 4. However, the results of these studies are either not mentioned or not discussed in this work. Some examples of articles that should be discussed in this work:</p>
<p>- &quot;Queuosine-modified tRNAs confer nutritional control of protein translation&quot; (Tuorto et al., 2018; 10.15252/embj.201899777)</p>
<p>- &quot;Preferential import of queuosine-modified tRNAs into Trypanosoma brucei mitochondrion is critical for organellar protein synthesis&quot; (Kulkarni et al., 2021; doi:10.1093/nar/gkab567.</p>
<p>- &quot;Queuosine-tRNA promotes sex-dependent learning and memory formation by maintaining codonbiased translation elongation speed&quot; (Cirzi et al., 2023; 10.15252/embj.2022112507)</p>
<p>- &quot;Glycosylated queuosines in tRNAs optimize translational rate and post-embryonic growth&quot; (Zhao et al., 2023; 10.1016/j.cell.2023.10.026)</p>
<p>- &quot;tRNA queuosine modification is involved in biofilm formation and virulence in bacteria&quot; (Diaz-Rullo and Gonzalez-Pastor, 2023; doi: 10.1093/nar/gkad667). In this work, the authors indicate that QtRNA increases NAT codon translation in most bacterial species. Could the regulation of TAT codonenriched proteins by Q-tRNAs in V. cholerae an exception? In addition, authors use a bioinformatic method to identify genes enriched in NAT codons similar to the one used in this work, and to find in which biological process are involved the genes whose expression is affected by Q-tRNAs (as discussed for the phenotype of UV resistance). It will be worth discussing all of this.</p>

<p>Thank you for detailed suggestions, we agree that this discussion was missing and this comment gives us a chance to address that in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>About the references above suggested by the referee, 4 of these papers were not mentioned in our manuscript, these were published while our manuscript was previously in review and we realize we have not cited them in the latest version of our manuscript. We thank the referee for highlighting this. We have now included a discussion about this.</p>
<p>We included the following in the discussion:</p>
<p>“However, the opposite codon preference was shown in E. coli {Diaz-Rullo, 2023 #1888}. In eukaryotes also, several recent studies indicate slower translation of U-ending codons in the absence of Q34 {Cirzi, 2023 #1887;Kulkarni, 2021 #1886;Tuorto, 2018 #1268}. It’s important to note here, that in V. cholerae ∆tgt, increased decoding of U-ending codons is observed only with tyrosine, and not with the other three NAC/U codons (Histidine, Aspartate, Asparagine). This is interesting because it suggests that what we observe with tyrosine may not adhere to a general rule about the decoding efficiency of U- or C-ending codons, but instead seems to be specific to Tyr tRNAs, at least in the context of V. cholerae. Exceptions may also exist in other organisms. For example, in human cells, queuosine increases efficiency of decoding for U- ending codons and slows decoding of C- ending codons except for AAC {Zhao, 2023 #1889}. In this case, the exception is for tRNA Asparagine. Moreover, in mammalian cells {Tuorto, 2018 #1268}, ribosome pausing at U-ending codons is strongly seen for Asp, His and Asn, but less with Tyr. In Trypanosoma {Kulkarni, 2021 #1886}, reporters with a combination of the 4 NAC/NAU codons for Asp, Asn, Tyr, His have been tested, showing slow translation at U- ending version of the reporter in the absence of Q, but the effect on individual codons (e.g. Tyr only) is not tested. In mice {Cirzi, 2023 #1887}, ribosome slowdown is seen for the Asn, Asp, His U-ending codons but not for the Tyr U-ending codon. In summary, Q generally increases efficiency of U- ending codons in multiple organisms, but there appears to be additional unknown parameters which affect tyrosine UAU decoding, at least in V. cholerae. Additional factors such as mRNA secondary structures or mistranslation may also contribute to the better translation of UAU versions of tested genes. Mistranslation could be an important factor. If codon decoding fidelity impacts decoding speed, then mistranslation could also contribute to decoding efficiency of Tyr UAU/UAC codons and proteome composition.”</p>

<p>(1.4) It is proposed that the stress produced by the TOB antibiotic causes greater translation of genes enriched in TAT codons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Actually, it’s the opposite because in presence of TOB, in the wt, tgt would be induced leading to more Q on tRNA-Tyr and less translation of TAT.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>On the one hand, it is shown that the GFP-TAT version (gene enriched in TAT codons) and the RsxATAT-GFP protein (native gene naturally enriched in TAT) are expressed more, compared to their versions enriched in TAC in a tgt mutant than in a wt, in the presence of TBO (Fig. 5C).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 5C shows relative fluorescence, ie changes of fluorescence in delta-tgt compared to WT. So it’s not necessarily more expressed but “more increased”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, in the absence of TOB, and in a wt context, although the two versions of GFP have a similar expression level (Fig. 3SD), the same does not occur with RsxA, whose RsxA-TAT form (the native one) is expressed significantly more than the RsxA-TAC version (Fig. 3SA). How can it be explained that in a wt context, in which there are also tRNA Q-modification, a gene naturally enriched in TAT is translated better than the same gene enriched in TAC?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the referee for this question based on careful assessment of our data. We agree, there appears to be significantly more RsxA-TAT in WT than RsxA-TAC. This could be due to other effects such as secondary structure formation on mRNA when the wt RsxA is recoded with TAC codons. This does not hinder the conclusion that the translation of the TAT version is increased in delta-tgt compared to WT.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be expected that in the presence of Q-tRNAs the two versions would be translated equally (as happens with GFP) or even the TAT version would be less translated. On the other hand, in the presence of TOB the fluorescence of WT GFP(TAT) is higher than the fluorescence of WT GFP(TAC) (Figure S3E) (mean fluorescence data for RsxA-GFP version in the presence of TOB is not shown). These results may indicate that the apparent better translation of TAT versions could be due to indirect effects rather from TAT codon translation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is now mentioned in the manuscript</p>
<p>“We cannot exclude, however, that additional factors such as mRNA secondary structures also contributes to the better translation of UAU versions of tested genes. “</p>

<p>(2) Another problem is related to the already known role of Q in prevention of stop codon readthrough, which is not discuss at all in the work. In the absence of Q, stop codon readthrough is increased. In addition, it is known that aminoglycosides (such as tobramycin) also increase stop codon readthrough (&quot;Stop codon context influences genome-wide stimulation of termination codon readthrough by aminoglycosides&quot;; Wanger and Green, 2023; 10.7554/eLife.52611). Absence of Q and presence of aminoglycosides can be synergic, producing devastating increases in stop codon readthrough and a large alteration of global gene expression. All of these needs to be discussed in the work. Moreover, it is known that stop codon readthrough can alter gene expression and mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of stop codon readthrough. Thus, this process could also affect to the expression of recoded GFP and RsxA versions.</p>

<p>“Q modification impacts decoding fidelity in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>.</p>
<p>To test whether a defect in Q34 modification influences the fidelity of translation in the presence and absence of tobramycin, previously developed reporter tools were used (Fabret &amp; Namy, 2021), to measure stop codons readthrough in V. cholerae ∆tgt and wild-type strains. The system consists of vectors containing readthrough promoting signals inserted between the lacZ and luc sequences, encoding β-galactosidase and luciferase, respectively. Luciferase activity reflects the readthrough efficiency, while β-galactosidase activity serves as an internal control of expression level, integrating a number of possible sources of variability (plasmid copy number, transcriptional activity, mRNA stability, and translation rate).  We found increased readthrough at stop codons UAA and to a lesser extent at UAG for ∆tgt, and this increase was amplified for UAG in presence of tobramycin (Fig. S2, stop readthrough). In the case of UAA, tobramycin appears to decrease readthrough, this may be artefactual, due to the toxic effect of tobramycin on ∆tgt.</p>
<p>Mistranslation at specific codons can also impact protein synthesis. To further investigate mistranslation levels by tRNATyr in WT and ∆tgt, we designed a set of gfp mutants where the codon for the catalytic tyrosine required for fluorescence (TAT at position 66) was substituted by nearcognate codons (Fig. S2). Results suggest that in this sequence context, particularly in the presence of tobramycin, non-modified tRNATyr mistakenly decodes Asp GAC, His CAC and also Ser UCC, Ala GCU, Gly GGU, Leu CUU and Val GUC codons, suggesting that Q34 increases the fidelity of tRNATyr.</p>
<p>In parallel, we replaced Tyr103 of the β-lactamase described above, with Asp codons GAT or GAC. The expression of the resulting mutant β-lactamase is expected to yield a carbenicillin sensitive phenotype. In this system, increased tyrosine misincorporation (more mistakes) by tRNATyr at the mutated Asp codon, will lead to increased synthesis of active β-lactamase, which can be evaluated by carbenicillin tolerance tests. As such, amino-acid misincorporation leads here to phenotypic (transient) tolerance, while genetic reversion mutations result in resistance (growth on carbenicillin). The rationale is summarized in Fig. 3C. When the Tyr103 codon was replaced with either Asp codons, we observe increased β-lactamase tolerance (Fig. 3D, left), suggesting increased misincorporation of tyrosine by tRNATyr at Asp codons in the absence of Q, again suggesting that Q34 prevents misdecoding of Asp codons by tRNATyr.</p>
<p>In order to test any effect on an additional tRNA modified by Tgt, namely tRNAAsp, we mutated the Asp129 (GAT) codon of the β-lactamase. When Asp129 was mutated to Tyr TAT (Fig. 3D, right), we observe reduced tolerance in ∆tgt, but not when it was mutated to Tyr TAC, suggesting less misincorporation of aspartate by tRNAAsp at the Tyr UAU codon in the absence of Q. In summary, absence of Q34 increases misdecoding by tRNATyr at Asp codons, but decreases misdecoding by tRNAAsp at Tyr UAU.</p>
<p>This supports the fact that tRNA Q34 modification is involved in translation fidelity during antibiotic stress, and that the effects can be different on different tRNAs, e.g. tRNATyr and tRNAAsp tested here.”</p>
<p>Added figures: Figure S2, Figure 3CD</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The statement about that the TOB resistance depends on RsxA translation, which is related to the presence of Q, also presents some problems:</p>
<p>(3.1) It is observed that the absence of tgt produces a growth defect in V. cholerae when exposed to TOB (Figure 1A), and it is stated that this is mediated by an increase in the translation of RsxA, because its gene is TAT enriched. However, in Figure S4F, it is shown that the same phenotype is observed in E. coli, but its rsxA gene is not enriched in TAT codons. Therefore, the growth defect observed in the tgt mutant in the presence of TOB may not be due to the increase in the translation of TAT codons of the rsxA gene in the absence of Q. This phenotype is very interesting, but it may be related to another molecular process regulated by Q. Maybe the role of Q in preventing stop codon readthrough is important in this process, reducing cellular stress in the presence of TOB and growing better.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>FigS4F (now figure 5D) shows that rsxA can be toxic during growth in presence of tobramycin, but it does not show that rsxA translation is increased in E. coli in delta-tgt. However, we agree with the referee that there are probably additional processes regulated by Q which are also involved in the response to TOB stress. We already had mentioned this briefly in the discussion (“Note that, our results do not exclude the involvement of additional Q-regulated MoTTs in the response to sub-MIC TOB, since Q modification leads to reprogramming of the whole proteome. “), we further discussed it as follows:</p>
<p>“As a consequence, transcripts with tyrosine codon usage bias are differentially translated. One such transcript codes for RsxA, an anti-SoxR factor. SoxR controls a regulon involved in oxidative stress response and sub-MIC aminoglycosides trigger oxidative stress in V. cholerae{Baharoglu, 2013 #720}, pointing to an involvement of oxidative stress response in the response to sub-MIC tobramycin stress.</p>
<p>A link between Q34 and oxidative stress has also been previously found in eukaryotic organisms {Nagaraja, 2021 #1466}. Note that our results do not exclude the involvement of additional Qregulated translation of other transcripts in the response to tobramycin. Q34 modification leads to reprogramming of the whole proteome, not only for other transcripts with codon usage bias, but also through an impact on the levels of stop codon readthrough and mistranslation at specific codons, as supported by our data.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3.2) All experiments related to the effect of Q on the translation of TAT codons have been performed with the tgt mutant strain. Considering that the authors have a pSEVA-tgt plasmid to overexpress this gene, they would have to show whether tgt overexpression in a wt strain produces a decrease in the translation of proteins encoded by TAT-enriched genes such as RsxA. This experiment would allow them to conclude that Q reduces RsxA levels, increasing resistance to TOB.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this would be interesting to test, however, as it can be seen in figure 1B, delta-tgt pSEVAtgt (complemented strain) grows better than WT pSEVA-tgt (tgt overexpression). In fact, overexpression of tgt negatively impacts cell growth and yield smaller colonies, especially when cells carry a second plasmid (e.g with gfp constructs). We have also seen this with other RNA modification gene overexpressions in the lab (unpublished). We believe that the expression of tgt is tuned and since overexpression affects fitness, it is generally difficult to conduct experiments with overexpression plasmid for RNA modifications.  Nevertheless, we have done the experiment (with slow growing bacteria) and when we normalize expression of gfp in the presence of tgt overexpressing plasmid to the condition with no plasmid, we see little (1.5 fold) or no effect of tgt overexpression on fluorescence (see graph below). This is probably due to a toxic effect of ooverexpression and we do not believe these results are biologically relevant.</p>

<p>(3.3) On the other hand, Fig. 1B shows that when the wt and tgt strains compete, both overexpressing tgt, the tgt mutant strain grows better in the presence of TOB. This result is not very well understood, since according to the hypothesis proposed, the absence of modification by Q of the tRNA would increase the translation of genes enriched in TAT, therefore, a strain with a higher proportion of Q-modified tRNAs as in the case of the wt strain overexpressing tgt would express the rsxA gene less than the tgt strain overexpressing tgt and would therefore grow better in the presence of TOB. For all these reasons, it would be necessary to evaluate the effect of tgt overexpression on the translation of RsxA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>See our answer above about negative effect of <italic>tgt</italic> overexpression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3.4) According to Figure 1I, the overexpression of tRNA-Tyr(GUA) caused a better growth of tgt mutant in comparison to WT. If the growth defect observed in tgt mutant in the presence of TOB is due to a better translation of the TAT codons of rsxA gene, the overexpression of tRNA-Tyr(GUA) in the tgt mutant should have resulted in even better RsxA translation a worse growth, but not the opposite result.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree, we think that rsxA is not the only factor responsible for growth defect of tgt in presence of TOB (as now further discussed in the discussion). Overexpression of tRNAtyr possibly changes the equilibrium between the decoding of TAC vs TAT and may restore translation of TAC enriched genes. As also suggested by rev3, we have measured decoding reporters for TAT/TAC while overexpressing tTNA-tyr. This is now added to the results in fig S2C and the following:</p>
<p>“We also tested decoding reporters for TAT/TAC in WT and ∆tgt overexpressing tRNATyr in trans (Fig. S1C). The presence of the plasmid (empty p0) amplified differences between the two strains with decreased decoding of TAC (and increased TAT, as expected) in ∆tgt compared to WT. Overexpression of tRNATyrGUA did not significantly impact decoding of TAT and increased decoding of TAC, as expected. Since overexpression of tRNATyrGUA rescues ∆tgt in tobramycin (Fig. 1I) and facilitates TAC decoding, this suggests that issues with TAC codon decoding contribute to the fitness defect observed in ∆tgt upon growth with tobramycin. Overexpression of tRNATyrAUA increased decoding of TAT in WT but did not change it in ∆tgt where it is already high. Unexpectedly, overexpression of tRNATyrAUA also increased decoding of TAC in WT. Thus, overexpression of tRNATyrAUA possibly changes the equilibrium between the decoding of TAC vs TAT and may restore translation of TAC enriched transcripts.”</p>

<p>(4) It cannot be stated that DNA repair is more efficient in the tgt mutant of V. cholerae, as indicated in the text of the article and in Fig 7. The authors only observe that the tgt mutant is more resistant to UV radiation and it is suggested that the reason may be TAT bias of DNA repair genes. To validate the hypothesis that UV resistance is increased because DNA repair genes are TAT biased, it would be necessary to check if DNA repair is affected by Q. UV not only produces DNA damage, but also oxidative stress. Therefore, maybe this phenotype is due to the increase in proteins related to oxidative stress controlled by RsxA, such as the superoxide dismutase encoded by sodA. It is also stated that these repair genes were found up for the tgt mutant in the Ribo-seq data, with unchanged transcription levels. Again, it is necessary to clarify this interpretation of the Ribo-seq data, since the fact that they are more represented in a tgt mutant perhaps means that translation is slower in those transcripts. Has it been observed in proteomics (wt vs tgt in the absence of TOB) whether these proteins involved in repair are more expressed in a tgt mutant?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that our results do not directly show that DNA repair is more efficient, but that delta-tgt responds better to UV. This has been modified in the manuscript. About oxidative stress, we did not see a better or worse response to H202 of delta-tgt. Moreover, since we see better response of deltatgt  to UV only in V. cholerae and not in E. coli, we did not favor the hypothesesi of response to stressox. In proteomics, we do not detect changes for DNA repair genes except for RuvA which is more abundant in delta-tgt. We have toned down the statement about DNA repair in the paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors demonstrate that in E. coli the tgt mutant does not show greater resistance to UV radiation (Fig. 7D), unlike what happens in V. cholerae. It should be discussed that in previous works it has been observed that overexpression in E. coli of the tgt gene or the queF gene (Q biosynthesis) is involved in greater resistance to UV radiation (Morgante et al., Environ Microbiol, 2015 doi: 10.1111/1462-2920.12505; and Díaz-Rullo et al., Front Microbiol. 2021 doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2021.723874). As an explanation, it was proposed (Diaz-Rullo and Gonzalez-Pastor, NAR 2023 doi: 10.1093/nar/gkad667) that the observed increase in the capacity to form biofilms in strains that overexpress genes related to Q modification of tRNA would be related to this greater resistance to UV radiation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now mention the previous observations suggesting a link between tgt and UV. We thank the referee for the reference which we had overlooked. Note that in the case of our experiments, all cultures are in planktonic form and are not allowed to form biofilms. We thus prefer not to biofilmlinked processes in this study.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript the authors begin with the interesting phenotype of sub-inhibitory concentrations of the aminoglycoside tobramycin proving toxic to a knockout of the tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) of the important human pathogen, Vibrio cholerae. Tgt is important for incorporating queuosine (Q) in place of guanosine at the wobble position of GUN codons. The authors go on to define a mechanism of action where environmental stressors control expression of tgt to control translational decoding of particularly tyrosine codons, skewing the balance from TAC towards TAT decoding in the absence of the enzyme. The authors use advanced proteomics and ribosome profiling to reveal that the loss of tgt results in increased translation of proteins like RsxA and a cohort of DNA repair factors, whose genes harbor an excess of TAT codons in many cases. These findings are bolstered by a series of molecular reporters, mass spectrometry, and tRNA overexpression strains to provide support for a model where Tgt serves as a molecular pivot point to reprogram translational output in response to stress.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript has many strengths. The authors use a variety of strains, assays, and advanced techniques to discover a mechanism of action for Tgt in mediating tolerance to sub-inhibitory concentrations of tobramycin. They observe a clear phenotype for a tRNA modification in facilitating reprogramming of the translational response, and the manuscript certainly has value in defining how microbes tolerate antibiotics.</p>

<p>(1) The authors have created and used a variety of relevant molecular tools. In some cases, using these tools in additional assays as controls would be helpful. For example, testing for compensation of the observed phenotypes by overexpression of the Tyrosine tRNA(GUA) in Figure 2A with the 6xTAT strain, Figure 5C with the rxsA-GFP fusion, and/or Figure 7B with UV stress would provide additional information of the ability of tRNA overexpression to compensate for the defect in these situations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestions. Since overexpression of tRNA tyr is not expected to decrease decoding of TAT, we do not necessarily expect any effect for UV and rsxA expression. Overexpression of tRNA_GUA restores fitness of delta-tgt in TOB, but this is probably independent of RsxA. As ref2 also suggested above, we included in the discussion that the effect seen in delta-tgt with TOB is not only due to RsxA expression but also additional processes. However, these suggestions are interesting and we performed the following experiments in order to have an answer for these questions:</p>
<p>- “testing for compensation of the observed phenotypes by overexpression of the Tyrosine tRNA(GUA) in Figure 2A with the 6xTAT strain”:</p>
<p>This is now included in figure S2C and results as follows:</p>
<p>“We also tested decoding reporters for TAT/TAC in WT and ∆tgt overexpressing tRNA-Tyr in trans (Fig. S1C). The presence of the plasmid amplified differences between the two strains with decreased decoding of TAC (and increased TAT, as expected) in ∆tgt with empty plasmid compared to WT. Overexpression of tRNA_TyrGUA did not significantly impact decoding of TAT and increased decoding of TAC as expected. Since overexpression of tRNA_TyrGUA rescues ∆tgt in tobramycin (Fig. 1I) and facilitates TAC decoding, this suggests that issues with TAC codon decoding contribute to the fitness defect observed in ∆tgt upon growth with tobramycin. Overexpression of tRNA_TyrAUA increased decoding of TAT in WT but did not change it in ∆tgt where it is already high. Interestingly, overexpression of TyrAUA also increased decoding of TAC in WT. Thus, overexpression of tRNA_TyrAUA possibly changes the equilibrium between the decoding of TAC vs TAT and may restore translation of TAC enriched transcripts. “</p>
<p>-  Figure 5C with the rxsA-GFP fusion:</p>
<p>When we overexpress tRNA_GUA, rsxA fluorescence is 2-fold higher in delta-tgt compared to wt. However, the fluorescence is highly decreased compared to the condition with no tRNA overexpression. While we are not sure whether this apparent decrease is a technical issue or not (e.g. due to the presence of additional plasmid), we prefer not to further explore this in this manuscript. Note that we could not obtain delta-tgt strain carrying both plasmids expressing tRNA_GUA and rsxA, suggesting toxic overproduction of rsxA in this context.</p>

<p>(2) The authors present a clear story with a reprogramming towards TAT codons in the knockout strain, particularly regarding tobramycin treatment. The control experiments often hint at other codons also contributing to the observed phenotypes (e.g., His or Asp), yet these effects are mostly ignored in the discussion. It would be helpful to discuss these findings at a minimum in the discussion section, or possibly experimentally address the role of His or Asp by overexpression of these tRNAs together with Tyrosine tRNA(GUA) in an experiment like that of Figure 1I to see if a more &quot;wild type&quot; phenotype would present. In fact, the synergy of Tyr, His, and/or Asp codons likely helps to explain the effects observed with the DNA repair genes in later experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the referee for the suggestion. We agree that there could be synergies between these codons, and that’s probably why proteomics data does not clearly reflect tyrosine codons usage bias. This is now further discussed in the ideas and speculation section.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have added Figure S3G and the following result:</p>
<p>“Since not all TAT biased proteins are found to be enriched in ∆tgt proteomics data, the sequence context surrounding TAT codons could affect their decoding. To illustrate this, we inserted after the gfp start codon, various tyrosine containing sequences displayed by rsxA (Fig. S3G). The native tyrosines were all TAT codons, our synthetic constructs were either TAT or TAC, while keeping the remaining sequence unchanged.  We observe that the production of GFP carrying the TEYTATLLL sequence from RsxA is increased in Δtgt compared to WT, while it is unchanged with TEYTACLLL. However, production of the GFP with the sequences LYTATRLL/LYTACRLL and EYTATLR/ EYTACLR was not unaffected (or even decreased for the latter) by the absence of tgt. Overall, our results demonstrate that RsxA is upregulated in the ∆tgt strain at the translational level, and that proteins with a codon usage bias towards tyrosine TAT are prone to be more efficiently translated in the absence of Q modification, but this is also dependent on the sequence context. “</p>

<p>(3) Regarding Figure 6D, the APB northern blot feels like an afterthought. It was loaded with different amounts of RNA as input and some samples are repeated three times, but Δcrp only once. Collectively, it makes this experiment very difficult to assess.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A different amount of RNA was used only for ∆tgt in which we have only one band because of the absence of modification. For all the other conditions, the same amount of RNA was used (0.9 µg). Additional replicates of crp were in an additional gel but only a representative gel was shown in the manuscript. This is now specified in the legend.</p>
<p>We also attach below the picture of the gel with total RNA (syber Gold labelling of total RNA), where it can be seen that the lanes contain an equivalent quantity of RNA, except for ∆tgt.</p>

<p>Minor Points:</p>
<p>(3) Fig S2B, do the authors have a hypothesis why the Asp and Phe tRNAs lead to a growth decrease in the untreated samples? It appears like Phe(GAA) partially compensates for the defect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes we agree, at this stage we do not have any satisfactory answer for this unfortunately. This would be interesting to study further but this is beyond the scope of the present study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Lines 655 to 660 seem more appropriate as speculation in the discussion rather than as a conclusion in the results, where no direct experiments are performed. The authors might take advantage of the &quot;Ideas and Speculation&quot; section that eLife allows.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>As specified in the public review, more evidence would be necessary to affirm that tRNAs not modified by Q have a greater preference for translating TAT codons, since there are several previous studies in which it is shown that Q-tRNAs have a greater preference for NAT codons (including TAT). For example, it is suggested to explore what happens with other recoded genes (enriched in TAT or TAC) if there is a high level of Q-tRNAs (overexpression of tgt in a wt context). It is also necessary to clarify how to interpret the Ribo-seq results, which apparently is different from how they have been interpreted in other studies.</p>

<p>(1) Lines 48-50, and 110 to 112, the authors have a nice mechanism and story, yet the lines mentioned feel very qualified (e.g., &quot;possibly&quot;, &quot;plausibly&quot;) and lead to the abstract hiding the value and major conclusions of the study. The authors could consider to revise or even remove these lines to focus on the take-home message in the abstract and end of introduction/discussion.</p>

<p>(3) Figure S1, the line of experiments with rluF is interesting, but in the end the choice seems a little random. Have the authors assessed knockouts of other modifications on the ASL for effects? Since the modification is not well characterized in V. cholerae according to the authors, it might make sense to save this for a future paper.</p>

<p>(5) It is likely beyond the scope of the study, but it would strengthen the paper to repeat Figure 3 with His and/or Asp based on the findings of 2C and 4E to better understand the contribution of His and Asp to Q biology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We repeated figure 3 with Asp. Based on Fig 2C (less efficient decoding of GAC in deta-tgt in TOB) and 4E (positive GAT codon bias in proteins up in riboseq in delta-tgt TOB), we would expect that beta-lactamase with asp GAC would be less efficiently decoded than GAT in delta-tgt.</p>
<p>This was added to the manuscript</p>
<p>“Like Tyr103, Asp129 was shown to be important for resistance to β-lactams (Doucet et al., 2004; Escobar et al., 1994; Jacob et al., 1990). When we replaced the native Asp129 GAT with the synonymous codon Asp129 GAC, the GAC version did not appear to produce functional β-lactamase in ∆tgt (Fig. 3B), suggesting increased mistranslation or inefficient decoding of the GAC codon by tRNAAsp in the absence of Q. Decoding of GAT codon was also affected in ∆tgt in the presence of tobramycin.”</p>
<p>Added figure: Figure 3B</p>
