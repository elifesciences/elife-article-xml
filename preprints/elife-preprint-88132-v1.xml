<title>Abstract</title><p>Plant arboviruses rely heavily on insects’ feeding activities for successful transmission. Insect salivary proteins have been suggested to be essential for successful viral infection, but their exact mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we reveal that salivary factors from <italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic> are necessary for infection of <italic>Rice stripe virus</italic> (RSV) in plants. A salivary carbonic anhydrase (LssaCA) is identified as an essential factor in promoting RSV infection. LssaCA interacts with a rice thaumatin-like protein (OsTLP) that has endo-β-1,3-glucanase activity and can degrade callose in plants. RSV infection induces callose deposition, which can be reversed by LssaCA. Furthermore, LssaCA directly binds to the RSV nucleocapsid protein (NP) in salivary glands, and the LssaCA-RSV NP complex still binds OsTLP and further increases its glucanase activity. This study provides new insights into the tripartite virus-insect vector-plant interaction, which is relevant to many agriculturally important plant arboviruses whose transmission is facilitated by insect salivary proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During plant virus transmission by piercing-sucking insects, arboviruses are inoculated into the plant phloem <italic>via</italic> the secreted insect’s saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arca &amp; Ribeiro, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Conway et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Wu, Yi, Lv, Mao, &amp; Wei, 2022</xref>). Thus, insect saliva acts as an interface for the virus-insect-host tripartite interaction and it can directly promote pathogen transmission to, and infection of, the hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). However, despite the importance of insect salivary proteins in the tripartite interaction, there is still much to learn about how these proteins enable successful viral infection.</p>
<p>Previous studies have revealed that there are two ways in which insect saliva facilitates viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arca &amp; Ribeiro, 2018</xref>). One is an indirect approach whereby the saliva modulates the host microenvironment at the feeding site, and saliva effectors work together to allow the arthropod to go unnoticed while it feeds on the host plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acevedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arca &amp; Ribeiro, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). The other is direct regulation, whereby saliva proteins promote virus transmission through specific molecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Wen et al., 2019</xref>). Our recent work indicated that a <italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic> mucin protein, LssaMP, enables the formation of the salivary sheath and facilitates the transmission of <italic>rice stripe virus</italic> (RSV) into the rice phloem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Huo et al., 2022</xref>). A recent study on leafhoppers revealed that the expression of a saliva calcium-binding protein is inhibited by <italic>rice gall dwarf virus</italic> (RGDV), thus causing an increase of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in rice and triggering callose deposition and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. This increases the frequency of insect probing, thereby enhancing viral horizontal transmission into the rice phloem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Direct saliva protein-pathogen interactions have been reported in animal pathogens. For example, during transmission of <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> by <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>, the saliva protein Salp15 of <italic>I. scapularis</italic> binds to the bacterial outer surface protein C, which prevents the bacterium from being recognized by the animal immune system. In this way, the saliva protein enables the pathogen to infect the animal host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ramamoorthi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Schuijt et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> saliva sporozoite-associated protein (AgSAP) binds to the surface of the <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> sporozoite. The binding of AgSAP to heparan sulfate inhibits local inflammatory responses, thereby facilitating early <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection in the vertebrate host. Although most plant viruses are completely dependent on insect vectors for plant-to-plant transmission (Gray, 2008), the direct function of insect saliva proteins in mediating virus transmission remains largely uninvestigated.</p>
<p>During sap-feeding, arthropods produce two distinct types of saliva at different stages of the feeding process; gel saliva and watery saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bonaventure, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lou et al., 2019</xref>). The former forms a salivary sheath to provide a smooth path for the stylet penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lou et al., 2019</xref>). The latter is secreted into the phloem sieve elements to prevent them from plugging up, suppresses plant defense responses, induces pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) through herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs), and induces effector-triggered immunity (ETI) through avirulent gene, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Huang, Liu, Xu, Bao, &amp; Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ji et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Yi, Wu, &amp; Wei, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>For phloem-feeding insects, callose deposited on phloem sieve tubes can function as a defense mechanism by reducing insect feeding and preventing long-distance viral movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Hipper, Brault, Ziegler-Graff, &amp; Revers, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Will &amp; Vilcinskas, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Zavaliev, Ueki, Epel, &amp; Citovsky, 2011</xref>). Callose is a β-(1,3)-D-glucan polysaccharide that is synthesized by callose synthases and degraded by β-(1,3)-glucanases. Plants can defend themselves by depositing callose at the sieve tubes in response to virus infection, whereas viruses can counter this by activating β-(1,3)-glucanases to degrade callose and unplug the sieve tube occlusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bucher et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Wu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Zavaliev et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>RSV is the causative agent of rice stripe disease, a serious disease of rice crops that has occurred repeatedly in China, Japan, and Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Xu, Fu, Tao, &amp; Zhou, 2021</xref>). RSV is completely dependent on insect vectors for transmission to its host plants, and <italic>L. striatellus</italic> is the main vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Xu et al., 2021</xref>; Zhao et al., 2018). <italic>L. striatellus</italic> transmits RSV in a persistent-propagative manner. The virus initially infects the midgut, then disperses from the hemolymph into the salivary glands, and is inoculated into the plant host during <italic>L. striatellus</italic> feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Huo et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>L. striatellus</italic> belongs to the order Hemiptera, whose members mainly feed from sieve tubes through their mouthparts (stylets) that penetrate plant tissues and reach sieve tubes to ingest the phloem sap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Tjallingii, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">van Bel &amp; Will, 2016</xref>). RSV is secreted into the rice phloem <italic>via</italic> the watery saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Huo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Wang &amp; Blanc, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we identified a molecular interaction among RSV, an <italic>L. striatellus</italic> saliva protein, and a plant β-1,3-glucanase. The insect saliva protein directly binds to the RSV nucleocapsid protein (NP) and then binds to a rice thaumatin-like protein to activate its β-1,3-glucanase activity. The activation of β-1,3-glucanase helps facilitate RSV infection of the host plant by inhibiting callose deposition in response to viral infection.</p>

<title><italic>L. striatellus</italic> salivary carbonic anhydrase is an essential factor in enhancing RSV infection</title>
<p>To investigate the influence of <italic>L. striatellus</italic> salivary proteins on RSV infection levels in rice plants, two experiments were conducted and compared: viruliferous insect feeding (VIF) and microinjection of purified virus (MPV) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The results showed that VIF caused high RSV infection levels and obvious rice stripe disease symptoms, while MPV did not lead to disease symptoms, and only a low level of RSV NP protein was detected inside the plant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-E</xref>). These results suggested that the insect saliva factors are necessary for enabling RSV infection.</p>

<p>To identify the salivary proteins that play roles in mediating RSV infection, we have sequenced the <italic>L. striatellus</italic> saliva proteins and focused on the watery proteins that were inoculated into the plant phloem sieve tubes together with RSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Huo et al., 2022</xref>). A salivary protein, Sap6 (GenBank accession No. RZF48846.1), was identified to have a high expression level in <italic>L. striatellus</italic> salivary glands (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Western blotting assay showed that Sap6 was secreted into the plant as a watery saliva protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). Sequence homology analysis revealed Sap6 as a carbonic anhydrase-like protein, and enzyme active site analysis and enzyme activity experiment indicated Sap6 as a carbonic anhydrase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). Sap6 was then named <italic>L. striatellus</italic> salivary carbonic anhydrase (LssaCA).</p>

<p>To determine the role of LssaCA in RSV infection of rice plants, a <italic>LssaCA</italic>-specific double-stranded RNA (dsLssaCA) was synthesized and delivered into the hemocoel of RSV-infected 3<sup>rd</sup> instar nymphs to interfere with the gene expression. At 2 days post-microinjection (dpi), the <italic>LssaCA</italic> mRNA levels were measured by RT-qPCR and compared with the dsGFP control. The results showed that dsLssaCA treatment reduced the <italic>LssaCA</italic> mRNA level by 80% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The two groups of insects were then allowed to feed on healthy rice seedlings (5 insects per rice seedling) for 2 days. The RSV NP RNA levels (indicative of RSV titers) in the plants were measured at 14 days post-feeding (dpf). Compared with the rice seedlings fed by dsGFP-treated insects, those fed by dsLssaCA-treated insects had significantly reduced RSV titers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), indicating that LssaCA played an essential role in mediating RSV infection of the rice plants.</p>

<title>LssaCA enhances RSV infection not before the viruses have been inoculated into the plant phloem</title>
<p>To determine at which step LssaCA-deficiency affected RSV infection, we analyzed the influence of LssaCA-deficiency on RSV titers during several steps of the RSV transmission process, including the virus load in the salivary glands and saliva, and the initial inoculation levels <italic>in planta</italic>. First, at 2 days after dsLssaCA treatment of the viruliferous insects when <italic>LssaCA</italic> was significantly downregulated, RT-qPCR was used to detect RSV titer in the insect salivary glands and the results showed that <italic>LssaCA</italic> deficiency did not reduce RSV titers in this tissue (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Then, the LssaCA-deficient insects were allowed to feed on an artificial diet and their saliva was collected for RSV level analysis, which revealed that LssaCA-deficiency did not reduce the RSV titer in the secreted saliva (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Finally, plants were fed with 10 viruliferous insects for 24 h respectively and the RSV titers were measured immediately after feeding, which showed that LssaCA-deficiency did not affect the RSV initial inoculation levels <italic>in planta</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). These results suggested that LssaCA promoted RSV infection by a mechanism occurred not in insects or early stage of viral entry in plants, but <italic>in planta</italic> after viral inoculation.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, VIF but not MPV is able to enable RSV infection of rice plants, suggesting the necessity of insect saliva factors in enabling RSV infection. To further confirm whether LssaCA played a role in directly enhancing RSV levels <italic>in planta</italic>, we produced a recombinant LssaCA protein to pre-incubate with purified RSV particle solution and used bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a control for comparison. The two groups were then microinjected into leaves on different plants, and at 14 dpi their viral titers were measured using NP gene-specific RT-qPCR. The results showed that compared to those inoculated with BSA plus RSVs particles, those inoculated with LssaCA plus these same particles exhibited significantly higher RSV titer values (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-G</xref>). These findings clearly indicate that LssaCA plays an important role in promoting RSV infection of plants after RSV has been inoculated into the plant.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>LssaCA interacts with rice thaumatin-like protein to increase its endo-β-1,3-glucanase activity</title>
<p>Because LssaCA played its role <italic>in planta</italic>, we performed two experiments to investigate the mechanisms by which LssaCA enhances RSV infection. The first was to create LssaCA mutant proteins lacking enzymatic activity to determine if the enhanced infection was related to the LssaCA enzymatic activity. The second was to conduct a yeast two-hybrid screening to identify rice proteins that interact with LssaCA.</p>
<p>LssaCA has 7 residues constituting the enzymatic active center, including H<sub>111</sub>, N<sub>139</sub>, H<sub>141</sub>, H<sub>143</sub>, E<sub>153</sub>, H<sub>166</sub>, and T<sub>253</sub>. Seven recombinant mutant proteins were constructed and were labeled as LssaCA<sup>H111D</sup>, LssaCA<sup>N139H</sup>, LssaCA<sup>H141D</sup>, LssaCA<sup>H143D</sup>, LssaCA<sup>E153H</sup>, LssaCA<sup>H166D</sup>, LssaCA<sup>T253E</sup> (Fig. S2A). Enzymatic activity assays indicated that five of the seven mutants had significantly reduced enzymatic activity (Fig. S2B). To measure the influence of these mutants on RSV infection, they were pre-cultured with purified RSV particle solution and were then microinjected into plant leaves. The RSV titers were measured using RT-qPCR at 14 dpi. The results showed that, compared to LssaCA, none of the mutants decreased the protein function in enhancing RSV infection (Fig. S2C).

<p>The yeast two-hybrid screening identified a rice thaumatin-like protein (XP_025879846.1), designated as <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> thaumatin-like protein (OsTLP) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref> and S3). The open reading frame of OsTLP encoded for a polypeptide of 327 amino acids and a thaumatin family (THM) domain from residues 27 to 267. A BLAST algorithm-based analysis against sequence databases revealed the sequence identities to TLP 1b. The N-terminal 24 amino acids constituted a secretion signal peptide, suggesting OsTLP as a secreted protein. Pull-down and MST assays were performed to confirm the molecular interaction between OsTLP and LssaCA. The pull-down assays showed that OsTLP and LssaCA had a specific interaction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The MST assay revealed a K<sub>D</sub> of 1.3 ± 2.2 μM for the OsTLP-LssaCA interaction, further confirming the molecular interaction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>Previous studies have reported that TLP orthologs in apples, cherries, tomatoes, barley, etc. have endo-β-1,3-glucanase activity, which works on degrading callose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">de Jesus-Pires et al., 2020</xref>). To confirm the endo-β-1,3-glucanase activity of OsTLP, an enzyme activity experiment was conducted with the recombinantly expressed OsTLP protein. The results revealed an average endo-β-1,3-glucanase activity of 60 units/mg OsTLP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). To determine the <italic>in-planta</italic> activity of OsTLP, OsTLP overexpression transgenic plants were constructed. Enzymatic activity assays confirmed that the transgenic plants had significantly increased β-1,3-glucanase activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the influence of the molecular interaction between LssaCA and OsTLP on OsTLP activity, OsTLP was pre-incubated with either LssaCA or a BSA control for 2 h before the enzymatic activity was measured. The results showed that pre-incubation with LssaCA significantly increased OsTLP activity, compared to the BSA control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). These results imply that LssaCA may facilitate RSV infection by enhancing the activity of OsTLP to degrade callose.</p>

<title>RSV NP interacts with LssaCA to further enhance OsTLP enzymatic activity</title>
<p>We have confirmed that LssaCA binds to OsTLP to promote callose degradation and facilitates RSV infection <italic>in planta</italic>, we then investigated whether there is a direct interaction between LssaCA and RSV by which RSV directly participates in the function played by LssaCA.

<p>As LssaCA interacts with both RSV NP and OsTLP, we measured the tripartite interaction. Through pull-down assays, we discovered that when LssaCA was pre-incubated with RSV to form an NP-LssaCA complex, the complex still had the ability to bind to OsTLP (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). This result demonstrates a tripartite interaction among these three proteins.</p>
<p>We then explored how the tripartite interaction affects OsTLP enzymatic activity. OsTLP was pre-incubated with LssaCA-NP complex or LssaCA control. After incubation for 2 h, the enzyme activity was measured. The results showed that pre-incubation with LssaCA-NP complex significantly increased OsTLP activity compared with LssaCA control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>), indicating that stronger activation of β-1,3-glucanase activity was achieved through the NP-LssaCA-OsTLP tripartite interaction.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggested that when RSV is delivered into plant phloem, it can induce callose deposition. This process is overturned through a tripartite interaction involving the LssaCA protein which binds to RSV in insect salivary glands and then the LssaCA-RSV complex binds to OsTLP in plants. Once this tripartite interaction occurs, OsTLP activity of β-1,3-glucanase is significantly increased which degrades callose thus allowing for efficient RSV infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Insects are known to be vectors of many plant viruses, and some of these plant viruses rely entirely on insect vectors for their plant-to-plant transmission. Previous studies have suggested that insect salivary proteins may facilitate arbovirus infection of plants through various mechanisms, such as breaking down plant cell walls, inhibiting plant immune defenses and callose deposition, directly binding to arbovirus to prevent their detection by plant immune systems, and more. Further research is needed to fully understand the role that insect salivary proteins play in arboviruses infection of plants. In this study, we have found that RSV infection of rice plants triggers the deposition of callose. However, this process is reversed by a tripartite interaction involving the central component of an insect salivary protein LssaCA, which subsequently binds to RSV in insect salivary glands and then OsTLP in the plants. The activity of OsTLP’s β-1,3-glucanase is significantly increased when this tripartite interaction occurs; leading to the degradation of callose and thus allowing for efficient RSV infection (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

Within the plants, RSV induces callose synthesis, causing callose deposition to inhibit RSV infection. However, LssaCA reverses this inhibition by binding to OsTLP to enhance its β-1,3-glucanase activity, which degrades the deposited callose. The interaction between RSV and LssaCA further enhances the OsTLP enzymatic activity and facilitates RSV infection.</p></caption>

<p>Callose is a complex polysaccharide, and its deposition in plant phloem plays an important role in defending against insect attacks and viral spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Zavaliev et al., 2011</xref>). When attacked by piercing insects or viruses, plants activate callose deposition on the sieve plates to occlude the flow of phloem sap, thus discouraging feeding and reducing viral long-distance spread. This accumulation of callose in plant phloem can be switched on or off through the action of callose synthases and hydrolases (Li et al., 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Shangguan et al., 2018</xref>). Studies have shown that expression levels of these glucanase enzymes differ between resistant and susceptible plant species. This suggests that some plants may be more successful at resisting infection due to high levels of glucanase enzymes in their tissues, which allow them to more quickly and effectively form callose barriers against insects and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hao et al., 2008</xref>). Some insects have evolved β-1,3-glucanases enzymes that can degrade the deposited callose, thus enabling them to bypass the plant’s defense mechanisms and continue feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bucher et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hao et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which an insect saliva protein binds to a plant β-1,3-glucanases protein, thus activating the enzymatic activity and promoting callose degradation.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that plants fed on by viruliferous insects showed higher callose deposition than did plants fed on by uninfected insects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A–C</xref>), suggesting that arbovirus infection <italic>via</italic> insect saliva may represent a double stress to the plant, inducing stronger callose deposition that must be overcome for successful insect feeding and viral spread. To analyze how this happens, we looked at the tripartite interaction between LssaCA-NP-OsTLP. We found that this interaction induced significantly higher β-1,3-glucanase activity than the LssaCA-OsTLP interaction alone, suggesting that SBPH and RSV have evolved mechanisms to increase β-1,3-glucanase activity in order to bypass the plant’s defense of callose deposition and facilitate successful viral spread.</p>
<p>LssaCA is carbonic anhydrase, but its role in aiding RSV infection does not rely on its enzymatic activity (Fig. S2). Our results found that even though LssaCA mutants had significantly reduced enzymatic activity, their ability to facilitate RSV infection was not significantly decreased. Because LssaCA interacts with RSV NP, we measured the interactions between LssaCA mutants and NP. Pull-down assays indicated that all the mutants still interacted with RSV NP (Fig. S4), while the mutants with a stronger interaction (LssaCA<sup>H111D</sup> and LssaCA<sup>E153H</sup>) showed better facilitation for RSV infection levels (Fig. S2). These results further supported the importance of LssaCA-NP interaction in mediating RSV infection, while the exact role of LssaCA enzymatic activities in aiding RSV infection is still unclear.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study elucidated a tripartite interaction among a plant virus, an insect saliva protein, and a host phloem β-1,3-glucanase. This interaction inhibited the plant defense of callose deposition and enabled arboviral phloem transmission. This study provides new insights into the tripartite virus-insect vector-plant interaction, which is relevant to many agriculturally important plant arboviruses whose transmission is facilitated <italic>via</italic> insect saliva proteins.</p>

<title>RNA interference</title>
<p>We conducted RNAi analyses to determine the function of LssaCA in mediating RSV infection and regulating callose deposition. The <italic>LssaCA</italic>-specific gene fragment was PCR-amplified with the primer pair LssaCA-T7F/LssaCA-T7R (Table S1). Then, dsRNA was synthesized using a commercial kit (T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi System, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and purified by phenol: chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. Finally, 36.8 nL dsRNA at 1 ng/nL was delivered into the insect hemocoel for gene silencing. Microinjection was performed using a glass needle through a Nanoliter 2000 (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA). The negative control, GFP dsRNA, was synthesized and microinjected following the same protocol.</p>

<p>Gene transcript levels were determined by RT-qPCR. The RNA was extracted from <italic>L. striatellus</italic> tissues using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and from plant leaves using TRIzol. Reverse transcriptional PCR (iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and SYBR-Green-based qPCR (SYBR Green Supermix, Bio-Rad) was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The primer pair used to amplify <italic>LssaCA</italic> was LssaCA-q-F/LssaCA-q-R (Table S1). Viral RNA copies were measured using the primers NP-q-F/NP-q-R (Table S1). <italic>L. striatellus</italic> translation elongation factor 2 (<italic>EF2</italic>) and rice <italic>actin</italic> were amplified as internal controls to ensure equal loading of cDNA isolated from different samples. The primer pairs EF2-q-F/EF2-q-R and actin-q-F/actin-q-R (Table S1) were used to amplify <italic>EF2</italic> and <italic>actin</italic>, respectively. Water was used as a negative control.</p>

<title>Yeast two-hybrid assays</title>
<p>Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed to identify rice proteins interacting with LssaCA. A high-complexity rice cDNA library was fused to <italic>Gal4 AD</italic> and transformed into the yeast strain Y187. The <italic>LssaCA</italic> gene lacking the signal-peptide sequence (<italic>LssaCA<sup>sp-</sup></italic>) was fused to <italic>Gal4 DNA-BD</italic> and transformed into the yeast strain Y2HGold. The two yeast strains were co-cultured overnight to allow mating to create diploids. After library screening, positive clones were selected on quadruple dropout medium: SD/–Ade/–His/–Leu/–Trp supplemented with X-a-Gal and aureobasidin A (QDO/X/A), and prey plasmids were isolated for sequencing. To further confirm the interaction between LssaCA and OsTLP, <italic>LssaCA<sup>sp-</sup></italic> was cloned into the prey vector pDB-Leu, and the <italic>OsTLP</italic> gene lacking the signal-peptide sequence (OsTLP<italic><sup>sp-</sup></italic>) was cloned into the bait vector pPC86.

<title>Pull-down assays</title>
<p>Pull-down assays were performed to determine the molecular interactions between LssaCA and RSV NP, LssaCA muteins and RSV NP, LssaCA and OsTLP, and OsTLP and the LssaCA-NP complex.</p>
<p>The interaction between LssaCA and RSV NP was determined using GST pull-down analyses as described previously (Huo et al., 2014). Briefly, <italic>LssaCA<sup>sp-</sup></italic> was cloned into the pGEX-3x vector and LssaCA was expressed as a GST-fusion protein (GST-LssaCA). The <italic>NP</italic> gene was cloned into the pET-30a (+) expression vector and the protein was expressed with an N-terminal His-tag (NP-His). The GST-LssaCA construct was expressed in, and purified from, <italic>E. coli</italic> stain BL21. The GST-LssaCA protein or the GST control protein was bound to Glutathione Sepharose beads (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA), then NP-His protein was added to the beads. The bead-bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by western blotting with antibodies against GST or His-tag.</p>
<p>We conducted His pull-down assays to determine the interactions between the LssaCA muteins and RSV NP. The gene sequences encoding <italic>LssaCA</italic> muteins (without the signal-peptide sequence) were each cloned into the pET-30a (+) expression vector, and each mutein was expressed with an N-terminal His-tag. The <italic>NP</italic> gene was cloned into the pGEX-3x vector and NP was expressed as a GST-fusion protein (GST-NP). Each of the His-tag-fused LssaCA muteins was bound to Ni Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), then the GST-NP protein or the GST control protein was added to the beads. The bead-bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by western blotting with antibodies against GST or His-tag.</p>
<p>Next, MBP pull-down analyses were performed to determine the interaction between OsTLP and LssaCA. The <italic>OsTLP<sup>sp-</sup></italic> sequence was cloned into pMAL-p2X to produce the MBP-fusion protein (MBP-OsTLP). The MBP-OsTLP protein or the MBP control protein was bound to amylose resin (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA, USA), and then the LssaCA-His protein was added to the beads. To determine the interaction between OsTLP and the LssaCA-NP complex, the LssaCA-His and GST-NP proteins were preincubated before being added to the beads. The bead-bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by western blotting with the MBP antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), His-tag antibody (Tiangen, Beijing, China) and GST antibody (Tiangen).</p>

<title>Microscale thermophoresis (MST) assays</title>
<p>We conducted MST assays to detect the interactions between LssaCA and NP, and between LssaCA and OsTLP. First, 10 μM purified LssaCA<sup>sp-</sup> protein (His-fusion protein) was labelled with a Monolith NT Protein Labeling Kit RED-NHS (Nano Temper Technologies GMBH, München, Germany) using red fluorescent dye NT-647 N-hydroxysuccinimide (amine-reactive), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The binding assays were performed on a Monolith NT.115 Microscale Thermophoresis instrument (Nano Temper Technologies GMBH) using capillaries treated using the standard method. The labeled protein LssaCA<sup>sp-</sup> was added to serially diluted NP (GST-NP, GST was used as a negative control) or OsTLP<sup>sp-</sup> (MBP-fusion protein, MBP was used as a negative control). The initial concentration of each protein was 40 µM with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The KD Fit function of NanoTemper Analysis software version 1.2.214.1 was used for curve fitting and to calculate the dissociation constant (Kd).</p>

<title>RSV inoculation through midrib microinjection</title>
<p>Midrib microinjection was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, 200 RSV-infected <italic>L. striatellus</italic> were homogenized with 200 μL PBS (pH 7.0), and the homogenate was centrifuged twice at 8000 g for 10 min at 4℃. The crude virus extract was transferred to a new centrifuge tube. The concentration of RSV in the extract was measured using a Nanodrop One instrument. The RSV extract was adjusted to 1 mg/mL for microinjection. Rice seedlings were grown in an incubator for 2 weeks until the leaf veins became clearly visible. Then, 23 nL RSV extract was microinjected into the midrib. The RSV titers in plants were detected at 7–14 days post microinjection.</p>

<title>β-1,3-glucanase activity</title>
<p>β-1,3-glucanase hydrolyzes laminarin and cuts the β-1,3-glucoside bond to produce a reducing terminus. Therefore, the rate of reducing sugars production was used to calculate enzyme activity. One unit of β-1,3-glucanase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyses laminarin to generate 1 μg reducing sugars per minute.</p>
<p>The β-1,3-glucanase activity of OsTLP was measured using a beta-1,3-glucanase microplate assay kit (Cat. ASK1028, Bioworld, Bloomington, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>To determine the enzymatic activity of the recombinant OsTLP proteins, the MBP-fusion OsTLP<sup>sp-</sup> protein or the MBP control protein was adjusted to 0.5 mg/mL. To determine the enzymatic activity of the <italic>in vivo</italic>-expressed OsTLP<sup>sp-</sup>, 0.1 g rice leaf material was homogenized with 1 mL assay buffer on ice, and then the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000g at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred into a new centrifuge tube and kept on ice until detection of enzymatic activity.</p>
<p>For the assay, a 50-μL aliquot of the protein solution was mixed with laminarin substrate and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by incubating the reaction tube in a boiling water bath for 10 min. The reaction supernatant was transferred into a microplate and incubated at 90°C for 10 min before measuring the absorbance at 540 nm.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors identify an insect salivary protein participating viral initiate infection in plant host. They found a salivary LssaCA promoting RSV infection by interacting with OsTLP that could degrade callose in plants. Furthermore, RSV NP bond to LssaCA in salivary glands to form a complex, which then bond to OsTLP to promote degradation of callose.</p>
<p>The story focus on tripartite virus-insect vector-plant interaction, and is interesting. However, the study is too simple and poor-conducted. The conclusion is also overstated due to unsolid findings.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>
1. The key problem is that how long the LssCA functioned for in rice plant. Author declared that LssCA had no effect on viral initial infection, but on infection after viral inoculation. It is unreasonable to conclude that LssCA promoted viral infection based on the data that insect inoculated plant just for 2 days, but viral titer could be increased at 14 day post-feeding. How could saliva proteins, which reached phloem 12-14 days before, induce enough TLP to degrade callose to promote virus infection? It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>2. Lines 110-116 and Fig. 1, the results of viruliferous insect feeding and microinjection with purified virus could not conclude the saliva factor necessary of RSV infection, because these two tests are not in parallel and comparable. Microinjection with salivary proteins combined with purified virus is comparable with microinjection with purified virus.</p>
<p>The second problem is how many days post viruliferous insect feeding and microinjection with purified virus did author detect viral titers? in Method section, authors declared that viral titers was detected at 7-14 days post microinjection. Please demonstrate the days exactly.</p>
<p>The last problem is that how author made sure that the viral titers in salivary glands of insects between two experiments was equal, causing different phenotype of rice plant. If not, different viral titers in salivary glands of insects between two experiments of course caused different phenotype of rice plant.</p>
<p>3. The callose deposition in phloem can be induced by insect feeding. In Fig. 5H, why was the callose deposition increased in the whole vascular bundle, but not phloem? Could the transgenic rice plant directional express protein in the phloem? In Fig.5, why was callose deposition detected at 24 h after insect feeding? In Fig. 6A, why was callose deposition decreased in the phloem, but not all the cells of the of TLP OE plant? Also in Fig.6A and B, expression of callose synthase genes was required.</p>

<p>There is increasing evidence that viruses manipulate vectors and hosts to facilitate transmission. For arthropods, saliva plays an essential role for successful feeding on a host and consequently for arthropod-borne viruses that are transmitted during arthropod feeding on new hosts. This is so because saliva constitutes the interaction interface between arthropod and host and contains many enzymes and effectors that allow feeding on a compatible host by neutralizing host defenses. Therefore, it is not surprising that viruses change saliva composition or use saliva proteins to provoke altered vector-host interactions that are favorable for virus transmission. However, detailed mechanistic analyses are scarce. Here, Zhao and coworkers study transmission of rice stripe virus (RSV) by the planthopper Laodelphax striatellus. RSV infects plants as well as the vector, accumulates in salivary glands and is injected together with saliva into a new host during vector feeding.</p>
<p>The authors present evidence that a saliva-contained enzyme - carbonic anhydrase (CA) - might facilitate virus infection of rice by interfering with callose deposition, a plant defense response. In vitro pull-down experiments, yeast two hybrid assay and binding affinity assays show convincingly interaction between CA and a plant thaumatin-like protein (TLP) that degrades callose. Similar experiments show that CA and TLP interact with the RSV nuclear capsid protein NT to form a complex. Formation of the CA-TLP complex increases TLP activity by roughly 30% and integration of NT increases TLP activity further. This correlates with lower callose content in RSV-infected plants and higher virus titer. Further, silencing CA in vectors decreases virus titers in infected plants. Interestingly, aphid CA was found to play a role in plant infection with two non-persistent non-circulative viruses, turnip mosaic virus and cucumber mosaic virus (Guo et al. 2023 doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2222040120), but the proposed mode of action is entirely different.</p>
<p>While this is an interesting work, there are, in my opinion, some weak points. The microinjection experiments result in much lower virus accumulation in rice than infection by vector inoculation, so their interpretation is difficult. Also, the effect of injected recombinant CA protein might fade over time because of degradation or dilution. The authors claim that enzymatic activity of CA is not required for its proviral activity. However, this is difficult to assess because all CA mutants used for the corresponding experiments possess residual activity. It remains also unclear whether viral infection deregulates CA expression in planthoppers and TLP expression in plants. However, increased CA and TLP levels could alone contribute to reduced callose deposition.</p>
