<title>Abstract</title><p>When mice run, activity in their primary visual cortex (V1) is strongly modulated. This observation has altered conceptions of a brain region assumed to be a passive image processor. Extensive work has followed to dissect the circuits and functions of running-correlated modulation. However, it remains unclear whether visual processing in primates might similarly change during locomotion. We therefore measured V1 activity in marmosets while they viewed stimuli on a treadmill. In contrast to mouse, running-correlated modulations of marmoset V1 were small, and tended to be slightly suppressive. Population-level analyses revealed trial-to-trial fluctuations of shared gain across V1 in both species, but while strongly correlated with running in mice, gain modulations were smaller and more often negatively correlated with running in marmosets. Thus, population-wide fluctuations of V1 may reflect a common feature of mammalian visual cortical function, but important quantitative differences point to distinct consequences for the relation between vision and action in primates versus rodents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sensation and action are traditionally thought to involve separate brain circuits serving distinct functions: Activity in early sensory areas is driven nearly exclusively by the corresponding sensory input, whereas activity in motor areas is exclusively related to movement. Recent work in mice, a major mammalian model system in neuroscience, has called for a re-evaluation of this distinction, given recent demonstrations that activity in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) depends as much on whether the mouse is running or stationary as on what visual stimulus is shown[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Neurons in V1 of virtually all mammals are selective for simple image features, a presumably critical early step of image processing that continues throughout a hierarchy of visual brain areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], and this is true of mice as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The observation that running modulates (mouse) V1 of a comparable magnitude to the visually-driven activity has motivated substantial effort in the field to understand the biological mechanisms and functional consequences of this powerful interaction between sensation and action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>However, these observations have all been made in rodents; similar measurements have not been made in primates. Although rodents certainly rely on vision for important behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], primates are more fundamentally visual organisms, with exquisite acuity and specialized functional characteristics such as foveas and corresponding high-resolution representations of the central visual field in V1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], in addition to a larger network of areas involved in vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. And while experiments that allow subjects to run while viewing visual stimuli may now be commonplace in mice, analogous experiments in nonhuman primates have remained technically daunting. It has thus remained unclear whether the large effect of running on early visual processing is a general property of mammalian brains revealed by work in mice, or whether the early stages of primate visual processing are less affected by nonvisual factors. Here, we fill this major gap in cross-species understanding by taking advantage of the relatively small size and peaceable nature of the common marmoset <italic>(Callithrix jacchus)</italic>, which allowed us to have animals on a custom-designed treadmill and to use high-channel-count electrode arrays, including Neuropixels. Our comparative study fits into a larger emerging enterprise to assess whether substantial signals due to animal movements affect sensory processing similarly in rodents and primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We tested for running-based modulations in V1 of the common marmoset, a highly visual new world primate. Marmosets were head-fixed, placed on a wheel-based treadmill suited to their arboreal nature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), and alternated between running and not running while we presented various visual stimuli designed to assess the properties and responsiveness of V1 neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). We recorded from foveal and parafoveal neurons in 2 marmosets (using chronically-implanted N-Form 3D electrode arrays), and in one marmoset were also able to simultaneously record from both foveal and peripheral V1 (using Neuropixels 1.0 probes). To support precise comparison to rodent V1, we used the same analysis pipeline on a publicly-available mouse dataset that used matching stimuli in a treadmill paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. This let us perform direct quantitative and statistical comparisons of the effects of running on V1 activity in a rodent and a primate.</p>

<p>a) Apparatus for recording from marmoset V1 while presenting visual stimuli on a high-resolution display, monitoring gaze using an eye tracker, on a toroidal treadmill that allowed the marmoset to run or not run. b) Schematic example of variables of interest. Visual stimuli were presented (top row). Rasters show activity from a V1 array (second row). Gaze was monitored (3rd row, x and y timeseries plotted in black and grey), saccades were detected (red), and pupil size was also measured (4th row). Running speed was measured using a rotary encoder attached to the treadmill (5th row). c) Before the main experiments, receptive fields were mapped using sparse noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. The array of pseudocolor images shows 3 examples of V1 receptive fields (2 foveal and 1 peripheral neuron). d) Main experiment involved presenting full-field sinusoidal gratings that drifted in one of 12 directions (top row), at a variety of spatial frequencies (vertical axis at left). Rasters show example V1 activity during stimulus presentations when running (red) or stationary (black). e) Summary of receptive field (RF) locations in the mouse dataset (orange, top), and f) our data from marmosets (blue and green, bottom). In both marmosets, we recorded from a portion of V1 accessible at the dorsal surface of the brain using chronically implanted arrays, which yielded neurons with foveal receptive fields (green RFs). We also recorded from one marmoset using Neuropixels arrays, allowing us to simultaneously access both peripheral and foveal V1 (blue RFs; peripheral units are analyzed later/separately, see text). g) Examples of mouse V1 orientation tuning curves, for cells with weak, moderate, and strong orientation tuning. h) Same, for marmoset V1. i,j) Histograms of orientation-selectivity indices (OSIs) for mice (i) and marmosets (j). Marmoset OSIs, likely lower than previously reported because we used full-field stimuli not optimized to the spatial frequency tuning of each neuron, and which likely recruited surround suppression. Regardless, the marmoset V1 neurons had strong visual responses and qualitatively conventional tuning. k,l) Running speeds in mice (k) and marmosets (l).

<p>First, we mapped the receptive fields of marmoset V1 neurons using reverse-correlation techniques adapted to free-viewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] while we measured gaze using a video-based eyetracker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In V1 of both marmosets, we found receptive fields within the central few degrees of vision, with sizes expected at those eccentricities (1-5 deg, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, blue and green; these can be compared to those in mouse, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). As expected for primary visual cortex, marmoset V1 (both well-isolated single units and well-tuned multi-unit clusters) responded robustly to oriented gratings and exhibited orientation- (and sometimes direction-) selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], similar to that in the mouse V1 dataset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g,h</xref>). Orientation tuning spanned a range from weak to strong tuning, with many units exhibiting strong and conventional tuning curves (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i,j</xref>).</p>
<p>As a first test for effects of running on V1 activity, we assessed whether running speed was correlated with aggregate V1 activity by comparing the time series of these variables throughout each session. In the mouse, such modulations are easily visually evident when inspecting the time series of neural activity and running: when the mouse runs, V1 spiking often increases substantially. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref> shows example sessions with the maximal and median amounts of correlation between the time series of running speed and a generic low-dimensional representation of the population activity (the first principal component [PC] of the simultaneously-recorded V1 trial spike counts). This correlation could be seen when running / not running alternated on slow (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) or fast (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) time scales.</p>

<caption><title>Mice and marmosets exhibit different correlations between V1 activity and running speed.</title>
<p>a) Mice show visually compelling correlations between V1 trial spike counts and running speed. Example session with the highest correlation between running and V1 activity. Raster at top shows spiking activity of all mouse V1 neurons recorded. Population activity is summarized below the raster as the first principal component of the V1 array activity (“First Neural PC”, orange trace); running speed is plotted underneath it on the same time axis (grey trace). Clearly, the two curves are highly similar. b) Same, for an example mouse session chosen to have the median correlation between running and V1 activity. In this example, the modulations of running speed and neural activity rise and fall together on a faster time scale than in the example in a). c,d) Marmosets show smaller, and typically negative, correlations between V1 spiking activity and running speed. Format same as the mouse data in (a,b), with example sessions chosen to show the maximal and the median correlations between V1 activity and running speed. The (anticorrelated) similarity between V1 activity (First Neural PC) and Running Speed curves is harder to discern in the marmoset. e,f) Correlations between V1 activity and running in the mouse (e) had a median &gt; 0 (median=0.407, p=9.04 × 10<italic><sup>-</sup></italic><sup>5</sup>, stat=308, n=25, Mann-Whitney U Test), and many individual sessions had significant correlations with running (filled bars), and all such significant sessions had positive correlations (with significance determined via permutation to remove effects of autocorrelation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]). In the marmosets (f), the distributions of correlations were slightly but reliably negative (median=-0.033, p=0.034, stat=101, n=27, Mann-Whitney U Test), and all significantly modulated individual sessions exhibited negative correlations (5/27).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>A starkly different impression comes from visual inspection of the relationship between running and the activity of marmoset V1 neurons representing the central visual field. Any relation between V1 activity and running appears considerably smaller. In examples showing the maximal and median relationships between running and V1 activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d</xref>), V1 activity did not track running speed as clearly, although the activity did tend to increase when the monkey stopped running, explaining the modest negative correlations.</p>
<p>We then quantified the relationship between the timecourses of aggregate V1 activity and running across all experiments on a session-by-session basis, in both species. For mice, this confirmed a strong positive correlation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>; median=0.407, n=25, p=9.04 × 10<italic><sup>-</sup></italic><sup>5</sup>, stat=308, Mann-Whitney U Test). For marmosets, the distribution of correlations between V1 activity and running was subtly but reliably negative (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>, median=-0.033, p=0.034, stat=101, n=27, Mann-Whitney U Test). Most importantly, the correlation between V1 activity and running was significantly different between the two species (p=6.93 × 10<italic><sup>-</sup></italic><sup>7</sup>, stat=934, Mann-Whitney U Test). This session-level analysis confirmed that running modulations in mice are large and mostly reflect increases in response. In contrast, running modulations in marmoset foveal V1 are small, and if anything, reflect slight reductions in activity.</p>
<p>To perform additional quantitative tests at the level of individual V1 units, we divvied up each unit’s spiking responses to drifting gratings based on whether or not the animal was running (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This analysis confirmed, in mouse, a tendency for large response increases during running to both the preferred orientation stimulus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, geometric mean ratio [running/stationary] = 1.523, 95% CI [1.469, 1.579], n=743 tuned units) and to all visual stimuli (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>, 1.402 [1.365, 1.440], n=1168). Many individual units had significant running modulations, and were more often increases rather than decreases (803/1168 [69%] increased firing rate, and 115/1168 [10%] decreased, bootstrapped t-test). In marmoset V1, there was again a modest decrease evident in the response to the preferred stimulus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>; geometric mean ratio [running/stationary] = 0.899, 95% CI [0.851, 0.949], n=228 tuned units). Not even modest suppression was evident in responses aggregated across all stimuli (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, 1.011 [0.995, 1.027], n=786). The number of significantly modulated units was relatively small, and was more balanced between decreases and increases in firing rate (172/786 [22%] increased and 161/786 [20%] decreased, bootstrapped t-test). Because we performed quantitative comparisons on subsets of the data for which the stimuli were nearly identical across species, and used the same data analysis code to calculate response metrics, these analyses solidly confirm a substantial difference between the form of running modulations of V1 activity in mouse versus marmoset (log ratio of running:stationary was significantly different between mouse and marmoset for all units: p=6.62 × 10<italic><sup>-</sup></italic><sup>99</sup>, stat=1399874, Mann-Whitney U Test, and tuned units: p=4.69 × 10<italic><sup>-</sup></italic><sup>57</sup>, stat=4030135). Thus, the overall impacts of running on V1 units again appear large and positive in mice, and much smaller (and perhaps slightly negative) in marmoset.</p>

<p>Mouse data points are plotted in orange and marmoset data in blue. a) Scatterplot (log-log) shows firing rate to preferred stimulus for tuned units (OSI &gt; 0.2), during running (y-axis) and stationary (x-axis). Histogram summarizes the projections onto the line of unity, and shows a clear shift indicating increases in response during running (geometric mean ratio [running/stationary] = 1.523 [1.469, 1.579], n=743). Dark-shaded symbols indicate individually-significant units. Dashed lines indicate doubling (2X) and halving (0.5x) of response. b) Same format, but now showing the response aggregated over all stimuli, for all units (geometric mean ratio [running/stationary] = 1.402 [1.365, 1.440], n=1168). A similar pattern reflecting primarily large increases is evident. c,d) V1 units in marmoset show a very different pattern. Responses of tuned units to preferred stimuli (c) cluster more closely to the line of unity, with a small but significant shift indicating a subtle decrease in response (geometric mean ratio [running/stationary] = 0.899 [0.851, 0.949], n=228). Responses to all stimuli for all units (d) show even less running-related modulation (geometric mean ratio [running/stationary] = 1.011 [0.995, 1.027], n=786).</p></caption>

<p>Given these apparently categorical differences between the two species at the levels of both experimental sessions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and individual units (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), a key question is whether mouse and marmoset visual cortices are modulated by non-visual input in fundamentally different ways. To answer this, we employed more powerful model-based neuronal population analyses that inferred trial-to-trial variations in shared gain modulations across V1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,d</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], in a manner totally agnostic to running (or any other aspect of behavior). This shared-gain model improved descriptions of the population data over simpler models that only took the stimulus (and slow drifts in baseline firing rate) into account for all sessions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b,c</xref>; marmoset p=1.52 × 10<italic><sup>-</sup></italic><sup>82</sup>, stat=27174, n=754, Wilcoxon signed rank test; mouse p=4.64 × 10<italic><sup>-</sup></italic><sup>181</sup>, stat=25966, n=1257). This was true in both species, bolstering the emerging notion that population-level gain modulations are a general principle of mammalian V1 function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. This shared gain term modulated more strongly in mice compared to marmosets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, std. dev. in mouse = 2.170 [2.106, 2.245], marmoset = 1.188 [1.072, 1.274], p&lt;1 × 10<italic>-</italic>9, stat=1013202, Mann-Whitney U Test). Furthermore, in the mouse, shared gain was higher for running than stationary as estimated during stimulus presentations (mean difference 0.970 [0.761, 1.225], p∼0, stat 8.017, t test), demonstrating that a substantial portion of modulations of mouse V1 can be explained by a shared gain term that increases with running (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>, orange point). In marmoset, shared gain was slightly but reliably lower when running (mean difference = -0.125 [-0.203, -0.059], p=0.002, stat=-3.360, t test, (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>, blue point), a quantitatively very different relation to running than in mouse (p = 8.77 × 10<italic><sup>-</sup></italic><sup>9</sup>, stat=6.615, 2 sample t test). Thus, a common mechanism (shared gain) can describe running modulations in both species– but with quantitatively different correlations with behavior that make for potentially distinct downstream impacts on perception and action.</p>

<p>Although our marmoset dataset focused on V1 neurons representing the central portion of the visual field, we were also able to record simultaneously from neurons with peripheral and central (foveal) receptive fields by advancing a Neuropixels probe into both the superficial portion of V1 (foveal/central) and the calcarine sulcus (peripheral), resulting in simultaneous recordings of 110 and 147 (stimulus-driven) units representing the central and peripheral portions of the visual field, respectively. Analyzing neurons with peripheral receptive fields separately revealed a difference in running modulations between these retinotopically-distinct portions of V1: peripheral neurons had slightly higher stimulus-driven responses during running (aggregating over all stimuli, geometric mean ratio [running/stationary] = 1.129 [1.068, 1.194], n=147; difference with the central units was significant, p=2.100e-03, stat=12376, Mann-Whitney U Test), and the two sessions in which we were able to perform these measurements had higher positive correlations than any sessions in our entire foveal V1 dataset (assessed by correlating running speed either with the First Neural PC or with a shared gain term). Although the foveal representation in V1 (accessible in marmosets on the dorsal surface of the brain) is slightly suppressed by running, it appears that quantitative differences exist in the peripheral representation (which we recorded from in the calcarine sulcus). This initial set of recordings suggests that subtle increases in response might occur in the peripheral representation in marmoset V1. This finding calls for a larger-scale study of how such modulations might differ across portions of the retinotopic map, and for further consideration of the implications for cross-species comparisons. An intriguing conjecture is that the primate foveal representation might be functionally unique, but that the primate peripheral representation might be more functionally similar to that of mouse V1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>].</p>
    <p>Although this is an interesting potential distinction that further work will investigate more systematically, we emphasize that the main result described earlier still holds: the effects of running are small in marmoset V1. Even though there are slightly positive modulations in the peripheral representation (and hence, are of the same sign as those in mouse), the magnitude of whatever running-correlated modulations we could measure in marmoset V1 are still small relative to those in mouse V1 (median spike rate modulation by running significantly different between mouse and marmoset calcarine/peripheral recordings: p=7.639 × 10<italic><sup>-</sup></italic><sup>11</sup>, stat=7967825, Mann-Whitney U Test).</p>
<p>Finally, we assessed whether the modest running-correlated modulations we observed in marmoset V1 might be explained by eye movements. If eye movements differed when the animal ran versus when it did not run, that would mean that the retinal input differed between the two conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. In that case, running modulations would not reflect a direct effect of running (a fundamentally non-visual effect), but rather a consequence of changes in the patterns of retinal stimulation (which we already know affects V1 responses). To test this possibility, we quantified the number of saccades per stimulus presentation, as well as saccade size (vector magnitude), and then assessed whether these eye movement metrics differed as a function of running.</p>
<p>We found that eye movements were quite similar between running and stationary periods, although subtle quantitative differences were revealed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In short, saccades were slightly more frequent and larger during running (saccade frequency during running: 2.653 Hz, 95% CI [2.600, 2.697]; stationary/not running: 2.525 Hz [2.475, 2.573]; saccade magnitude during running: 9.261 deg [9.140, 9.374]; stationary/not running: 8.337 deg [8.190, 8.470]). This result motivated us to then assess whether these running-correlated eye movement differences might quantitatively explain the running-correlated modulations of V1 response. Our initial analyses found that differences in retinal stimulation due to differences in eye movements are unlikely to explain running-correlated suppression of V1 activity. We used linear regression to estimate the relationship between number of saccades and the firing rate of each unit in each trial. This enabled us to predict how much change in firing rate we should expect given the differences in saccade rate between the running and stationary conditions. The response change predicted from saccades was much less than the already-small running-correlated changes in response we observed in our experiment. On the aggregate, saccades slightly increased activity (predicted spike rate increase during running based on saccades = 0.05 Hz; expressed as gain, &lt; 1%), and thus cannot explain the sign or magnitude of the subtle decreases we observed. In short, the decreases in V1 activity we saw in our main dataset are not likely to be explained by differential patterns of eye movements. (Likewise, the distinction we saw between running-correlated modulations in foveal versus peripheral V1 is unlikely attributable to eye movements, as we recorded simultaneously from both parts of the retinotopic map, meaning that the eye movements were the same despite the difference in modulations). Regrettably, the mouse dataset with which we compared our marmoset recordings did not reliably have eye video with quality required to do precise gaze estimation (at least for many of the sessions), so we could not perform a definitive analysis in mouse. However, the degree to which movement-correlated modulations of sensory processing contain a retinal contribution is an important issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], and one that we hope to tackle more directly in future cross-species studies wherein eyetracking and knowledge of individual receptive fields is highly, and equally, prioritized in mice and marmosets.</p>

</fig>
<p>We also analyzed the pupil size from our eyetracking videos. Pupil size was ~8% larger during running. This finding is consistent with the idea that the marmosets were in a higher arousal state during running. Such a result is at least loosely consistent with effects seen in mice (although in that literature, there is some degree of dissociation between modulations due to arousal and those due to running per se [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]). Thus, the changes in pupil size we detected do suggest that when a marmoset runs, it is likely in a higher arousal state, similar to that in mice. However, more work would be required to perform cross-species calibrations to understand how the magnitude of changes in pupil size corresponds to changes in levels of arousal. At this point, we can conclude that the differences we see in the size (and sometimes, sign) of V1 modulations across species are unlikely due to a categorical difference in a link between running and arousal in mice versus marmosets, but possible quantitative distinctions deserve further consideration.</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In short, running does not affect V1 activity in marmosets like it does in mouse. The large, typically positive correlations between running and V1 activity often found in mice are simply not evident in marmosets. Although we matched our experimental protocol to mouse experiments and used the same metrics and analysis pipeline, the difference in results across species was stark. We hypothesize that this distinction holds at the level of taxonomic order, distinguishing how much behavioral state interacts with early stages of visual processing in primates versus rodents.</p>
<p>Diving deeper into the pattern of results, we did detect small (but statistically nonzero) modulations of marmoset V1 response correlated with running. In the foveal representation in V1– where we made the majority of our recordings– responses on average were slightly smaller during running; In the peripheral representation, responses were slightly larger. Despite the main result of this study being that running-correlated modulations in marmoset V1 are small, and hence quantitatively different than that in mouse V1, our population-level analyses did point towards a possible cross-species generalization. The same shared-gain model improved accounts of both mouse and marmoset V1 activity. These population-level gain modulations likely reflect modulatory inputs associated with behavioral state and arousal. This commonality connects with mechanistic knowledge of how V1 activity is modulated. The primate-rodent difference in the magnitude and sign of V1 gain modulations we observed is in fact consistent with known differences in neuromodulatory inputs related to arousal in rodent and primate V1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. In primates, the locations of ACh receptors allow cholinergic inputs to increase the activity of the majority of GABAergic neurons and hence suppress net activity via inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], but pharmacologically and anatomically distinct cholinergic influences in rodent likely exert more complex effects on net activity, including disinhibition which can increase net activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Our population-level analyses also lay groundwork for connections to indirect and aggregate measures of neural activity made in humans under related conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], as well as the typically small modulations seen in primate visual cortices elicited by carefully-controlled attentional tasks, which are more clear when population-level modulations are considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>].</p>
<p>We also performed an analysis of whether eye movements might contribute to differential visual (retinal) stimulation, which in turn could differentially modulate visually-driven activity in V1 during running versus stationary periods. We found that there were subtle increases in eye movement frequency and saccade amplitude during running. However, saccades on average slightly increased V1 activity, so it seems unlikely that eye-movement mediated changes in retinal stimulation explain the modest decreases we observed during running. We found that analysis of eye movements was difficult in some of the mouse datasets. Because receptive fields in mouse V1 can be very large, uncontrolled (and/or uncharacterized) eye movements can not only create visual modulations of the stimulus on the screen, but can also hit the edges of the monitor under some viewing conditions. A related study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] found that eye movements (or, their effects on retinal stimulation) explained all of the modulations of V1 activity that were correlated with facial/body movements in seated macaques. Further work will be needed to understand how much eye movements play a role in both running-correlated and movement-correlated modulations in the mouse. This will require monitoring eye movements and dissecting the ensuing retinal effects from those of other (body and face) movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]; all of these types of motor activity (and subsequent “sensory reafference”) may be partially correlated.</p>
<p>Our results (as well as those of Talluri et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]) reveal a number of additional issues that should be addressed in follow-up work to even more tightly relate work across the two species. In our study, we attempted to match the overall treadmill apparatus and the visual stimuli used in the mouse studies. Even that required species-specific customization of the treadmill, as well as taking into account the higher spatial acuity of primate vision (which is why our study used much higher spatial frequencies in our set of drifting gratings). We describe how additional unresolved issues could be addressed for improved cross-species integration.</p>
<p>First, we analyzed pupil size and found that it was larger when the marmosets ran. At first glance, this suggests that running does indicate a more aroused internal state in the marmosets, as it likely does in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. However, it is less clear whether the magnitude of pupil size changes in marmosets corresponds to the same amount of arousal change that occurs in mice. Relative calibration of the dynamic range of pupil size (and measuring other biomarkers of arousal) may make for more satisfying inferences about internal states across species, as it has been shown that some (but not all) of running-correlated modulations are likely due to arousal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].</p>
<p>Second, although we found only small effects (relative to mouse) at the aggregate level, our results call for more specific investigations of modulations at the level of cell types and subcircuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Such investigations may reveal more nuanced effects in primate V1, using tools that can better unpack the circuitry associated with factors such as cholinergic modulation, which are known to differ in important ways across rodent and monkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Additionally, differences in feedback circuits also exist across the visual field representation within primate V1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. This– and the proposition that mouse V1 may be a better model of primate peripheral vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] – have motivated us to perform more systematic and larger-scale recordings to compare the foveal and peripheral representations.</p>
<p>Third, our results call for additional study across other visual areas. In mice, the large effects on V1 activity are likely to affect all subsequent stages of processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], but in marmosets, the small effects are less likely to have pronounced downstream effects. That said, running may directly and more strongly interact with later stages of visual processing in primates. This would be consistent with differences in where canonical computations occur across species with different numbers of visual areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Such measurements in primate extrastriate visual areas are already in progress in our laboratory.</p>
<p>Finally, larger effects of behavioral state may still be found in primate V1: Other behaviors that more directly recruit active vision may reveal stronger modulations. In mice, running may have a more direct functional relation to visual processing. Marmosets may instead wish to recruit head or body movements that are not realizable in the head-fixed preparation that we used for eye-movement and neural recording. These questions will be addressed in freely-moving and head-free subjects.</p>
<p>Although our main result is simply that running-correlated modulations in marmoset V1 are small relative to those in mouse, we did find evidence for behaviorally-correlated population-level gain modulations in both species. This sort of commonality may support further cross-species generalizations that transcend simpler observations of empirical similarity or dissimilarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Further work explicating how shared basic mechanisms may ultimately result in rather different patterns of interaction between vision and action will be critical for linking our understanding of cortical function between currently-preferred model organisms and across taxonomic orders. The results in this report reflect just the starting point for a larger comparative inquiry.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>We performed electrophysiological recordings in V1 of two common marmosets (1 male, “marmoset G”, and 1 female, “marmoset B”, both aged 2 years). Both subjects had chronically implanted N-form arrays (Modular Bionics, Modular Bionics, Berkeley CA) inserted into left V1. Implantations were performed with standard surgical procedures for chronically-implanted arrays in primates. Additional recordings were also performed using Neuropixels 1.0 probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] acutely inserted into small craniotomies (procedure described below). All experimental protocols were approved by The University of Texas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in accordance with National Institute of Health standards for care and use of laboratory animals.</p>
<p>Subjects perched quadrupedally on a 12” diameter wheel while head-fixed facing a 24” LCD (BenQ) monitor (resolution = 1920x1080 pixels, refresh rate = 120 Hz) corrected to have a linear gamma function, at a distance of 36 cm (pixels per degree = 26.03) in a dark room. Eye position was recorded via an Eyelink 1000 eye tracker (SR Research) sampling at 1 kHz. A syringe pump-operated reward line was used to deliver liquid reward to the subject. Timing events were generated using a Datapixx I/O box (VPixx) for precise temporal registration. All of these systems were integrated in and controlled by MarmoView. Stimuli were generated using MarmoView, custom code based on the PLDAPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>] system using Psychophysics Toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] in MATLAB (Mathworks). For the electrophysiology data gathered from the N-Form arrays, neural responses were recorded using two Intan C3324 headstages attached to the array connectors which sent output to an Open Ephys acquisition board and GUI on a dedicated computer. In electrophysiology data gathered using Neuropixels probes, data was sent through Neuropixels headstages to a Neuropixels PXIe acquisition card within a PXIe chassis (National Instruments). The PXIe chassis sent outputs to a dedicated computer running Open Ephys with an Open Ephys acquisition board additionally attached to record timing events sent from the Datapixx I/O box. Spike sorting on data acquired using N-Form arrays was performed using in-house code to track and merge data from identified single units across multiple recording sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Spike sorting for data acquired using Neuropixels probes was performed using Kilosort 2.5.</p>

<title>Acute Neuropixels recordings</title>
<p>Acute Neuropixels recordings were performed using standard Neuropixels 1.0 electrodes (IMEC, Leuven, Belgium). Each probe consists of 384 recording channels that can individually be configured to record signals from 960 selectable sites along a 10 mm long, 70 x 24 µm cross-section straight shank. Probes were lowered into right dorsal V1 of marmoset G via one of 3 burr holes spaced irregularly along the AP axis 4-5 mm from the midline for a single session of experiments. Natural images were played to provide visual stimulus as well as occupy the subject and keep them awake during insertion and probe settling. The temporary seal on the burr hole was removed, the intact dura nicked with a thin needle and the burr hole filled with saline. The probe was then lowered through the dural slit at 500 µm/minute, allowing 5 minutes for settling every 1000 µm of total insertion. The whole-probe LFP visualization was monitored during insertion for the characteristic banding of increased LFP amplitude that characterizes cortical tissue. The probe was inserted until this banding was visible on the electrodes nearest the tip of the probe, indicating that the probe tip itself had passed through the dorsal cortex and was within the white matter. The probe was then advanced until a second band became visible on the electrodes nearest the tip, indicating the tip of the probe had exited through the cortex of the calcarine sulcus. The probe was then advanced slightly until the entirety of the second LFP band was visible to ensure that electrodes covered the full depth of the calcarine cortex and the tip of the probe was located confidently within the CSF of the sulcus. The probe was then allowed to settle for 10 minutes. Active electrode sites on the probe were configured to subtend both dorsal and calcarine cortex simultaneously. Post-hoc receptive field recreation confirmed that visually-driven, tuned, V1 neurons were recorded at both foveal and peripheral eccentricities.</p>

<title>General experimental procedure</title>
<p>Marmoset recording sessions began with eye tracking calibration. Once calibration was completed, the wheel was unlocked and the subject was allowed to locomote freely, head-fixed, while free-viewing stimuli. Trials for all stimuli were 20 sec long with a 500 ms ITI and a 20 sec long natural image interleaved every fifth trial to keep the subject engaged. Stimuli were shown in blocks of 10 minutes and a typical recording session consisted of 50 trials of calibration followed by 1 or 2 blocks of a drifting grating stimulus and 1 block each of the two mapping stimuli. To elicit sufficiently reliable and frequent running behavior, subjects were rewarded at set locomotion distance intervals unrelated to the stimulus or gaze behavior (typical rewards were 50-70 µL and distance required to achieve a reward usually varied between 20-75 cm; reward amounts and intervals were adjusted daily to maximally motivate the subject.)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Eye tracking calibration</title>
<p>While the wheel was locked, subjects were allowed to free-view a sequence of patterns of marmoset faces. Marmosets naturally direct their gaze towards the faces of other marmosets when allowed to free-view with little-to-no training, allowing for the experimenter to adjust the calibration offset and gain manually between pattern presentations. Faces were 1.5 degrees in diameter and were presented for 3 sec with a 2 sec ISI between patterns. A portion of presented patterns were asymmetrical across both the X and Y axes of the screen to allow for disambiguation in the case of axis sign flips in the calibration. 50 trials were presented before each recording session to verify and refine the calibration. Calibration drift between sessions was minimal, requiring minor (&lt;1 deg) adjustments over the course of 1-2 months of recordings.</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>Drifting grating stimuli</title>
<p>The primary stimulus consisted of full-field drifting gratings. Gratings were optimized to drive marmoset V1 with 3 separate spatial frequencies (1, 2, and 4 cycles per degree), two drift speeds (1 or 2 degrees per second) and 12 orientations (evenly-spaced 30 degree intervals). Each trial consisted of multiple grating presentations, each with a randomized spatial frequency, drift speed, and orientation. Gratings were displayed for 833 ms followed by a 249-415 ms randomly jittered inter-stimulus interval. After each 20 second trial there was a longer 500 ms inter-trial interval. Every fifth trial was replaced with a natural image to keep subjects engaged and allow for visual assessment of calibration stability on the experimenter’s display.</p>

<sec id="s4g">
<title>Mapping of receptive fields</title>
<p>A spatiotemporal receptive field mapping stimulus, consisting of sparse dot noise, was shown during each recording session. One hundred 1 degree white and black dots were presented at 50% contrast at random points on the screen. Dots had a lifetime of 2 frames (16.666 ms). Marmosets freely viewed the stimulus and we corrected for eye position offline to estimate the spatial receptive fields using forward correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>

<title>Necessary differences between mouse and marmoset experiments</title>
<p>Although we sought to perform experiments in marmosets that were as similar as possible to mouse experiments, some differences in their visual systems and behavior made for differences. Because the spatial frequency tunings of marmoset and mouse V1 neurons are starkly different, we used stimuli with considerably higher spatial frequencies than in the mouse experiments. Relatedly, marmoset V1 receptive fields are much smaller than in mouse. Because we used full-field stimuli (to match mouse experiments), responses in marmoset V1 were likely affected by substantial amounts of surround suppression, which would reduce overall responses. We also learned that, although the marmosets were comfortable perched on the wheel treadmill, they did not naturally run enough for our experimental purposes. We therefore incorporated a reward scheme to motivate the subjects to run more frequently. Finally, the mouse dataset we analyzed comprised a large number of mice with a small number of sessions per mouse; as is required of work with nonhuman primates, we were limited to a smaller number of subjects (N=2), and ran many experimental sessions with each animal.</p>

<title>Session and cell inclusion criteria</title>
<p>For the analyses shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, sessions were included if they contained more than 250 trials and a proportion of trials running was not less than 10% or greater than 90%.

<p>We counted spikes between the 50ms after grating onset and 50ms after grating offset and divided by the interval to generate a trial spike rate. To calculate orientation tuning curves, we computed the mean firing rate each orientation and spatial frequency. Because we were limited by the animal’s behavior to determine the number of trials in each condition (i.e., running or not), we computed orientation tuning as a weighted average across spatial frequencies with with weights set by the spatial frequency tuning. We used these resulting curves for the all analyses of tuning. We confirmed that the results did not change qualitatively if we either used only the best spatial frequency or marginalized across spatial frequency.</p>
<p>Orientation selectivity index was calculated using the following equation
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="495712v4_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>θ</italic> is the orientation and <italic>r</italic> is the baseline-subtracted vector of rates across orientations.</p>

<title>Analysis of eye movement effects on neural response</title>
<p>To assess whether and how eye movements might differ between running and stationary periods (and perhaps account for some or all of the running-correlated modulations of V1 response), we started by counting the number of saccades within a bin corresponding to each stimulus presentation (from 0.2 sec before stimulus onset to 0.1 after offset), as well as calculating the average saccade size (vector magnitude) of those saccades. We then regressed these terms against the spike count in each bin, allowing us to estimate the effect of eye movements in units of spike rate (Hz). (We also analyzed the variance of the eye position signal and got similar results). For the analysis of pupil size, we used the values returned by our Eyelink eyetracker, averaged in the same bins as for the saccade analyses.</p>

<title>Shared modulator model</title>
<p>To capture shared modulator signals in an unsupervised manner, we fit our neural populations with a latent variable model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. The goal of our latent variable model was to summarize population activity with low-dimensional shared signal that operates as a gain on the stimulus processing (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]). In this model, the response of an individual neuron, <bold>r</bold><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> on trial <italic>t</italic> is given by:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="495712v4_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where the stimulus response <italic>f<sub>i</sub></italic>[<italic>s</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)] is given by the tuning curve, <italic>g<sub>i</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is a neuron-specific gain on the stimulus response, and <italic>b<sub>i</sub></italic> is the baseline firing rate. Similar models have been employed to describe the population response in V1 in several species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p>
    <p>Because the gain signal is shared across neurons, we fit this model to all <italic>n</italic> neurons in a given recording at the same time. To capture the stimulus tuning curves, we represented the stimulus on each trial <italic>s</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) as an <italic>m-</italic>dimensional “one-hot” vector, where <italic>m</italic> is the number of possible conditions (Orientation × Spatial Frequency) and on each trial all elements are zero, except for the condition shown. Thus, <italic>f</italic> [<italic>s</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)] becomes a linear projection of the stimulus on the tuning curves, A<italic>s</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), where A is an <italic>n × m</italic> matrix of tuning weights.</p>
<p>We decomposed the gain for each neuron on each trial into a rank 1 matrix that was rectified and offset by one, <italic>g</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = ReLU[1 + z(t)w], where <italic>w</italic> is an <italic>n-</italic>dimensional vector of loadings that map the 1-dimensional trial latent <italic>z</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) to a population-level signal, <italic>z</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)<bold>w</bold>. This signal is offset by 1 and rectified such that it is always positive and a loading weight of zero equals a gain of 1.0.</p>
<p>To capture any unit-specific slow drifts in firing rate, we further parameterized <bold>b</bold> as a linear combination of five b0-splines evenly spaced across the experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Thus, the baseline firing rate for each neuron, <italic>i</italic>, was a linear combination of five “tent” basis functions spaced evenly across the experiment, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="495712v4_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula></p>
<p>Thus, the full model describes the population response as
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="495712v4_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The parameters of the model are the stimulus tuning parameters <bold>A</bold>, the shared gain, <italic>z</italic>, the gain loadings,</p>
<p><bold>w</bold>, and the “tent” basis weights, <italic>b<sub>i,j</sub></italic>’s.</p>
<p>We first fit a baseline model with only stimulus and baseline parameters
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="495712v4_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Following Whiteway and Butts (2017), we initialized <bold>A</bold> and <bold>b</bold> using fits from a model without latent variables and initialized the latent variable, <italic>z</italic>, and loadings, <bold>w</bold>, using an Autoencoder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. We then fit the gain, loadings, and stimulus parameters using iterative optimization with L-BFGS, by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the observed spikes and the model rates. The model parameters were regularized with a modest amount of L2-penalty and the amount was set using cross-validation on the training set. The latent variables were penalized with a small squared derivative penalty to impose some smoothness across trials. This was set to be small and the same value across all sessions. We reverted the model to the autoencoder initialization if the MSE on a validation set did not improve during fitting.</p>
<p>We cross-validated the model using a speckled holdout pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] whereby some fraction of neurons were withheld on each trial with probability <italic>p</italic>=0.25. We further divided the withheld data into a validation set and a test set by randomly assigning units to either group on each trial with probability 0.5. The validation loss was used to stop the optimization during the iterative fitting and the test set was used to evaluate the models.</p>

<p>More than ten years ago, it was shown that activity in the primary visual cortex of mice substantially increases when mice are running compared to when they are sitting still. This finding 'revolutionised' our thinking about visual cortex, turning away from it being a passive image processor and highlighting the influence of non-visual factors. The current study now for the first time repeats this experiment in marmosets. The authors find that in contrast to mice, marmoset V1 activity is slightly suppressed during running, and they relate this to differences in gain modulations of V1 activity between the two species.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>- Replication in primates of the original finding in mice partly took so long, because of the inherent difficulties with recording from the brain of a running primate. In fact one recent, highly related study on macaques looked at spontaneous limb movements as the macaque was sitting. The treadmill for the marmosets in the current study is a very elegant solution to the problem of running in primates. It allows for true replication of the 'running vs stationary' experiment and undoubtedly opens up many possibilities for other experiments recording from a head-fixed but active marmoset.</p>
<p>
- In addition to their own data in marmoset, the authors run their analyses on a publicly available data set in mouse. This allows them to directly compare mouse and marmoset findings, which significantly strengthens their conclusions.</p>
<p>
- Marmoset vision is fundamentally different from mouse vision as they have a fovea and make goal-directed eye movements. In this revised version of their paper, the authors acknowledge this and investigate the possible effect of eye movements and pupil size on the differences they find between running and stationary. They conclude that eye input does not explain all these differences.</p>
<p>Significance</p>
<p>The paper provides interesting new evidence to the ongoing discussion about the influence of non-visual factors in general, and running in particular, on visual cortex activity. As such, it helps to pull this discussion out of the rodent field mainly and into the field of primate research. The bigger question of *why* there are differences between rodents and primates remains still unanswered, but the authors do their best to provide possible explanations. The elegant experimental set-up of the marmoset on a treadmill will certainly add new findings to this issue also in the years to come.</p>

<p>This work aims at answering whether activity in primate visual cortex is modulated by locomotion, as was reported for mouse visual cortex. The finding that the activity in mouse visual cortex is modulated by running has changed the concept of primary sensory cortical areas. However, it was an open question whether this modulation generalizes to primates.</p>
<p>To answer this fundamental question the authors established a novel paradigm in which a head-fixed marmoset was able to run on a treadmill while watching a visual stimulus on a display. In addition, eye movements and running speed were monitored continuously and extracellular neuronal activity in primary visual cortex recorded using high-channel-count electrode arrays. This paradigm uniquely permitted to investigate whether locomotion modulates sensory evoked activity in visual cortex of marmoset. Moreover, to directly compare the responses in marmoset visual cortex to responses in mouse visual cortex the authors made use of a publicly-available mouse dataset from the Allen Institute. In this dataset the mouse was also running on a treadmill and observing a set of visual stimuli on a display. The authors took extra care to have the marmoset and mouse paradigms as comparable as possible.</p>
<p>To characterize the visually driven activity the authors present a series of moving gratings and estimate receptive fields with sparse noise. To estimate the gain modulation by running the authors split the dataset into epochs of running and non-running which allowed them to estimate the visually evoked firing rates in both behavioral states.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The novel paradigm of head-fixed marmosets running on a treadmill while being presented with a visual stimulus is unique and ideally tailored to answering the question that the authors aimed to answer. Moreover, the authors took extra care to ensure that the paradigm in marmoset matched as closely as possible to the conditions in the mouse experiments such that the results can be directly compared. To directly compare their data the authors re-analyzed publicly available data from visual cortex of mice recorded at the Allen Institute. Such a direct comparison, and reuse of existing datasets, is another strong aspect of the work. Finally, the presented new marmoset dataset appears to be of high quality, the comparison between mouse and marmoset visual cortex is well done and the results and interpretation straightforward.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is known that the locomotion gain modulation varies with layer in mouse visual cortex, with neurons in the infragranular layers expressing a diversity of modulations (Erisken et al. 2014 Current Biology). However, for the marmoset dataset the layer information was unfortunately not recorded, leaving this point open for future studies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the aim of comparing the locomotion induced modulation of activity in primate and mouse primary visual cortex was convincingly achieved by the authors. The results shown in the figures support the conclusion that locomotion modulates the activity in primate and mouse visual cortex differently. While mice show a profound gain increase, neurons in primate visual cortex show little modulation or even a reduction in response strength.</p>
<p>This work will have a strong impact on the field of visual neuroscience but also on neuroscience in general. It revives the debate of whether results obtained in the mouse model system can be simply generalized to other mammalian model systems, such as non-human primates. Based on the presented results, the comparison between the mouse and primate visual cortex is not as straightforward as previously assumed. This will likely trigger more comparative studies between mice and primates in the future, which is important and absolutely needed to advance our understanding of the mammalian brain.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reported finding that neurons in primary visual cortex of marmosets do not increase their activity during running is intriguing, as it makes you wonder why neurons in the mouse visual cortex do so. The authors discuss a few ideas in the paper which can be addressed in future experiments. In this regard it is worth noting that the authors report an interesting difference between the foveal and peripheral part of the visual cortex in marmoset. It will be interesting to investigate these differences in more detail in future studies. Likewise, while running might be an important behavioral state for mice, other behavioral states might be more relevant for marmosets and do modulate the activity of primate visual cortex more profoundly. Future work could leverage the opportunities that the marmoset model system offers to reveal new insights about behavioral related modulation in the primate brain.</p>

<p>Prior studies have shown that locomotion (e.g., running) modulates mouse V1 activity to a similar extent as visual stimuli. However, it's unclear if these findings hold in species with more specialized and advanced visual systems such as nonhuman primates. In this work, Liska et al. leverage population and single neuron analyses to investigate potential differences and similarities in how running modulates V1 activity in marmosets and mice. Specifically, they discovered that although a shared gain model could describe well the trial-to-trial variations of population-level neural activity for both species, locomotion more strongly modulated V1 population activity in mice. Furthermore, they found that at the level of individual units, marmoset V1 neurons, unlike mice V1 neurons, experience suppression of their activity during running.</p>
<p>A major strength of this work is the introduction and completion of primate electrophysiology recordings during locomotion. Data of this kind were previously limited, and this work moves the field forward in terms of data collection in a domain previously inaccessible in primates. Another core strength of this work is that it adds to a limited collection of cross-species data collection and analysis of neural activity at the single-unit and population level, attempting to standardize analysis and data collection to be able to make inferences across species. In particular, the findings on how the primate peripheral and foveal V1 representations functionally relate to and differ from the mice V1 representations speak to the power of these cross-species comparisons.</p>
<p>However, there are still some lingering potential extensions to this work, largely acknowledged by the authors. One of these extensions involves more detailed eye movement analysis within species, such as microsaccades in marmosets and the potential impact on marmoset V1 activity. In the mouse data, similar eye-related analyses were not possible, in part due to instability in the eye recordings of many mouse sessions that made it challenging to replicate partnered analyses for the marmosets. We agree with the authors' assessment that these analyses can be targeted in future work and still believe that the marmoset eye-movement findings provide novel insights that will inform future cross-species comparisons of the visual system. Furthermore, another important issue not fully explored is the possible effects of the reward scheme during marmoset locomotion on V1 activity. The authors note that, unlike their mice counterparts, the marmosets were encouraged to run via liquid rewards, given after subjects traversed a specific distance. While the authors discuss the changes in arousal present when marmosets were running, there are still some unanswered questions on how their reward scheme may affect biomarkers (e.g., pupil sizes) and marmoset V1 activity.</p>
<p>Overall, the methods and data support the work's main claims. Single neuron and population level approaches demonstrate that the activity of V1 in mice and marmoset are categorically different. Since primate V1 is so diverse and differs from mouse V1, this presents important limitations on direct inferences from mouse V1 to primate V1. This work is a great step forward in the field, especially with the novel methodology of collecting neural activity from running primates.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 1</bold> <bold>(Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>“but an obvious influencing factor that the authors could investigate in their own data set is the retinal input. In Fig1b, the authors even show these data in the form of gaze and pupil size. In these example data, by eye, it looks like the pupil size is positively correlated with the run speed. This would of course have large consequences on the activity in V1, but the authors do not do anything with these data. The study would improve substantially if the authors would correlate their run speed traces with other factors that they have recorded too, such as pupil size and gaze.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Absolutely. We have added a first level of eye movement (and pupil size) analyses to the revised manuscript, resulting in an additional figure. In short, we found that eye movements are unlikely to play a significant role in our primary results, as the patterns of eye movements differed only slightly between running and stationary periods, and the measured impacts of such eye movements were also quantitatively much smaller than the primary effect sizes.</p>
<p>We also note that in analyzing the eye movements, we also found that pupil size was larger during running than stationary. This is suggestive evidence that running is correlated with increases in arousal. Although more work will be needed to calibrate and quantify how much this factor affects neural responses (and perhaps to dissociate it from running per se), the simple analysis we present suggest that the large differences we observe could be explained by a difference between how arousal and running are correlated in the monkey versus the mouse. Instead, it appears that both species have at least qualitatively similar relations between pupil size (a standard proxy for arousal) and running.</p>
<p>On this issue, we have added extensive discussion of the relevant recent work by Talluri et al. (2023) who attempted a similar cross-species analysis that considered spontaneous body movements and their effect on cortical activity (as well as the possibility that eye movements are a critical mediator in these modulations). Due to delays in revising our manuscript, we regret that our earlier submission had not cited this work, but we now do our best to highlight its importance and the synergy between these two papers. The full citation is listed below:</p>
<p>Talluri BC, Kang I, Lazere A, Quinn KR, Kaliss N, Yates JL, Butts DA, Nienborg H. Activity in primate visual cortex is minimally driven by spontaneous movements. Nat Neurosci. 2023 Nov;26(11):1953-1959. doi: 10.1038/s41593-023-01459-5.</p>
<p>There is a finer level of analysis that we hope to do in the future along these lines. It would rely on detailed characterization of each receptive field, building an image-computable model linking those receptive fields to the neural activity, and doing so at a finer time grain that links individual eye movements and changes in the spike train within a stimulus presentation (as opposed to working at the level of spike counts per stimulus presentation). Because these steps need to be accomplished together— and each requires substantial additional work and would go beyond the first-order findings we report in this work— we hope to report on such finer analyses in a standalone paper later. We are working on being able to do this in both marmoset and mouse.</p>
<p>More generally, we want to emphatically agree that what is missing from this paper is the “why?”! We have done our best to show that a fair comparison reveals quantitatively different phenomena in marmoset and mouse. In the revised discussion, we lay out many lines of work that we hope will gain traction on this deeper mechanistic point. There’s a lot to do, and several of the possibilities are already current topics of exploration in our ongoing work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“Looking at the raster plot, however, shows that this strong positive correlation must be due entirely to the lower half of the neurons significantly increasing their firing rate as the mouse starts to run; in fact, the upper 25% or so of the neurons show exactly the opposite (strong suppression of the neurons as the mouse starts running). It would be more balanced if this heterogeneity in the response is at least mentioned somewhere in the text.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are also intrigued by the heterogeneity of effects at the single neuron level. That is why the next section of the paper is dedicated to analyzing effects on a cell-by-cell basis. The fractions of neurons showing either increases or decreases are described separately, to get at this very issue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Public Review)::</bold></p>
<p>“For example, it is known that the locomotion gain modulation varies with layer in the mouse visual cortex, with neurons in the infragranular layers expressing a diversity of modulations (Erisken et al. 2014 Current Biology). However, for the marmoset dataset, it was not reported from which cortical layer the neurons are from, leaving this point unanswered.”</p>
<p>Reviewer 2 called for more consideration of details that have been addressed in the mouse literature, such as the cortical layer of the cells, and related aspects of circuitry. We have greatly re-worked the Discussion to address several of these issues. In short, the manuscript’s set of data were collected without strong traction on layers or cell types, and it will be quite interesting to get a better handle on this using both refinements to our recording procedures as well as new techniques that are now possible in the marmoset for future studies.</p>
<p>“In this regard, it is worth noting that the authors report an interesting difference between the foveal and peripheral parts of the visual cortex in marmoset. It will be interesting to investigate these differences in more detail in future studies. Likewise, while running might be an important behavioral state for mice, other behavioral states might be more relevant for marmosets and do modulate the activity of the primate visual cortex more profoundly. Future work could leverage the opportunities that the marmoset model system offers to reveal new insights about behavioral-related modulation in the primate brain.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Same page! We have expanded the discussion to better emphasize these points and are already deep in follow up experiments to explore the foveal and peripheral representations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 3</bold> <bold>(Public Review):****:</bold></p>
<p>“However, the authors did not take full advantage of the quantity and diversity of the marmoset visual cortex recordings in their analyses. They mention recording and analyzing the activity of peripheral V1 neurons but mainly present results involving foveal V1 neurons. Foveal neurons, with their small receptive fields strongly affected by precise eye position, would seem to be less likely to be comparable to rodent data. If the authors have a reason for not doing so, they should provide an explanation.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree, and hope the reviewer finds our overall reply, detailed response to Reviewer 1 (who raised a similar issue), and corresponding updates to the manuscript appropriate for this stage of understanding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“Given that the marmosets are motivated to run with liquid rewards, the authors should provide more context as to how this may or may not affect marmoset V1 activity. Additionally, the lack of consideration of eye movements or position presents a major absence for the marmoset results, and fails to take advantage of one of the key differences between primate and rodent visual systems - the marmosets have a fovea, and make eye movements that fixate in various locations on the screen during the task.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In addition to the response above, we have made edits to the manuscript to speak to issues of arousal and eye movements (also detailed in previous responses). Given the modest decrease in activity we see, the usual concerns about potential increases in neural activity related to eye movements (which we quantify in the revision) and other issues related to motivation are hard to specifically relate to existing literature. But in the revised Discussion we talk more about how future work can/should dissociate these factors, as has been done in the mouse literature.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“Finally, the model provides a strong basis for comparison at the level of neuronal populations, but some methodological choices are insufficiently described and may have an impact on interpreting the claims.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have also clarified the shared-gain model’s description, which we agree needed additional detail and clarification.</p>
