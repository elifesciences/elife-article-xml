<title>Abstract</title><p>Host-microbe interactions are virtually bidirectional, but how the host affects their microbiome is poorly understood. Here, we report that the host is a critical modulator to regulate the lifestyle switch and pathogenicity heterogeneity of the opportunistic pathogens <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> utilizing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and bacterium model system. First, we find that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae efficiently outcompete <italic>S. marcescens</italic> and typically drive a bacterial switch from pathogenicity to commensalism toward the fly. Furthermore, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae reshape the transcriptomic and metabolic profiles of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> characterized by a lifestyle switch. More important, the host alters pathogenicity and heterogeneity of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in the single-cell resolution. Finally, we find that larvae-derived AMPs are required to recapitulate the response of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> to larvae. Altogether, our findings provide an insight into the pivotal roles of the host in harnessing the life history and heterogeneity of symbiotic bacterial cells, advancing knowledge of the reciprocal relationships between the host and pathogen.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All metazoans ranging from insects to humans harbor a plethora of microbes referred to as the microbiome. The microbiome plays a pivotal role in host physiology and pathophysiology, with some species conferring benefits to the host and others causing damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Delannoy-Bruno et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lynch and Hsiao, 2019</xref>; Morais et al., 2021). Over the past decades, tremendous effort, including ours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), has been devoted to understanding the impact of microbial strains or more complex communities on their hosts. In fact, interactions between the host and microbiome are mutually bidirectional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Backhed et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>), conferring benefits to the host and microbial sides. Nevertheless, the knowledge of the effect of the host on the resident microbial community is still in its infancy. Studies reveal that hosts play a crucial role in shaping the assembly and composition of their unique microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Muegge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Olm et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Valeri and Endres, 2021</xref>). However, environmental fluctuations frequently happen at much shorter time scales that preclude bacterial adaptation by genetic mutation or species displacement. To cope with these situations, microbial communities have developed sophisticated transcriptional reprogramming to globally regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Avraham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Becattini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Prescott and Decho, 2020</xref>). Pathobionts routinely sense and specialize on host-derived substrates, execute context-dependent transitions from harmful to commensal states and generate the host-association continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barak-Gavish et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Proctor et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Somvanshi et al., 2012</xref>). In this regard, the molecular mechanism by which the host restrictively controls gene transcription and metabolism of their microbiome remains much undefined.</p>
<p>Microbial populations frequently aggregate in several dozen micrometres and stochastically undergo specific differentiation into subpopulations with strikingly distinct properties, employing a strategy known as bet-hedging to survive rapid changes in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Eldar and Elowitz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008</xref>). As such, bacteria manifest heterogeneous transcriptional profiles, leading to phenotypic heterogeneity among individual bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gasch et al., 2017</xref>). Traditionally, gene expression of bacterial cells has been investigated in bulk or on a population level by mixing and averaging mRNA simultaneously from sorts of cells. Single-cell transcriptomics is revolutionizing the analysis of phenotypic cell- to-cell variation in eukaryotes, enabling us to explore the heterogeneity heretofore hidden within population behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Klein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mancio-Silva et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Perez et al., 2022</xref>). Recently, droplet-based high-throughput bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing methods have been developed and applied to study antibiotic-associated heterogeneous cellular states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). We took advantage of this approach to tackle the challenge that the host induces transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of target bacteria during the interaction, contributing to a full appreciation of the phenotypic heterogeneity within microbiome.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> has a relatively simple bacterial community of commensal and opportunistic pathogens, typically predominated by 5 to 20 bacterial species. All <italic>Drosophila</italic> microbes are facultative bacteria that alternate between free-living and host-associated lifestyles. <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen and generates a pink pigment prodigiosin that is characteristically oscillatory to metabolic activities, making it a visible bioindicator of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> metabolism. In this regard, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has provided a promising model to study symbiosis, dysbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chandler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kim et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether and/or how the host modulates bacterial lifestyles, we used a reductionist approach in which germ-free (GF) <italic>Drosophila</italic> was re-associated with <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kuraishi et al., 2011</xref>). We found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae sufficiently outcompeted <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, and resulted in shifts in the transcriptomic and metabolomic profile in bulk and single-cell resolution, providing a robust paradigm to further study the host-microbe interaction with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model.</p>

<title><italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae alter surface topography and population size of microbes</title>
<p>All <italic>Drosophila</italic> microbes are facultative bacteria that alternate between free-living and host- associated lifestyles. Free-living bacteria initially form small microcolonies extending from the substratum, continue to expand, coalesce, and eventually generate a surface slick (a biofilm-like cell mat) that is visible to the naked eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Koo and Yamada, 2016</xref>). Fascinatingly, the topography of surface slick was typically altered by fly colonization. The surface slick associated with strong wild-type flies was corn-like yellow, and the mature layer of the bacterial community was completely broken (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The destruction process was further exacerbated by overcrowded larvae that liquefied the upper food layer, leading to a yellow aqueous layer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). However, it was grey and partially segmented by weak flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), and even pale and intact associated with infertile flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> plays a critical role in altering the topography of bacterial community on <italic>Drosophila</italic> media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deines et al., 2020</xref>). Our data showed that the cultivable bacterial loads associated with weak or infertile flies were dramatically higher than those of strong stocks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that the host diminishes the bacterial load of the shared niche.</p>

<p>Given that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and adults coexist in the bottles, we sought to determine which were directly responsible for these alterations. Similarly, bacteria loads were substantially higher in the medium associated with males and virgin females (without progenies) than in the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that larvae mainly cause a decline in bacterial population size. Consistently, the 50-day-aged flies that deposited few eggs mimicked weak flies with grey surface slick and a decline in bacterial loads. Moreover, transplanted larvae directly caused a dose-dependent decline in the overall bacterial loads in the habitat (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). These findings demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae play a critical role in outcompeting their symbionts in the shared habitat.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title><italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae antagonize <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in the niche</title>
<p>To experimentally characterize the impact of the host on the symbiont, we applied a reductionist approach in which <italic>Drosophila</italic> mono-associated with <italic>S. marcescens</italic> was generated as depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. Crawling larvae (∼96 h post oviposition) were concurrently transferred to fly food vials with 10<sup>7</sup> CFU bacterial load. We found that <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone formed a pink surface slick in the medium over time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, top). The color intensity of surface slicks was initially accumulated, peaked at 24 h timepoint post-inoculation, but gradually faded thereafter. We quantified the optical density of prodigiosin inside surface slicks with the spectrophotometer as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kalivoda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pan et al., 2020</xref>). The time-course amount of prodigiosin was congruent with the color density visible to the naked eye above (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Compared to <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone, the color intensity of surface slicks was significantly dampened by larval transplantations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom). As expected, the amount of prodigiosin of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in co-culture substantially declined compared with that of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone. Next, we examined bacterial titers in the food at regular intervals. Our result showed that single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> grew more rapidly than coexisting <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, and the population of single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> reached the plateau value within 1 d (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that the niche possesses a finite carrying capacity of bacteria. However, the population of coexisting <italic>S. marcescens</italic> reached the plateau value within 2 d. Moreover, the number of CFUs was predominantly suppressed by larva transplantation at the initial phases of colonization (within 72 h post-inoculation) compared to that of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with the result that larvae thwarted the number of total mixed bacteria in the diet (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Noteworthily, the growth of single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> was comparable (at 96 h post-inoculation) or even lower (at 120 h post-inoculation) than corresponding <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in co-culture, likely that single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> rapidly exhausted their nutritional resources and underwent ecological suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ratzke et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest that the larva acts as a potential competitor that efficiently prevents the overgrowth of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in the habitat before 72 h post-inoculation. To verify it, different numbers of larvae were added to vials inoculated with <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. Indeed, the more were larvae, the less the colour intensity of the surface slick (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1A, B). In addition, the population size of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in food was in restricted control by larvae in a dosage-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1C). Altogether, the cumulating results suggested that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva has a competitive advantage in the habitat, and acts as a critical regulator of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae modulate the pathogen-to-commensal transition of <italic>S. marcescens</italic></title>
<p><italic>S. marcescens</italic> is a <italic>Drosophila</italic> pathobiont with the potential to switch between commensalism and pathogenicity toward the host. To this end, we sought to examine the <italic>S. marcescens</italic> lifestyle switch from pathogenicity to commensalism by assessing the respective survival of flies on the fly medium that had been processed by single or coexisting <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. Our data showed that flies challenged with <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone manifested higher mortality than flies with <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in co-culture (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that larva antagonizes the pathogenicity of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. In addition, the expression of virulent factors was thwarted by larvae (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). However, <italic>S. marcescens</italic> more efficiently sustained optimal larval development upon nutrient scarcity than both axenicity and commensal <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Matos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Storelli et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1D), indicating that larvae-associated <italic>S. marcescens</italic> could impart fitness benefits to their hosts. To rule out the possibility that phenotypic alterations could stem from genomic mutations, we examined the prodigiosin yield and CFUs of re- culturing <italic>S. marcescens</italic> that had coexisted with larvae. Our results showed that neither prodigiosin yield nor CFUs of re-culturing <italic>S. marcescens</italic> differed from the original strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 3A-C), suggesting that a phenotypic switch was driven primarily by transcriptional reprogramming. The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is composed of a single layer of peptidoglycan surrounded by a membranous structure, which may function as a virulence factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pan et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, transmission electron microscopy confirmed a significant reduction in the width of the cell wall of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in co-culture compared to that of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Additionally, we observed that the expression of genes related to cell wall biosynthesis was dampened by larva transplantation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae modulate <italic>S. marcescens</italic> lifestyle from pathogenicity to commensalism toward the host.</p>
<p>Presumably, surface slicks can be destroyed by mechanical force from larva crawling and burrowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dufrene and Persat, 2020</xref>). To tackle this issue, we agitated fly food to imitate larva locomotion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 2A). Indeed, agitation decreased colour intensity, prodigiosin yield and population size in fly food (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 2B-D), implying that mechanical force accounts for the negative regulation of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. However, larval transplantation resulted in a much more robust decline in colour intensity of surface slicks, prodigiosin yield and population size than agitation alone. Of note, the surface of the slick with agitation appeared lighter than that of larvae, possibly due to a stratification of prodigiosin following agitation. In addition, the expression of prodigiosin synthesis genes was thwarted by the agitation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 2E). These results indicated that larva-derived biofactors and/or synergism of force and biofactors primarily confer the inhibition of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (see the later results).</p>

<title><italic>Drosophila</italic> enforces bacterial global transcriptional and metabolic adaptation to the host</title>
<p>In order to understand the molecular basis for the bacterial lifestyle switch from pathogenicity to commensalism in response to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, bulk RNA-seq analysis was applied to bacterial cells 24 h after inoculation. We devised an approach to efficiently collect bacteria from the agar fly food as described in Methods. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed a larvae-dependent separation to <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone on the first principal component of variance. Compared to single <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, larvae-associated <italic>S. marcescens</italic> exhibited significant upregulation of 360 genes and downregulation of 439 genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and Supplementary table 2), respectively. Functional annotations of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were assigned using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted that the most differentially upregulated DEGs of coexisting <italic>S. marcescens</italic> were related to bacterial proliferation and growth, including ribosome, translation factors, transcription, DNA replication proteins, and energy metabolism (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), implying that larval transplantations favored maintenance of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in the diet. By contrast, the most differentially downregulated DEGs of single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> were related to bacterial pathogenicity, including transporters, excretion, quorum sensing, and exosome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). To validate our findings in bulk RNA-seq analysis, quantitative PCR was used to examine the expression of predicted genes involved in bacterial proliferation and pathogenicity. Indeed, most predicted genes associated with pathogenicity were downregulated in single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), while genes associated with bacterial proliferation were upregulated in response to larva colonization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Consistent with the previous result that this phenotypic switch was driven by transcriptional changes, the expression of virulent and growth genes was recovered after re-culturing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 3D, E). Overall, <italic>Drosophila</italic> forms a symbiosis with the bacterial community by harnessing bacterial global transcription.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated whether larvae could further elicit changes in the metabolism of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> using untargeted metabolomics. The data showed that 91 metabolites were identified and their concentrations were quantified (Supplementary table 3). Metabolomic profiles discriminated larva-associated <italic>S. marcescens</italic> from <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that the host reshapes the global metabolic profile of bacterial cells. We found that larvae- associated <italic>S. marcescens</italic> displayed significant upregulation of 22 metabolites and downregulation of 69 metabolites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the metabolome revealed distinct clusters of metabolites in <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone versus co-culture (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, we detected a significant decrease in amino acid metabolism, phosphotransferase system, and ABC transporters in <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in co-culture compared to <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Defoirdt, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wen et al., 2022</xref>), these results suggested that the host suppresses differentiation of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> into the population with pathogenicity. By contrast, the most differentially upregulated metabolites of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in co-culture were related to the biosynthesis of fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids, and the pentose phosphate pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the host affects the global metabolic profile of symbiotic cells and drives the switch of the bacterial lifestyle from pathogenicity to commensalism.</p>

<p>The co-expression network analysis of transcriptome and metabolome revealed that 42 differentially expressed metabolites were found to be related to the pathogen-to-commensal switch, including ribosome, transcription, DNA replication, energy metabolism, ABC transporters, phosphotransferase system, quorum sensing and exosome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 4A).

Indeed, we found that serotonin, sorbitol and lactobionic acid efficiently reduced the prodigiosin yield and CFUs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 4B, C), highlighting the high quality of the prediction. Moreover, <italic>S. marcescens</italic> perturbed with sorbitol manifested less virulent to flies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 4D) and the impaired transcription of virulence-related genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 4E), resembling the lifestyle of co-culturing <italic>S. marcescens.</italic> Collectively, these findings suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> enforces bacterial transcriptional and metabolic adaptation to the host.</p>

<title>Larvae modulate pathogenicity heterogeneity of <italic>S. marcescens</italic></title>
<p>Isogenic microbial populations can generate transcriptional variation across individual cells, thereby prompting us to analyze bacterial populations at the single-cell resolution. We characterized the transcriptome of individual <italic>S. marcescens</italic> cells by implementing bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing on a platform available.

<p>Next, we speculated about the heterogeneous transcriptional response of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> challenged with larvae as well as mechanical force. The growth of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> was well understood in fly food conditions as described in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, so we collected <italic>S. marcescens</italic> at the late exponential phase when certain bacterial cells manifested their differentiation and pathogenicity. We captured 2800 cells in total and detected a median of 198 genes per cell for control, 333 for force, and 175 for larvae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Strikingly, bacterial cells from each group tended to form three distinct clusters that correspond to the agitated, larva-associated and control cultures could be visualized by graph-based clustering of their gene expression profiles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). This result suggested that larval transplantation, as well as agitation, induce significant changes in gene expression patterns, consistent with the bulk RNA-seq result that larvae caused the shift in bacterial global transcription using Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kuchina et al., 2021</xref>). Next, we attempted to partition the total bacterial population of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> into subpopulations with diverse predicted functional capabilities by the algorithmic grouping of cell-expression profiles. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, we further partitioned the three groups into 7 subclusters (Subcluster 0-6) representing subpopulations with distinct expression profiles, while the gene expression in each cluster was continuous. Namely, the sampled populations of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone and in coculture were respectively partitioned into three coexisting subgroups (Subcluster 0,1, and 2 for co-culturing <italic>S. marcescens</italic> and Subcluster 3, 4, and 6 for single <italic>S. marcescens</italic>), implicating that phenotypic diversity is a general feature of bacteria in clonal populations.</p>
<p>To understand the heterogeneity of gene expression patterns, we identified the DEGs associated with pathogenicity to characterize the transcriptional profile (Supplementary table 4), and ranked marker genes in each cluster (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). We selected pathogenicity-related DEGs, including <italic>livI</italic> (ABC transporter), <italic>oppA</italic> (quorum sensing), <italic>secY</italic> (secretion system), and <italic>fp</italic> (virulence), and charted the feature expression of them in each cluster in low-dimensional space (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, F and I, J). We found most genes involved in pathogenicity displayed a substantial decline upon larvae, which was consistent with the previous findings of reduced pathogenicity of coexisting <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. Moreover, we found that <italic>livI</italic> exhibited gradually higher expression down along Subcluster 3 to Subcluster 6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), implicating the potentially hierarchical virulence-regulatory network in these three subclusters. Analogously, <italic>oppA</italic>, <italic>secY</italic> and <italic>fp</italic> exhibited a similar expression pattern in these three subclusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>, K and L). Given that increased pathogenicity along three subclusters. It was likely that Subcluster 6 could be developed from Subcluster 4, thereby inferring that Subcluster 6 could be identified as subpopulations of single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in a bona fide pathogen. Intriguingly, many virulence- associated genes were highly expressed in Subclusters 5, implying that mechanical force could not attenuate the virulence of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. We tested it by assessing the survival of flies challenged with processed fly medium from agitated <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. Indeed, flies treated with agitated <italic>S. marcescens</italic> displayed a significantly shorter lifetime than flies with coculturing <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 5A). Taken together, our results demonstrated the presence of pathogenicity heterogeneity of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> at the single-microbe-level transcriptional landscape.</p>

<p>We showed that coexisting <italic>S. marcescens</italic> were related to growth, so we continued to identify the DEGs associated with bacterial propagation to characterize the transcriptional profile (Supplementary table 4), and ranked marker genes in each cluster (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

<p>Nitrogen is the fundamental element of nucleic acids and proteins. In the clusters corresponding to larvae (clusters 0, 1 and 2), we observe peak expression of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, such as P-II family nitrogen regulator (<italic>glnK</italic>) and glutamate-ammonia ligase (glnA; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-figure supplement 6B, D). <italic>glnK</italic> plays a critical role in regulating the activity of glutamine synthetase (e.g. <italic>glnA</italic>), which promotes glutamine synthesis. Glutamine is the most abundant non-essential amino acid, and serves as nitrogen and carbon sources for cell growth and differentiation. Moreover, these three subclusters showed a significant increase in the activity of genes involved in urea transport and utilization, such as urea ABC transporter substrate-binding protein (<italic>urtA</italic>), allophanate hydrolase (<italic>atzF</italic>) and urea carboxylase (<italic>uca</italic>). <italic>urtA</italic> accounts for the transport of urea, and then <italic>atzF</italic> and <italic>uca</italic> synergize to convert urea to ammonia that can be used for glutamine biosynthesis. The regulatory schematic is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>. Additionally, glutamine synthesis needs a large amount of energy, so we then turned to carbon metabolism. Indeed, we observed higher expression of phosphoglycerate kinase (<italic>pgk</italic>) and bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase (<italic>adhE</italic>) that participate in glycosis in the subclusters 0, 1 and 2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-figure supplement 6C).

<title>Larvae-derived AMPs efficiently antagonize <italic>S. marcescens</italic></title>
<p>Our results showed that the host keeps strict control over the pathobiont, we next asked whether one or multiple compound(s) secreted by the host could recapitulate this phenomenon. Indeed, the data showed that diets with intestinal excreta exhibited a modest but significant decline in color intensity of the slick, prodigiosin yield and population size compared to control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-C</xref>), in line with the result above (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 2C, D). Larval excreta contains short antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that efficiently combat a variety of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Marra et al., 2021</xref>), prompting us to whether AMPs could recapitulate the response of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> to the presence of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. To refine this concept, AMPs were supplemented to fly food vials with 10<sup>7</sup> CFU <italic>S. marcescens</italic> at the same time.

To verify it, we turned to a compound mutant strain lacking <italic>Defensin</italic>, <italic>Cecropins</italic> (4 genes), <italic>Drosocin</italic>, <italic>Diptericins</italic> (2 genes), <italic>Attacins</italic> (4 genes), <italic>Metchnikowin</italic>, and <italic>Drosomycin</italic>, referred to as “<italic>ΔAMP</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>), allowing direct investigation of their role in the lifestyle transition of the pathobiont. Indeed, <italic>ΔAMP</italic> recapitulated an increment in color intensity of surface slick, prodigiosin yield and population size compared to wild-type counterparts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D-F</xref>). More important, the recapitulation in color intensity of slick, prodigiosin yield and population size was substantially attenuated and even abolished by the addition of AMPs, suggesting that much of the inhibition of the microbiome can be ascribed to AMPs. To rule out the potential role of other immune effectors, we turned to the IMD pathway mutant <italic>Rel<sup>E20</sup></italic> that is deficient in total immune effectors.

Subsequently, quantitative PCR was employed to confirm the expression of altered genes as depicted above (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>, H). Together, our data demonstrated that larva-derived AMPs were a key factor that accounts for the restrictive control over diet microbes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The important role of the host in affecting microbial physiology and behavior is only beginning to be appreciated. In the current study, we found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae act as a competitive regulator that prevents <italic>S. marcescens</italic> overgrowth and antagonizes its pathogenicity. <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae reshaped the transcriptomic and metabolomic profile of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, characterized by the lifestyle switch from pathogenicity to mutualism toward the fly. More importantly, we highlight that the host alters the single-cell transcriptomic atlas of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> and phenotypic heterogeneity in bacterial populations.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> adults are routinely attracted to oviposit their eggs on rotting fruits that possess both commensal and pathogenic microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). Extensive attention has been dedicated to the essential roles of symbiotic bacteria in modulating the physiology of their animal partner, or to the molecular mechanisms underlying physiological benefits to their host. However, it’s necessary to explore both sides of symbioses to obtain a more complete understanding of the host-bacteria interaction. <italic>S. marcescens</italic> encounters a cost associated with symbiosis, as the population size for it is diminished in the shared niche before 72 hours post inoculation by the larvae (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Our findings highlight that larvae alleviate intraspecies competition of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> through population size control at the initial stage. Taking into account these findings, the competition model is more plausible to the larvae- pathogen system where larvae efficiently prevent the overgrowth of the potential pathogenic bacterial community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burns et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Foster et al., 2017</xref>). Interspecies competion for nearly the same or similar nutrients and space occurs in the habitat, making <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae a potential competitor for <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. Intriguingly, a previous study reported the contrasting result that <italic>Drosophila</italic> farms its commensal <italic>L. plantarum</italic>, and is required to optimize the extraction of dietary nutrients and sustain the growth of their symbionts upon chronic undernutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Storelli et al., 2018</xref>). To reconcile the two contradictions, another model of species cooperation is suggested. Consequently, larval transplantations favored long-term maintenance of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> on the diet, and benefits from symbiosis override the costs of the initial competition in the long run, conferring the beneficial effect of larval presence on bacterial maintenance. This paradox possibly reflects a strategy developed by <italic>Drosophila</italic> to preserve its own fitness. Potential pathogens differ from commensal bacteria, because they generate secondary metabolites threatening insect life at the static stage of growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). If the larvae obtain benefits to promote their development and growth, they must exert strict control over them through antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sharp and Foster, 2022</xref>). We found that larvae-derived AMPs efficiently antagonized <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-F</xref>), thereby recapitulating the response of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. Yet, the full complement of larva-derived factors required for bacterial controls as well as their mode of functions remains elusive, paving the way to seek the evolutionary-conserved animal factors essential to maintain symbiosis. Taken together, our findings of the host on microbial communities would improve our understanding of the ecology of host-symbiont interactions.</p>
<p>Owing to their saprophagous foraging behavior, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has to cope with many potential pathogens in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Black et al., 2018</xref>). We’re appreciating the profound influence of the host on the resident microbial community, but the underlying molecular mechanisms by which the host is potentially involved in the perpetuation of host-bacteria symbiosis are still poorly understood. Our result showed that <italic>S. marcescens</italic> versatilely displayed transcriptional and metabolomic adaptations to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), avoiding being competitors when they are associated with the host. Indeed, <italic>S. marcescens</italic> rapidly reached the plateau and exhausted its nutritional resources, and then generated secondary metabolites that could endanger insect life (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistently, our transcriptome data suggest the pathogen-to-commensal transition of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> by the presence of larvae, including ABC transporters, phosphotransferase system, quorum sensing and exosome. In gram- negative bacteria, these exporters transport lipids and polysaccharides from the cytoplasm to the periplasm, or certain substances that need to be extruded from the cell, including surface components of the bacterial cell (e.g., capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, and teichoic acid), proteins involved in bacterial pathogenesis (e.g., hemolysis), hydrolytic enzymes, competence factors, toxins, bacteriocins, peptide antibiotics, and siderophores. In addition, quorum sensing, used by pathogens in disease and infection, regulates gene expression following population density through autoinducers, allowing bacteria populations to communicate and coordinate group behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mukherjee and Bassler, 2019</xref>). The findings suggest that the microbiome responds to host physiology by altering gene expression and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Penterman et al., 2014</xref>). Consistently, a study observed that commensal bacteria calibrate their transcriptional and metabolic output to different systemic inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fyhrquist et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that larvae elicit a set of expressed genes in their harmful symbionts, favoring the shift from a pathogenic to a commensal stage.</p>
<p>Most microbial communities consist of a genetically diverse assembly of different organisms, and the level of genetic diversity plays an important part in community properties and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davies et al., 2022</xref>). However, genetically identical microbial cells can show different behaviors, including differences in growth speed, gene expression and metabolism, and biological diversity can arise at a lower level of biological units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Avraham et al., 2015</xref>). Fortunately, the recent development of methods to interrogate populations on the single-cell level has dramatically altered our understanding of cellular heterogeneity by providing much greater resolution of different cell types and cell states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hare et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Imdahl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">McNulty et al., 2023</xref>). By applying this technique, we indeed observed that single cells differ from each other with respect to gene expression even when genetic and environmental differences between cells are reduced as much as possible in a shaking liquid medium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 4). Recent development in single-cell techniques facilitates to reveal that distinct bacterial subpopulations contribute unique colonization and growth strategies to infection sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Llorens-Rico et al., 2022</xref>). For example, the host can drive <italic>Salmonella</italic> phenotypic heterogeneity at the single-cell level throughout the course of infection, highlighting how variation in gene expression, and metabolic activity contribute to overall bacterial success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tsai and Coombes, 2019</xref>). Consistently, we found that the host changes the transcriptomic atlas of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> individual cells, and attenuates phenotypic heterogeneity of virulent factors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-L</xref>). To date, transcriptional approaches-profiling the host, the pathogen, or both-have been employed to uncover substantial molecular details about the host and bacterial factors that underlie infection outcomes. During the interaction, the niche environment diversifies into 3D areas with varying degrees of growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Koo and Yamada, 2016</xref>). In a single population, both in vitro and in vivo, <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> has been shown to display significant cell-to-cell variation in attributes such as growth rate, expression of virulence factors, and sensitivity to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Claudi et al., 2014</xref>). With the development of this approach, it is possible to identify and modify the transcription of certain target bacterial cells with the expression of virulence factors in order to selectively treat human diseases in the gut microenvironment.</p>
<p>Utilizing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model system, we revealed a natural ecological phenomenon whereby the host was a prerequisite for regulating the population size and lifecycle switch of indigenous bacteria. It’s of importance to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape host-associated microbial communities. Little is known about the effect of the host on the commensal bacteria, and it would be also interesting to investigate whether the host and commensal bacteria could synergize to antagonize the pathogenicity of potential pathogens. Future studies that evaluate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of the host on microbial communities would improve our understanding of host-symbiont co-evolution in nature.</p>

    <p>Bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing was carried out on a commercially available platform (M20 Genomics Company) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). In brief, half a million <italic>S. marcescens</italic> cells were collected by centrifuging at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml ice-cold 4% formaldehyde (Sigma, 47608) and incubated with shaking overnight at 4LJ. The fixative was removed by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and cells were washed twice with 1 mL PBS-TRI (1x PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.1 U/mL Murine RNase inhibitor (Vazyme, R301)). The supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 200 μl PBS-TRI (1x PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.2 U/mL Murine RNase inhibitor (Vazyme, R 301)). The cell suspensions were counted with a Moxi cell counter and diluted according to the manufacturer’s instructions to obtain single-cell.</p>
<p>The bacterial single-cell RNA-Seq library was prepared according to the protocol of VITAPilote® kit (M20 Genomics, R20114124). In situ reverse transcription of bacteria was performed with random primers and the resulting cDNA fragment was added with adaptor. The droplet barcoding for a single bacterium was performed on VITACruiser® Single Cell Partitioning System (M20 Genomics, Hangzhou, China). Bacteria, DNA extension reaction mix, and hydrogel barcoded beads were encapsulated using the VITACruiser. The aqueous phase containing cDNAs was purified with magnetic beads. The cDNAs were amplified by PCR, and purified with magnetic beads. All products were pooled to construct a standard sequencing library. Sequencing was done on a PE150 (Illumina), and raw reads were aligned against the <italic>S. marcescens FY</italic> genome and counted by StarSolo followed by secondary analysis in the Annotated Data Format. Sequencing data was further analyzed using Seurat (v.4.3.0.1 with default parameters except where indicated). Cells were filtered to retain only those with at least 100 genes. Genes were also screened to remove genes expressed only in fewer than five cells. Then, We first log-transformed the data using the NormalizeData function, and selected the 2000 most variable genes using FindVariableFeatures. Then, we z-scored these highly-variable genes using ′ScaleData′. Next, we performed linear dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA) down to 50 dimensions (′RunPCA′). Points in this embedding were used to construct UMAP plots and find neighbours for clustering. FindClusters was used to run the Louvain clustering algorithm and generate clusters. We confirmed that the clusters highlighted in the main text appeared consistently for a range of resolutions from 0.5 to 1.5. DEG was performed using the FindMarkers function with a log-fold change cutoff of 0.25.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Wang and colleagues used Drosophila-Serratia as a host-microbe model to investigate the impact of the host on gut bacteria. The authors showed that Drosophila larvae reduce S. marcescens abundance in the food likely due to a combination of mechanical force and secretion of antimicrobial peptides. S. marcescens exposed to Drosophila larvae lost virulence to flies and could promote larval growth similar to typical Drosophila gut commensals. These phenotypic changes were reflected in the transcriptome and metabolome of bacteria, suggesting that the host could drive the switch from pathogenicity to commensalism in bacteria. Further, the authors used single-cell bacterial RNA-seq to demonstrate the heterogeneity in gut bacterial populations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a valuable work that addresses an important question of the impact of the host on its gut microbes. The authors could convincingly demonstrate that gut bacteria are strongly affected by the host with important consequences for both interacting partners. Moreover, the authors used state-of-the-art bacterial single-cell RNA-seq to reveal heterogeneity in host-associated commensal populations.</p>
<p>Overall most parts of the study are solid and clear.</p>

<p>In this study, Wang and coworkers established a model of Drosophila-S. marcescens interactions and thoroughly examined host-microbe bidirectional interactions. They found that:</p>
<p>(1) Drosophila larvae directly impact microbial aggregation and density;</p>
<p>
(2) Drosophila larvae affect microbial metabolism and cell wall morphology, as evidenced by reduced prodigiosin production and EPS production, respectively;</p>
<p>
(3) Drosophila larvae attenuate microbial virulence;</p>
<p>
(4) Drosophila larvae modulate the global transcription of microbes for adaptation to the host;</p>
<p>
(5) Microbial single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis revealed heterogeneity in microbial pathogenicity and growth;</p>
<p>
(6) AMPs are key factors controlling microbial virulence phenotypes.</p>
<p>Taken together, they concluded that host immune factors such as AMPs are directly involved in the pathogen-to-commensal transition by altering microbial transcription.</p>
<p>In general, in this revised version, I feel that the authors addressed all the points raised in the previous review process. Specifically, they demonstrated that sub-lethal doses of antibiotics such as kanamycin or ampicillin is sufficient to induce the virulence switch in S. marcescens. Furthermore, by testing IMD pathway mutant animals, they concluded that AMP plays a major role in the commensal-to-pathogen transition. In summary, I appreciate the authors' efforts, and I am satisfied with the revision.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This valuable study examines the role of a host in conditions that shift pathogenicity of opportunistic microbes. The use of single-cell microbial transcriptomics and metabolomics to demonstrate the host's effects on pathogen dynamics is interesting and convincing. However, the connection to host antimicrobial peptides driving these effects is incomplete and would benefit from additional evidence and improved explanation in the text. This paper has the potential to be of broad interest to those working in host-microbe (microbiome and pathogen) interactions.</p>

<p>We appreciate the editors for organizing our manuscript and providing eLife assessment. We went through each comment and carried out some necessary experiments. According to the comments, we here provide additional evidence that further supports our findings in this revised manuscript.</p>

<p>This is a valuable work that addresses an important question of the effect of the host on its gut microbes. The authors could convincingly demonstrate that gut bacteria are strongly affected by the host with important consequences for both interacting partners. Moreover, the authors used state-of-the-art bacterial single-cell RNA-seq to reveal heterogeneity in host-associated commensal populations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the conclusions are not fully supported by the data.</p>
<p>Specifically, in lines 142-143, the authors claim that larva antagonizes the pathogenicity of S. marcescens based on the survival data. I do not fully agree with this statement. An alternative possibility could be that, since there are fewer S. marcescens in larvae-processed food, flies receive a lower pathogen load and consequently survive. Can the authors rule this out?</p>
<p>Also, the authors propose that Drosophila larvae induce a transition from pathogenicity to commensalism in S. marcescens and provide nice phenotypic and transcriptomic data supporting this claim. However, is it driven only by transcriptional changes? Considering high mutation rates in bacteria, it is possible that S. marcescens during growth in the presence of larvae acquired mutations causing all the observed phenotypic and transcriptional changes. To test this possibility, the authors could check how long S. marcescens maintains the traits it acquires during growth with Drosophila. If these traits persist after reculturing isolated bacteria, it is very likely they are caused by genome alterations, if not - likely it is a phenotypic switch driven by transcriptional changes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for providing a feasible method to distinguish the shift in transcriptional profile from genomic mutations. According to this valuable suggestion, we checked phenotypic and transcriptional changes after re-culturing the bacterium that had coexisted with larvae. We found that all phenotypes can be recovered after re-culturing. The new data supported our previous result that a phenotypic switch was driven by transcriptional changes rather than genome mutations. We now add these results to the text with figure supplement 3 (line 147-151, 192-194). Please see the following text.</p>
<p>“To rule out the possibility that phenotypic alterations could stem from genomic mutations, we examined the prodigiosin yield and CFUs of re-culturing <italic>S. marcescens</italic> that had coexisted with larvae. Our results showed that neither prodigiosin yield nor CFUs of re-culturing <italic>S. marcescens</italic> differed from the original strain (Figure 2-figure supplement 3A-C), suggesting that a phenotypic switch was driven primarily by transcriptional reprogramming.” “Consistent with the previous result that this phenotypic switch was driven by transcriptional changes, the expression of virulent and growth genes was recovered after re-culturing (Figure 3-figure supplement 3D, E).”</p>
<p>For the first question, we admit the possibility that the high morality of flies could result from the acquirement of a higher pathogen load, because of an increase in the bacterial load of single <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. However, host pathogenesis is normally determined by the virulence of pathogens rather than the number of bacteria. For example, hosts constantly harbor astonishing commensals in their guts, but remain healthy. This evidence suggests that it was the property (virulence) of a pathogen that is more important to affect the health status of the hosts. Moreover, an increase in virulence of single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> was verified by real-time PCR (Fig. 2F) and TE (Fig. 2G). Taken together, we could draw a conclusion that the impaired survival of flies challenged with single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> mainly arose from an increase in the virulence of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. Thanks for your understanding!</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>While many studies have explored the impacts of pathogens on hosts, the effect of hosts on pathogens has received less attention. In this manuscript, Wang et al. utilize Drosophila melanogaster and an opportunistic pathogen, Serratia marcescens, to explore how the host impacts pathogenicity. Beginning with an observation that larval presence and density impacted microbial growth in fly vials (which they assess qualitatively as the amount of 'slick' and quantitatively as microbial load/CFUs), the authors focus on the impact of axenic/germ-free larvae on an opportunistic pathogen S. marcescens. Similar to their observations with general microbial load, they find that larvae reduce the presence of a pinkish slick of Sm, indicative of its secondary metabolite prodigiosin. The presence of larvae alters prodigiosin production, pathogen load, pathogen cellular morphology, and virulence, and this effect is through transcriptional and metabolic changes in the pathogen. Overall, they observe a loss of virulence factors/pathways and an increase in pathways contributing to growth. Given the important role the host plays in this lifestyle shift, the authors then examined host features that might influence these effects, focusing on the role of antimicrobial peptides (Amps). The authors combine the use of synthetic Amps and an Amp-deficient fly line and conclude much of the larval inhibitory effect is due to their production of AMPs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a very interesting question and the use of Drosophila-Serratia marcescens is a great model to explore these interactions and effects.</p>
<p>The authors have an interesting and compelling phenotype and are asking a unique question on the impact of the host on the pathogen. The use of microbial transcriptomics and metabolomics is a strength, especially in order to assess these impacts on the pathogen level and at the single-cell level to capture heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the writing style in the manuscript makes it difficult to fully understand and appreciate the data and its interpretation.</p>
<p>The data on the role of AMPs would benefit from strengthening. Some of the arguments in the text of that section are also counterintuitive. The authors show that △AMP larvae have a reduced impact on Sm as compared to wt larvae, but it seems less mild of an effect than that observed with wt excreta (assuming the same as secreta in Figures 7, should be corrected or harmonized). Higher doses of AMPs give a phenotype similar to wt larvae, but a lower dose (40 ng/ul) gives phenotypes more similar to controls. The authors argue that this data suggests AMPs are the factor responsible for much of the inhibition, but their data seems more to support that it's synergistic- you seem to still need larvae (or some not yet defined feature larvae make, although secreta/excreta was not sufficient) + AMPs to see similar effects as wt. Based on positioning and color scheme guessing that AMP 40ng/ul was used in Figures 7D-H, but could not find this detail in the text, methods, or figure legend and it should be indicated. This section does not seem to be well supported by the provided data, and this inconsistency greatly dampened this reviewer's enthusiasm for the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer’s valuable comments and suggestions. We admitted that some photos of the pinkish slick (prodigiosin) are counterintuitive in Figure 7 as well as figure supplement 2B. Here comes the reason. Single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> produced prodigiosin that only stayed on the surface of fly agar medium. As we know, larvae can agitate food and form a stratification of prodigiosin, even making higher prodigiosin yield inside food lighter than the surface slick of prodigiosin. We mentioned it in the previous manuscript line 166-168. This is why some photos treated with excreta and a lower dose of AMP seemed more intense than those with WT larvae. However, we precisely quantified the prodigiosin yield inside food with the spectrophotometer, so we provided a prodigiosin yield following the photos of the slick. Therefore, we drew our conclusions mainly relying on the quantification of the prodigiosin yield. We actually used cecropin A for our experiments, so we added this information in the text. We hope that our replies can reignite your enthusiasm for our manuscript, and thanks for your great support!</p>

<p>Taken together, they concluded that host immune factors such as AMPs are directly involved in the pathogen-to-commensal transition by altering microbial transcription.</p>
<p>General comments:</p>
<p>In general, this study is intriguing as it demonstrates that host immune effectors such as AMPs can serve as critical factors capable of modulating microbial transcription for host-microbe symbiosis. However, several important questions remain unanswered. One such question is: What is the mechanism by which AMPs modulate the pathogen-to-commensal transition? One hypothesis suggests that antimicrobial activity may influence microbial physiology, subsequently modulating transcription for the transition from pathogen to commensal. In this context, it is imperative to test various antibiotics with different modes of action (e.g., targeting the cell wall, transcription, or translation) at sub-lethal concentrations to determine whether sub-lethal doses of antimicrobial activity are sufficient to induce the pathogen-to-commensal transition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the important comments on our manuscript. We checked the effect of antibiotics (5 μg/μl kanamycin and 10 μg/μl ampicillin) on the virulence switch of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. We found that the two antibiotics with the sub-lethal doses similarly resulted in a decrease in prodigiosin yield and virulence expression of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. Intriguingly, the two antibiotics also resulted in a dramatic decline in the bacterial load and the expression of genes involved in cell growth. These results suggest that antibiotics reduced the virulence primarily through suppressing most activities of bacteria.</p>
<p>We found that larvae and AMPs at 40 μg/μl modestly resulted in a decrease in bacterial load and an increase in the relative level of genes involved in cellular proliferation, suggesting that AMPs could maintain the exponential phase of bacterial growth. This result is consistent that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae can support the long-term persistence of commensals in the shared habitat (DOI: 10.1016/j.cmet.2017.11.011). The inhibition could prevent bacteria from rapidly exhausting their nutritional resources, and consequently maintain symbiosis. It is likely that AMPs could maintain <italic>S. marcescens</italic> at the exponential phase of cell growth and prevent bacteria from rapidly exhausting their nutritional resources.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Here are some specific points that need to be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of statistical analysis for many figures. The authors should perform and report the statistical analysis for all figures where it is currently lacking, specifically, Figures 2C, D, E, F, H; Figures 3E, F; Figures 7G, H; Figure S2E, Figures S3D, E.</p>

<p>Thanks for your valuable suggestions. We re-checked the manuscript and performed the statistical analysis for these figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) For graphs showing dots, it should be specified what exactly individual dots show and how many animals were used per replicate. Also, time points at which specific analysis was performed should be specified.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 2. No letters illustrating statistical significance are shown, although this is claimed in the legend (line 848).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added statistical significance in the updated Figure 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 7, the authors used AMPs of defined concentration, but it is not specified what exactly these AMPs are. Please provide the full composition of the AMP mix used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used the antimicrobial peptide cecropin A produced by a silkworm. We added this information in the methods line 487-488 and Figure 7 legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure S2B. To me, it looks like that medium with larvae is redder than after mechanical force. I find it hard to believe the quantification in panel C that the medium with larvae has 3 times less pigment as compared to the mechanical force.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Larvae could only agitate the surface of food (~0.4 cm), but sticks completely agitated the food up to 3 cm. Thus, the layer of food with pink pigment with agitation seemed much deeper than with larvae, which was responsible for the counterintuitively. We explained it in the previous manuscript (line 166-168). “Of note, the surface of the slick with agitation appeared lighter than that of larvae, mainly due to a stratification of prodigiosin following agitation.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>We have corrected these errors in the new manuscript. We added an &quot;eye&quot; in L86. Co-culture means “<italic>S. marcescens</italic> in co-culture”. Interspecies competition for nearly the same or similar nutrients and space occurs in the habitat.</p>

<p>We added statistical analysis in the current version.

<p>Thanks for this comment. Virtually, there were no larvae inside the vials with single <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, so bacterial cells were not consumed. However, the numbers of CFUs of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone at the later stages were reduced (compared to the peak load at 48 h post-inoculation), so it was deterred that bacteria could undergo ecological suicide. Ecological suicide of the bacterial population was examined by recording the number of CFUs in the medium over time (Ratzke C, et al. Nat Ecol Evol. 2018.).

<p>Previous studies (DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005946) reveal that glucosylating toxins on the surface are primary virulence determinants, so an increased surface-anchored polysaccharide and protein profile promotes the virulence of the pathogen. Alterations in cell surface (the width of the cell wall) can be examined by TE. Moreover, TE was used to observe changes in the virulence of <italic>S.</italic> marcescens (DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkab1186).

<p>(5) While it's acknowledged that agitation decreases the color intensity of the bacteria, comparing mechanical agitation with larval crawling seems inappropriate, as the mechanical forces exerted by both methods are not of the same magnitude.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. In fact, food was agitated more heavily by glass sticks than by larvae, because larvae merely agitated the surface of food (about 0.5 cm-depth). If the decrease in bacterial load and color was related to the magnitude of agitation, larvae would confer a less decrease (from the decrease in stick agitation) in bacterial load than the sticks. Consequently, it would further support our result that biofactors more importantly confer the inhibition of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> than force.</p>

<p>(6) Figure 4D: with this metabolome data, they mentioned, &quot;host suppresses differentiation of S. marcescens into the population with pathogenicity.&quot; What evidence supports the claim that downregulation of amino acid metabolism, phosphotransferase system, and ABC transporter directly correlates with decreased pathogenicity?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comment. Earlier studies showed that amino acid-derived quorum sensing molecules are closely related to bacterial pathogenicity (Defoirdt T. PLoS Pathog. 2019; Wen J, et al. Microbiol Spectr. 2022). Moreover, the phosphotransferase system and ABC transporter can transport and/or produce virulence factors. Therefore, we claimed that downregulation of amino acid metabolism, phosphotransferase system, and ABC transporter directly were related to decreased pathogenicity. To support this claim, we add some references in the updated manuscript line 662-664, 827-830.</p>

<p>Bacterial single-cell RNA-seq can evaluate alterations in gene expression in the single-cell resolution.

<p>(10) Figure 7: Delta AMP + AMP exhibited a stronger effect on the bacteria compared to AMP alone, indicating that immune effectors other than AMP may be involved. Since the IMD pathway is necessary for most immune effectors, including AMP, it would be interesting to test IMD pathway mutant animals and compare them with Delta AMP. Delta AMP + AMP exhibited a stronger effect on the bacteria compared to AMP alone.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this important question. Indeed, Delta AMP + AMP exhibited a stronger effect on the bacteria compared to AMP alone. We admitted that immune effectors other than AMP may be involved. Alternatively, mechanical force, to a less extent, accounted for the stronger effect on the bacteria (Explained by larvae agitation in figure supplement 2). To rule out this possibility, we examined the effect of total immune effectors on the bacterial load and the prodigiosin yield of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> using the IMD pathway mutant (<italic>RelE20</italic> larvae). Our result showed that the optical density and yield of prodigiosin in Delta AMP group did not significantly differ from the ones in <italic>RelE20</italic> group. Moreover, the load of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> associated with Delta AMP mutant was comparable to that of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> associated with <italic>RelE20</italic> mutant. These results suggested that AMPs play a major role in recapitulating the response of _S. marcescens t_o larvae.</p>
<p>“To rule out the potential role of other immune effectors, we turned to the IMD pathway mutant <italic>RelE20</italic> that is deficient in total immune effectors. Our result showed that the optical density and yield of prodigiosin in <italic>RelE20</italic> group did not significantly differ from the ones in <italic>DAMP</italic> group (figure supplement 7A, B). Moreover, the load of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> associated with <italic>RelE20</italic> mutant was comparable to that of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> associated with Delta AMP mutant (figure supplement 7C).”</p>
