<title>Summary</title>
<p>The cell-type specific expression of ligand/receptor and cell-adhesion molecules is a fundamental mechanism through which neurons regulate connectivity. Here we determine a functional relevance of the long-established mutually exclusive expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit and the trans-membrane protein Kit Ligand by discrete populations of neurons in the mammalian brain. Kit is enriched in molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) of the cerebellar cortex (i.e., stellate and basket cells), while cerebellar Kit Ligand is selectively expressed by a target of their inhibition, Purkinje cells (PCs). By <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic manipulation spanning embryonic development through adulthood, we demonstrate that PC Kit Ligand and MLI Kit are required for, and capable of driving changes in, inhibition of PCs. Collectively, these works in mice demonstrate that the Kit Ligand/Kit receptor dyad sustains mammalian central synapse function and suggest a rationale for the affiliation of Kit mutation with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase Kit (c-Kit, CD117) is an evolutionarily conserved, loss-of-function intolerant, gene that is enriched in specific neuron populations and tentatively associated with rare cases of neurological dysfunction (pLI= 0.98 and LOEUF of 0.17) (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A,B</xref></bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. It is perhaps unsurprising that loss-of-function Kit mutations in humans are rare; Kit is highly pleiotropic, supporting diverse cell populations including melanocytes, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, germ cells, masts cell, and interstitial cells of Cajal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Thus, Kit mutations can result in diverse conditions such as hypo- or hyperpigmentation or melanoma, anemia or leukemia, infertility, mastocytosis, and impaired gut motility or gastro-intestinal tumors (Kit biology reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]).</p>
<p>The activation of Kit is stimulated by Kit Ligand (Gene symbol KITLG, herein KL), a single-pass transmembrane protein having an extracellular active domain that induces Kit dimerization and kinase activity. Across several decades and species, it has been reported that KL and Kit are mutually expressed in discrete neuron populations known to be connected; it has thus been hypothesized that the expression pattern of KL-Kit may reflect a role in connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Consistent with such a function, case reports have implicated inactivating Kit mutations with disorders of the central nervous system (References [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref></bold>). Clinical phenotypes include developmental delay, ataxia, hypotonia, intellectual disability, deafness, and autism spectrum disorder. White matter abnormalities have been noted, and limited evidence suggests KL-Kit may indeed regulate axon outgrowth. KL or Kit mutation or pharmacological manipulation alters outgrowth of spinal commissural axons <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], KL stimulates cortical neurite outgrowth <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], and Kit reduction in cortex of developing rats or mice delays axon extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. While these reports provide anatomical/morphological data suggesting that KL-Kit influences connectivity, these studies did not address consequences to neuronal physiology or synaptic connectivity. Functional studies of KL-Kit in synaptic physiology have likely been hampered by pleiotropy and organismal or cell death. Severe global KL-Kit hypomorphs exhibit fatal anemia, and developmental Kit depletion or inhibition in the cerebrum has resulted in the death of neuronal progenitors or nascent neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Therefore, whether KL-Kit is necessary for synaptic function has remained largely unstudied. Here, we address this gap.</p>
<p>In mice, rats, and humans, Kit is abundantly expressed by molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) of the cerebellar cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], while cerebellar KL is restricted to Purkinje cells (PCs), which MLIs provide GABAergic synaptic inhibition to. We tested the hypothesis that PC KL and MLI Kit were essential to the GABAergic inhibition of PCs. We created a Kit conditional knockout mouse and accomplished embryonic knockout of Kit from MLIs; separately, we knocked out KL from postnatal PCs. By either method, disruption of the KL-Kit pair produced robust and specific impairments to GABAergic inhibition of PCs. Through sparse postnatal viral manipulation of KL in PCs, we provide evidence that KL functions throughout adulthood to regulate synaptic function. These results demonstrate that cell-type specific expression of KL and Kit influences functional connectivity in the mammalian brain, informing the long-observed expression of KL-Kit in the brain and suggesting a rationale for the affiliation of Kit loss with neurological impairment.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>All procedures performed at Michigan State University were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Michigan State University, which is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). Mice were on a 12-hour dark/light cycle, with <italic>ad libitum</italic> food and water. Male and female mice were used for all experiments. Mice were genotyped in-house using standard PCR-based methods, or via Transnetyx.</p>

<title>Creation of Kit conditional knockout mouse</title>
<p>We generated a strain of mice having exon 4 of Kit flanked by LoxP sites (âfloxedâ). This was accomplished by utilizing the services of UNC Animal Models Core (Dr. Dale Cowley) to generate chimeras from an ES cell line having a Knockout-first Allele (with conditional potential) for Kit (HEPD0509_8). The ES clones were obtained through the EuMMCR (European Mouse Mutant Cell Repository) of the EUCOMM (European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Chimeric mice were screened for germline transmission of the targeted allele and were then crossed to a Flp deleter strain (C57BL/6N-Albino-Rosa26-FlpO) to convert the knockout-first allele to a conditional allele (tm1c) through removal of the FRT-flanked selection cassette. F1 male offspring carrying Kit tm1c and Flp alleles were crossed to C57Bl6/J females; we selected resultant progeny heterozygous for Kit tm1c but negative for Flp and the selection cassette. The Kit tm1c allele was bred to homozygosity while selecting against animals carrying the Tyr c-Brd allele (previously conveyed by C57BL/6N-Albino-Rosa26-FlpO). The resultant strain of mice having the Kit floxed tm1c allele are given the nomenclature C57BL/6NâKit<sup>tm1c(EUCOMM)Mirow</sup>/J; the Mirow lab code is registered through the National Academies to the author and principal investigator herein, <bold>Mi</bold>chael <bold>Ro</bold>land <bold>W</bold>illiams. Additional strains of mice used were Pax2-Cre transgenic mice (STOCK Tg(Pax2-cre)1Akg/Mmnc, RRID:MMRRC_010569-UNC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], Kit eGFP (Tg(Kit-EGFP)IF44Gsat/Mmucd; Gensat) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] backcrossed for greater than 5 generations to C57Bl6/J (Stock No: 000664, The Jackson Laboratory), KitL floxed (Kitltm2.1Sjm/J, Stock #017861) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], and Pcp2-Cre (Stock # 004146) mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], via The Jackson Laboratory.</p>
<p>To produce mixed litters of âControlâ and âKit KOâ animals, mice homozygous for the Kit tm1c allele but negative for Pax2-Cre were crossed to mice homozygous for the floxed allele and Pax2-Cre positive. We used Kit KO females crossed to Control males as our breeding scheme. Experimental animals were derived from at least 5 generations of backcrossing Kit KO animals to Kit tm1c homozygous animals derived from a separate (Kit tm1c homozygous x Kit tm1c homozygous) breeding cohort.</p>

<title>Validation of Kit knockout</title>
<p>We investigated conditional knockout of Kit protein from the cerebellum by Western blot of total protein lysates from acutely harvested cerebellums (â¼P52) and by indirect immunofluorescence on free-floating vibratome-generated sections of transcardial-perfused formaldehyde-fixed mouse brains (â¼P31). Western blots were probed with Rabbit: Î±-Kit (1:1000, clone D13A2, Cell Signaling Technologies product 3074), Î±-GAPDH (1:2000, Clone 14C10, product 2118 Cell Signaling Technology), or Î±-parvalbumin antibody (1:3000, product PV-27, Swant), each primary was detected via HRP conjugated Goat Î±-Rabbit secondary antibody (1:4000, Bio-Rad, product 170-6515) after incubation with Clarity ECL substrate (Bio-Rad, 1705061), via a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP.</p>
<p>For subsequent imaging and electrophysiology, we focused on lobule IV/V of the cerebellar cortex, as this area was superficially accessible for surgery, and provided a consistent area for focused comparisons between animals that would reduce the influence of spatial variations in KL or Kit expression.</p>
<p>For indirect immunofluorescence, primary antibodies were rat Î±-Kit (1:500, Rat Î±-Kit clone ACK4, ThermoFisher, product MA5-17836), mouse Î±-calbindin (1:2000, Î±-calbindin-D28K, CB-955, Sigma Aldrich), and rabbit Î±-parvalbumin (1:500, PV-27, Swant). Primaries were detected by Goat-host highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 488, Cy3, or Alexa 647 (1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nuclei were labeled with DAPI, tissues were mounted in an anti-fade reagent, and fluorescent signals captured laser scanning confocal microscopy. Cell densities for MLIs (parvalbumin positive and/or calbindin negative somas of the molecular layer) were performed on Maximum Z-projections of 2.5 to 2.6 micron thick stacks, using the multi-point feature for counting somas, and the polygon ROI tool for determining the area of the Molecular Layer in which the somas were counted; results from two-technical replicates were averaged for each animal. The polygon tool was also used for determining maximal PSD-95+ pinceau area. To determine the width of the molecular layer, seven linear ROIs per field of view of comparable locations of lobules IV/V were averaged to generate per animal layer thickness measurements. For analysis of synapses, we quantified puncta (of 0.05-5 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> using the Analyze Particles function) in the molecular layer that were triple positive (each channel auto-threshold) for rabbit Î±-VGAT(1:500, 131 003), mouse Î±-Gephyrin (1:5000, 147 011), and Chicken Î±-Calbindin (1:500, 214 006), all from Synaptic Systems. For analysis of pinceau markers we utilized mouse Î±-Kv1.1 (1:250, K36/15), Kv1.2 (1:250, K14/16), and PSD-95 (1:200, K28/43), all from NeuroMab/AntibodiesInc.</p>

<title>Stereotaxic Procedures</title>
<p>Injections of replication-defective viral particles used protocols substantially similar to those previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In brief, mice were brought to an anesthetic plane using inhaled isoflurane by a low-flow system (SomnoSuite, Kent); thermal regulation was assisted by heating pad, and pain managed through topical lidocaine and by intraperitoneal ketoprofen. A digital stereotaxic device (Kopf) and reference atlas were used to localize a small hole in the skull; cerebellar coordinates were: neonates; A/P, -2.55; M/L, - 1.1 (reference Lambda), D/V, 1.5 to 0.5 from dura; juvenile; A/P, -6.25; M/L, - 1.35; D/V, 1.5 to 0.75 (reference Bregma); adults; A/P, -6.35; M/L, - 1.8; D/V, 1.5 to 0.75 (reference Bregma). Viral particles were delivered via a â¼30-gauge Hamilton Syringe controlled by digital syringe pump (WPI). The infused virus volume was 1-2 ul and there was a 5-minute period after infusion prior to needle withdrawal. Animals were monitored during and after operations. Ages for injection were, nominally, postnatal day (P) 7, 19, and 56; for P7 and P19, variability of up to two days was utilized to accommodate differences in animal size, and for P56 the eighth week of life was utilized.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Viruses</title>
<p>Lentiviral particles were derived from our vectors previously described to express transgenes under the hUbiC promoter and pseudotyped with VSV-G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Silent mutations disrupted the internal EcoRI sites of mouse KitL (MC204279, OriGene), the KitL coding sequence was then flanked by EcoRI sites, and the subsequent KitL coding sequence was introduced into a FUC-T2A-(EcoRI) plasmid, to create a FUC-T2A-KL-1 plasmid, wherein C designates mCherry. Subsequent deletion of KitL Exon 6 generated a KL-2 vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Sequences were verified by sequencing. Adeno-Associated Viral (AAV) particles were created by Vigene to drive Cre expression by the Purkinje Cell-Specific L7.6 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], or to drive mCherry or mCherry-T2A-KL-2 in a Cre-On fashion under the EF1Î± promoter, with the AAV1 serotype.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>For patch clamp electrophysiology of Control vs Kit KO, cells were recorded in slices generated from animals at 36.9 Â± 0.6 and 37.4 Â± 0.9 days for MLIs and PCs respectively. Analysis of the Pcp2 Cre mediated KL KO tissues was conducted similarly at â¼40-44 days old. For viral PC KL KO animals injected as neonates (P7), juvenile (P19), and adults (P56) were recorded at an average of â¼35, 45, and 83 days old, respectively. Avertin-anesthetized mice were perfused with a carbogen-equilibrated ice-cold slicing solution containing (in mM): 110 C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>14</sub>ClNO, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O, 10 Glucose, and 1.3 Na-Ascorbate. In the same solution, we generated 250-micron thick parasagittal sections of the cerebellum (Leica VT1200). Slices recovered at 34Â°C for 30 minutes in a carbogenated ACSF containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O and 25 Glucose; slices were then held at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before recording. Recordings were performed in carbogenated external recording ACSF (32.7 Â± 0.1Â°C) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O and 25 Glucose. MLIs and PCs of folia IV/V were targeted for recording by IR-DIC, or epifluorescence stimulated by a CoolLED pE-4000, detected via a SciCam Pro on a SliceScope Pro 6000-based rig (Scientifica). Recording electrodes were pulled (Narishige, PC-100) from standard-wall borosilicate glass capillary tubing (G150F-4, Warner Instruments) and had 5.1 Â± 0.08 and 2.8 Â± 0.02 MÎ© tip resistance for MLIs and PCs respectively. Spontaneous Inhibitory Postsynaptic Currents (sIPSCs) and Miniature Inhibitory Postsynaptic Currents (mIPSC) were recorded with an intracellular solution containing (in mM):140 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.4 Na-GTP, 2 QX-314. For action potential recordings and for Miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents (mEPSCs), the intracellular solution contained (in mM): 140 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 0.02 EGTA, 3 Mg-ATP, and 0.5 Na-GTP as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The internal pipette solution pH was adjusted to 7.35 with CsOH for IPSCs and mIPSCs, and with KOH for mEPSCs and action potentials, while for all the osmolarity was adjusted to 300 mOsmolL-1 with sucrose. In whole-cell voltage clamp mode PCs were held at -70 mV; to isolate sIPSCs, CNQX or NBQX (10 Î¼M) and D-AP5 (50 Î¼M) were added to the recording solution and mIPSCs recordings additionally included 1 Î¼M tetrodotoxin (TTX). To record mEPSCs, 1 Î¼M TTX and 50 Î¼M picrotoxin was added to extracellular solution. Action potentials were recorded in MLIs within the middle third of the molecular layer; spontaneous action potentials were recorded in I=0 mode, or action potentials were evoked by depolarizing current injection in 600 ms steps of 10 pA, from 0 to 150 pA, with a 7 second inter-sweep interval. For paired pulse, current ranging from 150 uA to 250 uA was delivered by concentric bipolar stimulating electrode in the molecular layer. Stimulus duration was 50 Î¼S, and ISI was 50 ms. For each cell, 10 sweeps were recorded with 10 S inter-sweep interval. A square-wave voltage stimulation pulse was utilized to determine input resistance and cell capacitance. Purkinje Cells with an access resistance of 10-20 (15.9 Â± 0.5), or MLIs with an access resistance &lt;30 (23.6 Â± 0.6) Mâ¦ were considered for recording. Recordings with &gt;20% change in series resistance were excluded from analysis. Signals were acquired at 10 KHz with a low-noise data acquisition system (Digidata 1550B) and a Multiclamp700-A amplifier and were analyzed using pClamp11.1 (Molecular Devices) after low pass Bessel (8-pole) filtration (3dB cut off, filter 1 KHz). The minimum amplitude threshold for detecting IPSCs and EPSCs was 15 pA; for mIPSCs and mEPSCs the cutoff was 8 pA. For determining frequency and amplitude, individual events longer than 1 ms were included while overlapping events were manually rejected from analysis. Inhibitory charge is reported as the per-cell sum over the recording epoch of the area under the curve for all pharmacologically resolved inhibitory events. For the analysis of minis, both mIPSCs and mEPSCs with over 8 pA amplitude and longer than 1 ms duration were included while overlapping events were rejected from analysis; also rejected from analysis was any miniature event for which amplitude, rise, and decay metrics were not all available.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We generated mice in which Kit exon 4 is flanked by LoxP sites (Kit tm1c); Kit gene modifications are illustrated in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref></bold>. Kit tm1c homozygous Control animals had normal appearance, sex ratios, and reproductive success. Kit is abundantly expressed in parvalbumin positive GABAergic interneurons in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex (MLIs), whereas Kit Ligand (KL) is expressed by Purkinje cells (PCs) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref></bold>). To determine if Kit influences synapse function, we conditionally knocked out Kit from MLIs and assessed the MLI:PC synapse. Pax2 is a transcription factor expressed early in the lineage of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]; a Pax2-Cre transgene enables embryonic recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. We generated Kit tm1c homozygous litters of which nominally half were hemizygous for Pax2 Cre (Kit KO) and half were not (Control). We produced Control and Kit KO animals in normal sex and genotype ratios. As expected for the C57Bl6/J background, Control littermates had dark coat and eyes, but littermate Kit KO animals had white whiskers, white fur with variable pigmented patches, and black eyes; example littermates <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>. Given Pax2 expression in melanocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] and the role of Kit in melanogenesis (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]), the pigmentation phenotype provided gross confirmation of conditional Kit KO. We thus confirmed that cerebella of Kit KO animals were Kit depleted. By immunohistochemistry in Control animals, we recapitulated the known pattern of Kit immunoreactivity in the parvalbumin positive MLIs of the cerebellar cortex (Control, <bold>1F and Inset</bold>). In contrast, a sex-matched Kit KO littermate demonstrated loss of cerebellar Kit immunoreactivity (Kit KO, <bold>1F and Inset</bold>). In data not shown, we confirmed that both mGlur1/2 and neurogranin positive cerebellar Golgi cells (which share the MLI Pax2+ lineage, and of which some are transiently Kit positive) were still present in the Kit KO condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. By Western blot of cerebellar lysates from Control animals, Kit resolved as a major band at â¼120 kD, but in Kit KO littermates, Kit immunoreactivity was lost; GAPDH as loading control was equivalent, as was parvalbumin (which marks mature MLIs and PCs) <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></bold>.</p>

<p>Having validated that Kit KO animals indeed lacked cerebellar Kit, we then assessed the functional impact. We compared spontaneous GABAergic inhibitory post synaptic currents (sIPSC) in PCs of acute slices generated from â¼P34 Control and Kit KO animals, schema <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>, example traces <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>. Kit KO was associated with a significant change in the distribution of sIPSC event amplitudes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). For each PC of Control or Kit KO conditions, we calculated the average sIPSC event frequency and amplitude, as well as total inhibitory charge transfer over the recording epoch. We determined there was a significant decrease in sIPSC frequency (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>) and a less severe decrease of sIPSC amplitude and inhibitory charge. This reduced inhibition did not produce obvious impacts to spontaneous PC firing dynamics: we determined (in 29 Control vs 22 Kit KO cells) that PC membrane potential and membrane resistivity were not significantly different, and that per cell average: spontaneous action potential frequency, inter-spike interval (ISI), and ISI CV2 were not significantly different, despite some difference in the distribution of individual ISI across genotypes.(<bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref></bold>). Though circuit consequences of the Kit KO mediated PC disinhibition were thus not immediately apparent, the reduced sIPSC frequency in Kit KO was not associated with changes in the density or distribution of MLIs or in the thickness of the molecular layer (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<p>Since the number and distribution of MLIs were normal in Kit KO, we sought to determine if the reduced PC inhibition was related to altered MLI physiology (Schema, <bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref></bold>). However, capacitance, input resistance, and spontaneous or evoked MLI action potential frequency was not different between Control and Kit KO (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B-E</xref>)</bold>. Since MLIs numbers, distribution, and firing were apparently normal in Kit KO, we sought to determine if there were defects in evoked neurotransmitter release. Direct electrode stimulation of the outer or inner molecular layer in a paired-pulse paradigm (Schema, <bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3F,J</xref></bold>; example traces <bold>Figure G,K</bold>) evoked IPSCs of equivalent mean amplitude in PCs from Control and Kit KO (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3H,L</xref></bold>), and we detected no difference in the paired pulse ratio between conditions (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3I,M</xref></bold>). These data suggest that direct stimulation can evoke a similar maximum of release probability between Control and Kit KO conditions. We therefore investigated markers of the MLI:PC synapses to determine if they were altered.</p>
<p>The density and average size of GABAergic synapses onto PCs (triple positive VGAT, Gephyrin, and Calbindin puncta in the molecular layer) was not reduced by Kit KO (example immunofluorescence, <bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref></bold>, Quantification <bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">S4B,C</xref></bold>). MLI axon terminals contribute not just to individual axo-dendritic synaptic puncta, but also to interdigitated MLI axon collaterals around the soma and initial axon segment of PCs, forming âpinceauxâ structures. By parvalbumin immunoreactivity, these structures were preserved but smaller in Kit KO (arrowheads <bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>)</bold>, and this was confirmed by decreased Kv1.2 (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref></bold>) and PSD-95 (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4E</xref></bold>). As PSD-95 immunoreactivity faithfully follows multiple markers of pinceaux size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], we quantified PSD-95 immunoreactive pinceau area and we determined that pinceaux size was decreased by â¼50% in Kit KO (26 Control vs 43 Kit KO pinceau from n of 5 Control vs 8 Kit KO animals, <bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4F</xref></bold>). These results suggested that Kit KO MLIs may have defects in physical and/or functional maturation of synapses onto PCs.</p>
<p>To evaluate the number of functional GABAergic synapses, we analyzed miniature synaptic currents in acute cerebellar slices, (schema <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 E, F, G</xref></bold>; example traces <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 H, I, J</xref>)</bold>. In PCs of Kit KO, there was a significant â¼50% reduction in the average frequency, but not amplitude, of mIPSCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref></bold>). In contrast, the average frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in PCs from Control and Kit KO did not differ (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref></bold>). These data suggested that Kit KO impaired the MLI:PC synapse but did not rule out a general defect in MLI synapse function. As MLIs synapse not just onto PCs, but also onto other MLIs, we evaluated mIPSCs in MLIs. Mean mIPSC frequency and amplitude in MLIs was unchanged between Control and Kit KO (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref></bold>). Therefore, embryonic MLI Kit KO was associated with a specific defect in the number or proportion of functional GABAergic synapses onto PCs. As MLI Kit and PC KL expression is maintained postnatally, we hypothesized that postnatal postsynaptic PC KL KO would phenocopy embryonic presynaptic MLI Kit KO.</p>
<p>We utilized previously described KL floxed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] and Pcp2-Cre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] strains to yield mice with Control or KL KO PCs (Schema <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). We confirmed depletion of cerebellar KL transcripts by rtPCR in data not shown[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], and we confirmed that PC KL KO did not grossly disrupt the pattern of Kit immunoreactivity. Patch clamp of PCs in acute slices revealed that PC KL KO produced significant differences in the distribution of sIPSC event amplitudes (Example traces <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). PC KL KO reduced the average sIPSC frequency and amplitude, as well as the total inhibitory charge transfer (âChargeâ) recorded in PCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>), without changes to PC capacitance or membrane resistance. The phenotype was specific to GABAergic synapses: there was a substantial reduction in the frequency but not the amplitude of mIPSC events in PCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). As with Kit KO, we detected no decrease in the per-animal average size or density of triple positive VGAT/Gephyrin/Calbindin synaptic puncta in the molecular layer (n=4 Control vs 4 KL KO animals, mean area 0.249 vs 0.286 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>, p=.1962; mean density 0.045 vs 0.046 per Î¼m<sup>2</sup>, p=.9658), Not Illustrated). We further detected no difference either in PDS-95+ pinceau area (49 Control vs 48 KL KO pinceaux from n=4 Control vs 4 KL KO animals, mean area 57.93 vs 53.37 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> p=.6036, Not Illustrated). Thus, as with Kit embryonic Kit KO, postnatal KL KO apparently reduced the proportion of functional, if not the absolute structural total, of GABAergic synapse sites upon PCs. In contrast to this impact on GABAergic synapses, the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in KL KO PCs was not different vs Controls (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>). In data not shown, a KS test revealed a significant difference in the individual mEPSC event amplitude distribution (p=0.0002, n=1196 Control vs 1244 KL KO), however the mean mEPSC amplitude was within 1% between conditions. Similarly, a KS test of mIPSC event amplitudes revealed that the mean mIPSC amplitude was â¼10% greater in PC KL KO than in Control (p&lt;0.0001, n=5996 Control vs 3958 KL KO). It is therefore unlikely that decreased event amplitude contributed to the specific and robust &gt;50% decrease in mIPSC frequency detected in PC KL KO. Thus, as with MLI Kit KO, PC KL KO specifically reduced synaptic inhibition of PCs.</p>

<p>To determine if acute focal manipulations in KL modulate PC inhibition, we injected replication-defective viruses leveraging the PC-specific L7.6 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] to express Cre in KL floxed animals, and we identified Cre-positive KL KO PCs by mCherry expression (Schema <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>, Example transduction, <bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A-C,E-G</xref></bold>). Injections were at P7, P18, or P56; acute slices were generated 2-3 weeks after injections. In the P7 neonatal animals we utilized lentivirus owing to its reduced spread vs AAV particles, which were used for P18 and P56. Patch-clamp recordings in areas of sparse infection revealed that regardless of when KL was depleted, PC KL KO reduced PC sIPSC frequency and inhibitory charge transferred (P7, P18, and P56 in <bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5 D, H, I</xref>;</bold> P18 injections <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 B, C, D</xref>)</bold>. We next examined the effects of PC KL over-expression using a complementary strategy. We co-injected L7.6 Cre AAV with AAV encoding EF1Î± driven Cre-on mCherry and the membrane bound isoform of mouse KL (mKL2) via a T2A element to produce PC KL overexpression (OX) (Schema <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). Whether at P18 (shown) or P56 (not shown), KL OX PCs had increased sIPSC frequency, amplitude, and inhibitory charge transferred, compared to nearby Control PCs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, G, H</xref></bold>). We noted that Control PCs from the PC KL KO paradigm received a similar degree of inhibition (frequency, amplitude, charge) as did PCs from Sham injections. In contrast, while the KL OX PCs received elevated GABAergic input compared to their adjacent Control PCs, the (KL OX) relative local increase in inhibitory drive was not beyond the level of inhibition recorded in PCs from separate Sham animals (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, G, H</xref></bold>). That is, the local gain in synaptic input to KL OX PCs appears to come at the expense of decreasing inhibition to nearby Control PCs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>For genes essential to survival or reproduction, germline knockout strategies are not feasible for evaluating postnatal physiology. Among such genes, Kit is an example of a highly pleiotropic gene, and so the interpretation of global hypomorphs is challenging and the recombination of conditional alleles outside of desired tissues can lead to lethal or sterile phenotypes. By generating a conditional knockout mouse, we were able to produce viable animals with Kit depleted from the cerebellum to reveal a role in synapse function.</p>
<p>MLI number, distribution, action potential firing, and the density of GABAergic synaptic puncta onto PCs, are all apparently normal in MLI Kit KO. These data suggest that while MLI axon terminals are present in Kit KO, they may be less functional. An increased failure rate between action potential generation and neurotransmitter release would be consistent with the normal firing frequency and synapse puncta density but decreased sIPSC and mIPSC frequency observed. Under the PPR paradigm, the apparently equivalent evoked responses may be due to direct stimulation of axon terminals and/or simultaneous recruitment of multiple MLIs.</p>
<p>Kit KO most directly impacts the MLI:PC synapse, based on seemingly normal miniature events for parallel fiber: PC synapses (mEPSC in PC) and MLI:MLI (mIPSC in MLI) synapses. This is perhaps expected given the cell type specific expression of KL by PCs and Kit by MLIs, however, it is a critical distinction as Cerebellins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] and Calsystenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] impact multiple forms of synaptic input to PCs. It will be informative to determine if the residual inhibitory drive to PCs observed in MLI Kit KO or PC KL KO comes from PC axon collaterals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] whose input we might expect to be preserved if KL-Kit functions primarily to mediate connectivity between different cell types, or perhaps from a subtype of interneuron not dependent upon Kit signaling. This distinction is further relevant since our histological analysis of synaptic puncta does not resolve between MLI:PC and PC:PC synapses, the relative balance of which may be altered by either KL or Kit manipulations. Indeed, future studies of the role of KL-Kit on PC-PC connectivity may inform how PC KL OX can apparently weaken inhibition to adjacent PCs: this may occur through the reduction of inhibitory drive from KL OX PCs to adjacent control PCs. An alternative, and not mutually exclusive possibility is that PC KL OX excessively potentiates MLI Kit to enhance MLI:MLI inhibition, reducing the inhibitory output surrounding MLIs can provide to control PCs.</p>
<p>Though such important nuances of the circuit mechanisms remain to be elucidated, our results demonstrate that the KL-Kit axis, from embryonic development through young adulthood, can alter GABAergic drive to PCs. These results suggest that KL-Kit may be necessary to maintain, and perhaps capable of modulating, MLI:PC GABAergic inhibition in the adult cerebellum. As each MLI (e.g. basket cell) has axon collaterals that can target multiple PCs, and as each PC can receive input from multiple MLIs, it is interesting to speculate that dynamics (e.g. in the expression or shedding) of KL may act through presynaptic Kit to tune the degree of convergent MLI:PC inhibitory drive. This would complement existing forms of modulation at the MLI:PC synapse, such as those dependent on other PC derived signaling molecules, like endocannabinoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] or peptides like secretin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] and CR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. The physiology of PCs, and the structure of MLI:PC inhibition, also varies over zones such as those identified by Zebrin-II and PLC Î²4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]; whether there is functional variation in KL or Kit expression, signaling, or dependency, remains to be determined. Though we have demonstrated a role in synaptic GABAergic inhibition, it is currently unknown whether Kit signaling also plays a role in other forms of inhibition in the cerebellar cortex, such as MLI:MLI gap-junctions, or MLI:PC ephaptic coupling. The latter may be suggested by the Kit KO mediated reduction in Kv1.1/Kv.12 and PSD-95 immunoreactivity.</p>
<p>While KL-Kit clearly influences synaptic function, we do not yet know the molecular mechanisms involved. Kit is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can activate multiple downstream effectors including Src family kinases, PLC, PI3K/mTOR, and the MAPK pathway, the latter two notable here for their shared affiliation with synapse phenotypes and autism spectrum disorder. Investigation of the interactome of Kit under basal and KL manipulated conditions may inform the receptor kinase cascades through which Kit signaling sustains synaptic function. It also plausible that trans-cellular interactions between KL and Kit may function in a kinase-independent, cell adhesion molecule modality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. There is a substantial literature illustrating the importance of adhesion molecules in the organization and maintenance of MLI:PC inhibition, such as neurexins/neuroligins, dystrophin/dystroglycan, semaphorins, and neurofascins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Much of what is understood about these molecules in the maintenance of PC inhibition is revealed by post-synaptic phenotypes; that is, cis-and trans interacting proteins that, via gephyrin, maintain the organization of PC GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. It is notable therefore that MLI Kit or PC KL KO has a more predominant effect on mIPSC frequency than on amplitude, suggesting a presynaptic phenotype.</p>
<p>Despite the reduced PC inhibition resulting from MLI Kit KO or from PC KL KO, we have not observed overt cerebellar signs (i.e., ataxia). We suspect that this is due to compensation. Even the developmental ablation of functional GABA<sub>A</sub> channels in PCs does not produce overt motor signs, while adulthood ablation can [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Thus, we might unmask behavioral phenotypes if KL or Kit KO is delayed until adulthood. Consistent with the interpretation that developmental compensation may be involved, the impact of postnatal PC KL KO on inhibitory drive to PCs is more pronounced than embryonic MLI Kit KO. Beyond direct inhibition of PCs, MLI:PC GABAergic inhibition constrains granule cell mediated PC dendritic excitation and thus gates the conversion of PC LTD to LTP at the PF-PC synapse in motor learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. It is therefore possible that KL or Kit KO may only reveal phenotypes in motor learning (or other cerebellar-plasticity dependent) behaviors; speaking to the feasibility of this possibility, global hypomorphs for KL or Kit have altered hippocampal neurophysiology and learning performance on a Water Maze task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. Continuous expression of KL and Kit in specific neurons may thus reflect not only a role in the development (or maintenance) of synaptic function as suggested here, but also in the plastic modulation of synaptic strength.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of future works to determine molecular mechanisms and organismal consequences, our study is a discrete advance because it establishes that KL-Kit regulates mammalian central synapse function. Here, we demonstrate impacts at the mouse GABAergic MLI:PC synapse; however, Kit and KL exist in diverse organisms and neuronal populations including glutamatergic neurons of the hippocampus, and neurons in olfactory bulb, basal forebrain, and brainstem. It is therefore feasible that the synaptic phenotypes reported here reflect that KL-Kit is broadly capable of influencing connectivity.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study from Zaman et al. demonstrates that the cKit-Kit ligand complex is necessary for the formation and/or maintenance of molecular layer interneuron synapses in cerebellar Purkinje cells. The evidence presented is <bold>convincing</bold>; in particular, the use of cell-type specific knockout of cKit in molecular layer interneurons and knockout of Kit ligand in Purkinje cells provides robust evidence. This work will be of particular relevance to those interested in inhibitory synapse formation or the role of inhibition in Purkinje cell behavior.</p>

<p>This manuscript from Zaman et al., investigates the role of cKit and Kit ligand in inhibitory synapse function at molecular layer interneuron (MLI) synapses onto cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC). cKit is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in multiple tissues, including select populations of neurons in the CNS. cKIt is activated by Kit ligand, a transmembrane protein typically expressed at the membrane of connected cells. A strength of this paper is the use of cell-specific knockouts of cKit and Kit ligand, in MLIs and PCs, respectively. In both cases, the frequency of spontaneous or miniature (in the presence of TTX) IPSCs was reduced. This suggests either a reduction in the number of functional inhibitory release sites or reduced release probability. IPSCs evoked by electrical stimulation in the molecular layer showed no change in paired-pulse ratio, indicating release probability is not changed in the cKit KO, and favoring a reduction in the number of release sites. Changes in IPSC amplitude were more subtle, with some analyses showing a decrease and others not. These data suggest that disruption of the cKit-Kit ligand complex reduces the number of functional synapses with only minor changes in synapse strength.</p>

<p>In their study, Zaman et al. demonstrate that deletion of either the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit from cerebellar interneurons or the kit ligand (KL) from Purkinje cells reduces the inhibition of Purkinje cells. They delete Kit or KL at different developmental time points, illustrating that Kit-KL interactions are not only required for developmental synapse formation but also for synapse maintenance in adult animals. The study is interesting as it highlights a molecular mechanism for the formation of inhibitory synapses onto Purkinje cells.</p>
<p>The tools generated, such as the floxed Kit mouse line and the virus for Kit overexpression, may have broader applications in neuroscience and beyond.</p>
<p>One general weakness is that Kit expression is not limited to molecular layer interneurons but also extends to the Purkinje layer and Golgi interneurons. But this expression does not conflict with the principal conclusions, as Purkinje layer interneurons form few or no synapses onto Purkinje cells.</p>
<p>In summary, the data support the hypothesis that the interaction between Kit and KL between cerebellar Molecular Layer Interneurons and Purkinje Cells plays a crucial role in promoting the formation and maintenance of inhibitory synapses onto PCs. This study provides valuable insights that could inform future investigations on how this mechanism contributes to the dynamic regulation of Purkinje cell inhibition across development and its impact on mouse behavior.</p>

<p>Summary: Bidirectional transsynaptic signaling via cell adhesion molecules and cell surface receptors contributes to the remarkable specificity of synaptic connectivity in the brain. Zaman et al., investigates how the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit and its trans-cellular kit ligand regulate molecular layer interneuron (MLI)- Purkinje cell (PC) connectivity in the cerebellum. Presynaptic Kit is specific for MLIs, and forms a trans-synaptic complex with Kit ligand in postsynaptic PC cells. The authors begin by generating Kit cKOs via an EUCOMM allele to enable cell-type specific Kit deletion. They cross this Kit cKO to the MLI-specific driver Pax2-Cre and conduct validation via Kit IHC and immunoblotting. Using this system to examine the functional consequences of presynaptic MLI Kit deletion onto postsynaptic PC cells, they record spontaneous and miniature synaptic currents from PC cells and find a selective reduction in IPSC frequency. Deletion of Kit ligand from postsynaptic PC cells also results in reduced IPSC frequency, together supporting that this trans-synaptic complex regulates GABAergic synaptic formation or maturation. The authors then show that sparse Kit ligand overexpression in PCs decreases neighboring uninfected control sIPSCs in a potential competitive manner.</p>
<p>Strengths: Overall, the study addresses an important open question, the data largely supports the authors conclusions, the experiments appear well-performed, and the manuscript is well-written. I just have a few suggestions to help shore up the author's interpretations and improve the study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The strong decrease in sIPSC frequency and amplitude in control uninfected cells in Figure 4 is surprising and puzzling. The competition model proposed is one possibility, and I think the authors need to do additional experiments to help support or refute this model. The authors can conduct similar synaptic staining experiments as in Fig S4 but in their sparse infection paradigm, comparing synapses on infected and uninfected cells. Additional electrophysiological parameters in the sparse injection paradigm, such as mIPSCs or evoked IPSCs, would also help support their conclusions.</p>
<p>The authors should validate KL overexpression and increased cell surface levels using their virus to support their overexpression conclusions.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>1. The immunolabeling data in Figure S4 shows no change in puncta number but reduced puncta size in Kit KO. sIPSC data show reduced frequency but little change in amplitude. These data would seem contradictory in that one suggests reduced synaptic strength, but not number, and the other suggests reduced synapse number, but not strength. How do the authors reconcile these results?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the synaptic puncta, In Kit KO (or KL KO), we have not detected an overt reduction in the average VGAT/Gephyrin/Calbindin positive puncta density or puncta size per animal. With respect to puncta size, only in the Kit KO condition, and only when individual puncta are assessed does this modest (~10%) difference in size become statistically significant.  In the revision, we eliminate this figure and focus on the per animal averages.</p>
<p>We interpret that the reduction in sIPSC and mIPSC frequency likely stems from a decreased proportion of functional synapse sites. The number of MLIs, their action potential generation, the density of synaptic puncta, and the ability of direct stimulation to evoke release and equivalent postsynaptic currents, are all similar in Control vs Kit KO. It is therefore feasible that a reduced frequency of postsynaptic inhibitory events is due to a reduced ability of MLI action potentials to invade the axon terminal, and/or an impaired ability for depolarization to drive (e.g. coordinated calcium flux) transmitter release. That is, while the number of MLIs and their synapses appear similar, the reduced mIPSC frequency suggests that there is a reduced proportion of, or probability that, Kit KO synapse sites that function properly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Related to point 1, it would be helpful to see immunolabeling data from Kit ligand KO mice? Do these show the same pattern of reduced puncta size but no change in number?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we have not added a figure, we have now added experiments and a corresponding analysis in the manuscript. As we had previously for Kit KO, we now for KL KO conducted IHC for VGAT, Gephyrin, and Calbindin, and we analyzed triple-positive synaptic puncta in the molecular layer of Pcp2 Cre KL KO mice and Control (Pcp2 Cre negative, KL floxed homozygous) mice.  We did not find a gross reduction in the average synaptic puncta size or density, or in the PSD-95 pinceau size. From this initial analysis, it appears that the presynaptic hypotrophy is more notable in the receptor than in the ligand knockout. We speculate that this is perhaps because the Kit receptor may have basal activity in the absence of Kit ligand, that Kit may serve a presynaptic scaffolding role that is lost in the receptor (but not the ligand) knockout, or simply that the embryonic timing of the Pax2 Cre vs Pcp2 Cre recombination events is more relevant to pinceaux development, especially as basket cells are born primarily prenatally.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The data using KL overexpression in PC (figure 4E,F) are intriguing, but puzzling. The reduction in sIPSC frequency and amplitude in the control PC is much greater than seen in the Kit or KL KO. The interpretation of these data, &quot;Thus, KL-Kit levels may not set the number of MLI:PC release sites, but may instead influence the proportion of synapses that are functional for neurotransmission (Figure 4G)&quot; is not clear and the reasoning here should be explained in more detail, perhaps in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have attempted to clarify this portion of the manuscript by eliminating the cartoon of the proposed model, and by revising and adding to the discussion. Either MLI Kit KO or PC KL KO seems to preserve the absolute number of MLI:PC anatomical synapse sites (IHC)  but to reduce the proportion of those synapse that are contributing to neurotransmission (mIPSC). We speculate that sparse PC KL overexpression (OX) may either 1) weaken inhibition to surrounding control PCs by either diminishing KL OX PC to KL Control PC inhibition, and/or 2) act retrogradely through MLI Kit to potentiate MLI:MLI inhibition, reducing the MLI:PC inhibition at neighboring Control PCs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>1. In the first sentence of the results, should &quot;Figure 1A, B&quot; be &quot;Figure C, D&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The top of page 6 states &quot;the mean mIPSC amplitude was ~10% greater in PC KL KO than in control&quot;,  this does not appear to be the case in Figure 3E. control and KL KO look very similar here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this portion of the text citing the modest 10% increase in mIPSC amplitude, we are referring to the average amplitude of all individual mIPSC events in the PC KL KO condition; in the figure referred to by the reviewer (3E), we are instead referring to the average of all mIPSC event amplitudes per KL KO PC. Because of the dramatic difference in sample size for individual events vs cells, this modest difference rises to statistical, if not biological, significance. We include this individual event analysis only to suggest that, since we in fact saw a slightly higher event amplitude in the KL KO condition, it is unlikely that a reduced amplitude would have been a technical reason that we detected a lower event frequency.</p>

<p>The global loss of Kit signaling is incompatible with life, as seen from perinatal lethality in other Kit Ligand or Kit mutant mouse lines or other conditional approaches. Furthermore, a loss of Kit signaling in germ cells impedes fertility. Thus, while not explicitly ruled out, since conditional Pax2 Cre mediated Kit KO animals were born, survived, and produced offspring in normal ratios, we do not suspect that germline recombination was a major issue in this specific study.</p>

</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>The rationale for regional focus has been added to the text. For MLI action potential recordings, we opted to sample the middle third of the molecular layer so that we would not be completely biased to either classic distal stellate vs proximal basket subtypes. It is our hope, in future optogenetic interrogations, to simultaneously record the dynamics of all MLI subtypes in a more unbiased way. With respect to internal solutions, we initially utilized a cesium chloride internal to maximize our ability to resolve differences in GABAA mediated currents, which was the hypothesis-driven focus of our study. While we agree that utilizing a single internal and changing the voltage clamp to arrive at per-cell analysis of Excitatory/Inhibitory input would have been most informative, our decision to utilize pharmacological methods was driven by our experience that achieving adequate voltage clamp across large Purkinje cells was often problematic, particularly in adult animals.</p>

<p>We now address this apparent discordance in the discussion. Pax2 Cre mediates recombination weeks ahead of Pcp2 Cre.

<p>The observation that control PC sIPSC frequency is lower in KL OX PCs than in sham is interesting. This observation would be consistent with overall inhibitory synapse density being preserved.

</disp-quote>
<p>Because we have now analyzed and failed to find an overt (per animal average) change in synaptic puncta size or density in the whole animal Control vs PCP2 Cre mediated KL KO conditions, we do not have confidence that it is feasible to pursue this IHC strategy in the sparse viral-mediated KL KO or OX conditions. To the reviewerâs valid point however, we intend to probe the spatial extent/specificity of the sparse phenomenon when we are resourced to complement the KL/Kit manipulations with transgenic methods for evaluating MLI-PC synapses specifically, potentially by GRASP or related methods that would not be confounded by PC-PC synapses. Transgenic MLI access would also facilitate determining the spatial extent to which opto-genetically activated MLIs evoke equivalent responses in Control vs KL manipulated PCs.</p>

<p>For now, based upon transgenic animal availability, we have now included an evaluation of PC firing in the (Pax2 Cre mediated) Kit KO condition.

A KS test of individual ISI durations for Control vs Kit KO did reveal a difference (p&lt;0.0001). We have added a supplementary figure (S6) with this data.  It is possible that in the more phenotypic PC KL KO condition that we may find a difference in these PC spiking patterns of PC firing, however, we are also eager to test in future studies whether postnatal KL or Kit KO impairs the ability of MLI activation to produce pauses or other alterations in PC firing or in PF-PC mediated plasticity.</p>
