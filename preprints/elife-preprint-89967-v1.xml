<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>A gain-of-function mutation in the TALK-1 K<sup>+</sup> channel (p.L114P) associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) was recently reported in two distinct families. TALK-1 is a key regulator of β-cell electrical activity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). <italic>KCNK16</italic>, the gene that encodes TALK-1, is the most abundant and β-cell– restricted K<sup>+</sup> channel transcript; polymorphisms in the <italic>KCNK16</italic> locus are also associated with an increased risk of type-2 diabetes. To investigate the impact of TALK-1-L114P on glucose homeostasis and confirm its association with MODY, a mouse model containing the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation was generated. Heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice exhibit increased neonatal lethality in the C57BL/6J and the mixed C57BL/6J:CD-1(ICR) genetic background, respectively. Lethality is likely a result of severe hyperglycemia observed in the homozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P neonates due to lack of GSIS and can be reduced with insulin treatment. TALK-1-L114P drastically increased whole-cell β-cell K<sup>+</sup> currents resulting in blunted glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and loss of glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Thus, adult <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice have reduced GSIS and plasma insulin levels, which significantly impaired glucose homeostasis. Taken together, this study determined that the MODY-associated TALK-1-L114P mutation disrupts glucose homeostasis in adult mice resembling a MODY phenotype and causes neonatal lethality by altering islet hormone secretion during development. These data strongly suggest that TALK-1 is an islet-restricted target for the treatment of diabetes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is a collection of monogenic forms of early-onset familial diabetes resulting from β-cell dysfunction. To date, mutations in 15 genes involved in β-cell development and function have been associated with MODY(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Monogenic diabetes cases account for approximately 1%-5% of the total diabetic patient population(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). However, as the phenotype of MODY overlaps with other forms of diabetes, many patients are misdiagnosed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Data from monogenic diabetes registries also suggests that in the US, ∼70% of the registered cases (2680/3800) still do not have a known genetic cause, and similarly many patients in the UK (∼50%) with monogenic diabetes have MODY-causing mutations that remain to be determined(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Additionally, some MODY-associated mutations are only reported in single families, and thus require genetic and mechanistic confirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). We recently identified a mutation in <italic>KCNK16</italic>, the gene encoding TALK-1 channels (p. TALK-1 L114P), which co-segregates with MODY in a four-generation family(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Importantly, this mutation causes a gain-of-function (GOF) in TALK-1 channel activity. As <italic>KCNK16</italic> is the most islet-restricted and abundant β-cell K<sup>+</sup> channel transcript, the TALK-1 L114P mutation is likely to perturb β-cell function and cause MODY(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). This was further strengthened by a recent report of a Japanese family with the identical <italic>KCNK16</italic> mutation (p. TALK-1 L114P) segregating with MODY(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Thus, it is important to determine the mechanistic underpinnings of how this specific mutation in TALK-1 impacts islet function and results in glucose dyshomeostasis.</p>
<p>TALK-1 is a key regulator of β-cell membrane potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>), glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and insulin secretion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). A non-synonymous GOF polymorphism in <italic>KCNK16</italic> (rs1535500; p. TALK-1 A277E) is also associated with an increased risk for type-2 diabetes (T2D)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Moreover, we recently determined that the MODY-associated TALK-1 L114P mutation results in a significant GOF in TALK-1 K<sup>+</sup> flux(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Thus, there is strong genetic evidence that alterations in TALK-1 function (e.g., TALK-1 L114P and TALK-1 A277E) result in diabetic phenotypes. Interestingly, when heterologously expressed in β-cells, TALK-1 L114P almost completely inhibited glucose-stimulated <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in most β-cells. While these TALK-1 L114P-mediated drastic changes in electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> would be predicted to fully inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), they only resulted in partial blunting of β-cell GSIS. However, this is consistent with TALK-1 L114P MODY patients that required low-dose insulin therapy which also suggested that this mutation does not fully suppress GSIS. This differs from previous studies showing that inhibition of β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx with either K<sup>+</sup> channel pharmacological activation or GOF mutations (e.g., K<sub>ATP</sub> R201H) results in complete inhibition of GSIS(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Therefore, it is critical to determine if endogenous TALK-1 L114P expression also shows complete inhibition of β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and how this impacts GSIS. Another potential mechanism for the modest impact of TALK-1 L114P on GSIS could be due to its function in other islet cells. For example, TALK-1 is also expressed in δ-cells where its activity limits somatostatin secretion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>).</p>
<p>Because somatostatin exerts inhibitory tone on islet β- and α-cells, TALK-1 L114P mediated reductions in δ-cell somatostatin secretion would be predicted to increase both glucagon and insulin secretion. Due to the β-cell intrinsic role of TALK-1 L114P channels, the effect of somatostatin on GSIS might be limited, however it remains to be determined if the fasting hyperglycemia observed in <italic>KCNK16</italic>-MODY patients is due in part to elevated glucagon secretion.</p>
<p>The nature and severity of MODY phenotypes is dictated by how specific gene mutations affect β-cell function. K<sub>ATP</sub> is the only ion channel besides TALK-1 to be linked to MODY; this is due to mutations in genes encoding the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel complex (<italic>KCNJ11</italic> and <italic>ABCC8</italic>) or mutations in genes affecting ATP synthesis (e.g., glucokinase)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Interestingly, MODY-associated mutations in <italic>KCNJ11</italic> and <italic>ABCC8</italic> have also been found to cause other diabetic phenotypes including permanent or transient neonatal diabetes, and late-onset diabetes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Although the two families with TALK-1 L114P primarily exhibit a MODY phenotype, it remains to be determined if <italic>KCNK16</italic> mutations are associated with other diabetic phenotypes besides MODY. Indeed, it was originally predicted that GOF TALK-1 mutations could cause neonatal diabetes, however, the voltage dependence of activation of TALK-1 makes this less likely that GOF TALK-1 channels would be active at resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Thus, TALK-1 GOF would limit but not abolish GSIS during β-cell glucose-mediated <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization and cause MODY. As K<sub>ATP</sub> channels show larger unitary conductance than TALK-1, and are active at resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>, severe GOF in K<sub>ATP</sub> channels strongly suppress β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The biophysical differences in K<sub>ATP</sub> and TALK-1 especially in the context of nucleotide-gating predict differences in their corresponding MODY phenotypes. The phenotypes of <italic>KCNJ11</italic>- and <italic>ABCC8</italic>-MODY are well characterized; however, with only two known <italic>KCNK16</italic>-MODY families, it remains to be elucidated how endogenous TALK-1 L114P disrupts islet electrical activity and glucose homeostasis.</p>
<p>Here we developed a mouse model harboring the MODY-associated <italic>Kcnk16</italic> variant p. TALK-1 L114P to investigate the impact of this mutation on glucose homeostasis and confirm its association with MODY. Interestingly, we observe increased neonatal lethality in heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice in the C57BL/6J (B6) and the B6;CD-1(ICR) mixed genetic backgrounds, respectively, likely due to severe hyperglycemia and lack of GSIS. Whereas in adult mice, TALK-1-L114P blunts glucose-stimulated β-cell electrical activity, Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, and GSIS, thus significantly impairing glucose tolerance. These data strongly suggest that alterations in TALK-1 activity can disrupt islet hormone secretion and glucose homeostasis. Importantly, this study further confirms that the TALK-1-L114P mutation results in a MODY phenotype, but additionally predicts that GOF TALK-1 mutations cause transient neonatal diabetes.</p>

<title><italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P neonates exhibit loss of glucose stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and insulin secretion leading to transient neonatal hyperglycemia and death.</title>
<p>To confirm the association of TALK-1 L114P in causing MODY, a mouse model harboring the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> mutation was developed in the C57BL/6J background using CRISPR/spCas9 (B6 <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and supplemental figures 1A and 1B). Surprisingly, heterozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice exhibited neonatal lethality as indicated by extremely low number of <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice at weaning (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). To increase the likelihood of survival of neonates, B6 <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice were crossed with the outbred CD-1(ICR) mouse strain resulting in a progeny in the mixed (50:50) background (B6;CD-1 <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Intriguingly, in the mixed background, neonatal lethality was observed in the homozygous B6;CD-1 <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (P/P) mice on ∼post-natal day 4 (P4), but not in the heterozygous B6;CD-1 <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice (Supplemental figure 1C). Lethality was likely independent of growth defects as body weight did not differ between genotypes (Supplemental figure 1D). To test if lethality occurs from GOF TALK-1 L114P mediated defect in neonatal islet function, we assessed glycemic control and insulin secretion on P4. Heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P neonates showed severe hyperglycemia and a concurrent reduction in plasma insulin levels in a gene-dosage dependent manner compared to the control littermates (WT) on P4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, and supplemental figure 1E). Additionally, TALK-1 L114P mutation blunted GSIS in islets from heterozygous neonates and decreased it further in islets from homozygous neonates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). These changes in GSIS and glucose homeostasis are likely due to TALK-1 L114P mediated alteration in islet function and not islet mass as pancreas weight was unchanged (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and supplemental figure 1F). Furthermore, neonatal islet composition was unaltered except for a modest increase in the α-cell (glucagon+) area/islet in the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P(L/P) pancreas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H-J</xref>). The loss of GSIS can be explained by a complete lack of glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in islets from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P and P/P) neonates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1K-N</xref>). However, these islets exhibited KCl-mediated β-cell <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry; this indicates that TALK-1 L114P channels hyperpolarize β-cell <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>, thereby overriding the effect of K<sub>ATP</sub> closure due to glucose metabolism and lead to insufficient GSIS and hyperglycemia. Importantly, insulin treatment (Glargine Lantus; 0.2U/Kg/day, once-daily subcutaneous injection) was able to extend the lifespan of <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (P/P) neonates suggesting that lethality results from hyperglycemia due to inadequate insulin secretion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1O</xref>).</p>

<title>Adult <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice exhibit fasting hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance</title>
<p>Because neonatal <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice showed transient hyperglycemia, we next assessed if TALK-1 L114P impairs glucose homeostasis in young-adulthood. Male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice developed glucose intolerance as early as 11-weeks of age in the B6;CD-1 background and 8-weeks of age in the B6 background compared to their respective control littermates (data not shown). This defect in glucose homeostasis is maintained with age in the male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A-C</xref> and supplemental figures 2A-C). Furthermore, male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice also exhibit fasting hyperglycemia indicating a likely non-β-cell-specific islet defect in this mouse model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). There were no body weight differences in males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, the female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice develop moderate glucose intolerance compared to the controls (WT) in both B6 and B6;CD-1 genetic backgrounds (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E-G</xref> and supplemental figures 2D-F). Moreover, TALK-1 L114P mutation leads to greater body weight gain in females compared to the WT controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>); this increase is likely contributed by lean mass which might render a protective effect on glucose tolerance in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) females compared to their male counterparts (Supplemental figures 3A-F).

Insulin sensitivity was not altered in the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice indicating that the reduction in glucose tolerance is primarily due to an islet secretion defect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). This was confirmed by in vitro GSIS and glucose-inhibition of glucagon secretion (GIGS) measurements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Islets from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice exhibited reduced ability to secrete insulin in response to glucose and showed elevated glucagon secretion under low glucose (2 mM) and euglycemic (7 mM) conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). This indicates that the fasting hyperglycemia observed in male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) is likely a result of the observed increase in glucagon secretion under fasting conditions.

<p>We used patch-clamp electrophysiology to test if the reduction in GSIS results from decreased β-cell electrical excitability due to a GOF in TALK-1 activity in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mouse islets.

However, TALK-1 L114P (L/P and P/P) channels did not show a massive GOF at hyperpolarized β-cell membrane potentials under low and high glucose where these K<sup>+</sup> currents are typically active (Supplementary figures 4A and 4B). Notably, the heterologously expressed human TALK-1 L114P channels exhibited a drastic GOF (&gt;300-fold)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>); this suggests the likelihood of unknown endogenous regulator(s) of TALK-1 in β-cells. It is also likely that recording conditions lead to poor isolation of the endogenous TALK-1 L114P currents. Thus, K2P currents were assessed by overexpressing mouse TALK-1 L114P channels in HEK293T cells under identical recording conditions as the human TALK-1 L114P study. Indeed, overexpression of the mouse mutant channel results in large K<sup>+</sup> currents indicative of a similar GOF in mouse TALK-1 current as the human TALK-1 current due to the L114P mutation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P reduces glucose- and tolbutamide-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and augments IP<sub>3</sub>-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> release.</title>
<p>β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was monitored in response to increasing concentrations of glucose (G) in islets from WT and <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice to assess if TALK-1 L114P-mediated <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> hyperpolarization reduces glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (GSCI). TALK-1 L114P blunted islet GSCI in mice on both B6 and B6;CD-1 genetic backgrounds compared to WT controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A-F</xref> and supplemental figures 5A and 5B). However, islets from male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice showed a larger reduction in normalized Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak and normalized area under the curve (AUC) in response to glucose compared to their controls than islets from female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice compared to their controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A-F</xref>). TALK-1 L114P channels did not affect the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at 2 mM G; however, the activity of mutant channels resulted in increased glucose-stimulated phase 0 response compared to controls (Supplemental figures 6A and 6B). This suggests a reduction in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>) storage in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets. Furthermore, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets also showed a complete lack of glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations monitored at 9 mM G (Supplemental figures 6C and 6D). We then assessed if the reduction in GSCI results from TALK-1 L114P overactivity on the β-cell plasma membrane by monitoring tolbutamide-stimulated <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. TALK-1 L114P mediated β-cell <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> hyperpolarization overrides the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization caused by K<sub>ATP</sub> closure by tolbutamide. Thus, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets do not exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in response to tolbutamide. Interestingly, islets from TALK-1 L114P mice showed equivalent KCl-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry compared to control islets; this suggests that the loss of GSCI in the TALK-1 L114P islets occurs due to enhanced K<sup>+</sup> ion flux through GOF in TALK-1 activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>). Our previous studies showed that TALK-1 channels are expressed on the ER membrane where they function to provide a K<sup>+</sup> countercurrent for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER lumen(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Thus, we tested if TALK-1 L114P regulates [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> homeostasis by stimulating G<sub>q</sub>-signaling using acetylcholine which results in IP<sub>3</sub> generation, subsequently causing IP<sub>3</sub>-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> release. Indeed, IP<sub>3</sub>-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> release was enhanced in islets from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice compared to controls suggesting that GOF TALK-1 channels are localized to the ER membrane where they facilitate increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER lumen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5I</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5J</xref>).</p>

<title>TALK-1 L114P islets exhibit altered expression of genes involved in β-cell identity, function, ion channel activity, hormone activity, inflammatory signaling, and extracellular <bold>matrix interaction pathways.</bold></title>
<p>Despite the loss of glucose-stimulated islet electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice do not exhibit a drastic reduction in GSIS and overt diabetes. Therefore, compensatory mechanisms such as the amplification pathway for insulin secretion might be altered in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Moreover, prolonged hyperglycemia (although modest in this model), would also be predicted to result in long-term gene expression changes in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets that alter β-cell function. Thus, gene expression differences between WT and <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mouse islets were quantified with bulk-RNA sequencing and validated with qRT-PCR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref> A-D). We observed increased expression of many genes which regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent potentiation of insulin secretion such as <italic>Adcy5</italic>, <italic>Creb5, Adcyap1, and Adcyap1r1</italic>; genes that may promote Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent secretion from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Additionally, broad changes in ion channel activity genes (e.g., <italic>Cacna1g, Cacng8, Scn5a, Pkd1l1, Kcnk2, Gabrg1</italic>, and <italic>Fxyd3</italic>) may contribute to altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets. Reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets results in decreased expression of genes previously shown to be elevated in chronically depolarized <italic>Abcc8</italic><sup>−/−</sup> β-cells such as <italic>Serpina7</italic>, <italic>Asb11</italic>, <italic>Sall1</italic>, and <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Finally, several stress-associated, fibrosis-related, and inflammatory signaling pathway genes are upregulated in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets likely due to prolonged hyperglycemic conditions. These include dedifferentiation markers <italic>Sox4, Sox6, Sox9, Hk2, Vim,</italic> and <italic>Cd36</italic>, extracellular matrix-interaction pathway genes <italic>Col1a1</italic>, <italic>Col1a2</italic>, <italic>Col3a1</italic>, <italic>Col14a1</italic>, <italic>Col6a1</italic>, <italic>and Dcn</italic>, and inflammatory signaling genes <italic>Cxcl1</italic>, <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ccl11</italic>, <italic>Ccl22</italic>, <italic>Tgfb2, Il33</italic>, <italic>and Il6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>GOF in TALK-1 activity is associated with diabetic phenotypes, suggesting a causal role for overactive TALK-1 in islet dysfunction and diabetes progression. Utilizing a GOF model of TALK-1 (L114P) this study uncovered that disrupted β-cell and α-cell function resulted in glucose intolerance in adolescent mice confirming the association of the TALK-1 L114P mutation with MODY-like diabetes. Importantly, our data also revealed that TALK-1 L114P mutation can cause transient neonatal diabetes. This finding suggests that transient neonatal diabetic patients with unknown genetic diagnosis should be screened for mutations in <italic>KCNK16.</italic> Moreover, our data provides further genetic evidence that TALK-1 is a potentially novel therapeutic target for diabetes treatment. Specifically, in mice heterozygous for <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation we observe neonatal hyperglycemia due to blunted GSIS, which can additionally result in neonatal death in mice homozygous for the mutant allele of <italic>Kcnk16</italic>. In young-adulthood, TALK-1 L114P causes glucose intolerance due to a reduction in GSIS mediated by enhanced β-cell <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> hyperpolarization and reduced glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. In addition to the β-cell intrinsic defect, the TALK-1 L114P mutation led to an increase in α-cell area fraction in islets and elevation of glucagon secretion under fasting conditions. Together these data highlight the crucial role of TALK-1 in β-cell function and glucose homeostasis and raise the possibility of TALK-1 inhibition as a druggable target for not only <italic>KCNK16</italic>-associated MODY but possibly for other forms of diabetes. Unlike the only other MODY-associated K<sup>+</sup> channelopathy (<italic>KCNJ11</italic> and <italic>ABCC8</italic> i.e., K<sub>ATP</sub> channel mutations), TALK-1 is not inhibited by sulfonylureas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>β-cell maturation and glucose-responsiveness of neonatal islets rapidly develops after birth and GSIS is required for efficient glucose uptake, which contributes to normal growth. Following birth, a shift to intermittent feeding and elevated plasma glucose requires an increase in β-cell insulin secretion for efficient nutrient absorption, as well as a suppression of insulin release during fasting to avoid hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Glucose-sensitivity in mouse β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and insulin secretion develops over the first 4 postnatal days due to changes in β-cell metabolism, K<sub>ATP</sub> surface localization, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent secretory machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Thus, mice expressing ATP-insensitive K<sub>ATP</sub> channels die shortly after birth due to hypoinsulinemia, severe hyperglycemia, and ketoacidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice show a similar phenotype, with neonatal islets showing a complete loss of GSCI, a drastic reduction in GSIS, and severe hyperglycemia by P5. Interestingly, TALK-1 L114P-mediated susceptibility to neonatal lethality was dependent on genetic diversity in mouse strains. Heterozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P caused almost complete neonatal lethality in the B6 background but only hyperglycemia in the B6:CD-1 background, whereas homozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P led to neonatal lethality in the B6:CD-1 mice. Although the neonatal glycemic data from the <italic>KCNK16</italic> L114P families does not exist, it may be that neonatal lethality is not observed in affected individuals. However, it is interesting to note that all currently identified individuals carrying the <italic>KCNK16</italic> L114P mutation are females (N=8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The importance of hypoinsulinemia in causing neonatal diabetes and lethality in TALK-1 L114P mice was confirmed by insulin treatment which extended their lifespan. This resembles other monogenic forms of neonatal diabetes that require exogenous insulin treatment for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Indeed, it has been well established that insulin signaling is required for neonatal survival; for example, a similar neonatal lethality phenotype was observed in mice without insulin receptors (<italic>Insr</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) where death results from hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis by P3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Future studies are required to determine if TALK-1 GOF mutations result in human transient neonatal diabetes and are possibly followed by a MODY phenotype. Other monogenic diabetes mutations such as in genes encoding K<sub>ATP</sub> channels result in transient neonatal diabetes and diabetes remits later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>).</p>
<p>In adolescence, the timeline of development of MODY-like diabetes in the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) model is consistent with data from MODY patients. Similar to the timeline of disease progression in other MODY mouse models, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice developed glucose intolerance during adolescence (∼8 weeks in the B6 strain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). The onset and severity of glucose intolerance in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice also recapitulates the data from probands from the Japanese and Australian <italic>KCNK16</italic> L114P MODY families, who were diagnosed at 11 and 15 years of age and displayed an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (blood glucose:19 and 19.6 mmol/L, 2 hours after 75 g oral glucose bolus, respectively). The disease severity is more prominent in the inbred B6 strain compared to the mixed B6:CD-1 strain likely owing to the outbred characteristics and genetic diversity of the CD-1 strain, which recapitulates the diverse nature of MODY manifestation observed in human patients. Intriguingly, the patients from the Japanese <italic>KCNK16</italic> L114P MODY family showed a greater insulin requirement compared to the patients from Australian <italic>KCNK16</italic> L114P MODY family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Interestingly, male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice exhibit more severe impairment in glucose homeostasis compared to female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice. A variety of factors could be at play here which could explain the observed sex-differences, including the female hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) which is critical for protection against glucolipotoxicity and oxidative stress(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Furthermore, for a given insulin action, comparing older men and women, women have higher insulin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Moreover, GSCI in islets from female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice is significantly greater than islets from male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice, which would be predicted to lead to greater insulin secretion and lesser impairment in glucose tolerance in female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice. Sexual dimorphism observed in GSCI could be mediated by differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling or differences in TALK-1 function. Whether sex-differences exist in humans with TALK-1 L114P mutation remains to be determined as all affected individuals in both <italic>KCNK16</italic>-MODY (p. TALK-1 L114P) families were females. Neonatal lethality was more penetrant in male than female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (P/P) mice, thus, it will also be important to determine if <italic>KCNK16</italic>-MODY patients show neonatal phenotypes and display sexual dimorphism.</p>
<p>Similar to the proband from the human <italic>KCNK16</italic> L114P MODY family who showed elevated fasting blood glucose (∼7mmol/L), <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice also exhibit fasting hyperglycemia. While this was predicted to be due to decreased insulin secretion, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets showed equivalent insulin secretion under euglycemic conditions. However, these islets exhibited a significant elevation in fasting glucagon secretion which likely contributes to the fasting hyperglycemia. If TALK-1 L114P channels were expressed in α-cells, it would result in inhibition of α-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and glucagon secretion which supports previously described lack of TALK-1 protein expression in α-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). This suggests that hyperglucagonemia in TALK-1 L114P islets is likely due to loss of inhibitory paracrine signaling. As insulin secretion does not change under fasting and euglycemic conditions, hyperglucagonemia might primarily be mediated by reduced somatostatin secretion. This is supported by a significant decrease in <italic>Sst</italic> expression in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), which is likely due to reduced δ-cell secretion. Also, our previous data in global TALK-1 KO mice show higher islet somatostatin secretion and lower glucagon secretion, thus δ-cell TALK-1 L114P would be predicted to limit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and somatostatin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets additionally exhibit increased α-cell area fraction and a concurrent modest reduction in β-cell area fraction compared to control islets. These changes in islet composition are consistent with both type-1 diabetes (T1D) and T2D data showing increased α-cell: β-cell ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), which show elevated islet glucagon secretion. α-cell hyperplasia may result from increased activity/secretion, which is supported by other mediators of α-cell secretion (e.g., amino acids) that cause hyperplasia as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). However, loss of somatostatin also elevates α-cell secretion without altering α-cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Moreover, the increased somatostatin and insulin secretion only result in reduced α-cell secretion without altering α-cell number. Thus, the exact mechanism of how TALK-1 L114P mediates increased α-cell number is not fully understood. Taken together, the <italic>KcnK16</italic> L114P mouse model shows disrupted glucagon and insulin secretion leading to fasting hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance, which provides confirmation that TALK-1 GOF mutations likely cause MODY.</p>
<p>One obstacle in determining how MODY-associated mutations result in β-cell dysfunction is the limited availability of primary islet tissue from MODY families. Due to this, the initial assessment of MODY-associated human TALK-1 L114P was performed in overexpression systems, which resulted in a drastic GOF. Similarly, overexpression of mouse <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P also leads to a significant GOF in TALK-1 activity (7.96-fold at −30 mV and 6.13-fold at 0 mV compared to TALK-1 WT). However, surprisingly β-cells from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P and P/P) mice showed only a modest GOF in K2P currents. While the slight increase in β-cell K<sup>+</sup> conductance from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice would be predicted to partially alter islet excitability, these islets exhibit a complete loss of glucose-stimulated <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization. This suggests that endogenous TALK-1 L114P polarizes plasma membrane potential, which is further supported by the robust KCl-induced <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry observed in these islets. Because KCl shifts the reversal potential of K<sup>+</sup> channels to a more depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>, the constant <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> hyperpolarization in TALK-1 L114P β-cells likely results from increased K<sup>+</sup> conductance through these channels. Yet, K<sup>+</sup> conductance in TALK-1 L114P β-cells was not significantly different at the hyperpolarized membrane potentials which these cells reside at under low and high glucose conditions. The recording conditions may lead to poor isolation of the endogenous TALK-1 L114P currents; however, overexpression of this mutant channel results in large K<sup>+</sup> currents under identical recording conditions. The K<sup>+</sup> conductance differences between heterologously versus endogenously expressed TALK-1 L114P channels points towards unidentified regulators of β-cell TALK-1 activity which could include endogenous ligands, protein interactions, and cellular localization of the channel. This is presumably not due to changes in TALK-1 protein levels because <italic>Kcnk16</italic> mRNA expression was not altered in control and <italic>Kcnk16</italic> (c. 337 T&gt;C) islets. The subtle increase in β-cell K<sup>+</sup> conductance correlates with a modest MODY-like phenotype and likely allows for incomplete suppression of β-cell function. This is also observed in K<sub>ATP</sub>-MODY, where channel activity is only modestly increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Importantly, our study suggests that drastic TALK-1 GOF mutations only lead to modest β-cell K<sup>+</sup> conductance, which may explain why both families with TALK-1 MODY carry the same pore-domain mutation (L114P) in TALK-1. Additionally, it is likely that other less-severe GOF mutations in TALK-1 (e.g., A277E) result in a milder phenotype such as T2D. Thus, it will be important to establish endogenous modulators of TALK-1 channels (WT and L114P) and how they contribute to β-cell dysfunction.</p>
<p>Suppression of glucose-stimulated electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets would be predicted to cause a greater reduction of GSIS than that observed. However, a few β-cells from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice show modest <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization; this resulted in a slight increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to glucose in a small subset of <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets, which could result in some GSIS. Interestingly, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets also show reduced expression of <italic>Fxyd3,</italic> which encodes the auxiliary subunit of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and is a known negative regulator of GSIS in diabetic mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Other interesting gene expression differences that may increase GSIS in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets include elevated expression (2.13-fold) of <italic>Adcy5</italic>, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent amplification pathway gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). In humans, <italic>Adcy5</italic> depletion impairs glucose-dependent elevation of cAMP and associated insulin secretion, thus elevation in <italic>Adcy5</italic> expression would be predicted to increase GSIS via cAMP signaling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Expression levels of other cAMP-dependent pathway genes were also elevated in the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets including <italic>Creb5, Adcyap1,</italic> and <italic>Adcyap1r1</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Moreover, <italic>Slit1</italic> and <italic>Srgap3</italic>, part of the SLIT-ROBO signaling which enhances GSIS, were upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). SLIT-ROBO signaling regulates not only Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling but also actin remodeling and thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent signaling pathways. These gene expression changes suggest an increase in GSCI-independent mechanism(s) of insulin secretion may compensate for TALK-1 L114P-mediated loss of β-cell electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.</p>
<p>Chronic hyperglycemia in diabetic patients and rodents results in islet dysfunction and destruction, thus hyperglycemia observed in the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice could exacerbate β-cell failure. Glucotoxicity results in numerous islet transcriptome changes that in-part contribute to dysfunction. Similar to islets from diabetic patients, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets exhibit an increase in <italic>Aldob</italic> (124.6-fold) and <italic>Nnat</italic> (1.7-fold) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Pdk4</italic> expression, a marker for the shift from utilization of glucose to fatty acids as the primary fuel source, is higher in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets (2.78-fold). Elevated islet PDK4 expression is also observed in patients with T2D and in animals on a HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Although hyperglycemia would be predicted to negatively impact <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islet function, no overt changes in β-cell mass were observed in these mice. This differs from mice with islets expressing K<sub>ATP</sub> GOF mutation, which show loss of β-cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P may not cause a significant β-cell destruction because these mice show sufficient GSIS to prevent overt diabetes.</p>
<p>In summary, we showed that the MODY-associated TALK-1 L114P mutation elevates α-cell glucagon secretion under fasting and euglycemic conditions and blunts glucose-stimulated β-cell electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry leading to reduced insulin secretion. Together, elevated glucagon impairs fasting glycemia and reduced GSIS increases post-prandial glucose levels in adults. This phenotype was more prominent in the male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice compared to the female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice raising the question whether sex-differences translate in humans carrying this mutation. Surprisingly, the TALK-1 L114P mutation also resulted in severe transient neonatal diabetes which was lethal in the C57Bl/6J genetic background. Thus, these data hold potential clinical utility in that neonatal diabetes patients with unknown genetic linkage should be screened for mutations in <italic>KCNK16</italic>. Together, these data strengthen the rationale for designing TALK-1 inhibitors for use as a therapeutic modality to treat diabetes.</p>

<p>This paper focuses on the effects of a L114P mutation in the TALK-1 channel on islet function and diabetes. This mutation is clinically relevant and a cause of MODY diabetes. This work employs a mouse model with heterozygous and homozygous mutants. The homozygous mice are homozygous lethal from severe hyperglycemia. The work shows that the mutation increases K+ currents and inhibits insulin secretion. This is a very nice paper with mechanistic insight and clear clinical importance. It is generally well-written and the data is well-presented.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This work follows previous work from the group where they have demonstrated the role of TASK1 in the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, a recent study links a mutation in KCNK16, the gene encoding TALK-1 channels to MODY. Here the authors have constructed a mouse model with the specific mutation (TALK-1 L114P mutation) and investigated the phenotype. They have to perform a couple of breeding tricks to find a model that is lethal in adult which might complicate the conclusions, however, the phenotype of the heterozygote model used has a MODY-like phenotype. The study is convincing and solid.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. The work is a natural follow-up from previous studies from the groups.</p>
<p>2. The authors present convincing and solid data that in the long perspective will help patients with these mutations.</p>
<p>3. Both in vivo and in vitro data are presented to give the full picture of the phenotype.</p>
<p>4. Data from both female and male mice are presented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The authors perform an RNA-sequencing showing that the cAMP amplifying pathway is upregulated. A weakness is that this is not further followed up. The remaining questions include; Is this also true in humans with this mutation? Would treatment with incretins improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and and lower blood glucose?</p>
<p>2. The authors avoid further investigating what it means that the glucagon area and secretion are increased in the model.</p>
<p>3. The performance of measurements in both male and female mice is praiseworthy. However, despite differences in the response, the authors do not investigate the potential reason for this. Are hormonal differences of importance?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The L114P gain of function mutation in the K2P channel TALK-1 encoded by KCNJ16 has been associated with MODY. In this study, Nakhe et al. generated mice carrying L114P TALK-1 and evaluated the impact of the mutation on glucose homeostasis. The authors report that the mutation increases neonatal lethality, owing to hyperglycemia caused by a lack of glucose-stimulated Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion. Adult mutant mice showed glucose intolerance and fasting hyperglycemia, which is attributed to blunted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion as well as increased glucagon secretion. Interestingly, male mice were more affected than female mice. Islets from adult mutant mice were found to have reduced Ca2+ entry upon glucose stimulation but also enhanced IP3-induced ER Ca2+ release, consistent with previous studies from the group showing a role of TALK-1 in ER Ca2+ homeostasis. Finally, a comparison of bulk RNA sequencing results from WT and mutant islets revealed altered expression of genes involved in β-cell identification, function, and signalling, which also contributes to the observed islet dysfunction.</p>
<p>The study is in general well designed and executed, and the conclusions are largely supported by the experimental evidence. The results confirm the pathogenic effect of L114P TALK-1 in human MODY. The findings that the mutation causes neonatal diabetes and affects male mice more than female mice have potential clinical implications with regard to genetic screening and diagnosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
A major strength of the study is the detailed characterization of the mutant mice in two different genetic backgrounds. The overall results provide compelling evidence that L114P TALK-1 disrupts glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and causes hyperglycemia. The neonatal diabetes phenotype and the gender difference in adults uncovered by the study are significant and should be considered in human patients. Results showing that the mutation not only attenuates membrane depolarization and Ca2+ entry upon glucose stimulation but also enhances IP3-induced ER Ca2+ release is consistent with the channel's dual role in membrane hyperpolarization and in providing counter currents to support ER Ca2+ release. The observed altered islet cell composition and the RNA seq data also add to the story and suggest the mutation has secondary effects that could explain the phenotypes observed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Some conclusions lack definitive evidence. For example, the authors conclude that L114P TALK-1 causes transient neonatal diabetes but there is no longitudinal glucose monitoring data to show remission of the diabetes. The contribution to defective insulin response from defects in plasma membrane depolarization relative to that from ER Ca2+ mishandling is not addressed. It is unclear whether the altered Ca2+ release in response to Ach is a direct result of GOF TALK-1 in the ER membrane or is due to the many transcriptional changes observed in the mutant islets.</p>
