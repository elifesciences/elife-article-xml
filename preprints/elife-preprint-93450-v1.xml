<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Diaphorina citri</italic> is the primary vector of the bacterium, ‘<italic>Candidatus</italic> Liberibacter asiaticus’ (<italic>C</italic>Las) associated with the severe Asian form of huanglongbing. <italic>C</italic>Las-positive <italic>D. citri</italic> are more fecund than their <italic>C</italic>Las-negative counterparts and require extra energy expenditure. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms linking metabolism and reproduction is of particular importance. In this present study, we found adipokinetic hormone (<italic>DcAKH</italic>) and its receptor (<italic>DcAKHR</italic>) were essential for increased lipid metabolism and fecundity in response to <italic>C</italic>Las infection in <italic>D. citri.</italic> Knockdown of <italic>DcAKH</italic> and <italic>DcAKHR</italic> not only resulted in triacylglycerol accumulation and a decline of glycogen, but also significantly decreased fecundity and <italic>C</italic>Las titer in ovaries. Combined <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments showed that miR-34 suppresses <italic>DcAKHR</italic> expression by binding to its 3’ untranslated region, whilst overexpression of miR-34 resulted in a decline of <italic>DcAKHR</italic> expression and <italic>C</italic>Las titer in ovaries and caused defects that mimicked <italic>DcAKHR</italic> knockdown phenotypes. In addition, knockdown of <italic>DcAKH</italic> and <italic>DcAKHR</italic> significantly reduced juvenile hormone (JH) titer and JH signaling pathway genes in fat bodies and ovaries, including the JH receptor, <italic>methoprene-tolerant</italic> (<italic>DcMet</italic>), and the transcription factor, <italic>Krüppel homolog 1 (DcKr-h1)</italic>, that acts downstream of it, as well as the egg development related genes <italic>vitellogenin 1-like</italic> (<italic>DcVg-1-like</italic>), <italic>vitellogenin A1-like</italic> (<italic>DcVg-A1-like</italic>) and the vitellogenin receptor (<italic>DcVgR</italic>). As a result, <italic>C</italic>Las hijacks AKH/AKHR-miR-34-JH signaling to improve <italic>D. citri</italic> lipid metabolism and fecundity, while simultaneously increasing the replication of <italic>C</italic>Las, suggesting a mutualistic interaction in <italic>D. citri</italic> ovaries with <italic>C</italic>Las.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The majority of devastating plant pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, are transmitted by insect vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. In recent decades, the interactions between vectors and pathogens have been widely studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. However, studies on the mechanisms underlying these interactions have mainly focused on vector-virus or vector-fungus interactions; less research has been performed on vector-bacteria interactions. Knowledge of the relationships between vectors and pathogens is of great significance for understanding the epidemiology of plant pathogens, and this knowledge may help develop new strategies for controlling both vectors and pathogens. The severe Asian form of huanglongbing (HLB) is currently the most destructive citrus disease in Asia and the Americas where it is associated with the phloem-restricted, Gram-negative, α–Proteobacteria ‘<italic>Candidatus</italic> Liberibacter asiaticus’ (<italic>C</italic>Las) and transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid, <italic>Diaphorina citri</italic> Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. However, since <italic>C</italic>Las has not been cultured <italic>in vitro,</italic> Koch’s postulates have not been proven. Control of <italic>D. citri</italic> is the most effective way to prevent HLB epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] but experience in Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and the United States of America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], and recent press reports from Brazil, indicate that it is impossible to suppress psyllid populations with insecticides to levels that prevent spread of <italic>C</italic>Las.</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported that infection with <italic>C</italic>Las significantly increases the fecundity of <italic>D. citri</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Reproduction is a costly process in terms of energy usage in the adult life of female insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], and there is an inevitable trade-off between lipid storage and use, because animals mobilize their lipid reserves during reproduction. How <italic>D. citri</italic> maintains a balance between lipid metabolism and increased fecundity after infection with <italic>C</italic>Las is not known.</p>
<p>In insects, energy mobilization is under control of adipokinetic hormone (AKH), which was the first insect neurohormone to be identified; it was shown to stimulate lipid mobilization for locomotor activity in locusts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. To date, more than 80 different forms of AKH have been identified or predicted in arthropod species due to similar structural characteristics of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The mechanisms of synthesis and biological activity of AKH have also been investigated. Insect store lipids in the form of triacylglycerides (TAG) and as carbohydrates in the form of glycogen in their fat bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Under conditions of energy demand, AKHs are synthesized in the corpora cardiaca, released into the hemolymph and bind to receptors (AKHRs) located on the plasma membrane of fat body cells. AKHR binding and activation triggers the release of energy-rich substrates after which various cellular signaling pathway components come into play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. AKHRs are a class of G protein-coupled receptors and were first identified in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]; subsequently, they were identified in a large number of insect species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that AKH/AKHR signaling plays a regulatory role during female reproduction in insects. For example, depletion of AKHR in <italic>Bactrocera dorsalis</italic> resulted in TAG accumulation, decreased sexual courtship activity, and fecundity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. AKHR knockdown in <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> interferes with trehalose homeostasis and vitellogenin uptake by oocytes, which causes delayed oocyte development and reduced fecundity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. AKH/AKHR signaling also regulates vitellogenesis and egg development in <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> via triacylglycerol mobilization and trehalose homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. As outlined above, the fecundity of <italic>D. citri</italic> is increased by <italic>C</italic>Las. Whether AKH/AKHR signaling participates in this increase in fecundity due to infection via alterations in lipid metabolism is not currently known.</p>
<p>Although numerous studies have been conducted on the AKH/AKHR signaling pathway, miRNA-mediated regulation of the AKH signaling pathway at the post-transcriptional level has been little studied. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs containing approximately 22 nucleotides that act mostly on the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, resulting in translation repression or mRNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. miRNAs play important roles in regulating cellular events at the post-transcriptional level during biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. For example, in term of host-virus interactions, miR-8 and miR-429 target <italic>Broad isoform Z2</italic>, the gene involved in the hormonal regulation of single nucleopolyhedrovirus (HaSNPV)-mediated climbing behavior in <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In relation to reproduction, in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, miR-275 is essential for egg development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], miR-309 for ovarian development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] and miR-8 for other reproductive processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. As for lipid metabolism, knockdown of miR-277 in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> activates insulin/FOXO signaling by increasing the expression of ilp7 and ilp8, which reduces TAG levels and inhibits ovarian development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, the functions of the miRNAs in insect-pathogen interactions need further investigation. To date, there are no reports that miRNAs participate in <italic>D. citri</italic>-<italic>C</italic>Las interactions or are hijacked by <italic>C</italic>Las to affect lipid metabolism and the fecundity of <italic>D. citri</italic>. As a consequence, in this study, we used the <italic>D. citri</italic>-<italic>C</italic>Las system as a model to study the molecular events associated with AKH/AKHR signaling that affect lipid metabolism and increase fecundity of <italic>D. citri</italic> induced by <italic>C</italic>Las. Our study contributes to our understanding of the interactions between vectors and pathogens and may also provide new ways for controlling <italic>D. citri</italic> and HLB.</p>

<title>Effects of <italic>C</italic>Las infection on the reproduction and metabolism of adult <italic>D. citri</italic></title>
<p>Total TAG and glycogen levels in fat bodies of <italic>C</italic>Las-negative and <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids were determined. After infection with <italic>C</italic>Las, the TAG and glycogen levels of <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids significantly increased compared with <italic>C</italic>Las-negative individuals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A-B</xref>). Since TAG is mainly stored in fat bodies as lipid droplets, we next evaluated the changes in the lipid droplet size using Nile red staining. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, the size of lipid droplets in the <italic>C</italic>Las-positive group was significantly larger than those of the <italic>C</italic>Las-negative group. In order to evaluate the effects of <italic>C</italic>Las on the reproduction of <italic>D. citri</italic>, the preoviposition period, oviposition period and fecundity of both <italic>C</italic>Las-negative and <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids were examined.

<title><italic>DcAKH</italic> is involved in changes in metabolism and fecundity in <italic>D. citri</italic> mediated by <italic>C</italic>Las</title>
<p>Using our transcriptome database, cDNA sequences of <italic>DcAKH</italic> were identified and cloned. The cDNA sequence of <italic>DcAKH</italic> is 225 bp in length, encodes a deduced polypeptide of 74 amino acid residues and has the conserved structural characteristics of a neuropeptide. The conserved structure was “signal peptide + mature peptide + related peptide”, and the mature peptide sequence of <italic>Dc</italic>AKH is “QVNFSPNW” (Figure S1A). A phylogenetic analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of <italic>Dc</italic>AKH with other insect AKHs; <italic>Dc</italic>AKH was most closely related to the AKHs of three hemipteran species, <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>, <italic>Sitobion avenae</italic> and <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> (Figure S1B).</p>
<p>Tissue expression profiles showed that <italic>Dc</italic>AKH was expressed at the highest level in the brain, significantly higher than in the ovaries, fat bodies, and midgut in <italic>D. citri</italic> (Figure S2). The levels of <italic>DcAKH</italic> in ovaries of <italic>C</italic>Las-negative and -positive psyllids decreased during the assessment period. However, levels in the ovaries of <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids were significantly higher than those that were <italic>C</italic>Las-negative at all assessment times (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To investigate the role of <italic>DcAKH</italic> in metabolic and reproductive changes induced by <italic>C</italic>Las, we knocked down <italic>DcAKH</italic> expression using RNAi. When fed with ds<italic>DcAKH</italic>, the mRNA level of <italic>DcAKH</italic> in <italic>C</italic>Las-negative and <italic>C</italic>Las-positive ovaries significantly decreased by 89% and 66%, respectively, compared with psyllids fed with ds<italic>GFP</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>DcAKH</italic> resulted in TAG accumulation and a significant decrease in glycogen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C-D</xref>). Correspondingly, depletion of <italic>DcAKH</italic> led to a significant increase the size of the lipid droplets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Compared with the controls, <italic>DcAKH</italic> RNAi slowed ovarian development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), extended the preoviposition period (from 13.3 to 14.2 days in <italic>C</italic>Las-negative psyllids and from 10.7 to 13.4 days in <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids), shortened the oviposition period (from 7.1 to 4.3 days in <italic>C</italic>Las-negative psyllids and from 10.1 to 5.7 days in <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids), and decreased fecundity (from 138.0 to 94.7 days in <italic>C</italic>Las-negative psyllids and from 230.0 to 118.1 days in <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2G-I</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>C</italic>Las signal and relative titer in the ovaries of <italic>DcAKH</italic> knockdown psyllids significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2J-K</xref>). Taken together, it can be concluded that <italic>DcAKH</italic> is involved in <italic>C</italic>Las-induced metabolic and reproductive changes in <italic>D.citri</italic>.</p>

A phylogenetic analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of <italic>DcAKHR</italic> with other insect <italic>AKHRs</italic>; <italic>DcAKHR</italic> was most closely related to the <italic>AKHR</italic> of <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> (Figure S3B). To further confirm <italic>Dc</italic>AKH can activate <italic>DcAKHR</italic>, we performed a cell-based calcium mobilization assay. As shown in Figure S3C, <italic>DcAKHR</italic> was strongly activated by <italic>Dc</italic>AKH in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 2.20 × 10<sup>−5</sup> mM, but there were no responses when challenged with an empty vector or other evolutionarily-related peptides. In addition, after <italic>DcAKH</italic> knockdown, <italic>DcAKHR</italic> expression in the ovaries significantly decreased (Figure S3D). <italic>DcAKHR</italic> was cloned, sequenced, designated and then used for further studies. Sequence analysis showed that <italic>DcAKHR</italic> consisted of an open reading frame (ORF) of 1290 bp and a 185 bp 3’ UTR. It encodes a putative protein consisting of 429 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 48.32 kDa. Tissue expression patterns showed that <italic>DcAKHR</italic> had the highest expression in the midgut, follow by the head, fat bodies, and ovaries (Figure S4). In the ovaries of <italic>C</italic>Las-positive and -negative psyllids, the transcript and protein levels of <italic>DcAKHR</italic> increased over the assessment period with levels of both being higher in <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids than in <italic>C</italic>Las-negative psyllids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To investigate the role of <italic>DcAKHR</italic> in metabolic and reproductive changes induced by <italic>C</italic>Las, we knocked down <italic>DcAKHR</italic> expression by RNAi. When fed with ds<italic>DcAKHR</italic>, the mRNA levels of <italic>DcAKHR</italic> in the ovaries of <italic>C</italic>Las-negative and <italic>C</italic>Las-positive were significantly decreased by 59.4 and 66.0%, respectively, compared with psyllids fed with ds<italic>GFP</italic>; western blot analysis confirmed that <italic>Dc</italic>AKHR protein levels were also significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>DcAKHR</italic> resulted in TAG accumulation and a significant decrease in glycogen (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C-D</xref>). Correspondingly, depletion of <italic>DcAKHR</italic> led to a significant increase in the size of lipid droplets (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Compared with the controls, <italic>DcAKHR</italic> RNAi interfered with ovarian development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>): the preoviposition period was extended (from 13.3 to 16.2 days in <italic>C</italic>Las-negative psyllids and from 10.7 to 12.9 days in <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids); oviposition period was shortened (from 7.1 to 4.6 days in <italic>C</italic>Las-negative psyllids and from 10.1 to 5.3 days in <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids); and fecundity decreased (from 138.0 to 90.6 eggs per female in <italic>C</italic>Las-negative psyllids and from 230.0 to 98.2 eggs per female in <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids). These effects are similar to those caused by <italic>DcAKH</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3G-I</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>C</italic>Las signal and relative titer in the ovaries of <italic>DcAKH</italic> knockdown psyllids were significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3J-K</xref>). Taken together, <italic>DcAKHR</italic> responds to <italic>DcAKH</italic> and is involved in the <italic>C</italic>Las-induced metabolic and reproductive changes in <italic>D. citri</italic>.</p>

<title>miR-34 targeted <italic>DcAKHR</italic></title>
<p>Based on the small RNA libraries of <italic>D. citri</italic>, we used miRanda and RNAhybrid software to predict the potential miRNAs targeting <italic>DcAKHR</italic>; three putative miRNAs, namely miR-34, miR-2 and miR-14 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), were identified. To confirm the binding activity of these miRNAs with <italic>DcAKHR</italic>, several dual-luciferase reporter assays were conducted. Compared with the controls, the luciferase activity was markedly reduced when miR-34 agomir was co-transfected with the recombinant plasmid containing the full 3’UTR sequence of <italic>DcAKHR</italic>, while miR-2 and miR-14 activities were not significantly changed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, the reporter activity was recovered when the binding sites of miR-34 were mutated in the <italic>DcAKHR</italic> 3’-UTR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). To determine whether miR-34 specifically targets <italic>DcAKHR</italic>, the following experiments were conducted. Firstly. tissue expression patterns showed that the miR-34 was highly expressed in the head, followed by the fat bodies, ovaries, and midgut (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Secondly, miR-34 has the opposite expression pattern to <italic>DcAKHR</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), and transcript levels decreased over the assessment period with the levels of both being lower in <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids than in <italic>C</italic>Las-negative psyllids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Thirdly, after feeding with agomir-34, the relative levels of miR-34 mRNA in the ovaries of <italic>C</italic>Las-negative and <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids increased 1.9- and 2.3-fold, respectively (Figure S5). The mRNA and protein levels of <italic>DcAKHR</italic> were correspondingly increased or decreased after separately feeding psyllids with either antagomir-34 or agomir-34 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Fourthly, an RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay was performed; <italic>DcAKHR</italic> mRNA was significantly enriched in the anti-AGO-immunoprecipitated RNAs from ovaries of agomir-34-fed female psyllids relative to the control samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that <italic>DcAKHR</italic> is a direct target of miR-34.</p>

<title>miR34 participates in <italic>D. citri</italic>-<italic>C</italic>Las mutualism in ovaries</title>
<p>To investigate the roles of miR-34 in the interaction between <italic>D. citri</italic> and <italic>C</italic>Las, <italic>C</italic>Las-positive and –negative females were fed with agomir-negative control (NC) or with miR-34 agomir.

<title>The JH signaling pathway is regulated by the AKH pathway and is involved in the increase in fecundity induced by <italic>C</italic>Las</title>
<p>To evaluate whether the JH signaling pathway is regulated by the AKH signaling pathway, we assayed the relative JH titers and the expression levels of several JH pathway-related genes in <italic>DcAKH-</italic>deficient, <italic>C</italic>Las-positive females.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Increasing numbers of studies have focused on the effects of vector-virus interactions on reproduction. For example, rice gall dwarf virus is vertically transmitted by hitchhiking on insect sperm, thereby promoting long-term viral epidemics and persistence in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Berasategui et al. (2022) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] found a mutualistic relationship between <italic>Chelymorpha alternans</italic> and <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, where the pupae were protected in exchange for the dissemination and propagation of the fungus. There are few studies on the mechanisms underlying vector-bacteria interactions. However, Singh and Linksvayer (2020) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] found that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected colonies of <italic>Monomorium pharaonis</italic> had increased colony-level growth, accelerated colony reproduction, and shortened colony life cycles compared to those that were uninfected.</p>
<p>The fat body is the major insect storage organ that produces the majority of hemolymph-born vitellogenic proteins and critically contributes to insect ovary development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. In this study, after infection with <italic>C</italic>Las, the preoviposition period of <italic>D. citri</italic> was shortened, oviposition period was prolonged, and fecundity was significantly increased. These results suggests that there is a mutualistic interaction in <italic>D. citri</italic> ovaries with <italic>C</italic>Las. <italic>C</italic>Las accelerates ovarian development and prolongs the oviposition period thereby enhancing the fecundity of <italic>D. citri</italic>; in turn, <italic>D. citri</italic> provides sites and nutrients for <italic>C</italic>Las replication during ovarian development. <italic>C</italic>Las-positive <italic>D. citri</italic> require more energy to support this increased fecundity. Hence, the TAG and glycogen levels of both <italic>C</italic>Las-positive and <italic>C</italic>Las-negative were assayed. After infection with <italic>C</italic>Las, the TAG and glycogen levels significantly increased, and the average size of lipid droplets in the fat bodies were distinctly larger, indicating that the increase in lipid mobilization may prepare for an increase in fecundity.</p>
<p>The total amount of lipids present in fat bodies is a balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], and both processes are essential for lipid homeostasis. Disruption of either lipogenesis or lipolysis could interfere with nutritional and physiological conditions in fat bodies and affect vitellogenesis. AKH/AKHR mediated lipolytic systems are essential for lipid provision and nutrient transfer during reproduction. In <italic>Gryllus bimaculatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], injections of AKH interfered with egg production by inhibiting the production of vitellogenins and the accumulation of lipid stores. In <italic>Bactrocera dorsalis</italic>, AKHR knockdown led to decreased lipolytic activity and delayed oocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] and these authors suggested the decline in fecundity may be due to the inability to utilize the lipid stores of fat bodies to promote oocyte maturation. In <italic>Glossina morsitans</italic>, the silencing of <italic>AKHR</italic> and <italic>brummer</italic> led to the inability to mobilize lipid reserves in fat bodies during pregnancy, slowed down the development of oocytes, and caused embryogenesis to fail, indicating that female fertility depends on lipid metabolism regulated by AKHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. These results suggest that lipid homeostasis appears critical for insect fecundity, as its disruption substantially suppresses egg production and negatively affects vitellogenesis.</p>
<p>In the present study, <italic>DcAKH</italic> and <italic>DcAKHR</italic> played important roles in the increased lipid metabolism and fecundity of <italic>D. citri</italic> mediated by <italic>C</italic>Las. The cDNA sequences encoding AKH and AKHR from <italic>D. citri</italic> were cloned and identified, and phylogenetic analysis showed that <italic>DcAKH</italic> and <italic>DcAKHR</italic> were orthologous to other hemipteran AKHs and AKHRs. Functional analysis showed that <italic>DcAKHR</italic> shares properties found with other AKHRs. <italic>DcAKHR-</italic>transfected CHO cells could be activated by AKH peptide, while it did not response to Crz peptide, despite the sequences and gene structures of AKH and Crz being closely related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. <italic>DcAKH</italic> and <italic>DcAKHR</italic> were more highly expressed in the ovaries of <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids than those of <italic>C</italic>Las-negative individuals. Knockdown of <italic>DcAKH</italic> and <italic>DcAKHR</italic> resulted in TAG accumulation and a significant decrease in glycogen levels in the fat bodies. Most importantly, the <italic>C</italic>Las titer in the ovaries of <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids and fecundity significantly reduced when feeding with <italic>dsDcAKH</italic> and <italic>dsDcAKHR</italic>. Our results support the idea that reproductive disruption from AKH/AKHR knockdown is due to the inability of female to mobilize lipid reserves in the fat bodies required for oocyte maturation during vitellogenesis.</p>
<p>To date, there are no reports on the post-transcriptional regulation of AKHR. As important post-transcriptional regulators, miRNAs generally suppress their target genes by triggering mRNA degradation or translational repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. More and more miRNAs have been reported to be involved in the metabolic processes of insects including reproduction. In addition to functions of miR-277 described in the Introduction, this miRNA targets ilp7 and ilp8 thereby controlling lipid metabolism and reproduction in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. miR-8 depletion in mosquitoes resulted in an increase of its target gene, <italic>secreted wingless-interacting molecule</italic>, and in lipid accumulation in developing oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Depletion of miR-8 in mosquitoes by antagomir injection upregulates <italic>secreted wingless-interacting molecule</italic> and decreases the level of lipid in ovaries to block vitellogenesis post blood meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. A switch from catabolic to anabolic amino acid metabolism in fat bodies mediated by miR-276 restricts mosquito investment into oogenesis and benefits the development of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. In the current study, based on <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, we found that host miR-34 targets <italic>DcAKHR</italic>. miR-34 was observed to have an opposite expression trend to <italic>DcAKHR</italic>, and its expression in the ovaries of <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids was lower than in those of CLas-negative individuals. Treatment of miR-34 agomir and antagomir, respectively, resulted in a significant decrease and increase in <italic>DcAKHR</italic> mRNA and protein levels. In addition, miR-34 overexpression not only led to the accumulation of TAG and the reduction of glycogen levels in fat bodies, but also decreased fecundity and <italic>C</italic>Las titers in the ovaries similar to the phenotypes caused by silencing of <italic>DcAKHR</italic>. This indicates that <italic>C</italic>Las inhibited host miR-34 to enhance <italic>DcAKHR</italic> expression and improve the lipid metabolism and fecundity. This study is the first to report the manipulation of host miRNAs and target genes by a bacterium to affect lipid metabolism and reproduction of their vector.</p>
<p>Vitellogenesis is strongly linked with insect JH production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. The fat body is an important tissue that senses and integrates various nutritional and hormonal signals required for the regulation of vitellogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Moreover, JH is also involved in the nutrient-dependent regulation of insect reproduction, but the mechanism of action remains obscure. Lu et al. (2016a, b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] have demonstrated that nutritional signaling during female reproduction induces JH biosynthesis that in turn stimulates vitellogenin expression in fat bodies and egg production in <italic>N. lugens.</italic> In order to evaluate the possible relationship between AKH/AKHR-mediated lipolysis and JH-dependent vitellogenesis, the expressions of JH signaling pathway-related genes in fat bodies and ovaries were determined after knockdown of <italic>DcAKH</italic> and <italic>DcAKHR</italic>. We found that reducing <italic>DcAKH</italic> or <italic>DcAKHR</italic> by RNAi in <italic>C</italic>Las-positive <italic>D. citri</italic> not only decreased JH titer but also resulted in a decrease in the expression of <italic>DcMet</italic> and <italic>DcKr-h1</italic> in the fat bodies and ovaries, as well as the egg development related genes, <italic>DcVg-1-like</italic>, <italic>DcVg-A1-like</italic> and <italic>DcVgR</italic>. Similar results were detected in the agomir-34 treatment. Our results suggest that AKH/AKHR-based lipolysis plays an important regulatory role in the JH signaling pathway during <italic>D. citri-C</italic>Las interactions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we proposed the scheme of events following <italic>C</italic>Las infection presented in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. After infection with <italic>C</italic>Las, <italic>D. citri</italic> are more fecund than their uninfected counterparts. The interaction between <italic>C</italic>Las and <italic>D. citri</italic> affecting reproduction is a win-win strategy; the more offspring of <italic>D. citri</italic>, the more <italic>C</italic>Las in the field. <italic>C</italic>Las upregulates the AKH/AKHR signaling and downregulates miR-34 to increase lipid metabolism and activate JH-dependent vitellogenesis, thereby improving the fecundity of <italic>C</italic>Las-positive females. Overall, our results not only broaden our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the <italic>D. citri-C</italic>Las interaction, but also provide valuable information for further integrated management of <italic>D.citri</italic> and HLB by targeting the <italic>DcAKH/DcAKHR</italic> signaling pathway.</p>

<caption><title>Mechanisms linking metabolism and reproduction of <italic>D. citri</italic> induced by <italic>C</italic>Las.</title>
<p>After infection with <italic>C</italic>Las, the TAG and glycogen levels in fat bodies of <italic>C</italic>Las-positive psyllids significantly increased as well as the size of lipid droplets. In ovaries, <italic>C</italic>Las upregulates the AKH/AKHR signaling and downregulates miR-34 to increase lipid metabolism and activate JH-dependent vitellogenesis, thereby improving the fecundity of <italic>C</italic>Las-positive females. <italic>D. citri</italic> are more fecund than their uninfected counterparts. The interaction between <italic>C</italic>Las and <italic>D. citri</italic> affecting reproduction is a win-win strategy; the more offspring of <italic>D. citri</italic>, the more <italic>C</italic>Las in the field.</p></caption>

<title>Assays of reproductive parameters</title>
<p>Tested females from two colonies were selected and paired with healthy males. One female and one male were placed onto young vegetative shoots (flush) of healthy lemon plants to promote oviposition; the flush and insects were sealed with tied white mesh bag (15 × 20 cm). These lemon plants were held in an incubator (25 ± 1 <italic>℃</italic>, 65 ± 5% RH, 14L: 10D photoperiod). After 24h, the preoviposition period and oviposition period were recorded, the number of eggs laid per female were counted, and this pair of psyllids were transferred to new flush to continue egg laying. Eggs were counted daily until all females died. All the experiments were performed using three replications, and about 15 pairs of <italic>D. citri</italic> for each replication.</p>

<title>Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)</title>
<p>For mRNA expression analysis, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States), and the synthesis of first-strand cDNA was performed using a PrimeScript™ II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara, Beijing, China) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR was carried out by using the TB Green® Premix Ex Taq™ II (Takara, Beijing, China) on an ABI PRISM® 7500 Real-Time System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The beta-actin (Dcβ-ACT, GenBank XM_026823249.1) gene was used as an internal control to normalize gene expression levels. For miRNA expression analysis, miRNA was extracted using a miRcute miRNA Isolation Kit (TIANGEN, Beijing, China), synthesized using a miRcute Plus miRNA First-Strand cDNA Kit (TIANGEN, Beijing, China), and quantified using the miRcute Plus miRNA qPCR Kit (SYBR Green) (TIANGEN, Beijing, China). U6 snRNA was used as an internal control to normalize the expression of miRNA. All the primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 1.</p>

<title>Luciferase activity assay</title>
<p>The 185 bp sequence of the 3’UTR containing the predicted target sites for miR-34 in <italic>DcAKHR</italic> was cloned into the pmirGLO vector (Promega, Wisconsin, USA) downstream of the luciferase gene to construct the recombinant plasmid, <italic>DcAKHR</italic>-3’UTR-pmirGLO, using the pEASY®-Basic Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit. The mutated 3’UTR sequence was amplified and cloned into the pmirGLO vector to generate the <italic>DcAKHR</italic>-3’UTR mutant-pmirGLO plasmid. The agomir and antagomir of miRNAs were chemically synthesized and modified by GenePharma (Shanghai, China) with chemically modified RNA oligos of the same sequence or anti-sense oligonucleotides of the miRNA. The negative control for agomir and antagomir was provided by the manufacturer. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, the constructed vector (500 ng) and miRNA agomir (275 nM) were co-transferred into HEK293T cells in a 24-well plate using a Calcium Phosphate Cell Transfection Kit (Beyotime, Nanjing, China). After co-transfection for 24 h, the activities of firefly and Renilla luciferase were detected using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and the average luciferase activity was calculated.</p>

<title>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)</title>
<p>FISH using a <italic>C</italic>Las probe was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Under a dissecting microscope, the ovaries of <italic>C</italic>Las-negative and <italic>C</italic>Las-postive <italic>D. citri</italic> were dissected in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Firstly, the isolated ovaries were fixed in Carnoy’s fixative (glacial acetic acid-ethanol-chloroform, 1: 3: 6, vol/vol) for 12 h at 25 <italic>℃</italic>, washed four times (5 min each time) with 6% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 80% ethanol and then three times (10-15 min per time) with PBST (1 × PBS: TritonX-100, 99.7: 0.3, (vol/vol)). Secondly, the samples were pre-incubated three times (10 min per time) in hybridization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.9 M NaCl, 30% formamide (vol/vol), 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate (wt/wol)) containing 10 pmol/mL of each probe for 24 h at 25 <italic>℃</italic>, then washed three times with PBST. Thirdly, nuclei were stained with 0.1 mg/mL of 40, 60-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) for 15 min, then washed once with PBST. Finally, the stained ovaries were mounted in mounting medium. The slides were scanned under a Leica TCS-SP8 (Leica Microsystems Exton, PA USA) confocal microscope; excitation lasers emitting at 405 nm and 550 nm were used to detect the DAPI and Cy3 signals, respectively, and sequential scanning was used to avoid the signal overlap of probes. Image processing was completed using Leica LAS-AF software (v2.6.0). Specificity of detection was carried out using without the probe and <italic>C</italic>Las-negative controls. Three FISH tests were performed and at least 20 ovaries were viewed under the microscope to confirm the repeatability. The probe sequences used in the current study are listed in Supplementary Table 1.</p>

<title>dsRNA synthesis and RNAi assay</title>
<p>dsRNAs of <italic>DcAKH</italic> and <italic>DcAKHR</italic> were transcribed by a Transcript Aid T7 High Yield kit (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, United states) and purified using the GeneJET RNA Purification kit (Thermo Scientific). miRNA agomir, agomir negative control, miRNA antagomir, and antagomir negative control were synthesized in the Shanghai GenePharma Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The RNAi and miRNA treatments were performed by feeding dsRNA or miRNA antagomir/agomir through an artificial diet as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Briefly, twenty females at 7 DAE were placed into a glass cylinder (25 × 75 mm) and sealed with two stretched paramembranes. 200 μL of 20% (w:v) sucrose mixed with dsRNA was placed between two paramembranes for feeding. The final ingestion concentrations of ds<italic>DcAKH</italic> and ds<italic>DcAKHR</italic> were 200 ng/μL and 300 ng/μL, respectively. After feeding with dsRNA for 48 h, the treated females were assayed as follows. The ovaries were dissected or qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Reproductive parameters including the pre-oviposition period, oviposition period, and fecundity were recorded. <italic>C</italic>Las titers in the ovaries were assayed. Ovary morphologies were observed using a Ultra-Depth Three-Dimensional Microscope (VHX-500). Fat bodies were stained with Nile red. TAG levels and glycogen levels were determined. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a reporter gene. Feeding ds<italic>GFP</italic> was used as the control when psyllids were fed with dsRNA.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study reveals the molecular basis of mutualism between a vector insect and a bacterium responsible for the most devastating disease in citrus agriculture worldwide. The evidence supporting the conclusions is <bold>compelling</bold>, with biochemical and gene expression analysis demonstrating the phenomenon. However, there are concerns related to the presentation, as well as lack of sufficient information about data analysis, both of which should be clarified and/or extended. With these matters addressed, this work will be of great interest to the fields of vector-borne disease control and host-pathogen interaction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript by Jiayun Li and colleagues aims to provide insight into adipokinetic hormone signaling that mediates the fecundity of Diaphorina citri infected by 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus'. CLas-positive D. citri are more fecund than their CLas-negative counterparts and require extra energy expenditure. Using FISH, qRT-PCR, WB, RNAi, and miRNA-related methods, authors found that knockdown of DcAKH and DcAKHR not only resulted in triacylglycerol accumulation and a decline of glycogen but also significantly decreased fecundity and CLas titer in ovaries. miR-34 suppresses DcAKHR expression by binding to its 3' untranslated region, whilst overexpression of miR-34 resulted in a decline of DcAKHR expression and CLas titer in ovaries and caused defects that mimicked DcAKHR knockdown phenotypes. Most of the methods and results are solid and valuable, but I have a number of concerns with this paper, relating to the writing and lack of sufficient information about data analysis.</p>

<p>Diaphorina citri is the primary vector of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), but the mechanism of how D. citri maintains a balance between lipid metabolism and increased fecundity after infection with CLas remains unknown. In their study, Li et al. presented convincing methodology and data to demonstrate that CLas exploits AKH/AKHR-miR-34-JH signaling to enhance D. citri lipid metabolism and fecundity, while simultaneously promoting CLas replication. These findings are both novel and valuable, not only have theoretical implications for expanding our understanding of the interaction between insect vectors and pathogenic microorganisms but also provide new targets for controlling D. citri and HLB in practical implications. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects of phrasing and data analysis need to be further clarified and extended.</p>
<p>Key Considerations:</p>
<p>There are specific instances where additional information would enhance comprehension of the results and their interpretation.</p>
<p>There seem to be two inconsistencies related to some results depicted in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 5.</p>
<p>Firstly, Figure 1 shows the effect on CLas infection (CLas+) compared to the control (CLas-), where results show an increase of TAG, Glycogen, lipid droplet size, oviposition period, and fecundity. In Figures 2, 3, and 5, the authors establish the involvement of the genes DcAKH, DcAKHR, and miR34 in this process, by showing that by preventing the function of these three factors the effects of CLas+ are lost. However, while Figure 1 shows the increase of TAG and lipid droplet size in CLas+, Figures 2, 3, and 5 do not show a significant elevation in TAG when comparing CLas- and CLas+.</p>
<p>Secondly, in addition to the absence of statistical difference in TAG and lipid droplet size observed in Figure 1, Figures 2, 3, and 5 show an increase in TAG and lipid droplet size after dsDcAKH (Figure 2), dsDcAKHR (Figure 3) and agomiR34 (Figure 5) treatments. Considering that AKH, AKHR, and miR34 are important factors to CLas-induce increase in TAG and lipid droplet size, one might expect a reduction in TAG and lipid droplet size when CLas+ insects are silenced for these factors, contrary to the observed results.</p>
