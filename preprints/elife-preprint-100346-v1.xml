<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the role of 17α-estradiol in lifespan extension and its potential side effects for long-term administration. Pooled hypothalami from aged male Norway brown rats treated with 17α-estradiol (O.T), aged male controls (O), and young male controls (Y) were subjected to single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing (snRNA-seq). To evaluate the effects of 17α-estradiol in anti-aging in neurons, supervised clustering on neurons by neuropeptides and their receptors were used to evaluate the responses of each neuron subtype during aging and after 17α-estradiol treatment. The elevated cellular metabolism, stresses and decreased synaptic activity in neurons initiated by aging were remarkably attenuated by 17α-estradiol. Assessment of changes in neuron populations showed that neurons related to food intake, reproduction, blood pressure, stress response and electrolyte balance were sensitive to 17α-estradiol treatment. 17α-estradiol treatment not only increased Oxytocin (Oxt), but also increased the activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, evidenced by significantly elevated levels of plasma Gnrh, bioavailable testosterone, and decreased estradiol. Elevated Gnrh1 was verified to be one of the causal effects mediating the role of 17α-estradiol in energy homeostasis, neural synapse, and stress response. Notably, <italic>Crh</italic> neurons displayed most prominently senescent phenotype among all checked neuron subtypes in O.T, which may be a potential side effect of 17α-estradiol treatment. Therefore, HPG axis and energy metabolism may be key targets of 17α-estradiol in male lifespan extension. Additionally, supervised clustering of neurons was shown to be a useful method to assess the responses to treatment among different neuron subtypes in the hypothalamus.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The hypothalamus is the central hub controlling energy homeostasis, stress response, temperature, learning, feeding, sleeping, social behavior, sexual behavior, hormone secretion, reproduction, osmoregulation, blood pressure, visceral activities, emotion, and circadian rhythms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The hypothalamic energy-sensing system, especially circuits regulating food intake, is critical for life span extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Elevated metabolic activity involving many regulatory signaling pathways has been reported in aged hypothalamus, including enhanced mTor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Decreases in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), Ghrh, Trh, monoamine neurotransmitters, and blood supply are also hallmarks of aging hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that 17α-estradiol extends the lifespan of male mice, has beneficial effects on metabolism and inflammation with a similar mechanism as that of rapamycin and acarbose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Further investigations revealed certain unique features of 17α-estradiol in life extension distinct to rapamycin and acarbose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Further, 17α-estradiol was shown to target hypothalamic <italic>POMC</italic> neurons to reduce metabolism by decreasing feeding behavior via anorexigenic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Interestingly, the lifespan extension effect is only found in male animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. The safety of 17α-estradiol is key for translation into clinical treatment, and the side effects on reproduction and potential feminization by 17α-estradiol treatment need to be considered. However, contradictory results have been reported regarding its side effects on reproduction and feminization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. A previous study showed that 17α-estradiol elicits similar genomic binding and transcriptional activation through Esr1 (estrogen receptor α, ERα) to that of 17β-estradiol, suggesting a potential side effect on reproduction and feminization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Therefore, the underlying mechanism of lifespan extension and the safety of 17α-estradiol still need further investigation and verification.</p>
<p>In this report, we used single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing and performed supervised clustering of neurons by neuropeptides, hormones, and their receptors. Supervised clustering provides better resolution in cell cluster screening than is achieved by traditional unsupervised clustering. The effects of 17α-estradiol on metabolism, stress responses, ferroptosis, senescence, inflammation, and synaptic activity were assessed in each neuron subtype, and the most sensitive neurons were ranked. The effects of 17α-estradiol on reversing measures of aging were evaluated by two opposing regulatory networks involved in hypermetabolism, stress, inflammation, and synaptic activity. Several key endocrine factors from serum were checked. Additionally, the potential side effects of 17α-estradiol on certain neurons were also evaluated.</p>

<title>Animals, treatment and tissues</title>
<p>Nine Norway brown male rats were acquired from Charles River (Beijing). Aged rats were housed one per cage and young rats (1 month old) were housed two per cage. Aged rats were randomly allocated into control and 17α-estradiol-treated groups. Aged rats treated with 17α-estradiol (Catalog #: E834897, Macklin Biochemical, Shanghai, China) were fed freely with regular diet mixed with 17α-estradiol at a dose of 14.4 mg/kg (14.4 ppm), starting at 24 months of age for 6 months according to prior reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. The young rats were fed a regular diet without 17α-estradiol continuously for 3 months until 4 months old. All rats had ad libitum access to food and water throughout the experiments. The rats were then euthanized via CO<sub>2</sub>, hypothalami, testes and blood serum were collected for subsequent experiment procedures. All blood samples were collected at 9:00-9:30 a.m to minimize hormone fluctuation between animals. All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Nantong University.</p>

<title>Enzyme immunoassays</title>
<p>Enzyme immunoassays kits for rat Oxt (Catalog #: EIAR-OXT), Corticotropin Releasing Factor (Catalog #: EIAR-CRF), and gonadoliberin-1 (Catalog #: EIAR-GNRH) were obtained from Raybiotech (GA, USA). Enzyme immunoassay kits for rat serum bioavailable testosterone (Catalog #: ml002868), estradiol (Catalog #: ml002891), aldosterone (Catalog #: ml002876), and cortisol (Catalog #: ml002874) were obtained from Enzyme-linked Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). Sera from 3 animals per group were used and each was diluted 10 or 20 times for immunoassays.</p>

<title>Seminiferous tubule inflammation test</title>
<p>8 testes were obtained from each sample group and then subjected to fixation in 4% formalin for at least 1 week. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded mouse testis sections of 5 µm thickness were used for HE Staining. At least 30 seminiferous tubules in each slide were examined for inflammation test. Testis with at least 1 inflammatory seminiferous tubule was set as 1, and normal testis was set as 0 for inflammation index calculation.</p>

<p>Intact hypothalami were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen from sacrificed rats, and two to three pooled intact hypothalami from each group were homogenized in 500 µL ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM MgAc<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor, and 1 U/µL RiboLock RNase inhibitor) with Dounce homogenizer. Then, the homogenizer was washed with 700 µL ice-cold nuclei washing buffer (0.04% bovine serum albumin, 0.2 U/µL RiboLock RNase Inhibitor, 500 mM mannitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride protease inhibitor in 1× phosphate buffer saline). Next, the homogenates were filtered through a 70-µm cell strainer to collect the nuclear fraction. The nuclear fraction was mixed with an equal volume of 50% iodixanol and added on top of a 30% and 33% iodixanol gradient. This solution was then centrifuged for 20 min at 10 000 ×g at 4 °C. After the myelin layer was removed from the top of the gradient, the nuclei were collected from the 30% and 33% iodixanol interface. The nuclei were resuspended in nuclear wash buffer and resuspension buffer and pelleted for 5 min at 500 ×g at 4 °C. The nuclei were filtered through a 40-µm cell strainer to remove cell debris and large clumps, and the nuclear concentration was manually assessed using trypan blue counterstaining and a hemocytometer. Finally, the nuclei were adjusted to 700–1200 nuclei/µL, and examined with a 10X Chromium platform.</p>
<p>Reverse transcription, cDNA amplification and library preparation were performed according to the protocol from 10X Genomics and Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v3.1. Library sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq™ 4000 by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Guangzhou, China).</p>
<p>10X Genomics Cell Ranger software (version 3.1.0) was used to convert raw BCL files to FASTQ files, and for alignment and counts quantification. Reads with low-quality barcodes and UMIs were filtered out and then mapped to the reference genome. Reads uniquely mapped to the transcriptome and intersecting an exon at least 50% were considered for UMI counting. Before quantification, the UMI sequences were corrected for sequencing errors, and valid barcodes were identified using the EmptyDrops method. The cell × gene matrices were produced via UMI counting and cell barcodes calling. Cells with an unusually high number of UMIs (≥8000) or mitochondrial gene percent (≥15%) were filtered out. Batch effect correction was performed by SCTransform function built in Seurat V4.4.0.</p>

<title>Correlation analysis and ROC analysis</title>
<p>Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated with the linkET package (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Fast Wilcoxon rank sum test and auROC analysis was performed with the wilcoxauc function in R package presto. The minimal cell number in either one of the comparing pairs should be no less than 15. Ranks of AUC values were in descending order. A total of 431 pathways from Hallmark, KEGG and PID databases were used for correlation analysis with MitoCarta OXPHOS subunits in neurons and non-neural cells (<bold>Figure 2—figure supplement 1</bold>).

<title>The division of expression level-dependent clusters in each pathway and their signatures</title>
<p>The quarters of the mixed cell populations from O, O.T and Y hypothalamic neurons were equally divided with R function fivenum from R package stats according to pathway expression levels. The total neurons were then divided into 4 clusters (c1-c4) accordingly. The cell proportion from O.T, O and Y neurons in each cluster were weighted against the total neurons in the 3 groups. The unique markers of each cluster were calculated with FindAllMarkers function of Seurat package. The intersection of the unique markers from 6 pathways were obtained for heatmap plotting. 19 genes highly expressed in c1 were calculated as c1.up.signature via the PercentageFeatureSet function in R package Seurat. 12 genes were highly expressed in c4 and thus were calculated as c4.up.signature.

<title>The overall changes in aged hypothalamus with or without long-term 17α-estradiol treatment via snRNA-seq profiling</title>
<p>To investigate the hypothalamus as a potential key target of 17α-estradiol’s effects on life extension, we performed snRNA-seq on the entire hypothalamus of aged and 17α-estradiol-treated aged Norway brown rats, and used the hypothalamus from young adult male rats as a control. We obtained 10 major cell types according to cell markers of the hypothalamus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Notably, the proportions of non-neural cells were changed extensively in O (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). For example, Oligo, OPC, and Micro were increased, and Astro, Tany, Fibro, PTC, and Endo were decreased in O compared with Y. The proportion of Oligo, OPC, and Micro were increased in O.T than those in Y. Endo was also increased in O.T. The proportions of Astro, Tany, Epen, and PTC were decreased more in O.T than those in O in comparison with those in Y. The results indicated that 17α-estradiol treatment had extensive effects on the proportions of non-neural cells in hypothalamus.</p>

<p>Cell communication analysis indicated that the ligand–receptor pairs between neurons and other cell types also changed remarkably, such as those in Endo, Fibro, Tany, and Atro (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The significant ligand–receptor pairs among Neurons were changed in O.T and O, especially in O (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, of the significant ligand–receptor pairs in neurons, <italic>Bmp2– Acvr1/Acvr2a/Acvr2b/Bmpr</italic>, <italic>Gdf11–Acvr2a/Acvr2b</italic>, <italic>Inhba–Acvr1/Acvr2a/Acvr2b</italic>, <italic>Nrg1/Nrg2/Nrg4–Erbb4</italic>, <italic>Rspo1–Lgr5/Lrp6</italic>, and <italic>Rspo3–Lgr5</italic> were exclusively and significantly increased in Neuron.O, in comparison with neurons of O.T and Y, which suggested enhanced TGF superfamily-mediated signaling activity and canonical Wnt signaling during aging. The significantly-changed ligand–receptor pairs <italic>Nlgn1–Nrxn1/Nrxn2</italic>, <italic>Nlgn2–Nrxn1/Nrxn2/Nrxn3</italic>, <italic>Nlgn3–Nrxn1/Nrxn2/Nrxn3</italic>, <italic>Nxph1–Nrxn1/Nrxn2/Nrxn3</italic>, <italic>Nxph3–Nrxn1/Nrxn2/Nrxn3</italic>, <italic>Pomc– Oprd1/Oprk1/Oprm1</italic>, and <italic>Vip–Adcyap1r1/Avpr1a/Vipr2</italic> were exclusively increased in neurons of O.T. These ligand–receptor pairs were related to or belonged to synaptic activity, cellular adhesion, opioid system, and vasodilation, which indicated unique roles of 17α-estradiol in restoring certain physiological functions in aging hypothalamus. The enhanced <italic>Pomc</italic> signal in O.T neurons is in line with prior report that 17α-estradiol treatment decreased food uptake in mice is potentially correlated with <italic>Pomc</italic> neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) based on DEGs also verified the expression profiles in stress responses and synaptic activity in neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). ROC analysis of significantly differently expressed pathways related to neural synapse manually selected from Gene Ontology databases showed that most top-ranked pathways related to synaptic activity according to area under the curve (AUC) values were downregulated in aged neurons, and that 17α-estradiol treatment reversed this pattern (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref><bold>, Table S1</bold>).</p>
<p>Together, the findings suggested that 17α-estradiol extensively reshaped the cell populations, cellular communication, neuropeptide secretion, and neural synapse activity in aged hypothalamus, which was distinct from that of the young hypothalamus and aged hypothalamus.</p>

<title>The two opposing signaling networks in regulating metabolism and synapse activity, which can be balanced effectively by 17α-estradiol</title>
<p>In order to monitor the metabolism and neural status interfered by 17α-estradiol, energy metabolism pathway MitoCarta OXPHOS subunits was used to calculate the positively-or negatively-correlated pathways in hypothalamic neurons (<bold>Figure 2—figure supplement 1</bold>). Energy metabolism and synapse activity was thus revealed to be two opposing regulatory signaling networks in hypothalamic neurons and 17α-estradiol strongly balanced these two opposing signaling networks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Underlying these opposing signaling pathways were two category opposing transcriptional factors (TFs) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). For example, <italic>Calr</italic>, <italic>Clu</italic>, <italic>Peg3</italic>, <italic>Prnp</italic>, <italic>Ndufa13</italic>, <italic>Actb</italic>, <italic>Ywhab</italic>, <italic>Nfe2l1</italic>, <italic>Mtdh</italic>, <italic>Npm1</italic>, <italic>Bex2</italic>, <italic>Aft4</italic>, and <italic>Maged1</italic> were positively correlated with pathways in OXPHOS subunits, lysosome, protein export, mTorc1 signaling, unfolded protein response (UPR) in O, O.T and Y neurons, and were negatively correlated with pathways in ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, endocytosis, tight junction, focal adhesion, axon guidance, and MAPK signaling. Additionally, TFs <italic>Myt1l</italic>, <italic>Ctnnd2</italic>, <italic>Tenm4</italic>, <italic>Camta1</italic>, <italic>Med12l</italic>, <italic>Rere</italic>, <italic>Csrnp3</italic>, <italic>Erbb4</italic>, <italic>Jazf1</italic>, <italic>Dscam</italic>, <italic>Klf12</italic>, and <italic>Kdm4c</italic> had opposite correlation patterns with these selected pathways in O, O.T and Y neurons.

</fig>
<p>Then, we tried to establish gene signatures to represent these two opposing signaling networks to display the cell status of aging and evaluate the effect interfered by 17α-estradiol. To accomplish this, 4 quarters (c1-c4) according to the expression level of each of the 6 selected pathways from the two opposing signaling networks were evenly divided in quantity among the mixed neurons from O, O.T and Y and the shared unique markers in each quarter were calculated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>). From the distribution patterns we revealed that the neuron proportion decreased in O from c1 to c4 in metabolism pathways (MitoCarta OXPHOS subunits and Hallmark mTorc1 signaling), and this trend was reversed in the opposing signaling pathways (GOBP synapse organization and KEGG Mapk signaling pathway) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). But in Y this trend was on the contrary, implying the expression level of 4 quarters (c1-c4) from the two opposing signaling networks can be used to monitor the aging status. 17α-estradiol treatment alleviated this trend or even reversed the trend in O. We then screened the shared unique markers of each quarter from the 6 selected pathways to try to establish the signatures representing the two opposing signaling networks. Unique markers in c1 (19 genes, c1.up.signature) and c4 (12 genes, c4.up.signature) were obtained, but c2 and c3 didn’t have unique markers shared by the 6 pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Accordingly, the 19 genes in c1.up.signature displayed conversed correlation pattern with the 12 genes in c4.up.signature, indicating the two opposing signatures are capable of reflecting the two opposing signaling networks in hypothalamic neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). But the two opposing signaling networks balanced by 17α-estradiol in non-neural cell types were not so striking as that in neurons, displaying variable effects on non-neurons (<bold>Figure 2—figure supplement 2</bold>). Therefore, in this report we mainly focused on hypothalamic neurons and its response to aging and 17α-estradiol.</p>

<title>Supervised clustering revealed distinct responses of different subtypes of hypothalamic neurons to aging and 17α-estradiol</title>
<p>The hypothalamus has numerous neuron subtypes that release various neuropeptides and hormones to regulate fundamental body functions. To discriminate the changes during aging and the effect of 17α-estradiol on each neuron subtype, we performed supervised clustering by neuropeptides, hormones or their receptors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Most of the top 10 neuron subtypes in unfolded protein response (UPR), ferroptosis, mTorc1 signaling, insulin signaling pathway, immune response pathways, OXPHOS subunits, and senescence signature during aging were attenuated by 17α-estradiol treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref><bold>, Figure 3—figure supplement 1</bold>). For example, Serpine1-secreting neurons had very high expression levels of UPR, ferroptosis signature, mTorc1 signaling, Tnfa signaling via NFKB, and OXPHOS subunit during aging that were attenuated by 17α-estradiol.</p>

<p>To further determine the most affected neurons in response to aging and 17α-estradiol, we calculated the frequency of each neuron subtype by combining the top 10 neurons in each of the 16 pathways and signatures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref><bold>, Table S2</bold>). Serpine1-secreting neurons were enriched exclusively in aged hypothalamus, suggesting this type of neuron was an effective target of 17α-estradiol. Additionally, <italic>Mlnr</italic>, <italic>Nmb</italic>, <italic>Pomc</italic>, <italic>Ednra</italic>, <italic>Serpine3</italic>, <italic>Gast</italic>, and <italic>Pcsk6</italic> neurons were all affected by 17α-estradiol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). <italic>Galp</italic>, <italic>Glp1r</italic>, <italic>Serping1</italic>, <italic>Sstr2</italic>, <italic>Sstr3</italic>, and <italic>Vip</italic> neurons were enriched in O, O.T and Y hypothalamus, suggesting a lack of effect of 17α-estradiol on these neuron types.

<p>We then evaluated the most and the least affected neurons by aging via ranking the neuron subtypes according to the levels of c1.up.signature and c4.up.signature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). <italic>Serpine1</italic>, <italic>Galp</italic>, <italic>Calca</italic> neurons were among the most affected neuron subtypes in aged hypothalamus which was similar to the combined ranks of several pathways (<bold>Figure 3—figure supplement 1</bold>). <italic>Npr3</italic>, <italic>Crh</italic>, <italic>Ar</italic>, <italic>Esr1</italic>, and <italic>Esr2</italic> neurons were among the least affected neuron subtypes in aged hypothalamus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The neuron subtypes ranked by c1.up.signature and c4.up.signature in O.T indicated that neurons <italic>Gast</italic>, <italic>Npb</italic>, <italic>Nppa</italic>, and <italic>Crh</italic> were affected most by the treatment of 17α-estradiol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).

<p>These results indicated that supervised clustering of each subtype of neurons facilitated the visualization of different subtypes of neurons in response to aging and medical treatments.

<p>Due to the intricate regulatory networks between various endocrine factors, the elucidation of the causal effect of Oxt on other endocrine factors is thus very complicate through traditional methods. MR analysis with variant SNPs as genetic tools has much advantageous in such task. We thus performed bidirectional MR analysis of the GWAS summary data of human plasma OXT and 203 endocrine-related and hypothalamus-related factors, most of which are protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data from IEU (<bold>Table S4</bold>). As an exposure, OXT was revealed to be the significant causal effect on POMC/beta-endorphin (id:prot-a-2327, id:prot-a-2325), glucagon (id:prot-a-1181), GNRH1/Progonadoliberin-1 (id:prot-a-1233) and total testosterone levels (id:ebi−a−GCST90012112, id:ieu−b−4864) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). NPW and CBLN1 were found to be negatively associated with OXT. The significance of these significant associations was not found in the reverse MR analysis (<bold>Figure 5—figure supplement 2A, B</bold>). Unfortunately, we were unable to screen significant associations between OXT and estradiol levels (id:ebi-a-GCST90012105, id:ebi-a-GCST90020092, id:ebi-a-GCST90020091, id:ieu-b-4872, id:ieu-b-4873, id:ukb-e-30800_AFR, id:ukb-e-30800_CSA). Interestingly, QRFP, IGF1, AGRP, TAC4, GRP, CLU, BNF, PCSK7, PACAP, ANP, TAC3, CRH, INSL6, and PRL displayed significant associations with OXT in both MR and reverse MR, indicative of their complicate causal effects (<bold>Figure 5—figure supplement 2A, B</bold>). The results suggested that elevated Oxt levels induced by 17α-estradiol may have positive associations with endocrine factors governing feeding behavior, glucose metabolism, male reproduction, and sex hormones. Therefore, OXT was a potential mediator of 17α-estradiol.</p>

<title>17α-estradiol activated HPG axis and the elevated Gnrh also took important roles in mediating the effect of 17α-estradiol on other endocrine factors</title>
<p>Since Gnrh and sex hormone expressed neuron subtypes were sensitive to 17α-estradiol treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref><bold>, Figure 3—figure supplement 1</bold>), we then checked their expression profile with representative pathways of two opposing signaling networks of metabolism and synapse, including c1-up-signature and c4-up-signature (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). But both c1-up-signature and c4-up-signature were not up-regulated in <italic>Gnrh1</italic> neuron in O.T, which was similar to <italic>Esr2</italic> neuron. Only in <italic>Esr1</italic> neuron, the c1-up-signature was up-regulated. Meanwhile, both <italic>Ar</italic> and <italic>Esr</italic> neurons also displayed high level of c4-up-signature, indicative of relatively healthy status. The data implied that most of the 4 types of sex hormone-related neurons didn’t experience severe aging in O.T. However, from these expression profile, it’s hard to define the exact physiological status of these subtype of neurons, especially neural endocrine activities. Therefore, we further performed enzyme immunoassays of hormones from the serum of O, O.T and Y. 17α-estradiol treatment significantly increased the plasma level of Gnrh in comparison with Y (p = 0.0099) and O (p = 0.096) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). More interestingly, testosterone level in serum was significantly increased in O.T in comparison with O (p = 0.018) and Y (p = 0.052). Meanwhile, the serum level of estradiol was significantly increased in O comparing with Y (p = 0.011) and significantly decreased in O.T in comparison with O (p = 0.019), suggesting 17α-estradiol treatment strongly altered the homeostasis of testosterone and estradiol. Additionally, most testes from 30-month-old male BN rats experienced severe age-related inflammation and epithelial collapse of seminiferous tubules (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). The testes without inflammation in O.T displayed normal morphology. 17α-estradiol treatment slightly decreased the testis inflammation in O.T in comparison with that in O (p = 0.15), indicating a positive role of 17α-estradiol treatment in male reproductive system. Additionally, the elevated transcriptional factors as <italic>Sf1</italic>, <italic>Pparg</italic>, <italic>Litaf</italic>, <italic>Nupr1</italic>, <italic>Rxrg</italic>, <italic>E2f2</italic>, and <italic>Zfp42</italic> may be involved in the transcriptional regulation by 17α-estradiol in O.T (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). More importantly, both the activities of androgen and estrogen pathways were decreased in <italic>Gnrh1</italic> neurons in O.T comparing with O and distinct to those in <italic>Ar</italic>, <italic>Esr1</italic>, and <italic>Esr2</italic> neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). These signaling is important for the feedback controlling of sex hormone secretion in <italic>Gnrh</italic> neurons. This result may also reflect the strong effect of 17α-estradiol on <italic>Gnrh</italic> neurons.</p>

<p>To decipher the potential effects of elevated serum Gnrh levels on endocrine system, we performed bidirectional MR analysis of the GWAS summary data of human GNRH1 (id: prot-a-1233) and 203 endocrine-related factors with genetic variants SNPs. The strong causal effects of GNRH1 on GAL/Galanin (id:prot−a−1166), POMC/Beta−endorphin (id:prot−a−2327, id:prot−a−2325), Adrenomedullin (id:prot−a−48), BDNF (id:prot−a−242), and LPR (id:prot−a−1724), which are involved in feeding, energy homeostasis, osmotic regulation, and neuron plasticity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Notably, CRH/Corticotropin (id:prot−a−2326), PRLH/Prolactin−releasing peptide (id:prot−a−2376), NPW/Neuropeptide W (id:prot−a−2082), Glucagon (id:prot−a−1181), Chromogranin−A (id:prot−a−538) displayed bidirectional significance, indicating close and complicated causal effects between GNRH1 and these endocrine factors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref><bold>, Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B</bold>). These results also suggested that the role of 17α-estradiol treatment in feeding, energy homeostasis, reproduction, osmotic regulation, stress response, and neuron plasticity may be mediated at least by elevated Gnrh secretion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The most striking role of 17α-estradiol treatment revealed in this study showed that HPG axis was substantially improved. The underlying molecular mechanism is still unknown. But prior report indicated that 17α-estradiol is able to bind ESR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. In this report, 17α-estradiol treatment significantly decreased serum estradiol and elevated serum testosterone. Combining these information, we propose 17α-estradiol may have similar roles of estrogen antagonists or the roles of aromatase inhibitors, which may prevent the conversion of androgens to estrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. These roles can remove the feedback inhibition by estrogen on hypothalamus and pituitary to secret Gnrh, FSH, and LH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].</p>
<p>The testosterone levels declined gradually from the third decade of life in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Ageing of the gonadotropic axis, especially aged males with low serum testosterone, is usually associated with many aging symptoms as the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, muscle power, low bone mineral density, frailty, impaired physical performance, mobility limitation, increased risk of diabetes, higher all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, cognitive decline, and increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Therefore, testosterone supplementation to older men is benefit. Additionally, Gnrh supplement alleviates aging-impaired neurogenesis and thus decelerates aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. 17α-estradiol treatment didn’t lead to feminization and didn’t affect the sperm parameter, fertility in male animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Therefore, the increased Gnrh levels and serum testosterone by 17α-estradiol treatment is likely benefit to older males especially to those with syndrome of late-onset hypogonadism.</p>
<p>Similar aging syndrome to aged males with low serum testosterone, postmenopausal women with low estrogen also experience increased mortality, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis fracture, urogenital atrophy and dementia, which are also benefit from hormone therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. But why 17α-estradiol treatment doesn’t display positive life extension roles in aged females according to prior report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]? The underlying key point may be the inhibition of estrogens by 17α-estradiol treatment. This is also evidenced by the inability of 17α-estradiol to improve female fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. However, due to lacking parallel data in aged female BN rats treated with 17α-estradiol, the exact answer to this question needs more investigation in the females in the future.</p>
<p>Another striking effect of 17α-estradiol to hypothalamus neurons was to decrease the overall energy metabolism in aged male BN rats. The nutrient-sensing network, mediated by MTORC1 complex, is a central regulator of mRNA and ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, glucose, autophagy, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial biosynthesis, and proteasomal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Downregulation of the nutrient-sensing network can increase lifespan and healthspan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. 17α-estradiol treatment attenuated nutrient-sensing network activity in most hypothalamic neurons, which promoted lifespan extension. Additionally, synaptic aging leads to a decline of synaptic activity and estrogen improves the performance of aging synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. In line with this, our data showed that the benefit of improved synaptic activity by 17α-estradiol treatment was prominent in aging male hypothalamus.</p>
<p>In this report, we showed that neuron populations in appetite control, specifically <italic>Agrp</italic>, <italic>Pomc</italic>, <italic>Oxt</italic>, <italic>Oxtr</italic>, <italic>Gipr</italic>, and <italic>Glp2r</italic> neurons, were extensively changed. The Oxt neuron proportion was elevated the most by 17α-estradiol in all detected neuron subtypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Oxt plays versatile roles in social behavior, stress response, satiety, energy balance, reproduction, and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Most <italic>Oxt</italic> neurons are produced by the PVN and supraoptic nuclei (SON) in hypothalamus with very high plasticity during development and intricate circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. PVN, ARC, and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus compose the neural hub in the hypothalamus that integrates peripheral, nutritional, and metabolic signals to control food intake behavior and energy balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Many effects of Oxt are sex-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. For example, females are less sensitive to exogenous Oxt than males in social recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. More interestingly, Oxt injection, which was delivered via improved blood–brain barrier penetration nanoparticles, decreased body mass, and increased social investigation and Oxt-positive cell number in the SON of hypothalamus preferentially in male rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Intracerebroventricular Oxt injection in rats showed that food intake was reduced in both sexes with a more pronounced effect in males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].Therefore, we propose that the role of Oxt in systemic aging and feeding behavior is another potential contributing factor in mediating the sex-biased effects of 17α-estradiol.</p>
<p>17α-estradiol treatment apparently induced elevated aging of HPA axis. One evidence was the increased senescence of <italic>Crh</italic> neurons. The other evidence was the elevated serum cortisol, which is a hallmark of aging HPA axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Therefore, more attentions should be paid to the potential side effects of 17α-estradiol especially in its clinical application.</p>
<p>Together, the findings suggest that HPG axis and neurons involved in appetite and energy balance were improved by 17α-estradiol treatment, which may be closely related to the life-extension roles of 17α-estradiol in aged males. Additionally, supervised clustering by neuropeptides, hormones and their receptors is proved to be a useful strategy to investigate the pharmacological, pathological and physiological processes in each subtype of neurons in the hypothalamus.</p>

<p>This study demonstrates the potential role of 17α-estradiol in modulating neuronal gene expression in the aged hypothalamus of male rats, identifying key pathways and neuron subtypes affected by the drug. While the findings are <bold>useful</bold> and provide a foundation for future research, the strength of supporting evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold> due to the lack of female comparison, a young male control group, unclear link to 17α-estradiol lifespan extension in rats, demonstration of physiological effects of the treatment, and insufficient analysis of glial cells and cellular senescence in CRH neurons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that treatment with 17α-estradiol (a stereoisomer of the 17β-estradiol) extends lifespan in male mice but not in females. The current study by Li et al, aimed to identify cell-specific clusters and populations in the hypothalamus of aged male rats treated with 17α-estradiol (treated for 6 months). This study identifies genes and pathways affected by 17α-estradiol in the aged hypothalamus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Using single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing (snRNA-seq) on the hypothalamus from aged male rats treated with 17α-estradiol they show that 17α-estradiol significantly attenuated age-related increases in cellular metabolism, stress, and decreased synaptic activity in neurons.</p>
<p>Moreover, sc-analysis identified GnRH as one of the key mediators of 17α-estradiol's effects on energy homeostasis. Furthermore, they show that CRH neurons exhibited a senescent phenotype, suggesting a potential side effect of the 17α-estradiol. These conclusions are supported by supervised clustering by neuropeptides, hormones, and their receptors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the study has several limitations that reduce the strength of the key claims in the manuscript. In particular:</p>
<p>(1) The study focused only on males and did not include comparisons with females. However, previous studies have shown that 17α-estradiol extends lifespan in a sex-specific manner in mice, affecting males but not females. Without the comparison with the female data, it's difficult to assess its relevance to the lifespan.</p>
<p>(2) It is not known whether 17α-estradiol leads to lifespan extension in male rats similar to male mice. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that the observed effects in the hypothalamus, are linked to the lifespan extension.</p>
<p>(3) The effect of 17α-estradiol on non-neuronal cells such as microglia and astrocytes is not well-described (Figure 1). Previous studies demonstrated that 17α-estradiol reduces microgliosis and astrogliosis in the hypothalamus of aged male mice. Current data suggest that the proportion of oligo, and microglia were increased by the drug treatment, while the proportions of astrocytes were decreased. These data might suggest possible species differences, differences in the treatment regimen, or differences in drug efficiency. This has to be discussed.</p>
<p>(4) A more detailed analysis of glial cell types within the hypothalamus in response to drugs should be provided.</p>
<p>(5) The conclusion that CRH neurons are going into senescence is not clearly supported by the data. A more detailed analysis of the hypothalamus such as histological examination to assess cellular senescence markers in CRH neurons, is needed to support this claim.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Li et al. investigated the potential anti-ageing role of 17α-Estradiol on the hypothalamus of aged rats. To achieve this, they employed a very sophisticated method for single-cell genomic analysis that allowed them to analyze effects on various groups of neurons and non-neuronal cells. They were able to sub-categorize neurons according to their capacity to produce specific neurotransmitters, receptors, or hormones. They found that 17α-Estradiol treatment led to an improvement in several factors related to metabolism and synaptic transmission by bringing the expression levels of many of the genes of these pathways closer or to the same levels as those of young rats, reversing the ageing effect. Interestingly, among all neuronal groups, the proportion of Oxytocin-expressing neurons seems to be the one most significantly changing after treatment with 17α-Estradiol, suggesting an important role of these neurons in mediating its anti-ageing effects. This was also supported by an increase in circulating levels of oxytocin. It was also found that gene expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons was significantly impacted by 17α-Estradiol even though it was not different between aged and young rats, suggesting that these neurons could be responsible for side effects related to this treatment. This article revealed some potential targets that should be further investigated in future studies regarding the role of 17α-Estradiol treatment in aged males.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Single-nucleus mRNA sequencing is a very powerful method for gene expression analysis and clustering. The supervised clustering of neurons was very helpful in revealing otherwise invisible differences between neuronal groups and helped identify specific neuronal populations as targets.</p>
<p>(2) There is a variety of functions used that allow the differential analysis of a very complex type of data. This led to a better comparison between the different groups on many levels.</p>
<p>(3) There were some physiological parameters measured such as circulating hormone levels that helped the interpretation of the effects of the changes in hypothalamic gene expression.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) One main control group is missing from the study, the young males treated with 17α-Estradiol.</p>
<p>(2) Even though the technical approach is a sophisticated one, analyzing the whole rat hypothalamus instead of specific nuclei or subregions makes the study weaker.</p>
<p>(3) Although the authors claim to have several findings, the data fail to support these claims.</p>
<p>(4) The study is about improving ageing but no physiological data from the study demonstrated such a claim with the exception of the testes histology which was not properly analyzed and was not even significantly different between the groups.</p>
<p>(5) Overall, the study remains descriptive with no physiological data to demonstrate that any of the effects on hypothalamic gene expression are related to metabolic, synaptic, or other functions.</p>
