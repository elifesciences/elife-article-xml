<title>Abstract</title><p>Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), characterized by two or more failed clinical pregnancies, poses a significant challenge to reproductive health. In addition to embryo quality and endometrial function, proper oviduct function is also essential for successful pregnancy establishment. Therefore, structural abnormalities or inflammation resulting from infection in the oviduct may impede the transport of embryos to the endometrium, thereby increasing the risk of miscarriage. However, the precise cellular mechanisms that maintain the structural and functional integrity of the oviduct are not studied yet. Here, we report that autophagy is critical for maintaining the oviduct homeostasis and keeping the inflammation under check to enable embryo transport. Specifically, the loss of the autophagy-related gene, <italic>Atg14</italic> in the oviduct causes severe structural abnormalities compromising its cellular plasticity and integrity leading to the retention of embryos. Interestingly, the selective loss of <italic>Atg14</italic> in oviduct ciliary epithelial cells did not impact female fertility, highlighting the specificity of ATG14 function in distinct cell types within the oviduct. Mechanistically, loss of <italic>Atg14</italic> triggered unscheduled pyroptosis leading to inappropriate embryo retention and impeded embryo transport in the oviduct. Finally, pharmacological activation of pyroptosis in pregnant mice led to an impairment in embryo transport. Together, we found that ATG14 safeguards against unscheduled pyroptosis activation to enable embryo transport from the oviduct to uterus for the successful implantation. Of clinical significance, these findings provide possible insights on the underlying mechanism(s) of early pregnancy loss and might aid in developing novel prevention strategies using autophagy modulators.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A successful pregnancy is orchestrated by the sequential and coordinated events happening in the FRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Each of these events is crucial to advance to the next step in pregnancy. For example, as a first step, the ovary undergoes ovulation to release a mature ovum into the oviduct where it gets fertilized by the sperm, and a zygote is formed in the ampullary region of the oviduct. The newly formed zygote undergoes several rounds of cleavage to form a morula while being transported through the isthmus region of the oviduct. Timely transport of the embryos from the oviduct into the uterus and synchronous development of the implantation-competent blastocyst and a receptive uterus is a prerequisite for implantation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Any perturbations in these early pregnancy events can lead to adverse ripple effects that can compromise pregnancy outcomes. Previous studies have reported that impaired oviductal transport of embryos can lead to pregnancy failure and cause infertility in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanism is not yet completely understood.</p>
<p>Autophagy is a cellular process, evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals, that recycles long-lived proteins and organelles to maintain cell energy homeostasis. Autophagy is classically activated through the nutrient sensor or mammalian target of the rapamycin complex. Genetic screens for autophagy-defective mutants in yeast and other fungi have currently identified 41 autophagy-related (ATG) genes that play a primary role in autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Approximately half of these genes have homologs in higher organisms, and <italic>Atg14</italic> (also known as Barkor for Beclin 1 (<italic>Becn1</italic>)-associated autophagy-related key regulator) is one of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. ATG14 is part of a protein complex that is composed of Beclin 1, vacuolar sorting protein 15 (VPS15), and VPS34 (also named as Pik3c3, the catalytic subunit of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), and this ATG14-containing complex plays an important role in the initiation process of autophagy.</p>
<p>With a better understanding of the fundamental process of autophagy, its pathophysiological functions have begun to be appreciated in the female reproductive tract. For example, mice deficient in key autophagy genes such as genetic knockout of <italic>Atg7</italic> or <italic>Becn1</italic> result in primary ovarian insufficiency and reduced progesterone production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Similarly, recent studies from our group established the roles of three different autophagy-specific genes: ATG16L, FIP200/RB1CC1, or BECN1 in endometrial physiological processes, including receptivity and decidualization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. However, none of these proteins exhibited any discernible impact on oviduct function. Surprisingly, in this study, we revealed a critical role for Atg14 in maintaining proper oviduct function, specifically enabling the transport of embryos to the uterusâa function distinct from that of other autophagy-related proteins. Loss of Atg14 in the oviduct resulted in severe structural abnormalities, compromising its cellular plasticity and integrity, ultimately leading to embryo retention and infertility.</p>

<title>Animal care and use</title>
<p>All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA and Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. <italic>Atg14</italic> f/f mice were provided by gift from Dr. Shizuo Akira at the Department of Host Defense, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases (RIMD), Osaka University, and previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Wild type Pr-cre mice were provided by Dr. John Lydon at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston and previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Atg14<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice, in which exon 4 was flanked by loxp sites, were bred to progesterone receptor cre (PR<sup>cre/+</sup>) mice to generate (Atg14<sup>flox/flox</sup>; PR<sup>cre/+</sup> mice), hereafter referred to as <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO mice. Both control and conditional knockout females were generated by crossing females carrying homozygous <italic>Atg14</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> alleles with <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO males. <italic>Foxj1-cre</italic> mice were a generous gift from Dr. Michael J. Holtzman at Washington University St. Louis and previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. <italic>Foxj1</italic>/<italic>Atg14</italic> cKO mice were generated by crossing females carrying homozygous <italic>Atg14 <sup>f/f</sup>/</italic>Foxj1<sup>f/f</sup> females with <italic>Atg14<sup>f/f</sup>/Foxj1-cre</italic> males. All mice were age-matched and on a C57BL/6 genetic background (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were genotyped by PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail clippings using the gene-specific primers listed in <bold>Supplementary Table 1.</bold></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Fertility analysis and timed mating</title>
<p>Female fertility was determined by mating cohorts of <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO experimental (n=6) and control <italic>Atg14</italic> f/f (n=4) females individually starting at 8 weeks of age with sexually mature males of proven fertility. Similarly, breeding trials were set up for <italic>Foxj1/Atg14</italic>-cre females (n=6) and <italic>Foxj1</italic>/<italic>Atg14</italic> control 8-week-old f/f females (n=6). The numbers of litters and pups were tracked over 6 months for each female. Pups per litter for each genotype are reported as mean Â± SEM. For timed mating, the morning on which the copulatory plug was first observed was considered 1 dpc. To visualize implantation sites, mice received a tail vein injection of 50 Î¼L of 1% Chicago Sky Blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 5 dpc just before sacrifice.</p>

<title>Steroid hormone treatments</title>
<p>The hormonal profile of pregnancy at the time of implantation was done using a previously described experimental scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Briefly, <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO and control females (8 weeks old) were bilaterally ovariectomized under ketamine anesthesia with buprenorphine-SR as an analgesic. Mice were allowed to rest for two weeks to dissipate all endogenous ovarian hormones. After the resting period, mice were injected with 100 ng of estrogen (E2; Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 100 ÂµL of sesame oil on two consecutive days and then allowed to rest for two days. At this point, mice were randomly divided into three groups of five: Vehicle-treated (E2 priming) mice received four consecutive days of sesame oil injections; E2 group mice received three days of sesame oil injections followed by a single injection of 50 ng of E2 on the fourth day; The E2/P4 mice received 1 mg of progesterone (P4; Sigma-Aldrich) for three consecutive days followed by a single injection of 1 mg P4 plus 50 ng E2 on the fourth day. All hormones were delivered by subcutaneous injection in a 90:10 ratio of sesame oil: ethanol. Mice were euthanized 16 hours after the final hormone injection to collect the uteri. A small piece of tissue from one uterine horn was processed in 4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde for histology, and the remaining tissue was snap-frozen and stored at -80 Â°C.</p>

<title>Hematoxylin and eosin staining</title>
<p>Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and then sectioned (5 Î¼m) with a microtome (Leica Biosystem, Wetzlar, Germany). Tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. All the histology was performed on three sections from each tissue of individual mice, and one representative section image is shown in the respective figures.</p>

<title>Histological analysis</title>
<p>For histological analysis, the collected tissues (oviduct or uteri) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Sections (5 Âµm) were immunostained (n=5 per group) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Briefly, after deparaffinization, sections were rehydrated in an ethanol gradient and then boiled for 20 min. in citrate buffer (Vector Laboratories Inc., Newark, CA, USA) for antigen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with Bloxall (Vector Laboratories Inc.), and tissues were blocked with 2.5% goat serum in PBS for 1 hr (Vector Laboratories Inc.). After washing in PBS three times, tissue sections were incubated overnight at 4 Â°C in 2.5% goat serum containing the primary antibodies listed in <bold>Supplementary Table 2.</bold> Sections were incubated for 1 hr with biotinylated secondary antibody, washed, and incubated for 45 min with ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Color was developed with 3, 3â-diaminobenzidine (DAB) peroxidase substrate (Vector Laboratories Inc.), and sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin. Finally, sections were dehydrated and mounted in Permount histological mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)</title>
<p>For ultrastructural analysis, oviducts were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) in 100 mM cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2 for 1 hr at room temperature and then overnight at 4Â°C. Samples were washed in cacodylate buffer and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Ted Pella Inc.) for 1 hr. Samples were then rinsed extensively in dH20 prior to en bloc staining with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate (Ted Pella Inc.) for 1 hr. Following several rinses in dH20, samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Eponate 12 resin (Ted Pella Inc.). For initial evaluation semithin sections (0.5 Î¼m) were cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT7 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL) and stained with toluidine blue. Sections of 95 nm were then cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed on a JEOL 1200 EX II transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA). Images at magnifications of 3,000X to 30,000X were taken with an AMT 8-megapixel digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Woburn, MA).</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence analysis</title>
<p>Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in an ethanol gradient, and boiled in a citrate buffer (Vector Laboratories Inc.) for antigen retrieval. After blocking with 2.5% goat serum in PBS (Vector laboratories) for 1 hr at room temperature, sections were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with primary antibodies (<bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>) diluted in 2.5% normal goat serum. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 1 hr at room temperature, washed, and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All Immunofluorescence images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope (10x and 40x objective lens).</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Protein lysates (40 Âµg per lane) from uteri or oviducts were loaded on a 4-15% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), separated in 1X Tris-Glycine Buffer (Bio-Rad), and transferred to PVDF membranes via a wet electro-blotting system (Bio-Rad), all according to the manufacturerâs directions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. PVDF membranes were blocked for 1 hour in 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T, Bio-Rad), then incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with antibodies listed in <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold> in 5% BSA in TBS-T. Blots were then probed with anti-Rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) in 5% BSA in TBS-T for 1 hr at room temperature. Signal was detected with the Pierceâ¢ ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and blot images were collected with a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imaging system.</p>

<title>Transfection and human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization</title>
<p>HESCs were plated in six-well culture plates at a cell density of 1x10<sup>5</sup> per well in triplicates. For siRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>Atg14</italic>, HESCs were treated with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)) and 60 pmol of either non-targeting siRNA (D-001810-10-05) or siRNAs targeting <italic>Atg14</italic> (L-020438-01-0005). Six hours after the transfection, the media was replaced with complete HESC media. 48 hrs later, HESCs were treated with Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) reduced serum media containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), E2 (100 nM), 10 mM medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 mM cAMP (Sigma-Aldrich), which constitutes the decidualization media. The first day that HESCs were cultured in decidualization media was assigned day 0. Decidualization media was renewed every two days. Cells were harvested at appropriate time points as per experimental conditions. Total RNA was isolated to assess transcript levels of the decidualization markers: prolactin (PRL) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1).</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>A two-tailed paired student t-test was used to analyze data from experiments with two experimental groups and one-way ANOVA followed by Tukeyâs post hoc multiple range test was used for multiple comparisons. All data are presented as mean Â±SEM. GraphPad Prism 9 software was used for all statistical analyses. Statistical tests, including p values, are reported in the corresponding figure legends or, when possible, directly on the data image. To ensure the reproducibility of our findings, experiments were replicated in a minimum of three independent samples, to demonstrate biological significance, and at least three independent times to ensure technical and experimental rigor and reproducibility.</p>

<title>Conditional deletion of <italic>Atg14</italic> in the FRT results in infertility despite the normal ovarian function</title>
<p>To explore the role of <italic>Atg14</italic> in uterine function, we first determined its expression levels in uterus during early pregnancy (Day 1-7) in mice. We found distinct expression of ATG14 in all the uterine compartments (luminal epithelium, glands, and stroma) by day 1 of pregnancy, which disappeared by day 2 of pregnancy (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). However, the ATG14 expression in uterus reappeared by day 3 and persisted through the day 7 of pregnancy. The period from day 3 to day 7 is critical, as it is during this time when uterus begins to prepare for embryo implantation and undergoes decidualization process. Consistent with protein expression, similar <italic>Atg14</italic> expression at mRNA levels was noted in uteri from early pregnant mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). This analysis suggests a potential role for ATG14 protein in the uterine physiologic adaptations during early pregnancy. Thus, to study the role of ATG14 in uterine function, we generated a conditional knockout (PR<sup>cre/+</sup> /<italic>Atg14</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup>) mouse model by crossing <italic>Atg14</italic> flox/flox mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of progesterone receptor promoter (PR<sup>cre/+</sup>). Histological examination of the uterus from adult females showed no gross morphological differences between <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO and control mice (<bold>Fig. S1A</bold>). Further, we did not find any overt defects in ovary as cKO mice had normal follicles and corpus luteum as like their corresponding controls (<bold>Fig. S1B</bold>). Analysis of transcript levels from the uterus, ovary, and liver showed that while <italic>Atg14</italic> levels were efficiently depleted in uteri from cKO mice the levels were unaltered in the ovary and liver samples in control and cKO mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>). Immunofluorescence analysis further confirmed the efficient deletion of ATG14 in all uterine compartments (epithelium and stroma) of cKO mice uteri compared to corresponding control groups (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>Atg14</italic> results in impaired embryo implantation and uterine receptivity in mice</title>
<p>Based on the normal ovarian morphology, we posited that the infertility observed in females with <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO status could be attributed to compromised uterine functioning. Analysis of the implanting embryos at Day 5 of pregnancy found no implantation sites in the uteri of <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO females, whereas â¼8 to 9 implantation sites were seen in the uteri of control mice at 5 dpc (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, left panel</bold>). Whilst there was no embryo present in the uterine lumen of <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO mice, a fully attached embryo encapsulated by the luminal uterine epithelium, were seen in control mice uteri were (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, middle panel</bold>). Additionally, MUC1, a receptive marker expression was persisted in the luminal epithelium of cKO mice uteri at 5 dpc as well as 4 dpc (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, right panel, Fig. S2A</bold>). The process of successful embryo attachment and implantation within the uterus necessitates a transition from a non-receptive to a receptive state, a transformation orchestrated under the regulated influence of steroid hormones. Thus, the effects of <italic>Atg14</italic> loss on uterine responsiveness to steroid hormones E2 and P4 was characterised. We performed an established hormone-induced uterine receptivity experiment, which involved ordered and co-stimulatory actions of E2 and P4 leading to the initiation of a receptive phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. In response to E2 treatment, uteri from both <italic>Atg14</italic> control and cKO mice showed similar proliferation as evidenced from Ki-67 staining (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, middle panel</bold>). Following the co-stimulation with E2+P4 treatment, epithelial proliferation was inhibited with concomitant induction of stromal cell proliferation in control mice uteri indicating fully receptive uteri (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Interestingly, cKO mice uteri failed to elicit sub-epithelial stromal cell proliferation and showed intact P4-driven inhibition of epithelial proliferation. Consistently, uteri from <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO mice at 4 dpc showed reduced number of proliferating stromal cells (<bold>Fig. S2B</bold>). These results demonstrate that ATG14 is required for P4-mediated but not for E2-mediated actions during uterine receptivity.</p>

<p>Given that stromal cell proliferation is a prerequisite for successful decidualization, we wondered whether cKO mice uteri can undergo the decidualization process.

(<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, left panel</bold>). Further, a significant reduction in proliferative pH3-positive and multinucleated decidualized stromal cells were noted in cKO mice stimulated uterine horns (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Also, the decidualization markers <italic>Wnt4</italic> and <italic>Bmp2</italic> was significantly reduced in stimulated horns of cKO mice compared to control mice (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>)</bold>.

<title><italic>Atg14</italic> is required for maintaining oviductal cell plasticity and embryo transport</title>
<p>Given that <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO mice had impaired embryo implantation, we wondered whether embryos are reaching the uterus timely through oviduct. To determine this, we flushed embryos from both the control and cKO mice uteri on day 4 of pregnancy. Interestingly, in cKO mice, we could retrieve only 1-2% of embryos from their uteri, whereas in control mice, 100% of well-developed blastocysts were retrieved from their uteri (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, Upper and lower panel</bold>). To ensure the timely transport of all embryos from the oviducts to the uteri, we also flushed oviducts from both control and cKO mice. As expected, in the control mice oviduct flushing, we could not recover any embryos or blastocysts, indicating their precise and timely transport to the uterus. Unexpectedly, oviduct flushing from cKO mice resulted in the retrieval of approximately 80-90% of blastocysts, suggesting their potential entrapment within the oviducts, impeding their transit to the uterus (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>). Similarly, when we super-ovulated the mice and looked for the embryos on the day 4 of pregnancy, we could recover â¼20-25 embryos from the cKO mice oviducts compared to only 4-5 embryos that were able to reach the uterus. In comparison, in control mice, 90% of embryos were able to complete their pre-destined and timely transport to the uterus (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>), except 1-2% of unfertilized embryos, which remained in their oviducts.</p>

<p>To understand the underlying cause for retained embryos in cKO mice oviducts, we performed histology analysis and determined the structural morphology of their oviducts. The cKO mice oviduct lining shows marked eosinophilic cytoplasmic change akin to decidualization in human oviducts. Some of the cells showed degenerative changes with cytoplasmic vacuolization and nuclear pyknosis, loss of nuclear polarity, and loss of distinct cell borders giving an appearance of fusion of cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>). The marked cytologic enlargement appears to cause luminal obliteration or narrowing resulting in a completely unorganized, obstructed, and narrow lumen, thereby, hampering the path of embryos to reach the uterus as evident from an entrapped embryo shown in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>. Further, epithelial (cytokeratin KRT8-positive) and myosalpinx (Î±-smooth muscle active [SMA]-positive,) marker analysis revealed completely distorted epithelial structures (in terms of loss of epithelial cell integrity or plasticity). However, there were no overt defects in the muscle organization in oviducts of cKO mice (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>). To gain more insights into structural defects, we performed TEM analysis on oviducts collected from both control and cKO females on day 4 of pregnancy. Interestingly, oviducts from cKO females had numerous altered mitochondrial structures with abnormally enlarged mitochondria and a less dense matrix compared to control oviducts that had small and compact mitochondria with tight cristae and a dense matrix (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>). Together, these results demonstrate that Atg14 is required for maintaining oviductal cell plasticity and embryo transport.</p>

<title>Selective loss of <italic>Atg14</italic> in oviduct cilia is dispensable for female fertility</title>
<p>The oviduct epithelium primarily consists of two types of cells: ciliated and secretory (non-ciliated) cells. Ciliated cells play a role in embryo and oocyte transport by means of ciliary beat, and non-ciliated/secretory cells produce an oviductal fluid that is rich in amino acids and various molecules, thereby providing an optimal micro-environment for sperm capacitation, fertilization, embryonic survival, and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Therefore, we determined whether oviducts from cKO mice possess normal ciliated and secretory cell composition. To do so, we examined the expression of various markers, including acetylated-Î±-tubulin (cilia marker), FOXJ1 (ciliogenesis markers), and PAX8 (non-ciliated/ secretory cell marker). As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>, while we observed normal ciliary structures in the ampulla of both control and cKO oviducts, there was a remarkable reduction in the ciliary cells (indicated by fewer Î±-tubulin and FOXJ1-positive cells) as well as secretory cells (indicated by fewer PAX-8 positive cells) in the isthmus of cKO oviducts (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">B</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<title><italic>Atg14</italic> prevents unscheduled pyroptosis activation in the oviduct to enable embryo transport</title>
<p>Having identified the cellular mechanisms of Atg14, we aimed to delineate the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with Atg14 function in oviduct. Since, we found mitochondrial defects with ATG14 loss and altered mitochondrial structures have been linked to the activation of pyroptosis, we determined if ATG14 regulates pyroptosis in oviduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. First, we assessed the key primary executors of the pyroptosis pathway, GSDMD and caspase-1. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a remarkable upregulation in GSDMD and caspase-1 expression in the cKO oviducts compared to controls (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">B</xref></bold>). Consistently, western blot analysis also confirmed elevated expression of caspase-1 and GSDMD in cKO oviducts in comparison to control oviducts as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>. The qPCR analysis further demonstrated elevated levels of inflammatory markers, such as <italic>Tnf-Î±</italic> and <italic>Cxcr3</italic> in cKO oviducts compared to control ones (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>). Based on these findings, we posit that Atg14 exerts a regulatory control over the pyroptotic pathway and activation of pyroptosis owing to loss of ATG14 within the oviduct adversely impacts embryo transport. However, to substantiate the aforementioned notion, we also evaluated the impact of unscheduled activation of pyroptosis on the embryo transport. To test this, we employed a pyroptosis inducer, Polyphyllin VI and chose the optimal dose based on the established studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Wild type females were mated with virile males and following the plug detection treated with Polyphyllin VI for three consecutive days from 1 to 4 dpc (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref></bold>). We chose to treat to 1 to 4 dpc for treatment to activate unwarranted pyroptosis in oviduct prior to embryo transport. Following the treatments, the oviducts, and uteri from both vehicle-treated and Polyphyllin VI-treated were flushed. We found that pregnant females treated with Polyphyllin VI showed â¼50% embryo retention in the oviduct, whereas in the vehicle-treated group, no embryos were retained in the oviduct (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">G</xref></bold>). Precisely activating the unscheduled pyroptosis during the critical period of embryo transport is technically challenging. Nonetheless, our findings provide evidence that unscheduled pyroptosis adversely affects embryo transport through the oviduct.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we delineated the essential role of ATG14 in maintaining the structural integrity of the oviduct by preventing pyroptosis, which enables smooth embryo transit during early pregnancy. Specifically, we dissected the tissue-specific functions of ATG14 in the FRT using Cre driver mice targeting female reproductive tract. Given that PR-Cre expresses postnatally in different tissues of FRT such as corpus luteum, oviducts, and different cellular compartments (epithelial, stromal, and myometrium) of uteri [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], we found that conditional ablation of ATG14-mediated functions in FRT resulted in infertility owing to hampered transport of embryos from the oviduct. Additionally, <italic>Atg14</italic> loss in uteri causes impaired embryo implantation, receptivity, and decidualization. Its ablation in the oviduct causes activation of pyroptosis, an inflammatory-associated apoptosis pathway that causes the retention of embryos in the oviduct and prevents their timely transport to the uterus. However, the ovarian-specific functions were found to be unaffected despite the loss of <italic>Atg14</italic> in the corpus luteum.</p>
<p>The human endometrium is a complex dynamic tissue that undergoes sequential phases of proliferation and differentiation to support embryo implantation during the conceptive. However, in absence of implanting embryo, endometrium sheds (menstruation) and initiates regeneration process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Previous reports indicated that autophagy is modulated in the human endometrium during the menstrual cycle. For example, autophagy altered during the proliferative and secretory phases of the menstrual cycle with its highest activity occurring during the secretory phase when the stroma is decidualized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Similarly, the level of autophagy was higher in postmenopausal human uterine epithelial cells compared to premenopausal uterine epithelial cells indicating the onset of autophagy upon estrogen deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Although all these studies reported that autophagy is hormonally regulated, however, the role of autophagy-specific proteins in the endometrium is not established till our groupâs recent reports. Specifically, studies from our group reported the role of three different autophagy-associated proteins: FIP200 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], ATG16L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], and BECLIN-1 in uterine functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Conditional ablation of <italic>Fip200</italic> and <italic>Atg16l</italic> in the uterus displayed fertility defects owing to impaired implantation, uterine receptivity, and decidualization defects. On contrary, loss of <italic>Beclin1</italic> in the uterus caused progressive loss of endometrial progenitor stem cells resulting in severe uterine developmental defects and rendered the mice infertile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Although the autophagy-related proteins we studied so far influenced uterine functions, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], we found a distinct role for ATG14 in both the uterine and oviduct-specific functions. It is intriguing to note that the absence of ATG14 did not affect the tissue integrity of the uterus. However, the severe structural abnormalities in the oviduct due to <italic>Atg14</italic> ablation unearthed a unique function of Atg14 in maintaining oviduct homeostasis. This distinctive role of ATG14, unlike other autophagy proteins, might be due to its pivotal role in the assembly of PtdIns3K complexes which is not the case for either FIP200 or ATG16L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Nevertheless, understanding the specific contributions of each core autophagy protein in reproductive tract functions is necessary which requires substantial efforts.</p>
<p>The retention of preimplantation embryos in the oviduct established as a significant contributor to implantation failures, presenting challenges to the overall reproductive health of women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Embryo transport in the oviduct is known to be controlled primarily by two major physiological responses: ciliary activity and muscle contractility. In our study, a dramatic decrease in the number of Foxj1<sup>+ve</sup> ciliary epithelial cells and Pax-8<sup>+ve</sup> secretory cells in <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO mice implied cell-type specific actions for ATG14 in oviduct. Interestingly, the specific ablation of <italic>Atg14</italic> in Foxj1+ve ciliary epithelial cells of the oviduct does not appear to impact fertility. This suggests that the absence of ATG14 within ciliary cells does not impact the process of embryo transport. Although unexpected, this is consistent with other reports that have demonstrated the dispensability of cilia for embryo transport in the oviduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, characterized by cell swelling, flattening of the cytoplasm and large bubbles like protrusions on the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Several recent studies found a link between autophagy and pyroptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies also found that mice lacking the autophagy genes <italic>Atg14</italic>, <italic>Fip200</italic>, <italic>Atg5</italic>, or <italic>Atg7</italic> in myeloid cells had more pronounced lung inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. In our study, cellular swelling, and fused membranous structures (a unique feature of activation of pyroptosis) observed in the oviductal epithelial folds from <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO mice. This aberrant activation of the pyroptosis pathway due to loss of <italic>Atg14</italic> appear to adversely affect the oviduct cellular plasticity. These findings have implications beyond the oviduct, as autophagy can modulate the inflammatory signalling pathway through different avenues. For example, first, autophagy prevents mitochondrial reactive oxygen species release that can activate the inflammasome by inhibiting IL1-Î² and IL18 production through the digestion of dysfunctional mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Second, autophagy is capable of targeting inflammasome complexes for degradation, which prevents the cleavage of pro-IL-1Î² and pro-IL-18 into biologically active forms. Finally, autophagy machinery further regulates IL-1Î² levels by engulfing and degrading pro-IL-1Î² proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. In our study, accumulation of abnormally enlarged and dysfunctional mitochondria in absence of ATG14 in oviduct clearly suggests induction of severe inflammatory conditions hampering the embryo transit through the oviduct. These findings are further substantiated by the upregulation of pivotal mediators of the pyroptosis program, including GSDMD and caspase-1, in <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO mice. Notably, the induction of pyroptosis in the absence of ATG14 is specifically localized to the oviducts, with no parallel activation detected in either the ovary or uterus. This distinct activation pattern suggests a unique interaction between oviduct-specific proteins and ATG14, which keeps pyroptosis at the bay in the oviduct. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the oviduct-cell-specific roles of ATG14 necessitates additional investigations, employing oviduct-specific cKO mouse models.</p>
<p>In this report, we revealed tissue-specific roles of ATG14 in governing oviductal transport, and uterine receptivity which are necessary for embryo implantation and pregnancy establishment. Of mechanistic insights, we delineated a novel function of ATG14 as a negative regulator of pyroptosis, which is vital for proper embryo transport in the oviduct (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 H</xref></bold>). Thus, this study not only sheds light on the involvement of autophagy in oviductal embryo transport but also underscores the importance of autophagy in preserving the oviduct tissue integrity. Such insights hold promise for advancing our understanding of gynaecological pathologies associated with the oviduct including tubal pregnancies.</p>

<p>This study by Popli et al. evaluated the function of Atg14, an autophagy protein, in reproductive function using a conditional knockout mouse model.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Popli et al investigated the roles of the autophagy-related gene, Atg14, in the female reproductive tract (FRT) using conditional knockout mouse models. By ablation of Atg14 in both oviduct and uterus with PR-Cre (Atg14 cKO), the authors discovered that such females are completely infertile. They went on to show that Atg14 cKO females have impaired embryo implantation and uterus receptivity due to impaired response to P4 stimulation and stromal decidualization. In addition to the uterus defect, the authors also discovered that early embryos are trapped inside the oviduct and cannot be efficiently transported to the uterus in these females. They went on to show that oviduct epithelium in Atg14 cKO females showed increased pyroptosis, which disrupts oviduct epithelial integrity and leads to obstructive oviduct lumen and impaired embryo transport. Therefore, the authors concluded that autophagy is critical for maintaining the oviduct homeostasis and keeping the inflammation under check to enable proper embryo transport.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study revealed an important and unexpected role of the autophagy-related gene Atg14 in preventing pyroptosis and maintaining oviduct epithelial integrity, which is poorly studied in the field of reproductive biology. The study is well designed to test the roles of ATG14 in mouse oviduct and uterus. The experimental data in general support the conclusion and the interpretations are mostly accurate. This work should be of interest to reproductive biologists and scientists in the field of autophagy and pyroptosis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite the strengths, there are several major weaknesses raising concerns. In addition, the mismatched figure panels, the undefined acronyms, and the poor description/presentation of some of the data significantly hinder the readability of the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) In the abstract, the authors stated that &quot;autophagy is critical for maintaining the oviduct homeostasis and keeping the inflammation under check to enable embryo transport&quot;. This statement is not substantiated. Although Atg14 is an autophagy-related gene and plays a critical role in oviduct homeostasis, the authors did not show a direct link between autophagy and pyroptosis/oviduct integrity. In addition, the authors pointed out in the last paragraph of the introduction that none of the other autophagy-related genes (ATG16L, FIP200, BECN1) exhibited any discernable impact on oviduct function. Therefore, the oviduct defect is caused by Atg14 specifically, not necessarily by autophagy.</p>
<p>(2) In lines 412-414, the authors stated that &quot;Atg14 ablation in the oviduct causes activation of pyroptosis&quot;, which is also not supported by the experimental data. The authors did not show that Atg14 is expressed in oviduct cells. PR-Cre is also not specific in oviduct cells. It is possible that Atg14 knockout in other PR-expressing tissues (such as the uterus) indirectly activates pyroptosis in the oviduct. More experiments will be required to support this claim. In line with the no defect when Atg14 is knocked out in oviduct ciliary cells, it will be good to use the secretory cells Cre, such as Pax8-Cre, to demonstrate that Atg14 functions in the secretory cells of the oviduct thus supporting this conclusion.</p>
<p>(3) With FOXJ1-Cre, the authors attempted to specifically knockout Atg14 in ciliary cells, but there are no clear fertility and embryo implantation defects in Foxj1/Atg14 cKO mice. The author should provide the verification data to show that Atg14 had been effectively depleted in ciliary cells if Atg14 is normally expressed.</p>
<p>(4) In lines 307-313, the author tested whether ATG14 is required for the decidualization of HESCs. The author stated that &quot;Control siRNA transfected cells when treated with EPC seemed to change their morphological transformation from fibroblastic to epithelioid (Fig. 2E) and had increased expression of the decidualization markers IGFBP1 and PRL by day three only (Fig. 2F)&quot;. First, the labels in Figure 2 are not corresponding to the description in the text. Second, the morphology of the HESCs in control and Atg14 siRNA group showed no obvious difference even at day 3 and day 6. The author should point out the difference in each panel and explain in the text or figure legend.</p>
<p>(5) In lines 332-336, the authors pointed out that the cKO mice oviduct lining shows marked eosinophilic cytoplasmic change, but there's no data to support the claim. In addition, the authors further described that &quot;some of the cells showed degenerative changes with cytoplasmic vacuolization and nuclear pyknosis, loss of nuclear polarity, and loss of distinct cell borders giving an appearance of fusion of cells (Fig. 3D)&quot;. First, Figure 3D did not show all these phenotypes and it is likely a mismatch to Figure 3E. Even in Figure 3E, it is not obvious to notice all the phenotypes described here. The figure legend is overly simple, and there's no explanation of the arrowheads in the panel. More data/images are required to support the claim here and provide a clear indication and explanation in the figure legend.</p>
<p>(6) In lines 317-325, it is rather confusing about the description of the portion of embryos from the oviduct and uterus. In addition, the total number of embryos was not provided. I would recommend presenting the numerical data to show the average embryos from the oviduct and uterus instead of using the percentage data in Figures 3A and 5G.</p>
<p>(7) In lines 389-391, authors tested whether Polyphyllin VI treatment led to activated pyroptosis and blocked embryo transport. Although Figures 5F-G showed the expected embryo transport defect, the authors did not show the pyroptosis and oviduct morphology. It will be important to show that the Polyphyllin VI treatment indeed led to oviduct pyroptosis and lumen disruption.</p>
<p>(8) In line 378, it would be better to include a description of pyroptosis and its molecular mechanisms to help readers to better understand your experiments. Alternatively, you can add it in the introduction.</p>
<p>(9) Please make sure to provide definitions for the acronyms such as FRT, HESCs, GSDMD, etc.</p>
<p>(10) It is rather confusing to use oviducal cell plasticity in this manuscript. The work illustrated the oviducal epithelial integrity, not the plasticity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Pooja Popli and co-authors tested the importance of Atg14 in the female reproductive tract by conditionally deleting Atg14 using PrCre and also Foxj1cre. The authors showed that loss of Atg14 leads to infertility due to the retention of embryos within the oviduct. The authors further concluded that the retention of embryos within the oviduct is due to pyroptosis in oviduct cells leading to defective cellular integrity. The manuscript has some interesting findings, however there are also areas that could be improved.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The importance of Atg14 and autophagy in the female reproductive tract is incompletely understood. The manuscript also provides partial evidence about a new mechanism linking Atg14 to pyropotosis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) It is not clear why the loss of Atg14 selectively induces Pyroptosis within oviduct cells but not in other cellular compartments. The authors should demonstrate that these events are not happening in uterine cells.</p>
<p>(2) The manuscript never showed any effect on the autophagy upon loss of Atg14. Is there any effect on autophagy upon Atg14 loss? If so does that contribute to the observation?</p>
<p>(3) It is not clear what the authors meant by cellular plasticity and integrity. There is no evidence provided in that aspect that the plasticity of oviduct cells is lost. Similarly, more experimental evidence is necessary for the conclusion about cellular integrity.</p>
<p>(4) The mitochondrial phenotype shown in Figure 3 didn't appear as severe as it is described in the results section. The analyses should be more thorough. They should include multiple frames (in supplemental information) showing mitochondrial morphology in multiple cells. The authors should also test that aspect in uterine cells. The authors should measure Feret's diagram. Difference in membrane potential etc. for a definitive conclusion.</p>
<p>(5) The comment that the loss of Atg14 and pyroptosis leads to the narrowing of the lumen in the oviduct should be experimentally shown.</p>
<p>(6) The manuscript never showed the proper mechanism through which Atg14 loss induces pyroptosis. The authors should link the mechanism.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for insightful comments and helpful suggestions. We will address majority of the concerns. Specifically, we will evaluate whether loss of Atg14 leads pyroptosis in other reproductive tract tissue, uterus, and ovary. To determine the ATG14 spatiotemporal expression, we will assess the ATG14 expression in oviducts of WT, and cKO mouse models. Further, to understand the impact of Atg14 loss on different regions of oviduct, we would provide additional images from cKO mice and will quantify FOXJ1 positive cells. To address the concerns on cyclicity and steroid hormone levels, we will measure the E2 or P4 levels and assess E2-target genes in uterus from control and cKO mice. We will also include the ampullary section images from the oviducts of Atg14 cKO and control females.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer on this, we will take a cautious approach and will modify the statements that ATG14 dependent autophagy might be critical for maintaining the oviduct homeostasis and keeping the inflammation under check to enable embryo transport.</p>

<p>(6) The manuscript never showed the proper mechanism through which Atg14 loss induces pyroptosis. The authors should link the mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Autophagy has been shown to inhibit pyroptosis by either inhibiting the cleavage of GSDMD or by suppressing various pyroptosis-related factors, including NFLRs and STING proteins. We found that the loss of Atg14 results in elevated GSDMD levels, a potential mechanism through which Atg14 suppresses pyroptosis in the oviduct. Importantly, Atg14 may regulate GSDMD through several intermediary factors, and resolving this intricate nexus necessitates conducting complex biochemical, cellular, and molecular screenings, which is one of the focus of our future investigations.</p>
