<title>Abstract</title><p>Dense core vesicles (DCVs) transport and release various neuropeptides and neurotrophins that control diverse brain functions, but the DCV secretory pathway remains poorly understood. Here, we tested a prediction emerging from invertebrate studies about the crucial role of the intracellular trafficking GTPase Rab10, by assessing DCV exocytosis at single- cell resolution upon acute Rab10 depletion in mature mouse hippocampal neurons, to circumvent potential confounding effects of Rab10’s established role in neurite outgrowth.</p>
<p>We observed a significant inhibition of DCV exocytosis in Rab10-depleted neurons, whereas synaptic vesicle exocytosis was unaffected. However, rather than a direct involvement in DCV trafficking, this effect was attributed to two ER-dependent processes, ER-regulated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and protein synthesis. Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed proteins upon Rab10 depletion identified substantial alterations in synaptic and ER/ribosomal proteins, including the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-pump SERCA2. In addition, ER morphology and dynamics were altered, ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were depleted and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis was impaired in Rab10-depleted neurons. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry using a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore still triggered less DCV exocytosis. Instead, leucine supplementation, which enhances protein synthesis, largely rescued DCV exocytosis deficiency. We conclude that Rab10 is required for neuropeptide release by maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and regulating protein synthesis. Furthermore, DCV exocytosis appeared more dependent on (acute) protein synthesis than synaptic vesicle exocytosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dense core vesicles (DCVs) transport and release neuromodulators (neuropeptides, neurotrophic factors, and catecholamines) that play crucial roles in modulating diverse brain functions, including sleep, mood, memory, and learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cawley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Malva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Poo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Salio et al., 2006</xref>). Deficits in neuropeptide signaling pathways have been associated with several human disorders and diseases, including anxiety, depression, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beck, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sah and Geracioti, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barde et al., 2022</xref>). Neuropeptides are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequently packaged into immature DCVs in the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tooze et al., 2001</xref>). DCVs are transported along the neurites and undergo activity-dependent membrane fusion with the plasma membrane to release their content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Farina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Heidelberger et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nassal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Thomas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the critical role of neuropeptides in brain functions, the regulatory mechanisms governing their secretion are not fully understood. We have shown previously that Rab3 is an essential regulator in the last steps of the DCV secretory pathway in mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>). However, studies in invertebrates have also implicated other Rab proteins, including Rab2, Rab5, and Rab10, in the DCV secretory pathway: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ailion et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Azouz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Edwards et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hannemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lund et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sasidharan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sumakovic et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Among these Rab proteins, Rab10 deficiency produces the strongest inhibition of neuropeptide accumulation in coelomocytes in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> suggesting deficits in DCV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sasidharan et al., 2012</xref>). With its subcellular localization in many vesicular organelles, such as plasmalemmal precursor vesicles (PPVs), GLUT4 transport vesicles, and recycling endosomes, Rab10 regulates various aspects of intracellular membrane trafficking, including vesicle formation, transport, and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Larance et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mîinea et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). Rab10 deficiency leads to deficits in these pathways, resulting in impaired neuronal outgrowth and disrupted retrograde axonal transport of signaling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lazo and Schiavo, 2023</xref>). How these deficits relate to the strong inhibition of DCV exocytosis remains unknown.</p>
<p>Deletion of Rab10 expression or inhibiting its functions by overexpression of an inactive mutant (Rab10T23N) leads to abnormal ER morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">English and Voeltz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lv et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shih and Hsueh, 2016</xref>). Since the ER is a crucial organelle involved in protein synthesis, Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering, and lipid metabolism, alterations in its structure and function can directly or indirectly affect neuronal secretory pathways. Indeed, several studies have suggested the roles of the ER in the DCV pathway, such as the involvement of ER stress and lipid levels in DCV production in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Laurent et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Valadas et al., 2018</xref>), and the roles of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> as an internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> source regulating somatodendritic dopamine release in mouse substantia nigra neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Patel et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, Rab10 mutations, altered expression levels, or phosphorylation states are firmly associated with CNS disorders (Agola et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2005; Ishida et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kiral et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, the strong inhibition of neuropeptide accumulation in coelomocytes in nematode Rab10 mutants may be a direct or indirect effect of Rab10 loss of function on DCV exocytosis and Rab10-dependent disease processes may (in part) be explained by DCV exocytosis impairment.</p>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the involvement of Rab10 in regulated secretion of neuropeptides in mammalian neurons. We directly assessed DCV exocytosis at single-cell resolution in mouse hippocampal neurons and confirmed that Rab10 is a crucial regulator of DCV exocytosis also in mammalian systems, while not affecting synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis. However, instead of having a direct role in the DCV secretory pathway, we observed that Rab10 is involved in DCV exocytosis through ER-dependent processes, especially reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and impaired global protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Supplementation with leucine known to boost protein synthesis, rescued the defects in DCV exocytosis. We therefore conclude that Rab10 plays a central role in regulating DCV exocytosis by maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and protein synthesis.</p>

<title>Rab10 regulates neuronal outgrowth but is dispensable for synaptogenesis and SV exocytosis</title>
<p>To study the role of Rab10 in regulated secretion, we utilized a knockdown strategy since complete knockout of Rab10 results in lethality at cell and organismal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lv et al., 2015</xref>). We selected two specific shRNA sequences, shRNA#9, and shRNA#11, to deplete Rab10 expression, and a scrambled sequence as control. In mouse cortical neurons infected with either shRNA#9 or shRNA#11 at day in vitro 0 (DIV0), we observed a 75-95% decrease in Rab10 expression at DIV14 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Previous studies have shown that Rab10 regulates neuronal outgrowth (Fukuda, 2008; Hutagalung and Novick, 2011). Consistent with these findings, we observed a significantly reduced dendrite and axon length in neurons infected with shRNA#9 at DIV0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>).</p>

<p>To test the effects of Rab10 depletion on synaptogenesis, synaptic vesicles (SVs) were quantified using the endogenous marker synaptophysin-1 (Syp1). Syp1 staining exhibited a punctate distribution at DIV14, indicating the accumulation of SVs in boutons/synapses, and no changes in the number of puncta per µm neurite or the intensity of Syp1 puncta (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>). These data confirm that Rab10 regulates neurite outgrowth, but we found no evidence for a role in synaptogenesis.</p>
<p>To test whether Rab10 depletion affects SV exocytosis, hippocampal neurons were infected with the SV exocytosis reporter Synaptophysin-pHluorin (SypHy; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Granseth et al., 2006</xref>). SV exocytosis was triggered by high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS, 5s 40- Hz). The total vesicle pool was measured by briefly superfusing Tyrode’s solution containing 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. The fraction of fused SVs, determined by the ratio of SypHy intensity upon HFS to the maximum intensity upon NH<sub>4</sub>Cl superfusion, was comparable in the two groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I-J</xref>). In addition, SV endocytosis, measured by the fluorescence decay of SypHy after HFS, was unaffected by Rab10 depletion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that Rab10 is dispensable for SV exocytosis.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Rab10 is a major regulator of DCV exocytosis</title>
<p>To investigate the role of Rab10 in neuropeptide release, we depleted Rab10 levels at DIV0, expressed the DCV exocytosis reporter NPY-pHluorin at DIV9-10, and performed live-cell imaging at DIV14. Our previous studies have demonstrated that NPY-pHluorin almost exclusively localizes to DCVs as indicated by its strong co-localization with endogenous markers of DCVs, such as BDNF and the chromogranins CHGA and CHGB (Arora et al., 2017; Dominguez et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>). To achieve single-vesicle resolution analysis of DCV exocytosis, we used single cultured hippocampal neurons on glial micro- islands. Neurons were stimulated by 16 trains of 50 action potentials (APs) at 50 Hz, a protocol known to trigger robust DCV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Balkowiec and Katz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Emperador-Melero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gärtner and Staiger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hartmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Moro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>). Fusion events were detected as a rapid appearance of fluorescent puncta (<xref rid="figs2_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). DCV exocytosis in Rab10 KD neurons was significantly reduced by 60% compared to control neurons (<xref rid="figs2_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C- D</xref>). Furthermore, the total number of DCVs was reduced by 30% in Rab10 KD neurons (<xref rid="figs2_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The fusion fraction, which represents the number of DCV fusion events relative to the remaining DCV pool after stimulation, was also significantly decreased by 50% in Rab10 KD neurons (<xref rid="figs2_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Overexpression of wild-type, knockdown-resistant Rab10 rescued DCV exocytosis deficits in Rab10 KD neurons (<xref rid="figs2_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-F</xref>).</p>
<p>To overcome the potential confounding effects of impaired neurite outgrowth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and reduced total DCV pool (<xref rid="figs2_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) upon Rab10 depletion starting at DIV0, we adopted a more acute approach to interfere with Rab10 function, and late enough not to affect neuronal morphology and the total DCV pool. Neurons were transfected with shRNA against Rab10 at DIV7, fixed at DIV14, and stained with markers for dendrites (MAP2), axons (SMI312), and SVs (Syp1). Rab10 expression was reduced by 70% after 7 days of infection (Appendix 1—figure 3). No significant alterations in total dendrite length, axon length (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>), or synapse density (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) were observed in Rab10 KD neurons under these conditions. Therefore, to eliminate confounding effects on morphological parameters, we reevaluated DCV exocytosis and all further experiments in neurons infected with shRNA at DIV7. DCV exocytosis in Rab10 KD neurons remained significantly lower by 50% compared to control neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-I</xref>). The fusion fraction was also significantly reduced by 65% in Rab10 KD neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). Overexpression of wild-type Rab10 rescued DCV exocytosis deficits. No significant differences in the total number of DCVs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>), DCV transport (<xref rid="figs2_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-2B, 2E</xref>), or cargo loading (<xref rid="figs2_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F-K</xref>) were observed. Thus, these data indicate that Rab10 depletion specifically inhibits activity-dependent neuropeptide release in hippocampal neurons, without effects on DCV biogenesis, cargo loading, and transport and independent of Rab10’s established role in neuronal outgrowth.</p>

<title>Proteins involved in synaptic transmission and translation are severely dysregulated upon Rab10 depletion</title>
<p>To comprehensively investigate Rab10 function in mature neurons, mass spectrometry proteomics was performed on Rab10 KD and control neurons at DIV14. A total of approximately 5400 unique proteins were identified and quantified in two biological replicates. The complete list of proteins quantified in this study is presented in Appendix 1- figure 3. Only differentially expressed proteins detected with high confidence characterized by a log2(fold change) &gt; 0.56, and q-value &lt; 0.01, were included in the subsequent analysis. Among the dysregulated proteins, 71% were upregulated, while 29% were downregulated, resulting in a significant dysregulation of 19% of the total protein pool in Rab10 KD neurons. These data indicate that Rab10 depletion leads to major neuronal proteome dysregulation within 7 days after initiating knockdown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>To gain insights into the functional consequences of Rab10 depletion, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis using ClueGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bindea et al., 2009</xref>). This analysis revealed that biological processes related to chemical synaptic transmission were notably affected by Rab10 depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, several biological processes related to protein synthesis, such as cytoplasmic translation and ribosomal large subunit biogenesis, were among the top 5 terms with the lowest <italic>p</italic>-values (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Subcellular localization analysis of these dysregulated proteins upon Rab10 depletion showed that cytosolic ribosomal proteins were the most significantly affected, followed by dendritic proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Further characterization of the dysregulated synaptic proteins was performed using SynGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Koopmans et al., 2019</xref>). Among the 391 significantly dysregulated proteins annotated in SynGO, 205 were classified as presynaptic proteins and 237 as postsynaptic proteins. GO enrichment analysis revealed that biological processes in metabolism were most dysregulated upon Rab10 depletion. Among them, both pre and postsynaptic translation were significantly dysregulated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistent with the ClueGO analysis, SynGO highlighted a significant dysregulation of presynaptic (34 of 391) and postsynaptic ribosomal proteins (44 of 391), supporting the involvement of Rab10 in the regulation of neuronal protein synthesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, all dysregulated ribosomal proteins were upregulated upon Rab10 depletion, which contrasts with the mostly downregulated expression observed in the other classes of proteins (such as synaptic and cytoskeletal proteins) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-G</xref>). Taken together, GO analysis with both ClueGO and SynGO indicates a dysfunction of protein translation in Rab10 KD neurons.</p>
<p>Loss of Rab10 expression has been associated with altered ER morphology in mouse embryonic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lv et al., 2015</xref>), which may explain the selective upregulation of proteins involved in ribosome function in our proteomics data. Indeed, ER proteins were dysregulated substantially upon Rab10 depletion. Specifically, several rough ER proteins showed differential regulation, with SEC61A1 being upregulated, SEC61G being downregulated, and CLIMP remaining unchanged (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Most tubular ER proteins, such as RTN3/4 and VAPB, were robustly decreased. Interestingly, one of the ER membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, SERCA2, showed a 50% reduction upon Rab10 depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these analyses reveal that Rab10 depletion leads to major changes in protein expression, especially synaptic and ribosomal proteins, the latter all upregulated in Rab10- depleted neurons which suggests that protein synthesis is dysregulated, potentially due to altered ER function.</p>

<title>Rab10 regulates ER morphology and ribosomal protein levels</title>
<p>Given the substantial dysregulation of synapse and ribosome/ER proteins, we investigated synapses and ER further using electron microscopy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). These analyses revealed an apparently normal synapse morphology in Rab10 depleted neurons with many SVs clustered at the active zone, while DCVs were sparsely distributed along neurites and near the active zone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The length of the active zone (AZ) and postsynaptic density (PSD) were both decreased by 10% upon Rab10 depletion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>). However, other parameters of synaptic ultrastructure, such as the diameter of SVs or DCVs, and the number of SVs per synapse, were unchanged in Rab10 KD neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-H</xref>). Hence, despite substantial dysregulation of synaptic proteins, overall synapse morphology was hardly affected.</p>

<p>Tubular ER was also observed in some presynaptic sections, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Deng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Droz et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). The percentage of synaptic sections containing tubular ER was decreased by 24% (37% in Control versus 28% in Rab10 KD).</p>
<p>Rough ER (rER) was also studied in the somata of Rab10 depleted and control neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). The diameter of rER tubes was reduced by 15% in Rab10 KD neurons. Hence, the substantial dysregulation of ribosomal and ER proteins in Rab10-depleted neurons was accompanied by changes in the abundance of synaptic ER and small changes in ER morphology in the soma.</p>
<p>To study these effects on ER abundance and morphology further, we performed immunofluorescence staining for two endogenous ER markers, KDEL and RTN4. The average fluorescence intensity of RTN4 and KDEL staining was significantly decreased by 35% and 25% respectively in Rab10 KD neurons (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). The relative distributions of RTN4 and KDEL in neurites, as calculated by the intensity ratio of these two proteins in neurites over their somatic intensity, were reduced by 25% and 13%, respectively (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). In conclusion, the ultrastructural changes in ER abundance and morphology upon Rab10 depletion were accompanied by altered distribution of axonal ER, without affecting the ultrastructure of SVs and DCVs.</p>
<p>Finally, given the dynamic nature of ER tubular networks and the involvement of Rab10 in ER tubule extension in COS- 7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">English and Voeltz, 2013</xref>), we tested ER dynamics in Rab10 KD and control neurons expressing the luminal ER marker mCherry-ER3 using live- cell imaging at DIV8, and performed FRAP experiments at DIV14. The recovery of mCherry-ER3 intensity after photobleaching was significantly slower in Rab10 KD neurons with only 50% recovery within three minutes, compared to 80% recovery in control neurons (<xref rid="figs4_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that Rab10 depletion leads to reduced levels of ER-resident proteins altered ER abundance and morphology, and impaired ER dynamics.</p>

<title>Rab10 regulates SERCA2 levels and ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis</title>
<p>The ER is the largest internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> source in neurons and plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Karagas and Venkatachalam, 2019</xref>). The maintenance of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> primarily relies on the Sarco Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump. Among the three major paralogs of SERCA, SERCA2 is particularly enriched in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Britzolaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Periasamy and Kalyanasundaram, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Xu and Van Remmen, 2021</xref>). Consistent with the proteomic analysis which revealed a reduced SERCA2 expression upon Rab10 depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), immunoblotting confirmed the reduction of SERCA2 levels, showing a 50% reduction in Rab10 KD neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Therefore, ER alternations in Rab10 KD neurons may disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, which is essential for DCV exocytosis.</p>

<p>To test this, we next measured the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in ER ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>) using the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator ER-GCaMP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">de Juan-Sanz et al., 2017</xref>). We observed a reduction in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> in soma from 130 μM in control neurons to about 70 μM in Rab10-depleted neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> in neuritis was also reduced by 15% in Rab10 KD neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> was rescued by the expression of a knockdown-resistant Rab10 construct. To validate this observation, we assessed ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis indirectly by measuring the effect of caffeine on cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. As expected, in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, caffeine application (1 μM) triggered an increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER in both wild-type and Rab10 depleted neurons. However, the peak and the area of the caffeine-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response curves were both reduced by 30% in Rab10 KD neurons (<xref rid="figs5_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we examined ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics following a 10-minute caffeine treatment. Caffeine activates the ryanodine receptor (RyR), leading to the depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Endo, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fujimoto et al., 1980</xref>). As expected, perfusion with caffeine-induced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion, followed by recovery towards pre-stimulation levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-G</xref>). In wild- type neurons, Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were recovered by 90% at T=190 s. However, the refilling of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> was significantly delayed in Rab10 KD neurons, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were only recovered by 50% at T=190 s (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G-H</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, to investigate the consequence of the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion on neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in Rab10 KD neurons, we measured cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses triggered by action potentials (AP) using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fluo5F (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-C</xref>) and the genetically encoded Synaptophysin-GCaMP6 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-F</xref>). The AP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the soma, as measured by Fluo5F, were reduced by 40% upon Rab10 depletion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Similarly, the AP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in presynaptic nerve terminals, measured by Synaptophysin- GCaMP6, were also reduced (20%, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>), although this effect was smaller than the effects of Rab10 KD on ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and Caffeine-induced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that Rab10 knockdown leads to ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion and impairs neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, which may be attributed to the reduced levels of SERCA2 level and slower ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling and may contribute to the impaired DCV exocytosis.</p>

<title>Rab10 depletion impairs ionomycin-induced DCV exocytosis</title>
<p>To determine whether the impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling explains the DCV exocytosis deficiency in Rab10 KD neurons, we stimulated DCV exocytosis using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore ionomycin.</p>
<p>This approach bypasses cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and artificially increases the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration enough to trigger DCV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>).

Although the reduction was substantial, 45%, this impairment was not as substantial as observed for action potential-induced DCV exocytosis (65%, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). The total number of DCV was nearly identical between control and Rab10 KD neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>).

<p>Protein synthesis impairments may be rescued by supplementation with leucine, a branched- chain amino acid, that promotes protein synthesis by activating the mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ananieva et al., 2016</xref>). To test this in Rab10 KD neurons, additional L-leucine was added to the culture medium to increase the concentration to 5 mM for three days. Indeed, 5mM leucine supplementation significantly restored global protein synthesis deficits caused by Rab10 depletion (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A-B</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, a similar impairment in global protein synthesis was observed when a loss-of- function mutant of Rab10 (Rab10T23N) was overexpressed in wild-type neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>- B).

<title>Leucine supplementation restores normal DCV exocytosis</title>
<p>We hypothesized that protein synthesis deficits in Rab10-depleted neurons explain most of the impaired DCV exocytosis (in addition to a minor fraction explained by disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup>- homeostasis, see above) and tested whether leucine supplementation could rescue the DCV exocytosis deficits in Rab10 KD neurons. Rab10 depleted neurons expressing NPY-pHluorin were treated with 5mM leucine three days before live-cell imaging, or with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a control. Leucine supplementation restored DCV exocytosis by 80% caused by Rab10 depletion but did not alter DCV exocytosis in control neurons <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">(Figure 8C- F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the function of Rab10 in neuropeptide release in mature mouse hippocampal neurons. We found that DCV exocytosis triggered by action potential trains was reduced by 65% upon Rab10 depletion, whereas SV exocytosis was unaffected. In addition, we observed a depleted ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> pool and an impaired action potential-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in Rab10 KD neurons. However, DCV exocytosis triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ionophore ionomycin, a triggering method independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and internal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stores, was also impaired, albeit to a lesser extent. Furthermore, ribosomal proteins were massively dysregulated, and protein synthesis was impeded upon Rab10 depletion. Finally, the DCV exocytosis deficit in Rab10 KD neurons was largely rescued by leucine supplementation. We conclude that the strong inhibition of DCV exocytosis upon Rab10 depletion is mostly due to protein synthesis deficiency and to a lesser extent by dysregulation of Ca2+ channels and internal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stores.</p>

<title>Rab10 regulates neurite outgrowth but not membrane homeostasis in mature neurons</title>
<p>Rab10 is highly enriched in neurons and plays crucial roles in neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with these previous findings, we observed a reduction of axonal and dendritic outgrowth in Rab10-depleted neurons. Also consistent with previous findings in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sasidharan et al., 2012</xref>), we observed that the endogenous levels of SV markers are unchanged, indicating that SV biogenesis was unaffected. However, morphological characterization of neurons infected with shRNAs after the first week in culture did not identify changes in the total length of dendrites or axons, indicating that Rab10 is selectively required for outgrowth, not for subsequent membrane homeostasis or cell viability in mature neurons. Therefore, the strong deficit in neuropeptide release in DIV7-infected neurons is unlikely to be confounded by Rab10-dependent aspects of neuronal development.</p>

<title>Rab10 is crucial for DCV exocytosis but not for SV exocytosis</title>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, neuropeptide release was abolished in Rab10 deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sasidharan et al., 2012</xref>). We observed a 60% reduction in neuropeptide release in Rab10-depleted mature mouse hippocampal neurons. The difference in effect size could be explained by the incomplete Rab10 depletion with shRNA silencing or by redundant pathways in mammals, e.g. Rab10 and Rab8 are closely related paralogs and share many common effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Homma et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike Rab3, which travels together DCVs and exhibits a reduction of over 90% in DCV exocytosis in its quadruple knock-out neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>), Rab10 does not typically travel with DCVs (<xref rid="figs2_3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, no changes in DCV size, puncta intensity, puncta distribution, travel velocity, or -distance were detected in Rab10 KD neurons. We conclude that DCV exocytosis deficiency in Rab10-depleted neurons is not caused by alterations in DCV biogenesis or transport and that Rab10 is not required for DCV trafficking.</p>
<p>Although Rab10 is found in subcellular fractions enriched in synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Taoufiq et al., 2020</xref>), it is dispensable for SV exocytosis. Evoked postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were unaffected in Rab10 mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sasidharan et al., 2012</xref>). In line with this, SV exocytosis was unaffected in Rab10-depleted hippocampal neurons.</p>
<p>These results indicate that Rab10 is selectively required for DCV exocytosis, not for SV exocytosis. Strikingly, many synaptic proteins, including many involved in SV exocytosis, are among the most severely dysregulated proteins upon Rab10 depletion. SV exocytosis may be more resilient to acute protein changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>) than DCVs. In addition, vesicle secretion properties are different for DCVs and SVs. Unlike SVs, which are secreted upon a single electrical stimulation, DCVs need prolonged or more intense stimulation for the induction of fusion. Thus, the regulatory effects of Rab10 on DCV exocytosis might be amplified under prolonged stimulation.</p>

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis deficits contribute to DCV exocytosis deficits in Rab10 KD neurons</title>
<p>Rab10 KD neurons showed depleted ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> and impaired cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. These effects may contribute to the observed DCV exocytosis deficits. Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from the ER promotes DCV mobility and potentiates neuropeptide release via activating the CaMKII pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shakiryanova et al., 2007</xref>). However, this might not be the case in mouse neurons since most axonal ER takes Ca<sup>2+</sup> up from cytosol, instead of releasing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">de Juan-Sanz et al., 2017</xref>). Secondly, triggering Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER did not alter DCV transport and fusion (unpublished data from our lab). Finally, a previous study from our lab has shown that CaMKII deficiency does not alter DCV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Moro et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Hence, dysregulation of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics may not directly explain the observed DCV exocytosis deficits in Rab10-depleted neurons. However, ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> also regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by modulating L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the plasma membrane via a STIM1- based feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">de Juan-Sanz et al., 2017</xref>). Given the importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx for DCV exocytosis, dysregulation of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics may indirectly explain DCV exocytosis deficiency upon Rab10 depletion. However, Ionomycin-triggered DCV exocytosis, which bypasses voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, was still reduced, albeit to a lesser extent compared to action potential trains. This difference in effect size is consistent with a limited contribution for dysregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to explain the impaired DCV exocytosis in Rab10 KD neurons, while the majority of this phenotype is explained by deficits downstream of protein synthesis.</p>

<title>A role of Rab10 in protein synthesis largely explains DCV exocytosis deficiency in Rab10 KD neurons</title>
<p>In line with the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lv et al., 2015</xref>), which indicated alteration in ER morphology in Rab10 KO embryonic cells. We observed impaired ER morphology and upregulated ribosomal proteins upon Rab10 depletion. The upregulation of ribosomal proteins might be a compensatory response to altered ER structure as mutation of other ER-shaping proteins, such as VCP and ALT1, causes similar ribosomal abnormalities as Rab10 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shih and Hsueh, 2016</xref>). Protein homeostasis is vital for neuronal function and deficiency in protein translation is related to several CNS disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cajigas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Holt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Koga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Laguesse and Ron, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Dysregulation of ribosomes and ER is probably sufficient to explain the impaired protein translation in Rab10 KD neurons. Depleted ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> may induce ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arruda and Hotamisligil, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fu et al., 2011</xref>) which may also contribute to protein translation inhibition, but ATF4 levels are unaffected in Rab10 KD neurons, suggesting that ER stress is at best limited (<xref rid="figs4_3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A-B</xref>). In addition, Rab10 regulates the retrograde transport of TrkB signaling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lazo and Schiavo, 2023</xref>), which may activate the CREB/mTOR pathway and promote protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Moya-Alvarado et al., 2023</xref>). Hence, impaired TrkB transport may also contribute to impaired protein translation in addition to dysregulated ribosomes in Rab10 KD neurons. We found that restoring protein synthesis with leucine efficiently increased protein synthesis and largely restored DCV exocytosis deficiency in Rab10-depleted neurons. We conclude that dysregulation of protein synthesis results in DCV exocytosis deficits in these neurons.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate the importance of Rab10 in neuropeptide release and ER homeostasis. We observed altered ER morphology, reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, impaired protein synthesis, and impaired neuropeptide release in Rab10-depleted neurons. These observations shed light on the pathogenesis of Rab10-related disease. In addition, we have shown leucine can largely rescue deficiency in protein synthesis and neuropeptide release in Rab10-depleted neurons, providing a potential treatment for disorders associated with neuropeptide abnormalities such as depression and anxiety.</p>

<p>Dissociated neurons were spun down at 1000 rpm for 5 mins and resuspended in Neurobasal medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% B-27 (Gibco), 1.8% HEPES, 0.25% Glutamax (Gibco) and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin. For continental culture, hippocampal neurons were plated at a density of 30,000 on pre-grown rat glia cells, generated by adding 25,000 glia cells on 18 mm glass coverslips coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma Aldrich) in 12-well plates. For island culture, a density of 1,500 hippocampal neurons was plated on pre-grown micro-glia islands, generated by plating 6,000 glia cells on 18 mm glass coverslips coated with agarose and stamped with a solution of 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma Aldrich) and 0.7 mg/ml rat tail collagen (BD Biosciences). For western blot, cortical neurons were plated at a density of 300,000 on 6-well plates coated with a solution of 0.0005% poly-l-ornithine and laminin (2.5 μg/ml) (Sigma Aldrich).

Incubation with primary antibodies was done at room temperature for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. After three times of PBS washing, neurons were incubated with Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Sigma Aldrich) and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope (40 × objective; NA 1.3) with LSM510 software (version 3.2 Zeiss) or on an A1R Nikon confocal microscope with LU4A laser unit (40 × objective; NA 1.3) with NIS elements software (version 4.60, Nikon). Images were acquired as Z-stack at a step of 0.5 μm. All acquisition settings were kept constant for scans within each experiment. All solutions were in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4).

<title>Proteomics</title>
<p>DIV14 cortical neurons were prepared as previously described (Gonzalez-Lozano et al., 2019). In brief, neurons were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Then, 500μl PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) was added to each well and neurons were collected by gentle scraping. Neurons were centrifuged for 5 mins at 3000 g at 4 °C and the pellet was collected and lysed in Laemmli loading buffer (4%SDS, 100mM Tris pH 6.8, 200mM DTT, 20% glycerol, 0.04% bromophenol blue). In-gel digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C with MS grade endo Trypsin/LysC (Promega). The digested peptides were dried using a speedvac and stored at − 20 °C until further processed. An SDS-PAGE LC- MS/MS approach was used for peptide identification as previously reported. SWATH data were analyzed using Spectronaut 8.0 (49). The spectral library was created from the merging of two data-dependent analyses of non-transfected hippocampal neuron culture and hippocampal synaptosomes containing spike-in iRT peptides from Biognosys. The retention time prediction was set to dynamic iRT; the cross-run normalization based on total peak areas was enabled. Peptide abundances were exported and analyzed using R language for statistical computation. Only peptides present in both control and transfected groups and quantified with high confidence were included (i.e. q-value ≤ 10<sup>−3</sup> over all samples in either group, allowing for one outlier within each condition). Protein abundances were computed using Spectronaut normalized peak area, and Loess normalized using the ‘normalizeCyclicLoess’ function from the limma R package (fast method and 10 iterations) (50). Proteins with an adjusted FDR ≤ 0.01 and Log2 fold change ≥ 0.56 were defined as significant hints.</p>

<title>Live-cell imaging</title>
<p>Neurons at DIV 14-16 were transferred to an imaging chamber and perfused with Tyrode’s solution (2 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM KCl, 119 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 30 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES; pH 7.4). Imaging was acquired on a custom build microscope (AxioObserver.Z1, Zeiss) with 40 × oil objective (NA 1.3) and an EM-CCD camera (C9100-02; Hamamatsu, pixel size 200 nm) unless otherwise specified. Electrode field stimulation was applied using a stimulus generator (A-385, World Precision Instruments) controlled by a Master-8 (AMPI) to deliver 1 ms pulses of 30 mA. Experiments were performed at room temperature.</p>
<p>For SypHy experiments, neurons were imaged for 30 s as a baseline and then stimulated with electrical field stimulation for 5 s at 40 Hz. After 90 s, neurons were superfused with modified Tyrode’s solution containing NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (2 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM KCl, 119 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 30 mM glucose, 25 mM Hepes, and 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (pH 7.4)) delivered by gravity flow through a capillary placed above the neurons.</p>
<p>SV fusion analysis was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Moro et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, Regions of interest (ROIs) consisting of 6×6 pixels were placed on individual synapses identified as increased signals after the NH<sub>4</sub>Cl perfusion. Individual traces were analyzed using a custom-made MATLAB (MathWorks) script. Synapses were quantified as active if the maximum ΔF/F0 value upon stimulation was ≥3 * StD(F0). Active synapses were pooled per neuron. SV fusion fraction was calculated as the ΔFstimulation/ΔF NH<sub>4</sub>Cl.</p>
<p>For DCV fusion experiments, the imaging included 30 s of baseline recording and then stimulated with electrical field stimulation for 16 pulses of 50 AP at 50 Hz. Chemical stimulation of 5 μM Ionomycin, (Fisher Emergo) dissolved in modified Tyrode’s solution, was applied through glass capillaries placed near the neuron by gravity flow. After 90s, neurons were superfused with modified Tyrode’s solution containing NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. For the leucine rescue experiment, neurons expressing NPY-pHluorin were treated with 5mM leucine three days before live-cell imaging, or with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a control.</p>
<p>DCV fusion events were analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, DCV fusion events were detected by a rapid increase in fluorescence intensity. Regions of interest (ROIs) consisting of 3×3 pixels were placed on the time-lapse recordings using a custom-made script in Fiji. Resulting traces were evaluated using a custom-made script in MATLAB, and only events with F/F0 ≥ 2 SD and a rise time of less than 1 second were recorded. F0 was calculated by averaging the first 10 frames of the time-lapse recording. The total intracellular DCV pool was determined as the number of fluorescent puncta after the superfusion of Tyrode’s solution containing 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. The released fraction was calculated by dividing the number of fusion events per neuron by the total intracellular pool of DCVs.</p>
<p>For DCV transport experiments, neurons were imaged at DIV 14 in time-lapse recordings (2Hz) at room temperature. Stacks were divided into 10×10 regions with the Grid function in ImageJ, and transport was measured in five random regions (coordinates generated by random number generation in MATLAB).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Dong et al here have studied the impact of the small Ras-like GTPase Rab10 on the exocytosis of dense core vesicles (DVC), which are important mediators of neuropeptide signaling in the brain. They use optical imaging to show that lentiviral depletion of Rab10 in mouse hippocampal neurons in culture independent of the established defects in neurite outgrowth hamper DCV exocytosis. They further demonstrate that such defects are paralleled by changes in ER morphology and defective ER-based calcium buffering as well as reduced ribosomal protein expression in Rab10-depleted neurons. Re-expression of Rab10 or supplementation of exogenous L-leucine to restore defective neuronal protein synthesis rescues impaired DCV secretion. Based on these results they propose that Rab10 regulates DCV release by maintaining ER calcium homeostasis and neuronal protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work provides interesting and potentially important new insights into the connection between ER function and the regulated secretion of neuropeptides via DCVs. The authors combine advanced optical imaging with light and electron microscopy, biochemistry, and proteomics approaches to thoroughly assess the effects of Rab10 knockdown at the cellular level in primary neurons. The proteomic dataset provided may be valuable in facilitating future studies regarding Rab10 function. This work will thus be of interest to neuroscientists and cell biologists.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the main conclusions of this study are comparably well supported by the data, I see three major weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) For some of the data the statistical basis for analysis remains unclear. I.e. is the statistical assessment based on N= number of experiments or n = number of synapses, images, fields of view etc.? As the latter cannot be considered independent biological replicates, they should not form the basis of statistical testing.</p>
<p>(2) As it stands the paper reports on three partially independent phenotypic observations, the causal interrelationship of which remains unclear. Based on prior studies (e.g. Mercan et al 2013 Mol Cell Biol; Graves et al JBC 1997) it is conceivable that defective ER-based calcium signaling and the observed reduction in protein synthesis are causally related. For example, ER calcium release is known to promote pS6K1 phosphorylation, a major upstream regulator of protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis. Conversely, L-leucine supplementation is known to trigger calcium release from ER stores via IP3Rs. Given the reported impact of Rab10 on axonal transport of autophagosomes and, possibly, lysosomes via JIP3/4 or other mediators (see e.g. Cason and Holzbaur JCB 2023) and the fact that mTORC1, the alleged target of leucine supplementation, is located on lysosomes, which in turn form membrane contacts with the ER, it seems worth analyzing whether the various phenotypes observed are linked at the level of mTORC1 signaling.</p>
<p>(3) The claimed lack of effect of Rab10 depletion on SV exocytosis is solely based on very strong train stimulation with 200 Aps, a condition not very well suited to analyze defects in SV fusion. The conclusion that Rab10 loss does not impact SV fusion thus seems premature.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors assess the function of Rab10 in dense core vesicle (DCV) exocytosis using RNAi and cultured neurons. The author provides evidence that their knockdown (KD) is effective and provides evidence that DCV is compromised. They also perform proteomic analysis to identify potential pathways that are affected upon KD of Rab10 that may be involved in DCV release. Upon focusing on ER morphology and protein synthesis, the authors conclude that defects in protein synthesis and ER Ca2+ homeostasis contributes to the DVC release defect upon Rab10 KD. The authors claim that Rab10 is not involved in synaptic vesicle (SV) release and membrane homeostasis in mature neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data related to Rab10's role in DCV release seems to be strong and carried out with rigor. While the paper lacks in vivo evidence that this gene is indeed involved in DCV in a living mammalian organism, I feel the cellular studies have value. The identification of ER defect in Rab10 manipulation is not truly novel but it is a good conformation of studies performed in other systems. The finding that DCV release defect and protein synthesis defect seen upon Rab10 KD can be significantly suppressed by Leucine supplementation is also a strength of this work.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data showing Rab10 is NOT involved in SV exocytosis seems a bit weak to me. Since the proteomic analysis revealed so many proteins that are involved in SV exo/encodytosis to be affected upon Rab10, it is a bit strange that they didn't see an obvious defect. Perhaps this could have been because of the protocol that the authors used to trigger SV release (I am not an E-phys expert but perhaps this could have been a 'sledge-hammer' manipulation that may mask any subtle defects)? Perhaps the authors can claim that DCV is more sensitive to Rab10 KD than SV, but I am not sure whether the authors should make a strong claim about Rab10 not being important for SV exocytosis.</p>
<p>Also, the authors mention &quot;Rab10 does not regulate membrane homeostasis in mature neurons&quot; but I feel this is an overstatement. Since the authors only performed KD experiments, not knock-out (KO) experiments, I believe they should not make any conclusion about it not being required, especially since there is some level of Rab10 present in their cells. If they want to make these claims, I believe the authors will need to perform conditional KO experiments, which are not performed in this study.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors show that protein synthesis and ER Ca2+ defects seem to contribute to the defect but they do not discuss the relationship between the two defects. If the authors treat the Rab10 KD cells with both ionomycin and Leucine, do they get a full rescue? Or is one defect upstream of the other (e.g. can they see rescue of ER morphology upon Leucine treatment)? While this is not critical for the conclusions of the paper, several additional experiments could be performed to clarify their model, especially considering there is no clear model that explains how Rab10, protein synthesis, ER homeostasis, and Ca2+ are related to DCV (but not SV) exocytosis.</p>

<p>In the submitted manuscript, Dong and colleagues set out to dissect the role of the Rab10 small GTPase on the intracellular trafficking and exocytosis of dense core vesicles (DCVs). While the authors have already shown that Rab3 plays a central role in the exocytosis of DVC in mammalian neurons, the roles of several other Rab-members have been identified genetically, but their precise mechanism of action in mammalian neurons remains unclear. In this study, the authors use a carefully designed and thoroughly executed series of experiments, including live-cell imaging, functional calcium-imaging, proteomics, and electron microscopy, to identify that DCV secretion upon Rab10 depletion in adult neurons is primarily a result of dysregulated protein synthesis and, to a lesser extent, disrupted intracellular calcium buffering. Given that the full deletion of Rab10 has a deleterious effect on neurons and that Rab10 has a major role in axonal development, the authors cautiously employed the knock-down strategy from 7 DIV, to focus on the functional impact of Rab10 in mature neurons. The experiments in this study were meticulously conducted, incorporating essential controls and thoughtful considerations, ensuring rigorous and comprehensive results.</p>
