<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The opportunistic pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> serves as a model organism for studying multiple signal transduction pathways. The chemoreceptor cluster, a core component of the chemotaxis pathway, is assembled from hundreds of proteins. The unipolar distribution of receptor clusters has long been recognized, yet the precise mechanism governing their assembly remains elusive. Here, we directly observed the relative positions of the flagellar motor and chemoreceptor cluster using flagellar filament labeling and gene editing techniques. Surprisingly, we found that both are located at the same cell pole, with the distribution pattern controlled by the polar anchor protein FlhF. Additionally, the efficient assembly of the chemoreceptor cluster is partially dependent on the integrity of the motor structure. Furthermore, we discovered that overexpression of the chemotaxis regulatory protein CheY leads to high intracellular levels of the second messenger c-di-GMP, triggering cell aggregation. Therefore, the colocalization of the chemoreceptor cluster and flagellum in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> serves to avoid cross-pathway signaling interference, enabling cells to conduct various physiological activities in an orderly manner.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In biological systems, the process by which proteins self-assemble into organized complex structures is widespread<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Pole-to-pole protein oscillations in the <italic>Min</italic> system ensure that the FtsZ ring, a crucial component of cell division, is placed precisely in the middle of the cell body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. In response to antibiotic treatment and heat stress, some bacteria generate multiple protein foci throughout the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The polar localization of the secretion system, such as the type VI secretion system, is mediated by targeting proteins and potentially facilitates host-pathogen interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, spontaneous assembly is accompanied by the formation of spatial patterns that organize the intracellular environment.</p>
<p>To grow and colonize in various ecological niches, bacteria have evolved a mechanism for migrating towards more favorable environments. The locomotion organ (the flagellar motor) and the chemotaxis pathway play crucial roles in achieving this goal. The former provides physical drive, while the latter offers directional guidance. The initiation of cell reorientation is controlled by motor switching, which is governed by the chemotaxis two-component signaling pathway. This pathway comprises transmembrane chemoreceptors, a histidine kinase CheA, an adaptor protein CheW, a response regulator CheY, and two adaptation proteins, CheB and CheR. Receptors collaborate with CheA and CheW to form chemotaxis complex in a hexagonal pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Upon phosphorylation of CheY by the kinase at the complex, it freely diffuses to the motor and binds to FliM, a component of the motor switch complex, to affect motor switching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. It is worth noting that there exists diversity among different bacterial species in the placement of flagellar motors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, whereas chemoreceptor clusters are typically found at one or both ends of the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. These two structural units are functionally connected. However, it remains unclear whether there is an interaction in their spatial distribution and what the specific regulatory mechanism might be.</p>
<p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, a common human opportunistic pathogen, possesses four chemosensory pathways that perform distinct functions and are stimulated by signal binding to 26 chemoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Among them, the proteins encoded by chemotaxis-related genes collectively constitute the F6 pathway. Previous studies have suggested that the receptors involved in this pathway localize to the old cell pole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, similar to the flagellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, implying colocalization of the receptors and the flagellum at the same pole; however, direct evidence for this colocalization is still lacking. Furthermore, the polar anchor protein FlhF has been reported to guide the flagellum to grow at the cell pole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism by which chemotaxis complex-related proteins aggregate and self-assemble at the cell pole is controversial. The distribution of the chemotaxis complex in the peritrichous bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> has been extensively studied and attributed to several mechanisms, including stochastic self-assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, membrane curvature sorting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, and inefficient clustering in the lateral region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, these mechanisms cannot explain the unipolar distribution pattern observed in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Unlike <italic>E. coli</italic>, specific genes responsible for the placement of the chemotaxis complex have been identified in several bacterial species. In <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, chemotaxis complex assemble at the new cell pole with the help of TipN and TipF proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. A tripartite ParC-ParP-CheA interaction network was reported to promote polar localization of chemotaxis complex in <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. However, as there are no related genes in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the mechanism of its chemotaxis complex distribution remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Here, we combined gene editing and in vivo fluorescence imaging of flagellar filaments to directly observe the distribution of chemotaxis complex and flagellar motors, proposing a cooperative construction model of chemotaxis network and flagella during the entire division cycle of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The core focus of this study is to clarify the regulatory mechanism of its chemotaxis complex distribution. We found a substantial association between the assembly of the flagellar motor and the chemotaxis complex. The complete assembly of the motor serves as a partial prerequisite for the assembly of the chemotaxis complex, and its assembly site is also regulated by the polar anchor protein FlhF. Furthermore, by introducing exogenously expressed CheY protein, we found that this triggers the expression of c-di-GMP at a high level. From this, we infer that the colocalization of the chemotaxis complex and the flagellum in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> avoids the cross-pathway interference of signaling molecules, thus providing a guarantee for the coexistence of multiple chemosensory pathways.</p>

<title>Robust generation of daughter cell with both chemotaxis network and flagellar motor</title>
<p>CheY has been shown to colocalize with chemoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. To visualize the distribution of chemotaxis complex in cells, we fused the gene encoding the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) to the <italic>cheY</italic> gene in the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> chromosome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). All genetic modifications were carried out at the native position on the chromosome, allowing the expression of chemotaxis proteins in precise stoichiometry from their natural promoters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The mutant strain with <italic>cheY-eyfp</italic> was able to moderately expand on soft agar plates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, proving that its chemotaxis behavior was not notably affected, so it was selected for subsequent experiments. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, CheY-eYFP was mainly located at the cell pole, suggesting that CheA, CheW and CheY in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> form a signal transduction complex that was primarily distributed at the cell pole, as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Representative large-field images containing many cells are shown in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>. Additionally, we constructed a plasmid expressing CheA-CFP and electroporated it into the <italic>cheY-eyfp</italic> strain. Fluorescence imaging revealed a high degree of spatial overlap between CheA-CFP and CheY-EYFP (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>), confirming that CheY-EYFP accurately marks the location of the chemoreceptor complex. From our measurements, nearly 90% (332/372) of cells contain obvious receptor clusters, and factors such as fluorescence bleaching may have caused the loss of fluorescent spots in some cells. In addition, we observed the presence of fluorescent spots at both ends of some cells with a large aspect ratio (probably approaching cell division), indicating that the newly generated progeny cells will have a complete chemotaxis network. Next, we sought to observe the distribution of the flagella in cells simultaneously to understand the motility of future progeny.</p>

<p>Our recent study demonstrated the successful labeling of the flagellar filament with thiol-reactive fluorescent dye by introducing cysteines into the flagellin FliC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To avoid fluorescence interference, we utilized a dye with an excitation peak near 568 nm, considering that the excitation peak of eYFP is 513 nm, and the emission peak is 527 nm. We employed a xenon lamp as the excitation light source and switched filters to enable simultaneous fluorescence imaging of flagellar filaments and chemotaxis complex within the same cell.</p>
<p>Remarkably, our findings revealed a surprising colocalization of chemotaxis complex and flagellar filaments at the same end of the cell body, and this colocalization was consistent, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>. A typical large field was shown in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>. Similar to the chemotaxis complex, we observed the phenomenon of double flagella symbiosis in cells with a large aspect ratio, suggesting that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has evolved a cell division mechanism with precise timing regulation. Before cell division, both poles of the mother cell assembled chemotaxis complex and flagellar motors. This ensures that daughter cells possess complete motility and chemotaxis, thereby greatly enhancing the environmental adaptability of the population.</p>

<title>FlhF mediates proper unipolar localization of the chemotaxis complex</title>
<p>Despite potential differences in the physical and especially physiological environments at the two cell poles, it is unlikely that the unipolar distribution of the chemotaxis complex can be attributed to passive regulatory factors. The number and distribution of flagellar motors and chemotaxis complex vary among different bacterial species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and the localization system for flagella has been well studied. Specifically, the FlhF-FlhG system, discovered in several monotrichous bacterial species, has been shown to control the location and number of flagella<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, a knockout of <italic>flhF</italic> leads to mis-localized flagellar assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Considering the consistent colocalization pattern between chemotaxis complex and flagellar motors in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we speculate that the distribution of chemotaxis complex is also regulated by similar molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of FlhF in the localization of chemotaxis complex, we constructed a Δ<italic>flhF</italic> strain for fluorescence observation. The results revealed that the chemotaxis complex no longer grow robustly at the cell pole (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), and the assembly positions of the flagellar motor change accordingly, colocalizing with the chemotaxis complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Representative large fields containing many cells are shown in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>. Additionally, we categorized receptor cluster distribution patterns into three types: precise polar, near polar, and mid-cell. The relevant statistics for the wild-type strain and the Δ<italic>flhF</italic> mutant are presented in <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>, which show a significant increase in the proportion of non-precise polar chemoreceptors following <italic>flhF</italic> knockout. We also quantified the proportion of individuals with obvious receptor clusters, which was more than 80% (182/221), similar to the wild-type strain. These experimental results suggest that the polar anchoring protein FlhF has a minimal impact on the assembly efficiency of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>’s chemotaxis complex, but it strictly controls its unipolar distribution. Furthermore, a consistent colocalization between the flagellar motor and chemotaxis complex was observed, independent of FlhF. Thus, it is crucial to determine whether there is a causal relationship in the assembly order of these two structural units.</p>

<title>Motor structural integrity is a prerequisite for chemoreceptor self-assembly</title>
<p>Cryo-electron microscopy has successfully revealed the complete flagella structure in various bacterial species. This structure includes multiple components such as the inner-membrane MS ring, the cytoplasmic C ring, and the internal protein secretion system, all of which exhibit strong similarities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. This suggests that the core structure of the flagellar motor is highly conserved. The MS ring, composed of 26 FliF proteins, forms the foundation of the flagellar structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. In addition to serving as a mounting platform for the C ring, the MS ring also acts as a protective shell for the internal protein secretion machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. FliG, the main component protein of the C ring, binds directly to the cytoplasmic surface of FliF in a 1:1 ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Thus, the efficient assembly of the C ring requires preassembly of the MS ring. To observe the distribution of the chemotaxis complex following the disruption of the C ring and MS ring, we constructed Δ<italic>fliG</italic> and Δ<italic>fliF</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>We performed fluorescence observation on the Δ<italic>fliG</italic> mutant, which has a disrupted flagellar motor C ring. The results showed that the proportion of Δ<italic>fliG</italic> cells with obvious chemoreceptor clusters decreased significantly compared to the wild-type cells (59.8%, 140/234), although the chemotaxis complex remained at a single cell pole. We also examined the Δ<italic>fliF</italic> mutant, which has a disrupted flagellar motor MS ring. Similar to the Δ<italic>fliG</italic> mutant, the proportion of individuals with obvious chemotaxis complex decreased significantly (62.5%, 202/323). Subsequently, we constructed a Δ<italic>flhF</italic>Δ<italic>fliF</italic> mutant and observed that the proportion of individuals with obvious chemoreceptor clusters further decreased (50.7%, 341/672). To ascertain whether it is motor integrity rather than functionality that influences the efficiency of chemotaxis complex assembly, we constructed a stator mutant (Δ<italic>motA</italic>Δ<italic>motCD</italic>). In this mutant, the motor is completely stalled while the structure remains intact. We found that the mutant performed similarly to the wild-type strain in terms of chemotaxis complex assembly (84.3% of individuals with obvious clusters, 204/242). The fluorescence imaging of receptor clusters for multiple mutants in this section is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure. 3A</xref>, and corresponding large-field images are provided in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>. We utilized Western blotting to measure the expression levels of CheY, which were found to be similar across the different strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). These further substantiated that the observed phenomenon is based on the structural integrity of the motor rather than the protein expression level. In contrast, the <italic>cheA</italic> knockout strain was constructed to disrupt the assembly of the chemoreceptor complex. We fluorescently labeled its flagellar filaments and found that its phenotype was no different from that of the wild-type strain (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>), indicating that the assembly of the chemotactic receptor complex does not affect the flagellar assembly efficiency. The P ring (mainly composed of FlgI) is thought to act as a bushing for the peptidoglycan layer, and its absence results in partial assembly of the motor structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. We constructed Δ<italic>flgI</italic> mutant and found that the proportion of cells with distinct chemotactic complexes was similar to that of the wild-type (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). Additionally, we quantified the proportion of cells with receptor clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Overall, our findings suggest that the polar anchor protein FlhF and the structural integrity of the motor are crucial for the formation of chemotaxis complex. The former guides them to the appropriate site, while the latter influences the assembly efficiency of the chemoreceptor complex.</p>

<title>Colocalization of chemotaxis complex and flagellar motor avoids cross-pathway interference in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> signal transduction</title>
<p>The distribution patterns of receptors associated with various signal transduction pathways in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> vary considerably. For instance, the biofilm formation-related receptor WspA, unlike the chemotaxis receptors discussed here, is distributed throughout the cell. This distribution is thought to enhance its sensitivity to mechanical perturbations of the cell membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Previous studies speculated that the highly consistent position of chemotaxis complex and flagellar motors enhances bacterial chemotaxis performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. However, the diffusion time of the phosphorylated chemotaxis regulatory protein CheY-P across the longest distance in a bacterial cell body (along the cell’s long axis) is approximately 100 ms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, whereas the timescale for the chemotaxis temporal comparison is on the order of seconds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Additionally, a study by Fukuoka and colleagues reported that intracellular chemotaxis signal transduction requires approximately 240 ms beyond CheY or CheY-P diffusion time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Moreover, the CCW/CW interval of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> flagellar motor under normal conditions is 1-2 s, as determined by bead assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> or tethered cell assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Taken together, these indicate that for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which moves via a run-reverse mode, the potential 100 ms reduction in response time due to co-localization of the chemotaxis complex and motor has a limited effect on overall chemotaxis timing. Consequently, the physiological significance of the colocalization of chemoreceptors and flagellar motors remains unclear.</p>
<p><italic>E. coli</italic> mediates chemotaxis through a single pathway involving five types of chemoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. As a core regulatory protein for chemotaxis, CheY participates in multiple processes such as adaptation and chemotaxis response, with CheY-P binds to the motor to regulate switching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In contrast, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has four distinct chemosensory pathways that perform different functions, involving different CheY homologs, and are stimulated by signals binding to 26 types of chemoreceptors. Consequently, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> possesses more complex chemosensory pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. We thus hypothesized that the co-localization of chemoreceptors and flagellar motors in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ensures locally distributed CheY-P molecules, thereby eliminating the need for a high level of intracellular CheY-P and avoiding potential side effects on other signaling pathways.</p>
<p>To test the potential effect of an increased intracellular CheY-P level, we constructed the CheY expression plasmid <italic>cheY</italic>-pJN105, transformed it into the wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain, and induced it with varying concentrations of arabinose. We observed that the higher the inducer concentration, the more pronounced the cell aggregation became in the field of view (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The transition from planktonic individuals to aggregated communities is similar to biofilm formation, which is known to be accompanied by a significant increase in intracellular c-di-GMP levels.</p>

</fig>
<p>To investigate whether a higher level of intracellular CheY-P increased the intracellular c-di-GMP level, we sought to detect the c-di-GMP level. We introduced the plasmid pCdrA-gfp into <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, using it as a c-di-GMP biosensor with the fluorescence intensity proportional to the c-di-GMP level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. To ensure the coexistence of the plasmids, the intracellular CheY concentration was controlled by the plasmid <italic>cheY</italic>-pME6032. The intracellular CheY levels induced by varying arabinose concentrations were measured, showing clear differences across the concentration gradient (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). We found that the average single-cell fluorescence intensity of the CheY overexpression strain was 71.8% higher than that of the wild-type strain, while the c-di-GMP level of the <italic>cheY</italic> deletion strain was 58.6% lower than that of the wild-type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>The colocalization of both the signaling source (the kinase) and sink (the phosphatase) at the chemoreceptor complex at the cell pole results in a rapid decay of CheY-P concentration within approximately 0.2 µm from the cell pole, leading to a nearly uniform distribution elsewhere in the cell, as demonstrated by Vaknin and Berg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. This spatial arrangement effectively confines high CheY-P levels to the pole region. When the motor is also localized at the cell pole, the need for elevated CheY-P concentrations throughout the cytoplasm is reduced. Therefore, the colocalization of chemotaxis complex and flagellar motor facilitates the precise regulation of cell swimming direction within the low intracellular CheY-P concentration threshold, using locally distributed CheY-P molecules. This helps to avoid the occurrence of the aforementioned cross-pathway interference. To further confirm that CheY overexpression promotes aggregation through increased c-di-GMP levels, we performed additional experiments co-overexpressing CheY and a phosphodiesterase (PDE) from <italic>E. coli</italic> to reduce intracellular c-di-GMP. These experiments showed that PDE expression mitigates cell aggregation caused by CheY overexpression in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>).</p>

<title>Summary and discussion</title>
<p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> harbors multiple signal transduction systems that regulate flagella-mediated swimming motility (Che pathway), pili-mediated interface twitching motility (Pil pathway), and biofilm formation (Wsp pathway)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. These systems allow it to thrive in various ecological niches within complex external environments. Here, employing a combination of chromosomal fluorescent protein fusion and flagellar labeling techniques in living cells, we directly observed that the chemotaxis complex of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Che pathway and the flagellar motor share a high degree of consistency in their assembly sites. We found that the chemotaxis complex, comprising Che proteins, was consistently located at the cell pole where the flagellum was positioned. Based on these observations, we deduced the construction mode of the chemotactic network and flagellar motor during the entire cell growth cycle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). As the cell body matures and elongates, a new flagellum grows at the opposing cell pole, accompanied by the assembly of a fresh chemotaxis complex. The cell then undergoes division from the middle, generating two daughter cells, each equipped with fully functional motility and chemotaxis capabilities. This ensures robust inheritance of these chemotaxis and motility-related macromolecular machines.</p>

</fig>
<p>Based on our understanding of the regulation mechanism of flagellar position in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we constructed a Δ<italic>flhF</italic> mutant and found that the position distribution of its chemotaxis complex is actively regulated by FlhF-mediated molecular mechanisms, rather than being passively restricted by membrane curvature factors as seen in <italic>E. coli</italic>. A similar active regulation phenomenon was previously reported in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, with the corresponding molecular regulation mechanism detailed extensively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The flagella and chemotaxis complex of newborn <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells are located at the old cell pole, with the polar anchor protein HubP distributed at both cell poles. As the cell grows, HubP recruits the ParA homologue ParC. Subsequently, ParC recruits ParP to assemble a new chemotaxis complex at the new cell pole. Upon cell division, HubP relocates to the middle of the cell, ensuring its robust presences at both poles of the daughter cells. Here, HubP recruits ParA homologues including FlhG, which influence flagellar motor assembly. However, previous experiments confirmed that the cell cycle-dependent polar localization of ParC and chemotactic proteins is independent of the flagellar position regulatory protein FlhF. This suggests that the localization of flagellar motors and chemotaxis complex in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is controlled separately through different pathways. In contrast, flagellar motors were no longer robustly distributed at the cell pole after <italic>flhF</italic> was knocked out in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, whereas the assembly site of chemotaxis complex and flagellar motor remained remarkably consistent. This suggests that FlhF regulates the distribution patterns of both and implies an interaction between them.</p>
<p>We further constructed Δ<italic>fliG</italic> and Δ<italic>fliF</italic> mutants, which disrupted the assembly of the flagellar motor. Surprisingly, we observed that the assembly of chemotaxis complex was impaired under these conditions, with a significant decrease in the proportion of individuals exhibiting obvious Che protein fluorescent bright spots. In contrast, the chemotaxis complex assembly in the stator mutant (Δ<italic>motA</italic>Δ<italic>motCD</italic>) was similar to that of the wild-type strain. It should be noted that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has a four-tiered transcriptional regulatory circuit controlling flagellar biogenesis, in which FliG and FliF belong to class II and are regulated by the master transcriptional regulator FleQ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Chemotaxis complex-related genes (<italic>cheA</italic>, <italic>cheW</italic>, etc.) are regulated by intracellular free FliA proteins, and there is no evidence that FliA is regulated by proteins such as FliG. To further confirm that the expression of core chemotaxis proteins was not affected by the knockout of <italic>fliG</italic>, we performed Western blotting to measure CheY expression levels in wild-type, Δ<italic>fliF</italic> and Δ<italic>fliG</italic> strains, and found no significant differences (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). These results suggested that the integrity rather than functionality of the flagellar motor in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is critical for the assembly of its chemotaxis complex, and its assembly efficiency is greatly reduced in the absence of flagellar motors. To eliminate the potential confounding effects of FlhF and flagellar motors, we constructed a Δ<italic>flhF</italic>Δ<italic>fliF</italic> mutant strain. Under this condition, the proportion of individuals with obvious Che protein fluorescent bright spots dropped to ∼50%, indicating that passive regulation based on membrane curvature may still exist in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, albeit to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>Is the remarkable consistency in the spatial distribution of these two independent structural units an unintentional outcome or a hidden mystery? Given that Kulasekara et al. previously proposed that CheA and its phosphorylation state can cause c-di-GMP heterogeneity among individual <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells through a specific PDE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, we sought to verify whether the phenotypic differences induced by CheY here are closely related to changes in the overall population level of c-di-GMP. We introduced a c-di-GMP monitoring system at the single-cell level and discovered that overexpression CheY substantially increases the intracellular c-di-GMP concentration. Previous studies generally believed that CheY-P, as a chemotactic regulatory protein, only influences flagellar motor switching. Here, we found that CheY-P, as a signaling molecule, can accomplish threshold-limited cross-pathway regulation. At low CheY-P concentrations, it is conservatively involved in motor switching regulation, as confirmed by previous studies. At high CheY-P concentrations, cell motility is suppressed, and c-di-GMP is triggered to express, though its specific mechanism needs further exploration. Unlike CheA, a structural protein of the chemotaxis complex, CheY is a protein that can shuttle in the cytoplasm and can also regulate the intracellular c-di-GMP level. This finding expands our understanding of the connection between the internal chemotaxis network and the c-di-GMP pathway. The intracellular environment is highly crowded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, and the proximal growth pattern shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> has multiple physiological significances. On one hand, chemotaxis-related protein can precisely regulate cell motility with minimal synthesis costs. On the other hand, the chemotactic network and the flagellar motor are spatially integrated within the cell, ensuring their robust existence within the cell body and preventing mutual interference with collateral pathways.</p>
<p>Many bacteria possess multiple signal transduction pathways. The orderly operation of each pathway within the micrometer-scale space presents a fascinating scientific problem. Here, we utilized the well-known chemotaxis network as a starting point to shed light on this problem, providing inspiration for future in-depth understanding of related issues.</p>

The cell volume can be calculated by taking the length of the short axis of the cell body as the diameter of the sphere and the length of the long axis as the sum of the height of the cylinder and the diameter of the sphere.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here, the authors studied the molecular mechanisms by which the chemoreceptor cluster and flagella motor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) are spatially organized in the cell. They argue that FlhF is involved in localizing the receptors-motor to the cell pole, and even without FlhF, the two are colocalized. Finally, the authors argue that the functional reason for this colocalization is to insulate chemotactic signaling from other signaling pathways, such as cyclic-di-GMP signaling.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>The experiments and data are high quality. It is clear that the motor and receptors co-localize, and that elevated CheY levels lead to elevated c-di-GMP.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>The explanation for the functional importance of receptor-motor colocalization is plausible but is still not conclusively demonstrated. Colocalization might reduce CheY levels throughout the cell in order to reduce cross-talk with c-di-GMP. This would mean that if physiologically-relevant levels of CheYp near the pole were present throughout the cell, c-di-GMP levels would be elevated to a point that is problematic for the cell. Clearly demonstrating this seems challenging.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated the assembly and polar localization of the chemosensory cluster in P. aeruginosa. They discovered that a certain protein (FlhF) is required for the polar localization of the chemosensory cluster while a fully-assembled motor is necessary for the assembly of the cluster. They found that flagella and chemosensory clusters always co-localize in the cell; either at the cell pole in wild type cells or randomly-located in the cell in FlhF mutant cells. They hypothesize that this co-localization is required to keep the level of another protein (CheY-P), which controls motor switching, at low levels as the presence of high-levels of this protein (if the flagella and chemosensory clusters were not co-localized) is associated with high-levels of c-di-GMP and cell aggregations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is clearly written and straightforward. The authors applied multiple techniques to study the bacterial motility system including fluorescence light microscopy and gene editing. In general, the work enhances our understanding of the subtlety of interaction between the chemosensory cluster and the flagellar motor to regulate cell motility.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness for me in this paper is that the authors never discussed how the flagellar genes expression is controlled in P. aeruginosa. For example, in E. coli there is a transcriptional hierarchy for the flagellar genes (early, middle, and late genes, see Chilcott and Hughes, 2000). Similarly, Campylobacter and Helicobacter have a different regulatory cascade for their flagellar genes (See Lertsethtakarn, Ottemann, and Hendrixson, 2011). How does the expression of flagellar genes in P. aeruginosa compare to other species? how many classes are there for these genes? is there a hierarchy in their expression and how does this affect the results of the FliF and FliG mutants? In other words, if FliF and FliG are in class I (as in E. coli) then their absence might affect the expression of other later flagellar genes in subsequent classes (i.e., chemosensory genes). Also, in both FliF and FliG mutants no assembly intermediates of the flagellar motor are present in the cell as FliG is required for the assembly of FliF (see Hiroyuki Terashima et al. 2020, Kaplan et al. 2019, Kaplan et al. 2022). It could be argued that when the motor is not assembled then this will affect the expression of the other genes (e.g., those of the chemosensory cluster) which might play a role in the decreased level of chemosensory clusters the authors find in these mutants.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I believe the authors have performed additional experiments that improved their manuscript and they have answered many of my comments and those of the other reviewers. I am supportive of publishing this manuscript, but I still find the following points that are not clear to me (probably I am misunderstanding some points; the authors can clarify).</p>
<p>(1) In response to reviewer 1, the authors say that they &quot;analyzed and categorized the distribution of the chemotaxis complex in both wild-type and flhF mutant strains into three patterns: precise-polar, near-polar, and mid-cell localization.&quot; I can see what they mean by polar and mid-cell, but near-polar sounds a bit elusive? Can they provide examples of this stage and mention how accurately they can identify it? Also, do the pie charts they show in Figure S4 really show &quot;significant alterations&quot;? There is a difference between 98% and 85% as they mention in their response to reviewer 1, but I am not sure that this is significant? Probably they can explain/change the language in the text? Also, the number of cells they counted for FlhF mutant is more than the double of other strains (WT and FlhF FliF mutant)?</p>
<p>(2) One thing that also confused me is the following: One point that the authors stress is that FlhF localizes both the flagellum and the chemoreceptors to the pole. However, if I look at Figure 2B, the flagellum and the chemoreceptors still co-localize together (although not at the pole). If FlhF was responsible for co-localizing both of them to the pole, then wouldn't one expect them to be randomly localized in this mutant and by that I mean that they do not co-localize but that each of them (the flagellum and the chemoreceptors) are located in a different random location of the cell (not co-localized). The fact that they are still co-localized together in this mutant could also be interpreted by, for example, that FlhF localizes the flagellum to the pole and another mechanism localizes the chemoreceptors to the flagellum, hence, they still co-localize in this mutant because the chemoreceptors follow the flagellum by another mechanism to wherever it goes?</p>
<p>(3) In the response to reviewers, the authors mention &quot;suggesting that the assembly of the receptor complex is likely influenced mainly by the C-ring and MS-ring structures rather than by the P ring&quot; . However, in the article, they still write &quot;The complete assembly of the motor serves as a partial prerequisite for the assembly of the chemotaxis complex, and its assembly site is also regulated by the polar anchor protein FlhF&quot; despite their FlgI results which is not in accordance with this statement? Also, As I mentioned in my previous report, in FliG and FliF mutant the motor does not assemble (see Hiroyuki Terashima et al. 2020., and Kaplan et al., 2022).</p>
<p>(4) The authors have said in their response to my point &quot;and currently, there is no evidence that FliA activity is influenced by proteins like FliG&quot;. I just want to clarify what I meant in my previous report: In E. coli, FliA binds to FlgM, and when the hook is assembled FlgM is secreted outside the cell allowing FliA to trigger the transcription of class III genes, which include the chemosensory genes (see Figure 5 in Beeby et al, 2020 in FEMS Microbiology, and Chilcott and Hughes, 2000). This implies that if the hook is not built, then late genes (including the chemoreceptors) should not be present. However, in Kaplan et al., 2019, the authors imaged a FliF mutant in Shewanella oneidensis (Figure S3) and still saw that chemoreceptors are present (I believe the authors must highlight this). This suggests that species such as Shewanella and Pseudomonas have a different assembly process than that E. coli, and although the authors say that in the text, I believe they still can refine this part more in the spirit of what I wrote here.</p>
<p>I do not like to ask for additional experiments in the second round of review, so for me if the authors modify the text to tackle these points and allow for probable alternative explanations/ highlight gaps/ modify language used for some claims, then that is fine with me.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Wu et al presents interesting data on bacterial cell organization, a field that is progressing now, mainly due to the advances in microscopy. Based mainly on fluorescence microscopy images, the authors aim to demonstrate that the two structures that account for bacterial motility, the chemotaxis complex and the flagella, colocalize to the same pole in Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells and to expose the regulation underlying their spatial organization and functioning.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The subject is of importance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions are too strong for the presented data. The lack of statistical analysis makes this paper incomplete. The novelty of the findings is not clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have strengthened the data analysis by including appropriate statistical tests to support our conclusions more convincingly. Additionally, we have refined the description of the research background to better emphasize the novelty and significance of our findings. Please see the detailed responses below for further information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major issues:</p>
<p>(1) The novelty is in question since in the Abstract the authors highlight their main finding, which is that both the chemotaxis complex and the flagella localize to the same pole, as surprising. However, in the Introduction they state that &quot;pathway-related receptors that mediate chemotaxis, as well as the flagellum are localized at the same cell pole17,18&quot;. I am not a pseudomonas researcher and from my short glance at these references, I could not tell whether they report colocalization of the two structures to the same pole. However, I trust the authors that they know the literature on the localization of the chemotaxis complex and flagella in their organism. See also major issue number 5 on the novelty regarding the involvement of c-di-GMP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment and appreciate the opportunity to clarify our statements.</p>
<p>Kazunobu et al. (ref. 18) used scanning electron microscopy to preliminarily characterize the flagellation pattern of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> during cell division, showing that existing flagella are located at the old pole. Zehra et al. (ref. 17), through fluorescence microscopy, observed that CheA and CheY proteins in dividing cells are typically also present at the old pole. Based on these observations, we inferred in the Introduction that the chemotaxis complex and flagellum may localize to the same cell pole.</p>
<p>However, this inference is indirect and lacks direct live-cell evidence of colocalization, leaving its validity to be confirmed. This uncertainty was indeed the starting point and motivation for our study.</p>
<p>In our work, we simultaneously visualized flagellar filaments and core chemoreceptor proteins at the single-cell level in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. We characterized the assembly and spatial coordination of the chemotaxis network and flagellar motor throughout the cell cycle, providing direct evidence of their colocalization and coordinated assembly. This represents a significant advance beyond prior indirect observations and supports the novelty of our study.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we have revised the relevant statements in lines 71-75 of the manuscript to better reflect the current state of the literature and emphasize the novelty of our direct observations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Statistics for the microscopy images, on which most conclusions in this manuscript are based, are completely missing. Given that most micrographs present one or very few cells, together with the fact that almost all conclusions depend on whether certain macromolecules are at one or two poles and whether different complexes are in the same pole, proper statistics, based on hundreds of cells in several fields, are absolutely required. Without this information, the results are anecdotal and do not support the conclusions. Due to the importance of statistics for this manuscript, strict statistical tests should be used and reported. Moreover, representative large fields with many cells should be added as supportive information.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment, which significantly improves the rigor and persuasiveness of our manuscript.</p>
<p>For the colocalization analyses presented in Fig. 1D and Fig. 2B, we quantified 145 and 101 cells with fluorescently labeled flagella, respectively, and observed consistent colocalization of the chemoreceptor complexes and flagella in all examined cells (now added in the figure legends). Regarding the distribution patterns of chemoreceptors shown in Fig. 3A, we have now included comprehensive statistical analyses for both wild-type and mutant strains. For each strain, more than 300 cells were analyzed across at least three independent microscopic fields, providing robust statistical power (detailed data are presented in Fig. 3C).</p>
<p>To further strengthen the evidence, statistical tests were applied to confirm the significance and reproducibility of our findings (Fig. 3C). In addition, representative large-field fluorescence images containing numerous cells have been added to the supplementary materials (Fig. S1 and Fig. S3).</p>

<p>The problem is more pronounced when the authors make strong statements, as in lines 157-158: &quot;The results revealed that the chemoreceptor arrays no longer grow robustly at the cell pole (Figure 2A)&quot;. Looking at the seven cells shown in Figure 2A, five of them show polar localization of the chemoreceptors. The question is then: what is the percentage of cells that show precise polar, near-polar, or mid cell localization (the three patterns shown here) in the mutant and in the wild type? Since I know that these three patterns can also be observed in WT cells, what counts is the difference, and whether it is statistically significant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have now analyzed and categorized the distribution of the chemotaxis complex in both wild-type and <italic>flhF</italic> mutant strains into three patterns: precise-polar, near-polar, and mid-cell localization. For each strain, more than 200 cells across three independent fields of view were quantified.</p>
<p>Our statistical analysis shows that in the wild-type strain, approximately 98% of cells exhibit precise polar localization of the chemotaxis complex. In contrast, the Δ<italic>flhF</italic> mutant displays a clear shift in distribution, with about 5% of cells showing mid-cell localization and 9.5% showing near-polar localization. These differences demonstrate a significant alteration in the spatial pattern upon <italic>flhF</italic> deletion.</p>
<p>We have revised the relevant text in lines 166-170 accordingly and included the detailed statistical data in the newly added Fig. S4.</p>

<p>Even for the graphs shown in Figures 3C and 3D, where the proportion of cells with obvious chemoreceptor arrays and absolute fluorescence brightness of the chemosensory array are shown, respectively, the questions that arise are: for how many individual cells these values hold and what is the significance of the difference between each two strains?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The number of cells analyzed for each strain is indicated in the original manuscript: 372 wild-type cells (line 123), 221 Δ<italic>flhF</italic> cells (line 172), 234 Δ<italic>fliG</italic> cells (line 197), 323 Δ<italic>fliF</italic> cells (line 200), 672 Δ<italic>flhF</italic>Δ<italic>fliF</italic> cells (line 202), and 242 Δ<italic>motA</italic>Δ<italic>motCD</italic> cells (line 207). For each strain, data were collected from three independent fields of view. We have now also provided the number of cells in Fig. 3 legend.</p>
<p>We have now performed statistical comparisons using t-tests between strains. Notably, the measured values in Fig. 3C exhibit a clear, monotonic decrease with successive gene knockouts, supporting the robustness of the observed trend.</p>
<p>Regarding the absolute fluorescence intensity shown in the original Fig. 3D, the mutants did not display consistent directional changes compared to the wild type. Reliable comparison of absolute fluorescence intensity requires consistent fluorescent protein maturation levels across strains. Given the likely variability in maturation levels between strains, we concluded that this data may not accurately reflect true differences in protein concentrations. Therefore, we have removed the fluorescence intensity graph from the revised manuscript to avoid potential misinterpretation.</p>

<p>(3) The authors conclude that &quot;Motor structural integrity is a prerequisite for chemoreceptor self-assembly&quot; based on the reduction in cells with chemoreceptor clusters in mutants deleted for flagellar genes, despite the proper polar localization of the chemotaxis protein CheY. They show that the level of CheY in the WT and the mutant strains is similar, based on Western blot, which in my opinion is over-exposed. &quot;To ascertain whether it is motor integrity rather than functionality that influences the efficiency of chemosensory array assembly&quot;, they constructed a mutant deleted for the flagella stator and found that the motor is stalled while CheY behaves like in WT cells. The authors further &quot;quantified the proportion of cells with receptor clusters and the absolute fluorescence intensity of individual clusters (Figures 3C-D)&quot;. While Figure 3DC suggests that, indeed, the flagella mutants show fewer cells with a chemotaxis complex, Figure 3D suggests that the differences in fluorescence intensity are not statistically significant. Since it is obvious that the regulation of both structures' production and localization is codependent, I think that it takes more than a Western blot to make such a decision.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. To further clarify that the assembly of flagellar motors and chemoreceptor clusters occurs in an orderly manner rather than being merely codependent, we performed additional experiments. Specifically, we constructed a Δ<italic>cheA</italic> mutant strain, in which chemoreceptor clusters fail to assemble. Using in vivo fluorescent labeling of flagellar filaments, we observed that the proportion of cells with flagellar filaments in the Δ<italic>cheA</italic> strain was comparable to that of the wild type (Fig. S5).</p>
<p>In contrast, mutants lacking complete motor structures, such as Δ<italic>fliF</italic> and Δ<italic>fliG</italic>, showed a significant reduction in the proportion of cells with obvious receptor clusters (Fig. 3C). Based on these results, we conclude that the structural integrity of the flagellar motor is, to a certain extent, a prerequisite for the self-assembly of chemoreceptor clusters.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we have revised the relevant statement in lines 213-217 of the manuscript to reflect this clarification.</p>

<p>(4) I wonder why the authors chose to label CheY, which is the only component of the chemotaxis complex that shuttles back and forth to the base of the flagella. In any case, I think that they should strengthen their results by repeating some key experiments with labeled CheW or CheA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. In our study, we initially focused on the positional relationship between chemoreceptor clusters and flagella, then investigated factors influencing cluster distribution and assembly efficiency. The physiological significance of motor and cluster co-localization was ultimately proposed with CheY as the starting point.</p>
<p>Previous work by Harwood's group demonstrated that both CheY-YFP and CheA-GFP localize to the old poles of dividing <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> cells. Since our physiological hypothesis centers on CheY, we chose to label CheY-EYFP in our experiments.</p>
<p>To further strengthen our conclusions, we constructed a plasmid expressing CheA-CFP and introduced it into the <italic>cheY-eyfp</italic> strain via electroporation. Fluorescence imaging revealed a high degree of spatial overlap between CheA-CFP and CheY-EYFP (Fig. S2), confirming that CheY-EYFP accurately marks the location of the chemoreceptor complex.</p>

<p>(5) The last section of the results is very problematic, regarding the rationale, the conclusions, and the novelty. As far as the rationale is concerned, I do not understand why the authors assume that &quot;a spatial separation between the chemoreceptors and flagellar motors should not significantly impact the temporal comparison in bacterial chemotaxis&quot;. Is there any proof for that?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in our original explanation. The rationale behind the statement was initially supported by comparing the timescales of CheY-P diffusion and temporal comparison in chemotaxis. Specifically, the diffusion time for CheY-P to traverse the entire length of a bacterial cell is approximately 100 ms (refs 39&amp;40), whereas the timescale for bacterial chemotaxis temporal comparison is on the order of seconds (ref 41).</p>
<p>To clarify and strengthen this argument, we have expanded the discussion as follows:</p>
<p>The diffusion coefficient of CheY in bacterial cells is about 10 µm2/s, which corresponds to an estimated end-to-end diffusion time on the order of 100 ms (refs 40&amp;41). If the chemotaxis complexes were randomly distributed rather than localized, diffusion times would be even shorter. In contrast, the timescale for the chemotaxis temporal comparison is on the order of seconds (ref. 42). Additionally, a study by Fukuoka and colleagues reported that intracellular chemotaxis signal transduction requires approximately 240 ms beyond CheY or CheY-P diffusion time (ref. 41). Moreover, the intervals of counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) rotation of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> flagellar motor under normal conditions are 1-2 seconds, as determined by tethered cell or bead assays (refs. 30&amp;43).</p>
<p>Taken together, these indicate that for P. aeruginosa, which moves via a run-reverse mode, the potential 100 ms reduction in response time due to co-localization of the chemotaxis complex and motor has a limited effect on overall chemotaxis timing.</p>
<p>We have revised the corresponding text accordingly (lines 238-245) to better explain this rationale.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>More surprising for me was to read that &quot;The signal transduction pathways in E. coli are relatively simple, and the chemotaxis response regulator CheY-P affects only the regulation of motor switching&quot;. There are degrees of complexity among signal transduction pathways in E. coli, but the chemotaxis seems to be ranked at the top. CheY is part of the adaptation. Perfect adaptation, as many other issues related to the chemotaxis pathway, which include the wide dynamic range, the robustness, the sensitivity, and the signal amplification (gain), are still largely unexplained. Hence, such assumptions are not justified.</p>

<p>We acknowledge that <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis is a highly sophisticated system, involving processes such as perfect adaptation, wide dynamic range, robustness, sensitivity, and signal amplification, many aspects of which remain incompletely understood.

<p>Conclusions:</p>
<p>The manuscript addresses an interesting subject and contains interesting, but incomplete, data.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here, the authors studied the molecular mechanisms by which the chemoreceptor cluster and flagella motor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) are spatially organized in the cell. They argue that FlhF is involved in localizing the receptors-motor to the cell pole, and even without FlhF, the two are colocalized. FlhF is known to cause the motor to localize to the pole in a different bacterial species, Vibrio cholera, but it is not involved in receptor localization in that bacterium. Finally, the authors argue that the functional reason for this colocalization is to insulate chemotactic signaling from other signaling pathways, such as cyclic-di-GMP signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments and data look to be high-quality.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the interpretations and conclusions drawn from the experimental observations are not fully justified in my opinion.</p>
<p>I see two main issues with the evidence provided for the authors' claims.</p>
<p>(1) Assumptions about receptor localization:</p>
<p>The authors rely on YFP-tagged CheY to identify the location of the receptor cluster, but CheY is a diffusible cytoplasmic protein. In E. coli, CheY has been shown to localize at the receptor cluster, but the evidence for this in PA is less strong. The authors refer to a paper by Guvener et al 2006, which showed that CheY localizes to a cell pole, and CheA (a receptor cluster protein) also localizes to a pole, but my understanding is that colocalization of CheY and CheA was not shown. My concern is that CheY could instead localize to the motor in PA, say by binding FliM. This &quot;null model&quot; would explain the authors' observations, without colocalization of the receptors and motor. Verifying that CheY and CheA are colocalized in PA would be a very helpful experiment to address this weakness.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. We agree that verifying the colocalization of CheY and CheA would strengthen our conclusions. To address this, we constructed a plasmid expressing CheA-CFP and introduced it into the CheY-EYFP strain by electroporation. Fluorescence imaging revealed a high degree of spatial overlap between CheA-CFP and CheY-EYFP signals, indicating that CheY-EYFP indeed marks the location of the chemoreceptor complex rather than the flagellar motor.</p>
<p>We have revised the manuscript accordingly (lines 118-123) and included these results in the new Fig. S2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Argument for the functional importance of receptor-motor colocalization at the pole:</p>
<p>The authors argue that colocalization of the receptors and motors at the pole is important because it could keep phosphorylated CheY, CheY-p, restricted to a small region of the cell, preventing crosstalk with other signaling pathways. Their evidence for this is that overexpressing CheY leads to higher intracellular cdG levels and cell aggregation. Say that the receptors and motors are colocalized at the pole. In E. coli, CheY-p rapidly diffuses through the cell. What would prevent this from occurring in PA, even with colocalization?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's insightful question. The colocalization of both the signaling source (the kinase) and sink (the phosphatase) at the chemoreceptor complex at the cell pole results in a rapid decay of CheY-P concentration within approximately 0.2 µm from the cell pole, leading to a nearly uniform distribution elsewhere in the cell, as demonstrated by Vaknin and Berg (ref. 46). This spatial arrangement effectively confines high CheY-P levels to the pole region. When the motor is also localized at the cell pole, this reduces the need for elevated CheY-P concentrations throughout the cytoplasm, thereby minimizing potential crosstalk with other signaling pathways.</p>
<p>We have revised the manuscript accordingly (lines 280-286) to clarify this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Elevating CheY concentration may increase the concentration of CheY-p in the cell, but might also stress the cells in other unexpected ways. It is not so clear from this experiment that elevated CheY-p throughout the cell is the reason that they aggregate, or that this outcome is avoided by colocalizing the receptors and motor at the same pole. If localization of the receptor array and motor at one pole were important for keeping CheY-p levels low at the opposite pole, then we should expect cells in which the receptors and motor are not at the pole to have higher CheY-p at the opposite pole. According to the authors' argument, it seems like this should cause elevated cdG levels and aggregation in the delta flhF mutants with wild-type levels of CheY. But it does not look like this happened. Instead of varying CheY expression, the authors could test their hypothesis that receptor-motor colocalization at the pole is important for preventing crosstalk by measuring cdG levels in the flhF mutant, in which the motor (and maybe the receptor cluster) are no longer localized in the cell pole.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising the important point regarding potential cellular stress caused by elevated CheY concentrations, as well as for the suggestion to test the hypothesis using Δ<italic>flhF</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>First, as noted above, CheY-P concentration rapidly decreases away from the receptor complex. While deletion of <italic>flhF</italic> alters the position of the receptor complex, thereby shifting the region of high CheY-P concentration, it does not increase CheY-P levels elsewhere in the cell. Importantly, in the Δ<italic>flhF</italic> strain, the receptor complex and the motor still colocalize, so this mutant may not effectively test the role of receptor-motor colocalization in preventing crosstalk as suggested.</p>
<p>Regarding the possibility that elevated CheY levels stress the cells independently of CheY-P signaling, prior work in &lt;i.E. coli by Cluzel et al. (ref. 11) showed that overexpressing CheY several-fold did not cause phenotypic changes, indicating that simple CheY overexpression alone may not be generally stressful. Furthermore, our data indicate that the increase in c-di-GMP levels and subsequent cell aggregation upon CheY overexpression is not an all-or-none switch but occurs progressively as CheY concentration rises.</p>
<p>To further confirm that CheY overexpression promotes aggregation through increased c-di-GMP levels, we performed additional experiments co-overexpressing CheY and a phosphodiesterase (PDE) from <italic>E. coli</italic> to reduce intracellular c-di-GMP. These experiments showed that PDE expression mitigates cell aggregation caused by CheY overexpression (Fig. S8).</p>
<p>We have revised the manuscript accordingly (lines 290-294) and added these new results in Fig. S8.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated the assembly and polar localization of the chemosensory cluster in P. aeruginosa. They discovered that a certain protein (FlhF) is required for the polar localization of the chemosensory cluster while a fully-assembled motor is necessary for the assembly of the cluster. They found that flagella and chemosensory clusters always co-localize in the cell; either at the cell pole in wild-type cells or randomly-located in the cell in FlhF mutant cells. They hypothesize that this co-localization is required to keep the level of another protein (CheY-P), which controls motor switching, at low levels as the presence of high levels of this protein (if the flagella and chemosensory clusters were not co-localized) is associated with high-levels of c-di-GMP and cell aggregations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is clearly written and straightforward. The authors applied multiple techniques to study the bacterial motility system including fluorescence light microscopy and gene editing. In general, the work enhances our understanding of the subtlety of interaction between the chemosensory cluster and the flagellar motor to regulate cell motility.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness in this paper is that the authors never discussed how the flagellar gene expression is controlled in P. aeruginosa. For example, in E. coli there is a transcriptional hierarchy for the flagellar genes (early, middle, and late genes, see Chilcott and Hughes, 2000). Similarly, Campylobacter and Helicobacter have a different regulatory cascade for their flagellar genes (See Lertsethtakarn, Ottemann, and Hendrixson, 2011). How does the expression of flagellar genes in P. aeruginosa compare to other species? How many classes are there for these genes? Is there a hierarchy in their expression and how does this affect the results of the FliF and FliG mutants? In other words, if FliF and FliG are in class I (as in E. coli) then their absence might affect the expression of other later flagellar genes in subsequent classes (i.e., chemosensory genes). Also, in both FliF and FliG mutants no assembly intermediates of the flagellar motor are present in the cell as FliG is required for the assembly of FliF (see Hiroyuki Terashima et al. 2020, Kaplan et al. 2019, Kaplan et al. 2022). It could be argued that when the motor is not assembled then this will affect the expression of the other genes (e.g., those of the chemosensory cluster) which might play a role in the decreased level of chemosensory clusters the authors find in these mutants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> possesses a four-tiered transcriptional regulatory hierarchy controlling flagellar biogenesis. Within this system, <italic>fliF</italic> and <italic>fliG</italic> belong to class II genes and are regulated by the master regulator FleQ. In contrast, chemotaxis-related genes such as <italic>cheA</italic> and <italic>cheW</italic> are regulated by intracellular free FliA, and currently, there is no evidence that FliA activity is influenced by proteins like FliG.</p>
<p>To verify that the expression of core chemotaxis proteins was not affected by deletion of <italic>fliG</italic>, we performed Western blot analyses to compare CheY levels in wild-type, Δ<italic>fliF</italic>, and Δ<italic>fliG</italic> strains. We observed no significant differences, indicating that the reduced presence of receptor clusters in these mutants is not due to altered expression of chemotaxis proteins.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we have revised the manuscript (lines 341-348) and updated Fig. 3B to reflect these findings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The reviewers comment on several important aspects that should be addressed, namely: the lack of statistical analysis; the need for clarifications regarding assumptions made regarding receptor localization; the functional importance of receptor-motor colocalization; and the need for an elaborate discussion of flagellar gene expression. Also, two reviewers pointed out the need to prove the co-localization of CheY and CheA; This is important since CheY is dynamic, shuttling back and forth from the chemotaxis complex to the base of the flagella, whereas CheA (or cheW or, even better, the receptors) is considered less dynamic and an integral part of the chemotaxis complex.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Kazunobu et al. (ref. 18) used scanning electron microscopy to preliminarily characterize the flagellation pattern of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during cell division, showing that existing flagella are located at the old pole. Zehra et al. (ref. 17), through fluorescence microscopy, observed that CheA and CheY proteins in dividing cells are typically also present at the old pole. Based on these observations, we inferred in the Introduction that the chemotaxis complex and flagellum may localize to the same cell pole.</p>
<p>However, this inference is indirect and lacks direct live-cell evidence of colocalization, leaving its validity to be confirmed. This uncertainty was indeed the starting point and motivation for our study.</p>
<p>In our work, we simultaneously visualized flagellar filaments and core chemoreceptor proteins at the single-cell level in P. aeruginosa. We characterized the assembly and spatial coordination of the chemotaxis network and flagellar motor throughout the cell cycle, providing direct evidence of their colocalization and coordinated assembly. This represents a significant advance beyond prior indirect observations and supports the novelty of our study.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend checking that CheY localizes to the receptor cluster in PA. This could be done by tagging cheA with a different fluorophore and demonstrating their colocalization. It would also be helpful to check that they are colocalized in the delta flhF mutant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. We constructed a plasmid expressing CheA-CFP and introduced it into the CheY-EYFP strain by electroporation. Fluorescence imaging revealed a high degree of spatial overlap between CheA-CFP and CheY-EYFP signals, indicating that CheY-EYFP indeed marks the location of the chemoreceptor complex.</p>
<p>We have revised the manuscript accordingly (lines 118-123) and included these results in the new Fig. S2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The experiments under- and over-expressing CheY part seemed too unrelated to receptor-motor colocalization. I think the authors should think about a more direct way of testing whether colocalization of the motor and receptors is important for preventing signaling crosstalk. One way would be to measure cdG levels in WT and in delta flhF mutants and see if there is a significant difference.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for raising the important point regarding potential cellular stress caused by elevated CheY concentrations, as well as for the suggestion to test the hypothesis using <italic>flhF</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>First, as noted in the response to your 2nd comment in Public Review, CheY-P concentration rapidly decreases away from the receptor complex. While deletion of <italic>flhF</italic> alters the position of the receptor complex, thereby shifting the region of high CheY-P concentration, it does not increase CheY-P levels elsewhere in the cell. Importantly, in the Δ<italic>flhF</italic> strain, the receptor complex and the motor still colocalize, so this mutant may not effectively test the role of receptor-motor colocalization in preventing crosstalk as suggested.</p>
<p>Regarding the possibility that elevated CheY levels stress the cells independently of CheY-P signaling, prior work in <italic>E. coli</italic> by Cluzel et al. (ref. 11) showed that overexpressing CheY several-fold did not cause phenotypic changes, indicating that simple CheY overexpression alone may not be generally stressful. Furthermore, our data indicate that the increase in c-di-GMP levels and subsequent cell aggregation upon CheY overexpression is not an all-or-none switch but occurs progressively as CheY concentration rises.</p>
<p>To further confirm that CheY overexpression promotes aggregation through increased c-di-GMP levels, we performed additional experiments co-overexpressing CheY and a phosphodiesterase (PDE) from <italic>E. coli</italic> to reduce intracellular c-di-GMP. These experiments showed that PDE expression mitigates cell aggregation caused by CheY overexpression (Fig. S8).</p>
<p>We have revised the manuscript accordingly (lines 290-294) and added these new results in Fig. S8.</p>

<p>(1) Can the authors elaborate more on the hierarchy of flagellar gene expression in P. aeruginosa and how this relates to their work?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have now described the hierarchy of flagellar gene expression in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in lines 341-348.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I would suggest that the authors check other flagellar mutants (than FliF and FliG) where the motor is partially assembled (e.g., any of the rod proteins or the P-ring protein), together with FlhF mutant, to see how a partially assembled motor affects the assembly of the chemosensory cluster.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. The P ring, primarily composed of FlgI, acts as a bushing for the peptidoglycan layer, and its absence leads to partial motor assembly. We constructed a Δ<italic>flgI</italic> mutant and observed that the proportion of cells exhibiting distinct chemotactic complexes was similar to that of the wild-type strain, suggesting that the assembly of the receptor complex is likely influenced mainly by the C-ring and MS-ring structures rather than by the P ring. We have revised the original text accordingly (lines 217-220) and added the corresponding data as Figure S6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) I would suggest that the authors check the levels of CheY in cells induced with different concentrations of arabinose (i.e., using western blotting just like they did in Figure 3B).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have assessed the levels of CheY in cells induced with different concentrations of arabinose using western blotting, as suggested. The results have been incorporated into the manuscript (lines 274-275) and are presented in Figure S7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) To my eyes, most of the foci in FliF-FlhF mutant in Figure 3A are located at the pole (which is unlike the FlhF mutant in Figure 2). Is this correct? I would suggest that the authors also investigate this to see where the chemosensory cluster is located.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The distribution of the chemotaxis complex in the Δ<italic>flhF</italic>Δ<italic>fliF</italic> strain was investigated and showed in Fig. S4. Indeed, most of the chemoreceptor foci in this mutant are located at the pole. This probably suggests that, in the absence of both FlhF and an assembled motor, the position of the receptor complex may be largely influenced by passive factors such as membrane curvature. This interesting possibility warrants further investigation in future studies.</p>
