<title>Abstract</title>
<p>During tuberculosis, migration of dendritic cells (DCs) from the site of infection to the draining lymph nodes is known to be impaired, hindering the rapid development of protective T-cell mediated immunity. However, the mechanisms involved in the delayed migration of DCs during TB are still poorly defined. Here, we found that infection of DCs with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> triggers HIF-1α-mediated aerobic glycolysis in a TLR2-dependent manner, and that this metabolic profile is essential for DC migration. In particular, oxamate, a glycolysis inhibitor, or PX-478, an HIF-1α inhibitor, completely abrogated <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induced DC migration <italic>in vitro</italic> to the lymphoid tissue chemokine CCL21, and <italic>in vivo</italic> to lymph nodes in mice. Strikingly, we found that although monocytes from TB patients are inherently biased toward glycolysis metabolism, they differentiate into poorly glycolytic and poorly migratory DCs, compared with healthy subjects. Taken together, these data suggest that because of their preexisting glycolytic state, circulating monocytes from TB patients are refractory to differentiation into migratory DCs, which may explain the delayed migration of these cells during the course of the disease and opens avenues for host-directed therapies for TB.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health problem, responsible for approximately 1.5 million deaths annually. The causative agent of TB, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), is a highly successful pathogen that has evolved several strategies to weaken the host immune response. Although reliable immune correlates of protective immunity against Mtb are still not well-defined, it is widely accepted that Th1 cells contribute to protection by secreting IFN-γ and promoting antimycobacterial activity in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Importantly, the induction of a strong Th1 immune response relies on the generation of immunogenic dendritic cells (DCs) with strong migratory properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Mtb has been shown to interfere with several DC functions, thus impairing the induction and development of adaptive immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. For instance, we and others previously reported that Mtb-exposed DCs have low capacity for mycobacterial antigen presentation and stimulation of Mtb-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Additionally, Mtb-infected DCs were reported to have impaired ability to migrate to lymph nodes <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and in murine models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms of these phenotypes and their relevance to the migratory activity of monocyte-derived DCs in TB patients remain unknown.</p>
<p>Rapid, directed migration of DCs towards secondary lymphoid organs requires essential changes at the cellular and molecular levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Relatedly, the metabolic state of DCs is complex and varies according to cell origin, differentiation and maturation state as well as local microenvironment, among other factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Studies have reported that upon pathogen sensing, the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) increases glycolysis, which promotes immunogenic functions of DCs, such as IL-12 production, costimulatory marker expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, and cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. By contrast, it was shown that HIF-1α represses the proinflammatory output of LPS-stimulated DCs and can inhibit DC-induced T-cell responses in other settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. To reconcile these disparate roles for HIF-1α, it has been proposed that the impact of metabolic pathway activation on DC function depends on DC subset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. To this point, most prior studies have been conducted using murine conventional DCs and plasmacytoid DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Recently, with the implementation of high-dimensional techniques, it was demonstrated that distinct metabolic wiring is associated with individual differentiation and maturation stages of DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, highlighting the importance of defining the metabolic profile of specific subsets of DCs under particular physiological or pathological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Given the key role of DCs in the host response to TB, it is thus crucial to investigate DC metabolism in the context of Mtb infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We previously demonstrated that the TB-associated microenvironment, as conferred by the acellular fraction of TB patient pleural effusions, inhibits HIF-1α activity leading to a reduction in glycolytic and microbicidal phenotypes in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Moreover, activation of HIF-1α enhances Mtb control at early times post-infection in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and this effect was associated with a metabolic switch of alveolar macrophages towards an M1-like profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Given that HIF-1α activation promotes protection at early stages of Mtb infection and given its role as a key regulator of DC migration and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that HIF-1α could affect the functionality of DCs in regulating the initiation and orchestration of the adaptive immune response to Mtb, a process known to be delayed upon Mtb infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Here, we show that HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis promotes DC activation and migration in the context of TB. Importantly, we report pathologically active glycolysis in monocytes from TB patients, which leads to poor glycolytic induction and migratory capacities of monocyte-derived DCs.</p>

<title>Mtb impacts metabolism in human monocyte-derived DCs</title>
<p>To determine the impact of Mtb on the metabolism of human monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs), we assessed metabolic parameters associated either with glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) upon Mtb stimulation. Cells undergoing aerobic glycolysis are characterized by increased consumption of glucose and the production and release of lactate. We measured lactate release and glucose consumption in Mo-DCs stimulated for 24h with equivalent doses of either irradiated (iMtb) or viable Mtb. DCs treated with either iMtb or viable Mtb released increased levels of lactate and consumed more glucose than untreated DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref></bold>). Consistently, both iMtb treatment and Mtb infection resulted in an increase in expression of the key glycolysis-activating regulator HIF-1α at both mRNA and protein levels (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-D</xref></bold>). Expression of the gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase A (<italic>LDHA</italic>), which catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, was also increased in iMtb-treated or Mtb-infected DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). In agreement with their enhanced glycolysis profile, DCs stimulated with iMtb had increased expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 (SLC2A1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>)</bold>. Of note, <italic>LDHA</italic> and <italic>GLUT1</italic> are HIF-1α target genes, and their upregulation correlated with the increase in HIF-1α expression upon Mtb stimulation. Because irradiated and viable Mtb induced comparable activation of glycolysis, we subsequently performed all our assays with irradiated Mtb only in the rest of the study due to biosafety reasons. To assess changes in the mitochondria, we measured mitochondrial mass and morphology upon iMtb stimulation. We found a higher mitochondrial mass as well as larger individual mitochondria in iMtb-stimulated DCs compared to untreated DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G-H</xref></bold>). Thus, our data indicate that Mtb triggers both glycolysis and OXPHOS in Mo-DCs.</p>

<title>Mtb exposure shifts DCs to a glycolytic profile over OXPHOS</title>
<p>To further characterize the metabolic profile of iMtb-stimulated DCs, we next assessed the intracellular rates of glycolytic <italic>vs.</italic> mitochondrial ATP production using Seahorse technology. Bioenergetic profiles revealed that iMtb increased the rate of protons extruded over time, or proton efflux rate (PER) as well as the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in Mo-DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). The measurements of basal extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and OCR were used to calculate ATP production rate from glycolysis (GlycoATP) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (MitoATP). In line with our earlier findings, the ATP production rates from both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration were augmented upon iMtb-stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Of note, the relative contribution of GlycoATP to overall ATP production was increased, while MitoATP contribution was decreased in iMtb-treated cells compared to untreated cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). To further check the heterogeneity, we also evaluated the metabolism of DCs at single cell level using the SCENITH technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. This method is based on the fact that a decrease in ATP levels is tightly coupled with a decrease in protein synthesis and display similar kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. By treating the cells with glucose or mitochondrial respiration inhibitors and measuring their impact on protein synthesis by puromycin incorporation via flow cytometry, glucose and mitochondrial dependences can be quantified. Two additional derived parameters, glycolytic capacity and fatty acids and amino acids oxidation (FAO &amp; AAO) capacity were also calculated. Similarly to Seahorse results, SCENITH technology revealed a lower reliance on OXPHOS in parallel with an increase in the glycolytic capacity of Mtb-stimulated DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref></bold>). No differences were observed for glucose dependence and FAO &amp; AAO capacity (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref></bold>). These results confirmed the reconfiguration of DC metabolism by iMtb treatment, with an increase in the relative glycolytic contribution to overall metabolism at the expense of the OXPHOS pathway. Together, metabolic profiling indicates that a metabolic switch toward aerobic glycolysis occurs in Mo-DCs exposed to Mtb.</p>

<p>Since Mtb is sensed by Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, we investigated the contribution of these receptors to glycolysis activation in Mo-DCs upon Mtb stimulation. Using specific neutralizing antibodies for these receptors, we found that TLR2 ligation, but not that of TLR4, was required to trigger the glycolytic pathway, as reflected by a decrease in lactate release, glucose consumption and HIF-1α expression in iMtb-stimulated DCs treated with an anti-TLR2 antibody (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref></bold>). As a control, and as expected given the reliance on TLR4 for LPS sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, lactate release and glucose consumption were abolished in LPS-stimulated DCs in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against TLR4 but not TLR2 (<bold>Figure S1A-B</bold>). Moreover, blockade of TLR2 also diminished glycolytic ATP production in iMtb-stimulated DCs without altering OXPHOS-associated ATP production (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>) or the size and morphology of mitochondria (<bold>Figure S1C</bold>), suggesting that TLR2 engagement by iMtb is required for the induction of glycolysis but not mitochondrial respiration. Interestingly, TLR2 ligation was also necessary for lactate release triggered by viable Mtb, (<bold>Fig S1D</bold>). To further confirm the involvement of TLR2 in the induction of glycolysis, we tested the effect of synthetic (Pam<sub>3</sub>CSK<sub>4</sub>) or mycobacterial (peptidoglycans, PTG) TLR2 agonists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> and found that both ligands induced lactate release and glucose consumption in DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-F</xref></bold>), without affecting cell viability (<bold>Figure S1E</bold>). Thus, our data indicate that Mtb induce glycolysis in Mo-DCs through TLR2 engagement.</p>

<title>HIF-1α is required for DC maturation upon iMtb stimulation but not for CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte polarization</title>
<p>To determine the impact of glycolysis on DC maturation and the capacity to activate T cells, we inhibited HIF-1α activity in iMtb-stimulated DCs. Treatment with the HIF-1α inhibitor PX-478 (PX) diminished lactate release and glucose consumption in iMtb-stimulated DCs without affecting cell viability at the indicated concentration (<bold>Figure S2A-C</bold>). These results were confirmed using echinomycin (Ech), another HIF-1α inhibitor (<bold>Figure S2D-F</bold>). HIF-1α inhibition by PX significantly abolished ATP production associated with glycolysis without affecting absolute levels of OXPHOS-derived ATP production in iMtb-stimulated DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and Figure S2G</bold>). Although HIF-1α inhibitors did not affect the uptake of iMtb by DCs (<bold>Figure S2H</bold>), we observed a reduction in the expression of activation markers CD83 and CD86, but not in the inhibitory molecule PD-L1, upon treatment with PX (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>) or Ech (<bold>Figure S3</bold>). We then measured cytokine production in iMtb-stimulated DCs after HIF-1α inhibition and noted a reduction in TNF-α and an increase in IL-10 production by PX-treated cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). To assess the capacity of DCs to activate T cells in response to mycobacterial antigens, we co-cultured DCs and autologous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from PPD<sup>+</sup> donors in the presence or absence of HIF-1α inhibitors and measured the overall IFN-γ and IL-17 production in culture supernatants as well as cell surface expression of T cell markers. We found no significant differences in the activation profile of autologous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in coculture with iMtb-stimulated DCs treated or not with PX (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref> and Figure S4</bold>). We conclude that while HIF-1α is important for the maturation of iMtb-stimulated Mo-DCs, it does not influence their capacity to activate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis triggers the motility of DCs upon iMtb stimulation</title>
<p>Since DC migration to lymph nodes is essential to initiate an adaptive immune response and glycolytic activity has been reported to control DC migration upon stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we evaluated the migratory properties of iMtb-stimulated DCs in the presence of inhibitors of HIF-1α and glycolysis. First, we confirmed that PX and oxamate (OX), a well-established glycolysis inhibitor, diminished the glycolytic activity of iMtb-stimulated human Mo-DCs, as demonstrated by reduced lactate release (<bold>Figure S2A and 5A</bold>). Next, using a transwell migration assay, we found that PX and OX treatment significantly diminished the chemotactic activity of iMtb-stimulated human Mo-DCs in response to CCL21 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>), a CCR7 ligand responsible for the migration of DCs into lymphoid organs. We also assessed the 3 dimentional (3D) migration capacity of iMtb-stimulated DCs through a collagen matrix in which DCs use an amoeboid migration mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> and found that 3D migration was significantly impaired upon HIF-1α or glycolysis inhibition (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). The role of glycolysis in the migration of iMtb-stimulated Mo-DCs was further confirmed using an additional glycolysis inhibitor, GSK2837808A, which reduced both the release of lactate by iMtb-stimulated Mo-DCs and their migration in response to CCL21 (<bold>Figure S5A-B</bold>). To further investigate the effects of glycolysis on cell migration, we turned to an <italic>in vivo</italic> model. Murine bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) isolated and stimulated with iMtb in the presence or absence of PX or OX were labeled with CFSE and transferred into naïve mice (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). Similarly to human Mo-DCs, iMtb stimulation increased glycolysis in BMDCs, which was inhibited by PX and OX treatment <italic>in vitro</italic> (<bold>Figure S5C</bold>). Three hours after the transfer of BMDCs into recipient mice, nearby lymph nodes were collected for DC quantification (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). A higher number of adoptively transferred DCs (CFSE-labeled CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells) were detected in lymph nodes from mice that received iMtb-stimulated BMDCs compared to mice that received untreated BMDCs or iMtb-BMDCs treated with either PX or OX (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> and Figure S5D</bold>). Of note, we verified that CCR7 expression on iMtb-stimulated BMDCs was not affected by OX or PX treatment, so the effect could not be ascribed to downregulation of the chemokine receptor (<bold>Figure S5E</bold>). Therefore, we conclude that HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis is required for the successful migration of iMtb-stimulated DCs into lymph nodes.</p>

<title>Stabilization of HIF-1α promotes migration of tolerogenic DCs and DCs derived from TB patient monocytes</title>
<p>Since DC differentiation is skewed, at least partially, towards a tolerogenic phenotype during TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, we investigated whether tolerogenic DCs can be reprogrammed into immunogenic DCs by modulating their glycolytic pathway after iMtb stimulation. To this end, we generated tolerogenic Mo-DCs by adding dexamethasone (Dx) before stimulation with iMtb in the presence or absence of dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), which stabilizes the expression of HIF-1α. HIF-1α expression is tightly regulated by prolyl hydroxylase domain containing proteins which facilitate the recruitment of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, leading to ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α by the proteasomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. DMOG inhibits the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins. Acquisition of the tolerogenic phenotype was confirmed by the lack of upregulation of costimulatory markers CD83 and CD86, as well as by increased PD-L1 expression in iMtb-DCs treated with Dx compared to control iMtb-DCs (<bold>Figure S6A</bold>). Moreover, Dx-treated DCs did not exhibit an increase in lactate release, consumption of glucose or induction of HIF-1α expression in response to iMtb, showing a high consumption of levels of glucose under basal conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref></bold>). Of note, HIF-1α stabilization using DMOG restored the HIF-1α expression and lactate production in response to iMtb in Dx-treated DCs and increased the consumption of glucose (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref></bold>). Activation of HIF-1α also improved 3D amoeboid migration, as well as 2D migration capacity of DCs towards CCL21 of iMtb-stimulated Dx-treated DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref> and Figure S6B</bold>). Confirming the relevance of these findings to human TB patients, we found that iMtb-stimulated Mo-DCs from TB patients were deficient in their capacity to migrate towards CCL21 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>) and in glycolytic activity, compared to Mo-DCs from healthy subjects (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F-G</xref></bold>). Strikingly, stabilizing HIF-1α expression using DMOG in Mo-DCs from TB patients restored their chemotactic activity in response to iMtb (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref></bold>). These data indicate that the impaired migratory capacity of iMtb-stimulated tolerogenic DCs or TB patient-derived DCs can be restored via HIF-1α stabilization; thus, glycolysis is critical for DC function during TB in both murine and human contexts.</p>

<title>Glycolytic activation in CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes from TB patients leads to DCs with poor migration capacity</title>
<p>Since we observed differences in the metabolic activity of DCs derived from monocytes of TB patients when compared to healthy donors, we next focused on evaluating the release of lactate by DC precursors from both subject groups during the first hours of DC differentiation with IL-4/GM-CSF. We found a high release of lactate by monocytes from TB patients compared to healthy donors after 1 h of differentiation (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>). Lactate accumulation increased in both subject groups after 24h with IL-4/GM-CSF (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>). Based on these differential glycolytic activities displayed by DC precursors from both subject groups at very early stages of the differentiation process, we decided to evaluate the <italic>ex vivo</italic> metabolic profile of monocytes using SCENITH. To this end, we assessed the baseline glycolytic capacity of the three main populations of monocytes: classical (CD14<sup>+</sup>, CD16<sup>−</sup>), intermediate (CD14<sup>+</sup>, CD16<sup>+</sup>), and non-classical (CD14<sup>dim</sup>, CD16<sup>+</sup>) monocytes. We found that both populations of CD16+ monocytes from TB patients had a higher glycolytic capacity than monocytes from healthy donors (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>). As we have previously demonstrated that CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes from TB patients generate aberrant DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that the different metabolic profile of this monocyte subset could yield DCs with exhausted glycolytic activity and thus lower migration capacity upon Mtb exposure. To test this hypothesis, we treated with DMOG to increase the activity of HIF-1α during the first 24h of monocyte differentiation from healthy donors, leading to an exacerbated increase in lactate release at early stages of the differentiation (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></bold>). Such early addition of DMOG to healthy monocytes resulted in the generation of DCs (6 days with IL-4/GM-CSF) characterized by equivalent levels of CD1a as control DCs, with a significant decrease in the expression of DC-SIGN (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>). In terms of activation marker expression, DCs differentiated from DMOG-pretreated cells responded to iMtb by upregulating CD86 at higher levels compared to control cells, with an accompanying trend towards reduced upregulation of CD83 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></bold>). We also observed that DCs from DMOG pretreated-cells exhibited a lower migratory capacity in response to iMtb (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref></bold>), reminiscent of the 2D migration capacities of Mo-DCs from TB patients. Altogether, our data suggest that the activated glycolytic status of pathological monocytes from TB patients leads to the generation of DCs with low motility in response to Mtb.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we provide evidence for the role of HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis in promoting the migratory capacity of DCs upon encounter with Mtb. Our approach to quantify the <italic>ex vivo</italic> metabolism of monocytes shows that CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes from TB patients display a pathological glycolytic activity that may result in the generation of DCs with poor migratory capacities in response to Mtb. Our results suggest that under extensive chronic inflammatory conditions, such as those found in TB patients, circulating monocytes may be metabolically preconditioned to differentiate into DCs with low immunogenic potential.</p>
<p>Upon Mtb infection of naive mice, initial accumulation of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lung is delayed, occurring between 2-3 weeks postinfection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. The absence of sterilizing immunity induced by TB vaccines (such as BCG) has been proposed to result from delayed activation of DCs and the resulting delay in antigen presentation and activation of vaccine-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. In this context, it was demonstrated that Mtb-infected Mo-DCs recruited to the site of infection exhibit low CCR7 expression and impaired migration to lymph nodes compared to uninfected Mo-DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Additionally, Mo-DCs have been found to play a key role in transporting Mtb antigens from the lung to the draining lymph node, where conventional DCs present antigens to naive T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The migratory capacity of responding DCs is thus of paramount importance to the host response to Mtb infection.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that Mtb exposure triggers glycolysis in Mo-DCs, which promotes their migration capacity in a HIF-1α-dependent manner. Recently, it was shown that glycolysis was required for CCR7-triggered murine DC migration in response to LPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Glycolysis was also reported to be required for the migration of other immune cells such as macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and regulatory T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Consistently, we show that inhibition of HIF-1α-dependent glycolysis impairs human Mo-DC migration upon Mtb stimulation. The linkage between cellular metabolism and migratory behavior are supported by studies that have elucidated how glycolysis can be mechanically regulated by changes in the architecture of the cytoskeleton, ultimately impacting the activity of glycolytic enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. In addition, interesting links between cellular mechanics and metabolism have been previously described for DCs, highlighting the potential to alter DC mechanics to control DC trafficking and consequently T cell priming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, studies focused on the molecular mechanisms by which metabolic pathways impact the machinery responsible for cell movement in the context of TB infection will be required to more fully understand potential handles for therapeutic manipulation.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that tolerogenic DCs induced by dexamethasone as well as DCs derived from TB patient monocytes exhibit lower lactate release and impaired trafficking toward CCL21 upon Mtb stimulation; both of these phenotypes could be rescued by stabilization of HIF-1α expression. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing the metabolic status and migratory activity of Mo-DCs from TB patients. With respect to the metabolism of tolerogenic DCs broadly, our results are consistent with reported data showing that DC tolerance can be induced by drugs promoting OXPHOS, such as vitamin D and dexamethasone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. It was interesting to note that, although migration of tolerogenic DCs did not increase upon Mtb stimulation, it was increased under basal conditions, which is in agreement with previous data showing a high steady-state migration capacity of putatively tolerogenic DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>It has been widely demonstrated that immune cells have the ability to switch to glycolysis following engagement of TLRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Our work showed that TLR2 ligation by either viable or irradiated Mtb was necessary to trigger glycolysis in DCs, at least at early times post-stimulation. It remains to be elucidated whether persistent interaction between DCs and Mtb might lead to an attenuation in glycolysis over time, as has been reported for macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. In this regard, our data demonstrates that chronic Mtb infection leads to monocytes bearing an exacerbated glycolytic status which results in DCs with exhausted glycolytic capacity. Although DCs stimulated with iMtb in the presence of HIF-1α inhibitor exhibited differences in activation markers and cytokine profile, we found that they were still able to activate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from PPD+ donors in response to iMtb. These findings complement previous evidence showing that LPS-induced mature DCs inhibit T-cell responses through HIF-1α activation in the presence of glucose, leading to greater T cell activation capacity in low glucose contexts such as at the synapsis between DCs and T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In this work, we did not detect an impact on T cell activation upon HIF-1α inhibition in DCs, but we observed a clear reduction in their migration capacity that may limit or delay DC encounters with T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, leading to poor T cell activation in the lymph nodes. In this regard, mouse studies have shown that DC migration directly correlates with T cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets (such as regulatory T cells), CD1-restricted T cells, and/or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets could be differentially activated by iMtb-stimulated DCs lacking HIF-1α activity.</p>
<p>Three different populations of human monocytes have been identified: classical (CD14<sup>+</sup>, CD16<sup>−</sup>), intermediate (CD14<sup>+</sup>, CD16<sup>+</sup>), and non-classical (CD14<sup>dim</sup>, CD16<sup>+</sup>) monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. These monocyte subsets are phenotypically and functionally distinct. Classical monocytes readily extravasate into tissues in response to inflammation, where they can differentiate into macrophage-like or DC-like cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>; intermediate monocytes are well-suited for antigen presentation, cytokine secretion, and differentiation; and non-classical monocytes are involved in complement and Fc gamma-mediated phagocytosis and their main function is cell adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Unlike non-classical monocytes, the two CD14<sup>+</sup> monocyte populations are known to extravasate into tissues and thus are likely to act as precursors capable at giving rise to Mo-DCs in inflamed tissues. However, the DC differentiation capacity of the intermediate population is still not well defined. We previously demonstrated that monocytes from TB patients generate aberrant DCs, and that CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes generate aberrant DCs upon treatment with GM-CSF and IL-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrated that glycolysis seems to play a dual role during DC differentiation from monocytes, on the one side, being required for fully differentiated-DC migration to lymph nodes in response to Mtb and, on the other side, leading to DCs with poor iMtb-responsive migratory capacity if activated during the onset of DC differentiation. Similarly, we found that CD16<sup>+</sup> cells from TB patients display a pathologically activated glycolytic status. Additionally, we showed that monocytes from TB patients are not only enriched in CD16<sup>+</sup> cells, but also display an altered chemokine receptor expression profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, demonstrating that both phenotype and function of a given monocyte subset may differ under pathological conditions. While it is difficult to determine whether the heightened glycolytic profile of monocytes may limit their differentiation into DCs <italic>in vivo</italic>, we provided evidence that an increase in HIF1α-mediated glycolysis in precursors leads to the generation of cells with poor ability to migrate in response to CCL21 <italic>in vitro.</italic> In line with this observation, a recent paper revealed a significant increase in the glycolytic capacity occurs during the first 24h of monocyte differentiation towards a tolerogenic DC phenotype, as induced by vitamin D3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, highlighting the detrimental role of an early activated inflammatory profile in DC precursors. A possible explanation for these effects may be found in lactate accumulation in monocytes during DC differentiation. Lactate signaling in immune cells leads to metabolic alterations in DCs that program them to a regulatory state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, and lactate has also been shown to suppress DC differentiation and maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>; thus, excessive precursor glycolytic activity may result in DCs biased toward regulatory functions.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data provide novel insights into the immunometabolic pathways involved in the trafficking of DCs to the lymph nodes, which may be targetable to generate sterilizing vaccine-induced immunity against TB. To this end, we propose that the development of tools aiming to improve the migratory capacity of DCs by fostering their HIF-1α-mediated glycolytic activity may increase the effectiveness of preventive strategies for TB, especially given that the number of DCs to reach the lymph node was shown to be a critical parameter for the outcome of DC-based vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Understanding how Mtb rewires the innate immune response at the early stages is crucial for the design of preventive and therapeutic vaccines, as well as novel therapies and disease biomarkers.</p>

<title>Measurement of cell respiration with Seahorse flux analyzer</title>
<p>Bioenergetics were determined using a seahorse XFe24 analyzer. ATP production rates and relative contribution from the glycolysis and the OXPHOS were measured by the Seahorse XF Real-Time ATP Rate Assay kit. DCs (2 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) were cultured in 3 wells per condition. The assay was performed in XF Assay Modified DMEM. Three consecutive measurements were performed under basal conditions and after the sequential addition of oligomycin and rotenone/antimycin (Agilent, USA). Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were measured. Mitochondrial ATP production rate was determined by the decrease in the OCR after oligomycin addition. On the other hand, the complete inhibition of mitochondrial respiration with rotenone plus antimycin A, allows accounting for mitochondrial-associated acidification, and when combined with proton efflux rate (PER) data, allows calculation of Glycolysis ATP production rate.

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study tests the hypothesis that Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection increases glycolysis in monocytes, which alters their capacity to migrate to lymph nodes as monocyte-derived dendritic cells. The authors conclude that infected monocytes are metabolically pre-conditioned to differentiate, with reduced expression of Hif1a and a glycolytically exhaustive phenotype, resulting in low migratory and immunologic potential. Unfortunately, the evidence for the conclusions is currently <bold>incomplete</bold>, as the use of dead mycobacteria will affect bioenergetic readouts. The study will be of interest to microbiologists and infectious disease scientists.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Maio and colleagues looks at the impact of the heightened glycolytic activity induced by Mtb in monocytes, and its impact on Hif1- dependent migration of DCs.</p>
<p>Data concerning the biological significance of the impact of enhanced glycolysis on DC migration is strong and convincing. While Hif1-a is obviously a key factor, the evidence that it is a linear component in the cascade falls a little short as the main inhibitor used PX-478 does not have a clear, single mode of action. Additional characterization with the alternative inhibitor (Echinomycin) would make the argument more convincing.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Maio et al attempts to examine the bioenergetic mechanisms involved in the delayed migration of DC's during Mtb infection. The authors performed a series of in vitro infection experiments including bioenergetic experiments using the Agilent Seahorse XF, and glucose uptake and lactate production experiments. This is a well-written manuscript and addresses an important question in the TB field. A major weakness is the use of dead Mtb in virtually all the experiments. Unfortunately, the authors did not attempt to address this critical confounding factor. As a result, data was interpreted, and conclusions were made as if live Mtb was used. Also, previous studies (PMID: 30444490 and PMID: 31914380) have shown that live Mtb suppresses glycolysis, which contradicts findings in this study, perhaps because dead Mtb was used here. For these reasons, obtaining any pertinent conclusions from the study is not possible, which diminishes the significance of the work.</p>

<p>On behalf of the authors of the article &quot;Elevated glycolytic metabolism of monocytes limits the generation of HIF-1α-driven migratory dendritic cells in tuberculosis&quot;, I would like to provide interim responses noting some relevant points about eLife assessment and public reviews,</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This useful study tests the hypothesis that Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection increases glycolysis in monocytes, which alters their capacity to migrate to lymph nodes as monocyte-derived dendritic cells. The authors conclude that infected monocytes are metabolically pre-conditioned to differentiate, with reduced expression of Hif1a and a glycolytically exhaustive phenotype, resulting in low migratory and immunologic potential. Unfortunately, the evidence for the conclusions is currently incomplete, as the use of dead mycobacteria will affect bioenergetic readouts. The study will be of interest to microbiologists and infectious disease scientists.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify what may be a misunderstanding. Indeed, the study did not deal with “infected monocytes” per se, but rather with the ability of monocytes purified from TB patients vs. healthy control to differentiate into DCs with different migratory capacities upon Mtb infection or stimulation. Since there is no evidence for the presence of Mtb in the patient’s blood, the metabolic effects we observed are likely a consequence of systemic pulmonary disease rather than of direct interaction of monocytes with Mtb. Although irradiated Mtb was used in most experiments, in particular because Seahorse and other technologies cannot be used in our BSL3 laboratory, we provide evidence (Figure 1) that infecting DCs with live Mtb or stimulating DCs with irradiated Mtb generates comparable glycolytic profiles (release of lactate, glucose consumption, HIF1a expression and LDHA expression). To strengthen the relevance of our data, we will characterize the metabolism of DCs infected with live Mtb using SCENITH.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Maio and colleagues looks at the impact of the heightened glycolytic activity induced by Mtb in monocytes, and its impact on Hif1-a dependent migration of DCs.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of our manuscript. Although Echinomycin has been used for validating some of the representative experiments performed in our study (see supplementary figure 2E-F), we agree with the reviewer’s suggestion. Therefore, additional experiments using echinomycin will be carried out to confirm our results.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Maio et al attempts to examine the bioenergetic mechanisms involved in the delayed migration of DC's during Mtb infection. The authors performed a series of in vitro infection experiments including bioenergetic experiments using the Agilent Seahorse XF, and glucose uptake and lactate production experiments.

Unfortunately, the authors did not attempt to address this critical confounding factor. As a result, data was interpreted, and conclusions were made as if live Mtb was used. Also, previous studies (PMID: 30444490 and PMID: 31914380) have shown that live Mtb suppresses glycolysis, which contradicts findings in this study, perhaps because dead Mtb was used here. For these reasons, obtaining any pertinent conclusions from the study is not possible, which diminishes the significance of the work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their evaluation of our study. We agree that using live Mtb in all experiments would have been ideal. However, we do not have a Seahorse Analyzer in our BSL3 facility. Thus, we will characterize the metabolism of DCs infected with live Mtb using SCENITH during revision of our manuscript.</p>
<p>With regard to the differences between our results and those of previous studies showing Mtb-induced suppression of glycolysis, they could be explained by the use of different Mtb strains, different multiplicity of infection (MOI), macrophages of different origins, and different measurement timepoints, as discussed in one of these publications (PMID 30444490). For instance, in PMID 30444490, hMDMs infected at an MOI of 1 showed increased extracellular acidification and glycolytic parameters, as opposed to higher MOI or the same MOI but measured in THP1 cells. Importantly, the aforementioned articles studied macrophage and not DC metabolism. These aspects will be discussed in a revised manuscript.</p>
