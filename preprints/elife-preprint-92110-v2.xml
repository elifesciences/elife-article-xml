<title>Abstract</title><p>Transmembrane signaling by plant receptor kinases (RKs) has long been thought to involve reciprocal trans-phosphorylation of their intracellular kinase domains. The fact that many of these are pseudokinase domains, however, suggests that additional mechanisms must govern RK signaling activation. Non-catalytic signaling mechanisms of protein kinase domainshave been described in metazoans, but information is scarce for plants. Recently, a non-catalytic function was reported for the leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-RK subfamily XIIa member EFR (ELONGATION FACTOR TU RECEPTOR) and phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes were proposed to regulate signaling of RKs with non-RD kinase domains. Here, using EFR as a model, we describe a non-catalytic activation mechanism for LRR-RKs with non-RD kinase domains. EFR is an active kinase, but a kinase-dead variant retains the ability to enhance catalytic activity of its co-receptor kinase BAK1/SERK3 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1/SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE 3). Applying hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis and designing homology-based intragenic suppressor mutations, we provide evidence that the EFR kinase domain must adopt its active conformation in order to activate BAK1 allosterically, likely by supporting αC-helix positioning in BAK1. Our results suggest a conformational toggle model for signaling, in which BAK1 first phosphorylates EFR in the activation loop to stabilize its active conformation, allowing EFR in turn to allosterically activate BAK1.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plants and metazoans respond to extracellular signals through different sets of plasma membrane receptors. Whereas the G-protein coupled receptor family expanded in metazoans, the receptor kinase (RK) and receptor protein (RP) families expanded in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shiu and Bleecker, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Trusov and Botella, 2016</xref>). Plant RKs resemble metazoan receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in their organization, containing an extracellular ligand-sensing domain that is coupled to an intracellular kinase domain by a single-pass transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hohmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). In contrast to RTKs, however, the intracellular kinase domain of plant RKs is a serine/threonine kinase domain most closely related to interleukin-1 receptor associated kinases (IRAKs)/Pelle kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shiu and Bleecker, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">2001</xref>) – although dual-specificity kinase activity has been reported in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Macho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Oh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Perraki et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-RKs are the most extensively studied sub-family of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (hereafter Arabidopsis) RKs. They primarily sense peptide ligands that regulate growth and development, or molecular patterns that are released during damage or microbial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Couto and Zipfel, 2016</xref>). Ligand-binding LRR-RKs have long ectodomains (&gt;20 LRRs), and recruit short LRR ectodomain-containing co-receptor kinases (coRKs) upon ligand perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bender and Zipfel, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hohmann et al., 2017</xref>), most of which belong to the SERK (SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE) family. One of the most well characterized LRR-RKs is BRI1 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1), which recruits the coRKs SERK1 and SERK3/BAK1 (BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1) upon brassinosteroid (BR) perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Albrecht et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">He et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hothorn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nam and Li, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Santiago et al., 2013</xref>). After ligand perception, the intracellular kinase domains of BRI1 and BAK1 reciprocally trans-phosphorylate each other in their activation loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hohmann et al., 2017</xref>), and BAK1 then phosphorylates BRI1 in its juxtamembrane segment and C-tail to propagate BR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wang et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">2005</xref>). BRI1 exemplifies a set of BAK1-dependent LRR-RKs that have RD-type intracellular kinase domains and require their catalytic activity to signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kosentka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>). Other LRR-RKs such as EFR (ELONGATION FACTOR TU RECEPTOR) instead have non-RD intracellular kinases, and are thought not to <italic>trans-</italic>phosphorylate their associated coRK following ligand perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schwessinger et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, kinase inactive mutants of EFR (D849N or K851E) retain signaling function, a result that challenges the generality of the reciprocal trans-phosphorylation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bender et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>EFR perceives the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) ELONGATION FACTOR TU, or its active peptide epitope elf18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zipfel et al., 2006</xref>). PAMP perception triggers heterodimerization with the coRK BAK1, resulting in phosphorylation of the EFR intracellular kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bender et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Roux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Schulze et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schwessinger et al., 2011</xref>). The signal is subsequently relayed to the cytoplasmic kinases BIK1 (BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1) and PBL1 (PBS1-LIKE 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ranf et al., 2014</xref>). The resulting Immune signaling activation elicits a battery of cellular responses, including an apoplastic oxidative burst (hereafter oxidative burst), Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx, callose deposition, MAPK (MITOGEN ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE) activation, and transcriptional reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">DeFalco and Zipfel, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Initial studies <italic>in vitro</italic> identified phosphorylation sites in EFR that result either from auto-phosphorylation or from trans-phosphorylation by BAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation sites on EFR were identified by immunoprecipitating EFR-GFP from elf18-treated seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bender et al., 2021</xref>). One was a serine (S888) in the activation loop (A-loop), at which phosphorylation was consistently observed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bender et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the non-RD nature of EFR, and its ability to signal independently of catalytic activity, ligand-inducible phosphorylation in the A-loop (S887/S888) surprisingly proved indispensable for signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bender et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, a functionally important tyrosine in EFR (Y836) – conserved in subdomain VIa of many eukaryotic protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Perraki et al., 2018</xref>) – was found to be phosphorylated after ligand treatment <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Macho et al., 2014</xref>). A phospho-ablative Y836F mutation in EFR blocks immune signaling and resistance against the phytopathogenic bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Macho et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, although EFR function does not require its catalytic activity, both A-loop phosphorylation and phosphorylation of the VIa subdomain tyrosine (VIa-Tyr) appear to be crucial. The mechanistic importance of these phosphorylation events remains poorly understood, but we hypothesized that they switch the EFR kinase domain into an active-like conformation that allosterically activates BAK1 in the EFR-BAK1 complex through a mechanism similar to that described for pseudokinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mace and Murphy, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sheetz and Lemmon, 2022</xref>) – ultimately promoting BAK1’s activity towards its substrate BIK1.</p>
<p>Here, we tested the hypothesis that EFR is an allosteric regulator of BAK1 using a range of different approaches. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies revealed that forcing dimerization of the EFR and BAK1 intracellular domains allosterically enhances BAK1 activity. Using a homology-guided approach, we designed mutations to stabilize the active-like conformation of the EFR kinase domain and found that they restore functionality of EFR variants that cannot be phosphorylated in the A-loop (EFR<sup>SSAA</sup>) or at Y836 (EFR<sup>Y836F</sup>). We also used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to analyze conformational dynamics, revealing that the Y836F mutation hampers the ability of the EFR kinase domain to adopt an active-like conformation. Collectively, our findings argue that the active conformation of the EFR kinase domain is required for allosteric activation of the BAK1 kinase domain. Finally, we present evidence suggesting that EFR activates BAK1 allosterically by supporting αC-helix positioning in BAK1.</p>

<title>The EFR intracellular domain allosterically activates BAK1 in vitro</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that EFR enhances BAK1 catalytic activity allosterically, we used rapamycin (Rap)-induced dimerization (RiD) to induce a complex between the isolated EFR and BAK1 intracellular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Banaszynski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). The RiD system was previously applied <italic>in planta</italic>, maintaining membrane-association by N-terminal myristoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). For our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, the myristoylation sites were excluded to facilitate the purification of recombinant protein. We tested two LRR-RKs: EFR and BRI1, fusing GFP C-terminally and FKBP (FK506 binding protein) N-terminally to their intracellular domains. BAK1 instead was N-terminally tagged with FRB (FKBP-Rap-binding). We first confirmed that adding Rap induced formation of FKBP-EFR/FRB-BAK1 dimers in size exclusion chromatography experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We then assessed the effect of inducing RK/coRK kinase complex formation on their ability to phosphorylate BIK1<sup>D202N</sup>. BIK1 was chosen as it is a reported substrate of both, EFR/BAK1 and BRI1/BAK1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Rap addition increased BIK1<sup>D202N</sup> phosphorylation when the BRI1 or EFR kinase domains were dimerized with BAK1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Kinase-dead variants with the catalytic residue (HRD-aspartate) replaced by asparagine (EFR<sup>D849N</sup> and BRI1<sup>D1009N</sup>), had distinct effects. BRI1<sup>D1009N</sup> failed to enhance BIK1 phosphorylation substantially, whereas EFR<sup>D849N</sup> retained some ability to do so (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The same trend was observed for phosphorylation of the BAK1 kinase domain itself, indicating that EFR also enhances BAK1 autophosphorylation activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>).</p>

Addition of 1 μM Rap enhanced transphosphorylation of BIK1 by EFR and BRI1. Kinase-dead BRI1 failed to enhance BIK1 transphosphorylation, but kinase-dead EFR retained some ability to do so. A similar trend was observed for (auto)phosphorylation of BAK1 itself.C) Quantification of band intensities over three independent experiments of which a representative is shown in B.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The increased BIK1 trans-phosphorylation observed in these <italic>in vitro</italic> RiD experiments could arise either from direct enhancement of BAK1 activity by the RK kinase domain or from more efficient BIK1<sup>D202N</sup> recruitment to the dimerized RK/coRK complex. We found that BIK1<sup>D202N</sup> did not co-elute with the EFR-BAK1 complex in size exclusion studies, indicating that stable EFR/BAK1/BIK1 trimers do not form <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Our findings therefore support the hypothesis that EFR increases BIK1 phosphorylation by allosterically activating the BAK1 kinase domain. Although EFR’s catalytic activity is dispensable for this effect – and for immune signaling – EFR must be phosphorylated at S887/S888 in the A-loop and Y836 to signal <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bender et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Macho et al., 2014</xref>). The phospho-ablative EFR A-loop mutant EFR<sup>SSAA</sup> fails to activate the RK/coRK complex, as ligand-induced phosphorylation of BAK1 S612 – a mark for active BAK1-containing receptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Perraki et al., 2018</xref>) – is obstructed despite retaining the ability to associate with BAK1 in a ligand-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bender et al., 2021</xref>). To test whether the requirement for Y836 phosphorylation is similar, we immunoprecipitated EFR-GFP and EFR<sup>Y836F</sup>-GFP from mock- or elf18-treated seedlings and probed co-immunoprecipitated BAK1 for S612 phosphorylation. EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> also obstructed the induction of BAK1 S612 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – Supplement 1</xref>), indicating that EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> and EFR<sup>SSAA</sup> impair receptor complex activation.</p>

<title>EFR VIa-Tyr mutation affects dynamics of regulatory kinase subdomains</title>
<p>Y836 in EFR corresponds in sequence and structural alignments with Y156 in the canonical kinase PKA (protein kinase A) (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>), which is conserved in many protein kinases. We therefore speculated that Y836 may function as a pivot for key movements of the regulatory αC-helix, controlling conformational toggling of inactive/active transitions as described for its PKA counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tsigelny et al., 1999</xref>). To test whether an EFR Y836F mutation in EFR interferes with assembly of the active-like EFR kinase conformation we used HDX-MS. Plotting differential HDX (Δ%EX) between unphosphorylated EFR and EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> (aa684-1031) identifies one region that is stabilized in EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> compared to wild-type and two that are destabilized (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The region stabilized in EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> contains the N-terminal part of the A-loop, implying that this region makes more extensive contacts with the kinase core than in the unphosphorylated wild-type kinase domain. Alternatively, the decreased deuterium uptake in the EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> A-loop could arise from stabilization of a short A-loop α-helix, as seen in the inactive conformation of many kinases (such as in epidermal growth factor receptor). The two regions that become more structurally flexible in EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> include the β3-αC loop and the catalytic loop plus C-terminal end of the αE-helix – where Y836 is located (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Because these two regions are both important for conformational switching, the HDX-MS results suggest that Y836 is important in regulating kinase domain allosteric transitions. Consistent with this, crystal structures as well as AlphaFold2 models of active kinase conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Faezov and Dunbrack, 2023</xref>) suggest that the side-chain of this tyrosine forms hydrogen-bonds (H-bond) with the αC-β4 loop backbone to establish an inter-lobe connection (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Supplement 1</xref>). Loss of this inter-lobe connection may underlie the observed alterations in EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> conformational dynamics in EFR<sup>Y836F</sup>, resulting from inaccessibility of the active-like conformation.</p>

<title>Kinase activating mutations restore partial function of EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> and EFR<sup>SSAA</sup></title>
<p>To build on these results, we next sought to rescue stability of the active-like EFR kinase domain conformation by introducing activating mutations into EFR<sup>Y836F</sup>. Kinase activating mutations are well known in human disease, and cause different malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Foster et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). Because the HDX-MS data indicated a destabilized αC-helix, we were specifically interested in activating mutations thought to stabilize the kinase αC-helix in a ‘swung-in’ state, with the goal of making homologous changes in EFR. Such mutations were systematically identified in BRAF/CRAF by searching oncogenes using phenylalanine substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). We exploited these oncogenic BRAF mutations for homology-based design of putative activating EFR mutations at corresponding positions that could function as intragenic suppressors of EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Supplement 2A,B</xref>). Since EFR already carries a phenylalanine at the position corresponding to L505 in BRAF, we generated EFR<sup>F761[H/M]</sup> to resemble mutations known to potently activate BRAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hu et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<p>The putative activating mutations were introduced into either EFR<sup>WT</sup> or EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> and transiently expressed in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> to test receptor function.

When introduced on their own into EFR<sup>WT</sup>, the single mutations L743F, F761[HM], and L873E were all consistent with wild-type EFR function, supporting an elf18-induced oxidative burst, except for the ΔNLLKH deletion (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Supplement 2C</xref>). Intriguingly, the F761[H/M] mutations were also able to partially restore the ability of EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> to support an elf18-induced oxidative burst (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Supplement 2C</xref>). This observation also extended to EFR<sup>SSAA</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), arguing that the F761[H/M] mutations, that stabilizes the regulatory spine, support the ability of EFR to trans-activate BAK1.</p>
<p>EFR A-loop phosphorylation was reported previously to be indispensable for EFR function, and led to the hypothesis that it controls conformational switching, despite EFR being a non-RD kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bender et al., 2021</xref>). Our finding that the F761H mutation restores EFR<sup>SSAA</sup> function further supports this hypothesis. Nevertheless, how EFR A-loop phosphorylation facilitates conformational switching is unclear. In our AlphaFold2 models of the EFR kinase domain, we noted that two basic residues from the β3-αC loop and the αC-helix extend towards the A-loop and, similar to PKA H87 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meharena et al., 2016</xref>), may coordinate A-loop phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Supplement 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The oxidative burst is only one of multiple cellular responses triggered by elf18. We therefore also tested whether other immune signaling responses are restored in the EFR<sup>F761H/Y836F</sup> and EFR<sup>F761H/SSAA</sup> complementation lines. Consistent with previous results, EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> and EFR<sup>SSAA</sup> lines were both less sensitive to treatment with 5 nM elf18 than those with wild-type EFR in seedling growth inhibition (SGI) assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bender et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Macho et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Supplement 1B</xref>). As expected, both independent complementation lines of EFR<sup>F761H/Y836F</sup> and EFR<sup>F761H/SSAA</sup> exhibited enhanced SGI compared to EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> and EFR<sup>SSAA</sup>, respectively (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Supplement 1B</xref>). We also observed that MAPK activation was abolished or severely impaired in both EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> and EFR<sup>SSAA</sup> complementation lines (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Supplement 1C</xref>) and recovered in EFR<sup>F761H/Y836F</sup> and EFR<sup>F761H/SSAA</sup> complementation lines (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Supplement 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>The recovery of multiple immune responses in EFR<sup>F761H/Y836F</sup> and EFR<sup>F761H/SSAA</sup> complementation lines suggested that they retain fully functional elf18 signaling and that effective resistance against bacteria can be established. To confirm this, we tested the transgenic lines for resistance against <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>. Infection by this bacterium is restricted in Arabidopsis by EFR, so loss-of-function mutants like <italic>efr-1</italic> are more susceptible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zipfel et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> carrying a plasmid with an intronic version of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene was used to evaluate infection success.

Significant GUS activity was detected in <italic>efr-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with successful <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> infection, but only little was seen in wild-type EFR complementation lines, reflecting resistance to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bender et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zipfel et al., 2006</xref>).

We performed semi-<italic>in vivo</italic> IP-kinase assays in which EFR-GFP variants were immunoprecipitated from two-week-old seedlings after 10 min mock or 100 nM elf18 treatment, and kinase activity of the complex was assessed by monitoring phosphorylation of recombinant His-BIK1<sup>D202N</sup> substrate. The EFR<sup>WT</sup>-GFP-BAK1 complex showed pronounced BIK1 phosphorylation compared with the unliganded control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref>).

They also showed reduced levels of BAK1 phosphorylation at S612 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,C</xref>). However, BAK1 S612 phosphorylation (for EFR<sup>F761H/Y836F</sup> in two out of four experiments) and BIK1<sup>D202N</sup> trans-phosphorylation were partially restored for EFR<sup>F761H/Y836F</sup> and EFR<sup>F761H/SSAA</sup> in this assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,C</xref>), arguing that the functional rescue observed <italic>in vivo</italic> reflects BAK1 activation effects.</p>

<title>Towards a mechanistic understanding of BAK1 allosteric activation by EFR</title>
<p>A phospho-ablative mutation of the BAK1 VIa-Tyr (Y403F) – analogous to Y836F in EFR – has also been reported to compromise elf18-induced signaling by interfering with receptor complex activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Perraki et al., 2018</xref>). We recapitulated this finding using only the intracellular domains of EFR and BAK1, fusing them to FKBP and FRB domains with myristoylation sequences and inducing dimerization with Rap in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – Supplement 1A</xref>). This approach allowed us to investigate BAK1 variants without interference of endogenous NbSERKs. We wondered whether BAK1<sup>Y403F</sup> could be rescued by introducing a mutation into its regulatory spine that stabilizes the active-like confirmation, as seen for F761[H/M] in EFR. Indeed, introducing the analogous mutation (I338H) into BAK1 partly restored the oxidative burst for BAK1<sup>I338H/Y403F</sup> when dimerized with EFR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – Supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that BAK1<sup>Y403F</sup> is perturbed, like EFR<sup>Y836F</sup>, in accessing its active conformation. Analogies with allosteric regulation of other kinases and pseudokinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mace and Murphy, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sheetz and Lemmon, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>) led us hypothesize that EFR might stabilize the active-like conformation of BAK1 intermolecularly – helping to position the BAK1 αC-helix (in the EFR-BAK1 complex) to activate immune signaling. If this is correct, EFR that is partly ‘locked’ in its active-like conformation may be able to rescue (in <italic>trans</italic>) the function of a signaling-inactive BAK1 mutant with a destabilized αC-helix (as in BAK1<sup>Y403F</sup>). We therefore asked whether EFR<sup>F761H</sup> could achieve this, since it exhibited the tendency for increased BIK1<sup>D202N</sup> trans-phosphorylation in IP-kinase assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,C</xref>) and for an accelerated oxidative burst in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – Supplement 2A,B</xref>). Intriguingly, when EFR<sup>F761H</sup> was paired with BAK1<sup>Y403F</sup>, the Rap-induced oxidative burst was partially restored (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that EFR<sup>F761H</sup> can partially restore BAK1<sup>Y403F</sup> function. The fact that no oxidative burst was seen when EFR<sup>F761H</sup> was paired with catalytically inactive BAK1<sup>D416N</sup> suggests that this restoration does not occur through a direct catalytic mechanism mediated by EFR<sup>F761H</sup> (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – Supplement 2C</xref>), supporting the hypothesis of allosteric regulation.</p>

<title>Catalytic independence is only observed for Arabidopsis sp. LRR-RK XIIa kinase domains</title>
<p>EFR belongs to LRR-RK subfamily XIIa (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), of which two other RKs are functionally described immune RKs in Arabidopsis: FLS2 and XPS1 (XANTHINE/URACIL PERMEASE SENSING 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gómez-Gómez and Boller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mott et al., 2016</xref>).

Because EFR does not require its catalytic activity, we wondered whether other LRR-RK XIIa kinase domains similarly function non-catalytically, in a manner similar to pseudokinases. To test this hypothesis, we fused the EFR ectodomain to the transmembrane helix and intracellular domain of different LRR-RK XIIa members to generate elf18 responsive RKs that can dimerize with BAK1/SERKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rhodes et al., 2021</xref>). These chimeric proteins were expressed transiently in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves, and their immune signaling function was tested by elf18 treatment in oxidative burst assays. All chimeras induced an oxidative burst (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), except XIIa2 (the closest FLS2-related kinase), which exhibited only a very minor response. To determine whether their signaling function required kinase activity, we next tested variants with mutations in the catalytic site (replacing the putative catalytic base HRD-aspartate with asparagine). EFR<sup>D849N</sup> induced a robust oxidative burst as expected as well as FEXL1<sup>D838N</sup> and the closely related XIIa5<sup>D839N</sup> (AT3G47570). Similarly, XPS1<sup>D856N</sup> and XIIa6<sup>D840N</sup> (AT3G47090) induced an oxidative burst independently of their catalytic activity, but the total oxidative burst was reduced compared to the catalytically active variants. Protein levels of catalytic site mutants accumulated comparably to their corresponding wild-type versions (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – Supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, the catalytically inactive FLS2<sup>D997N</sup> showed a diminished oxidative burst (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that it may be mechanistically distinct. Furthermore, kinetic differences for the oxidative burst of Arabidopsis XIIa kinase domains were observed. XPS1<sup>D856N</sup> and XIIa6<sup>D840N)</sup> showed a delayed oxidative burst (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – Supplement 1A,B</xref>). Also, EFR<sup>D849N</sup> exhibited a delay of approximately five to seven minutes compared to wild-type EFR. In contrast, oxidative bursts induced by FEXL1<sup>D838N</sup> and XIIa5<sup>D839N</sup> were only slightly delayed compared to their corresponding catalytically active kinase domains. We corroborated these findings for XIIa5 by performing <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays, observing that BIK1<sup>D202N</sup> and BAK1 phosphorylation increased after Rap application as effectively for XIIa5<sup>D839N</sup> as for wild-type XIIa5 (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – Supplement 1C,D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study provides insights into the non-catalytic activation mechanisms of the EFR-BAK1 complex. Rather than requiring its kinase activity to transactive BAK1, our results suggest that the EFR kinase domain undergoes a ‘conformational toggle’ to an active-like state that permits allosteric <italic>trans</italic>-activation of BAK1. EFR function is impaired by perturbation of structural elements that are important for conformational switching – specifically, mutation of the subdomain VIa Y836 or ablation of A-loop phosphorylation sites – but these effects can be reversed by intragenic suppressor mutations that stabilize the active-like conformation, notably the F761H mutation.</p>

By comparison, very little is known about pseudokinases or non-catalytic kinase functions in plants, although pseudokinases are as prevalent in plant as in metazoan kinomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kwon et al., 2019</xref>). Our data demonstrate that EFR and potentially other Arabidopsis XIIa kinases function as allosteric regulators of BAK1 kinase activity, implying pseudokinase-like functions. Thus, our findings establish precedence for non-catalytic mechanisms, specifically allosteric regulation, in plant RK signaling.</p>
<p>Phosphorylation of EFR is crucial for signaling function and potentially supports the conformational toggle. Nevertheless, our results do not resolve how phosphorylation of the A-loop or VIa-Tyr facilitate conformational toggling for EFR, and structural studies will be required to address this question. However, our HDX-MS analysis of unphosphorylated protein suggests that EFR<sup>Y836F</sup> causes the active-like conformation to become inaccessible, potentially due to a lack of an inter-lobe H-bond – consistent with earlier studies describing the corresponding VIa-Tyr as a pivot for αC-helix movements in PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tsigelny et al., 1999</xref>). Recent analysis of the PKA hinge region demonstrate the importance of its integrity for coordinated conformational changes in the N- and C-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Olivieri et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wu et al., 2023</xref>). Whether EFR VIa-Tyr phosphorylation contributes to these coordinated conformational changes is unclear. We attempted to directly address the role of pY836 in EFR conformational dynamics using HDX-MS but were unable to produce sufficient recombinant protein with a pTyr-analog incorporated at the Y836 site. However, phosphorylation of the VIa-Tyr presumably distorts the hinge region due to its proximity to the αC-β4-loop. Alternatively, the VIa-pTyr and C-terminal end of the αE-helix must rotate outwards (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Supplement 1</xref>). Rotation of the αE-helix, however, would have direct impact on the positioning of the catalytic loop and RS1. Of note, functional importance of VIa-Tyr phosphorylation was assigned based on correlation between its phosphorylation and functional impairment by phenylalanine substitution in multiple plant RKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Macho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Perraki et al., 2018</xref>), making it possible that functional importance of its phosphorylation confounded a structural role. Future computational protein-structure prediction techniques that consider post-translational modifications will aid in elucidating the effect of EFR VIa-Tyr phosphorylation on EFR’s conformation. Nevertheless, mutation of VIa-Tyr may be a useful tool to break pseudokinase/non-catalytic functions by impeding conformational toggling in a way that is more effective than using conventional kinase-dead mutations.</p>
<p>Basal BAK1 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> is low compared to its robustly enhanced activity after Rap-induced dimerization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – Supplement 1C,D</xref>), which might be further reduced <italic>in planta</italic> by negative regulators (<italic>e.g.</italic> protein phosphatases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Segonzac et al., 2014</xref>). We propose that, by increasing the local concentration, ligand-induced association of EFR and BAK1 allows partially active BAK1 to phosphorylate the adjacent EFR A-loop. This in turn allows wild-type EFR to adopt the active-like conformation that can allosterically fully activate BAK1 to promote substrate phosphorylation. The activating mutation EFR F761H potentially circumvents the requirement of A-loop phosphorylation since it partially restored EFR<sup>SSAA</sup> function. Consistently, EFR<sup>F761H</sup> showed elevated BIK1 trans-phosphorylation in IP-kinase assays and an accelerated oxidative burst (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B, C</xref>; <xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – Supplement 2A, B</xref>), suggesting constitutive assembly of the active-like conformation. However, EFR<sup>F761H</sup> still requires catalytic activity of complexed BAK1 (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 - Supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data demonstrate that allosteric BAK1 kinase activation plays a key role in EFR-BAK1-mediated immune signaling. The partial recovery of BAK1<sup>Y403F</sup>, which we hypothesize is impaired in αC-helix positioning, by EFR<sup>F761H</sup> suggests a mechanism for allosteric regulation involving BAK1 αC-helix positioning. Indeed, multiple metazoan kinases are allosterically regulated by αC-helix positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sheetz and Lemmon, 2022</xref>). Moreover, BAK1 has a high propensity for a disordered αC-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Moffett et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting its correct positioning requires additional support. Different orientations of kinase-kinase dimers, in which allosteric regulation occurs at the αC-helix, were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mace and Murphy, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sheetz and Lemmon, 2022</xref>). Structural analysis will be required to resolve the exact interaction interface for allosteric activation in the EFR-BAK1 kinase dimer and to design interface-disrupting mutations for structure-function analysis but is beyond the scope of the present work.</p>
<p>Allosteric activation of BAK1/SERKs is partially preserved in Arabidopsis LRR-RK XIIa kinases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Whether these kinases function solely non-catalytically, as suggested by XIIa5<sup>D839N</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – Supplement 1</xref>), or contribute also catalytically to signaling activation is unclear since oxidative bursts induced by all functional catalytic base mutants of XIIa kinases were delayed (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – Supplement 1A,B</xref>). Catalytic base mutation may affect conformational dynamics, which we show are important for EFR function (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), confounding our interpretation. Inactive XIIa kinases with intact conformational dynamics may clarify the extent of catalytic contribution and could be obtained by development of selective inhibitors or engineering analog sensitive kinases. Alternatively, catalytic independency could be a recent innovation in Arabidopsis sp. XIIa kinases, that is taxonomically restricted due to a strong negative selection on the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Man et al., 2023</xref>) but further study is required to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results add to growing evidence that non-catalytic functions of kinases are similar to <italic>bona fide</italic> kinases controlled by conformational switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sheetz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sheetz and Lemmon, 2022</xref>) and further set precedence for discovering more non-catalytic mechanisms in plant RK signaling where pseudokinases are particularly prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kwon et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>In our <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays using the RiD system, the proteins were freely diffusing as they were produced as soluble entities. Freely diffusing components, however, do not fully resemble the <italic>in planta</italic> mode of activation where the plasma membrane restricts the free movement. The colocalization of RK/coRK complexes with their substrates may be a supporting component of signaling activation, which we did not capture in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays.</p>
<p>It is yet unclear whether EFR phosphorylates BAK1 efficiently on activation-relevant residues in the context of stabilized proximity. This information will ultimately help to deduce whether the catalytic activity of EFR contributes to signaling activation and whether even marginal catalytic activity of EFR<sup>D849N</sup> may be sufficient to support signaling activation.</p>
<p>Further, our study relies heavily on mutations. Mutations can have pleiotropic effects as they impact conformational plasticity which supports catalytic activity and non-catalytic functions. Thus, it is difficult to untangle catalytic from non-catalytic functions using solely mutations. Eventually, it would be beneficial to obtain structural information of native proteins in a complex and monitor site-specific and time-resolved phosphorylation on complex components.</p>
<p>We do not have experimental support for EFR<sup>F761H</sup> stabilizing or facilitating the transition into an active-like conformation and relieving the negative effect of the Y836F mutation in EFR<sup>F761H/Y836F</sup>. It would have been beneficial to obtain HDX-MS data for these mutants as well, but we could not produce sufficient protein to do so. Thus, we rather derived the biochemical and structural effects of the EFR<sup>F761H</sup> mutant by homology to mammalian kinases, e.g. BRAF.</p>

The next day, the water solution was replaced with assay solution containing 100 nM elf18, 100 μM luminol and 10 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase, immediately before recording luminescence in 1 min intervals with 250 ms integration time per well in a Tecan Spark plate reader. The luminescence recorded of all leaf discs coming from the same plant were averaged for each time point. For plotting the time course of recorded luminescence emission, the means of all plants belonging to the same genotype were averaged and the standard error of the mean was calculated, which is represented by the error bar. For calculating the time to half maximum, the timepoint of maximum oxidative burst was determined and the next 5 values included for fitting a sigmoidal curve to the oxidative burst of each leaf disc.

<title>HDX-MS Data Analysis</title>
<p>Peptides were sequenced using ProteinLynx Global Server 3.03 (PLGS, Waters), and the deuterium uptake of each peptic peptides was determined using DynamX 3.0 (Waters). The deuterium uptake of all analyzed peptides presented in this study is the average uptake of three biological replicates with technical triplicates per biological sample. The percent exchange of each peptic peptide (%D) was calculated by the following equation:</p>
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="554490v2_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>where m<sub>t</sub> = the centroid mass of a peptic peptide at time, t, m<sub>0</sub> = the centroid mass of a peptic peptide without deuterium labeling, and m<sub>f</sub> = the centroid mass of a peptic peptide for the fully-deuterated standard sample. The Student’s t-test of the HDX data was calculated, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Houde et al., 2011</xref>), by using the average of standard deviations of the percent exchange data of all analyzed peptides from n=3 biological experiments.

<p>Aliquots of purified protein stored at -80°C were thawed in a water bath at room temperature and then kept on ice. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm using a Nanodrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific) and calculating the concentration using the computed extinction coefficient under reducing conditions (Expasy Protparam, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) of the respective protein.

The reaction was stopped after 10 min by adding 5 μl 6x SDS-loading buffer (300 mM Tris, pH6.8, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 6% (w/v) SDS, 0.05% (w/v) bromophenol blue), and heating the sample at 70°C for 10 min. Subsequently, 20 μl of the sample was loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and protein separated by electrophoresis at 130 V for 60-70 min. Proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane at a current of 200 mA over 2 h. Membranes were stained the membrane with CBBG250 for 20 s and destaining (45% methanol (v/v), 10% acetic acid (v/v)) for 10 min. Finally, a phosphor-screen was exposed to the PVDF membrane overnight and imaged using an Amersham Typhoon (GE Lifesciences).

<p>This manuscript reports <bold>important</bold> in vitro biochemical and in planta experiments to study the receptor activation mechanism of plant membrane receptor kinase complexes with non-catalytic intracellular kinase domains. Several lines of evidence <bold>convincingly</bold> show that one such putative pseudokinase, the immune receptor EFR achieves an active conformation following phosphorylation by a co-receptor kinase, and then in turn activates the co-receptor kinase allosterically to enable it to phosphorylate down-stream signaling components. This manuscript will be of interest to scientists focusing on cell signalling and allosteric regulation.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The authors use an elegant but somewhat artificial heterodimerisation approach to activate the isolated cytoplasmic domains of different receptor kinases (RKs) including the receptor kinase BRI1 and EFR. The developmental RK BRI1 is known to be activated by the co-receptor BAK1. Active BRI1 is then able to phosphorylate downstream substrates. The immune receptor EFR is also an active protein kinase also activated by the co-receptor BAK1. EFR however appears to have little or no kinase activity but seems to use an allosteric mechanism to in turn enable BAK1 to phosphorylate the substrate kinase BIK1. EFR tyrosine phosphorylation by BAK1 appears to trigger a conformational change in EFR, activating the receptor. Likewise, kinase activating mutations can cause similar conformational transitions in EFR and also in BAK1 in vitro and in planta.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>I particularly liked The HDX experiments coupled with mutational analysis (Fig. 2) and the design and testing of the kinase activating mutations (Fig. 3), as they provide novel mechanistic insights into the activation mechanisms of EFR and of BAK1. These findings are nicely extended by the large-scale identification of EFR-related RKs from different species with potentially similar activation mechanisms (Fig. 5).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are currently two major issues with the present manuscript. (1) The authors have previously reported that the EFR kinase activity is dispensible for immune signaling (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34531323/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34531323/</ext-link>) but the wild-type EFR receptor still leads to a much better phosphorylation of the BIK1 substrate when compared to the kinase inactive D849N mutant protein (Fig. 1). (2) How the active-like conformation of EFR is in turn activating BAK1 is poorly characterized, but appears to be the main step in the activation of the receptor complex. Extending the HDX analyses to resting and Rap-activated receptor complexes could be a first step to address this question, but these HDX studies were not carried out due to technical limitations.</p>
<p>Overall this is an interesting study that aims to advance our understanding of the activation mechanisms of different plant receptor kinases with important functions in plant immunity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Transmembrane signaling in plants is crucial for homeostasis. In this study, the authors set out to understand to what extent catalytic activity in the EFR tyrosine kinase is required in order to transmit a signal. This work was driven by mounting data that suggest many eukaryotic kinases do not rely on catalysis for signal transduction, relying instead on conformational switching to relay information. The crucial findings reported here involve the realisation that a kinase-inactive EFR can still activate (ie lead to downstream phosphorylation) of its partner protein BAK1. Using a convincing set of biochemical, mass spectrometric (HD-exchange) and in vivo assays, the team suggest a model in which EFR is likely phosphorylated in the canonical activation segment (where two Ser residues are present), which is sufficient to generate a conformation that can activate BAK1 through dimersation. A model is put forward involving C-helix positioning in BAK1, and the model extended to other 'non-RD' kinases in Arabidopsis kinases that likely do not require kinase activity for signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work uses logical and well-controlled approaches throughout, and is clear and convincing in most areas, linking data from IPs, kinase assays (including clear 32P-based biochemistry), HD-MX data (from non-phosphorylated EFR) structural biology, oxidative burst data and infectivity assays. Repetitions and statistical analysis all appear appropriate.</p>
<p>
Overall, the work builds a convincing story and the discussion does a clear job of explaining the potential impact of these findings (and perhaps an explanation of why so many Arabidopsis kinases are 'pseudokinases', including XPS1 and XIIa6, where this is shown explicitly).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses are noted from reviewing the data and the paper follows a logical course built on solid foundations; the use of Tables to explain various experimental data pertinent to the reported studies is appreciated.</p>
<p>(1) The use of a, b,c, d in Figures 2C and 3C etc is confusing to this referee, and is now addressed in the latest version</p>
<p>
(2) The debate about kinase v pseudokinases is well over a decade old. For non-experts, the kinase alignments/issues raised are in PMID: 23863165 and might prove useful if cited.</p>
<p>
(3) Early on in the paper, the concept of kinases and pseudokinases related to R-spine (and extended R-spine) stability and regulation really needs to be more adequately introduced to explain what comes next; e.g. some of the key work in this area for RAF and Tyr kinases where mutual F-helix Phe amino acid changes are evaluated (conceptually similar to this study of the E-helix Tyr to Phe changes in EFR) should be cited (PMID: 17095602, 24567368 and 26925779).</p>
<p>
(4) In my version, some of the experimental text is also currently in the wrong order (and no page numbers, so hard for me to state exactly where in the manuscript); However, I am certain that Figure 2C is mentioned in the text when the data are actually shown in Figure 3C for the EFR-SSAA protein.</p>
<p>
(5) Tyr 156 in PKA is not shown in Supplement 1, 2A as suggested in the text; for readers, it will be important to show the alignment of the Tyr residue in other kinases; this has been updated in the second version. Although it is clearly challenging to generate phosphorylated EFR (seemingly through Codon-expansion here?), it appears unlikely that a phosphorylated EFR protein, even semi-pure, couldn't have been assayed to test the idea that the phosphorylation drives/supports downstream signaling. What about a DD or EE mutation, as commonly used (perhaps over-used) in MEK-type studies?</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>The work is an important new step in the huge amount of follow-up work needed to examine how kinases and pseudokinases 'talk' to each other in (especially) the plant kingdom, where significant genetic expansions have occurred. The broader impact is that we might understand better how to manipulate signaling for the benefit of plants and mankind; as the authors suggest, their study is a natural progression both of their own work, and the kingdom-wide study of the Kannan group.</p>

<p>The study presents strong evidence for allosteric activation of plant receptor kinases, which enhances our understanding of the non-catalytic mechanisms employed by this large family of receptors.</p>
<p>Plant receptor kinases (RKs) play a critical role in transducing extracellular signals. The activation of RKs involves homo- or heterodimerization of the RKs, and it is believed that mutual phosphorylation of their intracellular kinase domains initiates downstream signaling. However, this model faces a challenge in cases where the kinase domain exhibits pseudokinase characteristics. In their recent study, Mühlenbeck et al. reveal the non-catalytic activation mechanisms of the EFR-BAK1 complex in plant receptor kinase signaling. Specifically, they aimed to determine that the EFR kinase domain activates BAK1 not through its kinase activity, but rather by utilizing a &quot;conformational toggle&quot; mechanism to enter an active-like state, enabling allosteric trans-activation of BAK1. The study sought to elucidate the structural elements and mutations of EFR that affect this conformational switch, as well as explore the implications for immune signaling in plants. To investigate the activation mechanisms of the EFR-BAK1 complex, the research team employed a combination of mutational analysis, structural studies, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis. For instance, through HDX-MS analysis, Mühlenbeck et al. discovered that the EFR (Y836F) mutation impairs the accessibility of the active-like conformation. On the other hand, they identified the EFR (F761H) mutation as a potent intragenic suppressor capable of stabilizing the active-like conformation, highlighting the pivotal role of allosteric regulation in BAK1 kinase activation. The data obtained from this methodology strengthens their major conclusion. Moreover, the researchers propose that the allosteric activation mechanism may extend beyond the EFR-BAK1 complex, as it may also be partially conserved in the Arabidopsis LRR-RK XIIa kinases. This suggests a broader role for non-catalytic mechanisms in plant RK signaling.</p>
<p>The allosteric activation mechanism was demonstrated for receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) many years ago. A similar mechanism has been suggested for the activation of plant RKs, but experimental evidence for this conclusion is lacking. Data in this study represent a significant advancement in our understanding of non-catalytic mechanisms in plant RK signaling. By shedding light on the allosteric regulation of BAK1, the study provides a new paradigm for future research in this area.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>I will summarize my comments and suggestions below.</p>
<p>(1) Abstract:</p>
<p>&quot;Non-catalytic (pseudo)kinase signaling mechanisms have been described in metazoans, but information is scarce for plants.&quot; To the best of my understanding EFR is an active protein kinase in vitro and in vivo and cannot be considered a pseudokinase. Consider rephrasing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We rephrased to: “Non-catalytic signaling mechanisms of protein kinase domains have been described in metazoans, but information is scarce for plants.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Page 4: It should be noted, that while membrane associated Rap-RiD systems have been used in planta to activate receptor kinase intracellular domains by promoting interaction with a co-receptor kinase domain, this system does not resemble the actual activation mechanism in the plasma membrane. This would be worth discussing when introducing the system. For example, the first substrates of the RK signaling complex may also be membrane associated and not freely diffuse in solution, which may be important for enzyme-substrate interaction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We inserted on page 4: “The RiD system was previously applied in planta, maintaining membrane-association by N-terminal myristoylation (Kim et al., 2021). For the in vitro experiments, the myristoylation sites were excluded to facilitate the production of recombinant protein.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Page 4 and Fig 1: The catalytic Asp in BRI1 is D1027 and not D1009 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21289069/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21289069/</ext-link>). Please check and prepare the correct mutant protein if needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We clarified this in the text by stating that we mutated the HRD-aspartate to asparagine in all our catalytic-dead mutants: “Kinase-dead variants with the catalytic residue (HRD-aspartate) replaced by asparagine (EFRD849N and BRI1D1009N), had distinct effects […]”. D1027 in BRI1 is the DFG-Asp, which was not mutated in our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Page 4 and Fig 1: Is BIK1 a known component of the BR signaling pathway and a direct BRI1 substrate? Or in other words how specific is the trans-phosphorylation assay? In my opinion, a more suitable substrate for BRI1/BAK1 would be BSK1 or BSK3 (for example <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30615605/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30615605/</ext-link>).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Kinase-dead BIK1 is a reported substrate of BRI1. We clarified this in the results section by inserting: “BIK1 was chosen as it is reported substrate of both, EFR/BAK1 and BRI1/BAK1 complexes (Lin et al., 2013).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Fig. 1B Why is BIK1 D202N partially phosphorylated in the absence of Rap? I would suggest to add control lanes showing BRI1, EFR, FLS2, BAK1 and BIK1 in isolation. Given that a nice in vitro activation system with purified components is available, why not compare the different enzyme kinetics rather than band intensities at only 1 enzyme : substrate ratio?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>BIK1 D202N is partially phosphorylated due to the presence of active BAK1 that is capable of transphosphorylating BIK1 D202N as it has been reported in a previous study: (DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0471-x).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Page 4 and Fig 1: Is the kinase dead variant of EFR indeed kinase dead? I could still see a decent autorad signal for this mutant when expressed in E. coli (Fig 1 A in Bender et al., 2021; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34531323/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34531323/</ext-link>)? If this mutant is not completely inactive, could this change the interpretation of the experiments performed with the mutant protein in vitro and in planta in the current manuscript? In my opinion, it could be possible that a partially active EFR mutant can be further activated by BAK1, and in turn can phosphorylate BIK1 D202N. The differences in autorad signal for BRI1D1009?N and EFRD849N is very small, and the entire mechanism hinges on this difference.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to emphasize that the mechanism hinges on the difference between non-dimerized and dimerized kinase domains in the in vitro kinase assay. BRI1 D1009N fails to enhance BIK1 D202N trans-phosphorylation compared to the non-dimerized sample, while EFR D849N is still capable of enhancing BIK1 transphosphorylation upon dimerization as indicated by quantification of autorads (Figure 1B/C). We have also addressed this point in a section on the limitations of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Fig 1B. &quot;Our findings therefore support the hypothesis that EFR increases BIK1 phosphorylation by allosterically activating the BAK1 kinase domain.&quot; To the best of my understanding presence of wild-type EFR in the EFR-BAK1 signaling complex leads to much better phosphorylation of BIK1D202N when compared to the EFRD849N mutant. How does that support the allosteric mechanism? By assuming that the D849N mutant is in an inactive conformation and fully catalytically inactive (see above)? Again, I think the data could also be interpreted in such a way that the small difference in autorad signal for BIK1 between BRI1 inactive (but see above) and ERF inactive are due to EFR not being completely kinase dead (see above), rather than EFR being an allosteric regulator. To clarify this point I would suggest to a) perform quantitative auto- and trans-(generic substrate) phosphorylation assays with wt and D849N EFR to derive enzyme kinetic parameters, to (2) include the EFRD849 mutant in the HDX analysis and (3) to generate transgenic lines for EFRD489N/F761H/Y836F // EFRD489N/F761H/SSAA and compare them to the existing lines in Fig. 3.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Mutations of proteins, especially those that require conformational plasticity for their function can have pleiotropic effects as the mutation may affect the conformational plasticity and consequently catalytic and non-catalytic functions that depend on the conformational plasticity. In such cases, it is difficult to fully untangle catalytic and non-catalytic functions. Coming back to EFR D849N, the D849N mutation may also impact the non-catalytic function by altering the conformational plasticity, explaining the difference observed in EFR vs EFR D849N. As you rightly suggested, HDX would be a way to address this but would still not clarify whether catalytic activity contributes to activation. We instead attempted to produce analog sensitive EFR variants for in vivo characterization of EFR-targeted catalytic inhibition. Unfortunately, we failed in producing an analog-sensitive variant for which we could show ATP-analog binding. To address your concern, we inserted a section on limitations of the study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Fig. 2B,C, supplement 3 C,D. Has it been assessed if the different EFR versions were expressed to similar protein levels and still localized to the PM?</p>

<p>Localization of the mutant receptors has not been explicitly evaluated by confocal microscopy. However, the selected mutation EFRF761H is shown to accumulate in stable Arabidopsis lines (Figure 3 – Supplement 1C) and BAK1 could be coIPed by all EFR variants upon elf18-treatment (Figure 3 B), indicating plasma membrane localization.</p>

<p>(9) How the active-like conformation of EFR is in turn activating BAK1 is poorly characterized, but appears to be the main step in the activation of the receptor complex. Extending the HDX analyses to resting and Rap-activated receptor complexes could be a first step to address this question. I tried to come up with an experimental plan to test if indeed the kinase activity of BAK1 and not of EFR is essential for signal propagation, but this is a complex issue. You would need to be able to mimic an activated form of EFR (which you can), to make sure its inactive (possibly, see above) and likewise to engineer a catalytically inactive form of BAK1 in an active-like state (difficult). As such a decisive experiment is difficult to implement, I would suggest to discuss different possible interpretations of the existing data and alternative scenarios in the discussion section of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We addressed your concern whether BAK1 kinase activity is essential for signaling propagation by pairing EFRF761H and BAK1D416N (Figure 4 Supplement 2 C) which fails to induce signaling. In this case, EFRF761H is in its activated conformation but cannot activate downstream signaling. We also attempted to address your concern by an in vitro kinase assay by pairing EFR and BAK1D416N and using a range of concentrations of the substrate BIK1D202N. We observed that catalytic activity of BAK1 but not EFR was essential for BIK1 phosphorylation. However, this experiment does not address whether activated EFR can efficiently propagate signaling in the absence of BAK1 catalytic activity. In the limitations of the study section, we now discuss the catalytic importance of EFR for signaling activation.</p>

<title>BIK1 trans-phosphorylation depends on BAK1 catalytic activity.</title>
<p>Increasing concentrations of BIK1 D202N were used as substrate for Rap-induced dimers of EFR-BAK1, EFR D849N-BAK1, and EFR-BAK1 D416N respectively. BIK1 trans-phosphorylation depended on the catalytic activity of BAK1. Proteins were purified from E. coli λPP cells. Three experiments yielded similar results of which a representative is shown here.</p>

<p>All of my suggestions are minor.</p>
<p>Figure 1B, I think it would be more useful to readers to explain the amino acid in the D-N change, rather than just call it D-to-N? Also, please label the bands on the stained gel; the shift on FKBP-BRI1 and FKBP-EFR are noticeable on the Coomassie stain.</p>

<p>Figure 1-Supplement 1. There is still a signal in pS612 BAK1 (it states 'also failed to induce BAK1 S612 phosphorylation' in the text, which is not quite correct). Also, could mention the gel shift seen in BAK1, which appears absent in Y836F.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We corrected the text which now states: “To test whether the requirement for Y836 phosphorylation is similar, we immunoprecipitated EFR-GFP and EFRY836F-GFP from mock- or elf18-treated seedlings and probed co-immunoprecipitated BAK1 for S612 phosphorylation. EFRY836F also obstructed the induction of BAK1 S612 phosphorylation (Figure 1 – Supplement 1), indicating that EFRY836F and EFRSSAA impair receptor complex activation.” The gel shift of BAK1 you pointed out was not observed in replications and thus we prefer not to comment on it.</p>

<p>Figure Supplement 1 is very small for what it is trying to show, even on the printed page. If this residue were to be phosphorylated, what would happen to the H-bond?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We suppose that VIa-Tyr phosphorylation would break the H-bond and causes displacement of the aC-b4 loop. Recent studies, published after our submission, highlight the importance of this loop for substrate coordination and ATP binding. Thus, phosphorylation of VIa-Tyr and displacing this loop may render the kinase rather unproductive. We have expanded the discussion to include this point.</p>

<p>Figure 2B: Tyr 836 is not present in any of the alignments in Figure 2A. This should be rectified, because the text talks about the similarity to Tyr 156 in PKA.</p>

<p>Figure 4D. Is there any particular reason that these Blots are so hard to compare or FKBP and BAK1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We assume it is referred to Figure 4 – Supplement 2 D. FKBP-EFR and FRB-BAK1 both are approximately the size of RubisCo, the most abundant protein in plant protein samples and which overlay the FKBP- and FRB-tagged kinase. Thus, it is difficult to detect these proteins.</p>

<p>(2)The authors showed that &quot;Rap addition increased BIK1 D202N phosphorylation when the BRI1 or EFR kinase domains were dimerized with BAK1, but no such effect was observed with FLS2&quot;. Please explain why FLS2 failed to enhance BIK1 transphosphorylation by Rap treatment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Even though BIK1 is a reported downstream signaling component of FLS2/BAK1, it might be not the most relevant downstream signaling component and rather related RLCKs, like PBL1, might be better substrates for dimerized FLS2/BAK1. We haven’t tested this, however. Alternatively, the purified FLS2 kinase domain might be labile and quickly unfolds even though it was kept on ice until the start of the assay, or the N-terminal FKBP-tag may disrupt function. As the reason for our observation is not clear, we have removed FLS2 in vitro dimerization experiments from the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Based solely on the data presented in Figure 1, it can be concluded that EFR's kinase activity is not required to facilitate BIK1 transphosphorylation. Therefore, the title of Figure 1, &quot;EFR Allosterically Activates BAK1,&quot; may be inappropriate.</p>

<p>We have changed the figure title to: “EFR facilitates BIK1 trans-phosphorylation by BAK1 non-catalytically.”</p>

<p>(4) In Figure 1- Supplement 1, I could not find any bands in anti-GFP and anti-BAK1 pS612 of input. Please redo it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, we could not detect protein in the input samples of this experiment. BAK1 S612 phosphorylation is an activation mark and not necessarily expected to be abundant enough for detection in input samples. EFR-GFP, however, is usually detected in input samples and is reported in Macho et al. 2014 from which manuscript these lines come. Why EFR-GFP is not detected in this set of experiments is unclear but, in our opinion, does not detract from the conclusions drawn since similar amounts of EFR-GFP are pulled-down across all samples.</p>

<p>(7) The HDX-MS analysis demonstrated that the EFR (Y836F) mutation inhibits the formation of the active-like conformation. Conversely, the EFR (F761H) mutation serves as a potent intragenic suppressor, significantly stabilizing the active-like conformation. Confirming through HDX-MS conformational testing that the EFR (Y836F F761H) double mutation does not hinder the formation of the active-like EFR kinase conformation would greatly strengthen the conclusions of the article.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree that this is beneficial, and we attempted to do it but failed to produce enough protein for HDX-MS analysis. We stated this now in an extra section of the paper (“Limitations of the study”).</p>
