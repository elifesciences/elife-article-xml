<title>Abstract</title><p>It is known that stress powerfully alters pain, but its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we identified a circuit, locus coeruleus descending noradrenergic neurons projecting to the spinal dorsal horn (LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons), that is activated by acute exposure to restraint stress and is required for stress-induced mechanical pain hypersensitivity in mice. Interestingly, the primary target of spinal NA released from descending LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NAergic terminals causing the stress-induced pain hypersensitivity was α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenaline receptors (α<sub>1A</sub>Rs) in Hes5-positive (Hes5<sup>+</sup>) astrocytes located in the SDH, an astrocyte subset that has an ability to induce pain sensitization. Furthermore, activation of Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes reduced activity of SDH-inhibitory neurons (SDH-INs) that have an inhibitory role in pain processing. This astrocytic reduction of IN activity was canceled by an A<sub>1</sub>-adenosine receptor (A<sub>1</sub>R)-knockdown in SDH-INs, and the A<sub>1</sub>R-knockdown suppressed pain hypersensitivity caused by acute restraint stress. Therefore, our findings suggest that LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neuronal signaling to Hes5<sup>+</sup> SDH astrocytes and subsequent astrocytic reduction of SDH-IN activity are essential for pain facilitation caused by stress.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Somatosensory information generated at the periphery, such as skin, is conveyed to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (SDH) via primary afferent sensory neurons and further to the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The SDH is the first region for processing the peripherally derived sensory information and thus is critical for its proper transmission to and perception in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The processing of somatosensory information is not only tightly regulated by complex neuronal circuits within the SDH but also powerfully modulated by descending neurons from the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The locus coeruleus (LC), a small nucleus located in the brainstem, modulates pain information processing in the SDH via descending noradrenaline (NA) neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Activation of SDH-projecting LC-NA (LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA) neurons leads to a release of NA in the SDH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Spinal NA acts on α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenaline receptors (α<sub>1A</sub>Rs) expressed on inhibitory neurons (INs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and facilitates γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. This NA signal has been implicated in the inhibitory control of nociceptive information processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Besides neurons, glial cells in the SDH, such as microglia and astrocytes, also have a remarkable ability to modulate the processing and transmission of somatosensory information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Glial modulation has been extensively studied in pathological settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, but studies using <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging have shown that SDH astrocytes respond to noxious stimuli applied to the periphery under normal conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we have recently identified a subset of spinal astrocytes defined by expression of hairy and enhancer of split 5 (Hes5) as a new target of NA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Astrocytes express various types of adrenaline receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>; activation of LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons induces an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), an indicator of astrocyte activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, via α<sub>1A</sub>Rs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, which are the most abundant adrenaline receptors in astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes are selectively distributed in the superficial laminae of SDH where it receives primary afferent sensory fibers. Activation of α<sub>1A</sub>Rs of Hes5<sup>+</sup> SDH astrocytes by intrathecal administration of NA induces pain sensitization to light mechanical stimuli applied to the skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Given that most of the varicosities of NAergic axons/terminals are located closer to astrocytic processes than to neuronal synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes could be a critical NA target for modulating pain in the SDH.</p>
<p>LC-NA neurons are known to respond to several external and internal stressors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In rodent models of stress, nociceptive stimuli (e.g., electric shock, animal bite, etc.) are frequently employed as stressors. LC-NA neurons respond not only to stimuli that directly excite nociceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, but also to stressors that do not involve their direct stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Several studies using rodent stress models have shown that exposure to stressors with or without nociceptor activation induces a remarkable change in pain-associated behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Despite the impact of stress on the pain system, the mechanism underlying a link between stress and pain, especially pain exacerbation, at the neural circuit and cellular levels remains poorly understood, although it has been proposed that activation of enkephalinergic and GABAergic INs in the SDH is involved in stress-induced pain inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Since stressful events are known to have a significant impact on chronic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, providing new insights into the mechanisms by which stress modulates pain is also of clinical importance.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated how stress modulates pain with a focus on LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons and their target Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes in the SDH, using multiple approaches. Our experiments using <italic>in vivo</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, chemogenetics and optogenetics, cell ablation, electrophysiology, biochemical imaging for NA release and astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, conditional gene knockout, and behavioral analyses demonstrate for the first time that LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neuronal signaling to Hes5<sup>+</sup> SDH astrocytes and subsequent astrocytic reduction of SDH-IN activity are essential for stress-induced mechanical pain hypersensitivity.</p>

<title>LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons mediate mechanical hypersensitivity after acute restraint stress</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism underlying stress-induced pain modulation, we subjected wild-type (WT) mice to acute restraint stress exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), a well-known and frequently used stress model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Consistent with a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, restraint stress for 30 min and 1 hour induced hypersensitivity to light mechanical stimuli (by applying von Frey filaments) to the plantar skin of the hindpaw (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). However, with longer exposure (2 hours) to restraint stress, mechanical hypersensitivity was attenuated (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). In subsequent experiments, we chose 1 hour as the exposure time to restraint stress. To analyze LC-NA neuronal activity during restraint stress, we performed fiber photometry using <italic>NET-Cre</italic> mice (Cre is expressed in NAergic neurons under the control of the promoter of NA transporter [NET])<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> with microinjection into the LC of an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector designed to express GCaMP6s (genetic encoded fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator) in a Cre-dependent manner (AAV-flex[GCaMP6s]). Three weeks after the injection, GCaMP6s was expressed selectively in tyrosine hydroxylase<sup>+</sup> (TH<sup>+</sup>) LC-NA neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We found that restraint stress exposure increased the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in these neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). The number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events was highest during the first 20 min of the restraint stress exposure and gradually decreased later.</p>

<p>To investigate the role of LC-NA neurons in mechanical hypersensitivity, we utilized a cell ablation approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>; diphtheria toxin (DTX) receptors (DTR) were specifically expressed in LC-NA neurons by injection of AAV-flex[DTR-EGFP] into the LC of <italic>NET-Cre</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). DTR<sup>+</sup> neurons (detected by GFP) mainly co-expressed TH, and these neurons were ablated by DTX administration (10 µg/kg, two injections 24-hour apart), which resulted in a loss of TH signal in the LC and reduction of NET signal in the SDH (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). We performed behavioral tests in these mice and observed that ablation of LC-NA neurons abolished mechanical hypersensitivity after restraint stress exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). To specifically ablate LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons, a retrograde AAV vector expressing Cre (AAVretro-Cre) was injected into the L4 SDH, followed by AAV-flex[DTR-EGFP] injection into the LC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). In these mice, TH<sup>+</sup> LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons expressing DTR (detected by EGFP) were ablated after DTX administration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). These mice also failed to induce mechanical hypersensitivity after the restraint stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>). These results suggest that descending LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons are necessary for mechanical pain hypersensitivity after acute restraint stress exposure. Furthermore, we tested whether optogenetic activation of LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons could induce mechanical hypersensitivity, using ChrimsonR, a well-established red-shifted channelrhodopsin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. <italic>NET-Cre</italic> mice were microinjected with AAV-flex[ChrimsonR-tdTomato] into the LC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>). Three weeks later, we confirmed expression of ChrimsonR (detected by tdTomato) in TH<sup>+</sup> neurons in the LC and NET<sup>+</sup> axons/terminals in the SDH (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M</xref>). Optogenetic stimulation of LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neuronal axons/terminals in the SDH evoked mechanical hypersensitivity in these mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1N</xref>). These results together demonstrate that LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons are activated by acute stress exposure and are not only necessary for stress-induced mechanical pain hypersensitivity but also sufficient to phenocopy the behavioral response.</p>

<title>LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NAergic signaling to Hes5<sup>+</sup> SDH astrocytes is required for stress-induced mechanical hypersensitivity</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism by which activation of LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons induces mechanical hypersensitivity, we first examined if NA is released in the SDH when these neurons are stimulated, using the genetically encoded fluorescent NA sensor GRAB<sub>NE1m</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.

The fluorescence intensity increased in a stimulation period-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Next, to determine the target cells and receptors of LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons, we focused on α<sub>1A</sub>Rs in astrocytes because our previous study showed that NA increases [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in astrocytes via α<sub>1A</sub>Rs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Using spinal cord slices from <italic>NET-Cre</italic> mice that had been injected with AAV-flex[ChrimsonR-tdTomato] into the LC and AAV-gfaABC<sub>1</sub>D-GCaMP6m into the SDH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), we found that optogenetic stimulation of LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA axons/terminals evoked a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in astrocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Pretreatment with the α<sub>1A</sub>R-specific antagonist silodosin (40 nM) suppressed the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting that NA released from LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in SDH astrocytes via α<sub>1A</sub>Rs. Behaviorally, intrathecal injection of silodosin in <italic>NET-Cre</italic>;AAV-ChrimsonR mice attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity by optogenetic stimulation of the LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, intrathecal administration of NA (0.1 nmol) evoked transient mechanical hypersensitivity, which was completely abolished in <italic>Hes5-CreERT2</italic>;<italic>Adra1a</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice treated with tamoxifen (Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocyte-selective conditional knockout of α<sub>1A</sub>Rs: Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocyte–α<sub>1A</sub>R cKO) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Moreover, mechanical hypersensitivity after acute restraint stress was abolished in Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocyte–α<sub>1A</sub>R cKO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). In addition, intrathecal administration of 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (DCK; 10 nmol), an antagonist of D-serine signaling on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, also suppressed mechanical hypersensitivity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Supporting this finding, our previous report identified D-serine as a hypersensitivity-inducing factor released from Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. These results indicate that spinally-released NA from LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons after acute restraint stress activates α<sub>1A</sub>Rs on Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes, which causes mechanical pain hypersensitivity.</p>

However, <italic>Vgat-Cre</italic>;<italic>Adra1a</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice (Vgat<sup>+</sup> IN-selective conditional knockout of α<sub>1A</sub>Rs: Vgat<sup>+</sup> IN–α<sub>1A</sub>R cKO mice)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> had no effect on the NA (0.1 nmol)-induced mechanical hypersensitivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). A similar behavioral phenotype was also observed after intrathecal administration of phenylephrine (0.05 nmol), a selective agonist for α<sub>1</sub>Rs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, stress-induced mechanical hypersensitivity was not affected in Vgat<sup>+</sup> IN–α<sub>1A</sub>R cKO mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Considering previous data that SDH-INs (including Vgat<sup>+</sup>) respond to NA via α<sub>1A</sub>Rs at NA concentrations similar to those that elicit Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocyte response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, it remains unclear why intrathecally administered NA and spinally released NA from LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neuron terminals (after acute restraint stress) have no suppressive effect via α<sub>1A</sub>R-mediated Vgat<sup>+</sup> IN activation on mechanical hypersensitivity. We then hypothesized an interaction between Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes and Vgat<sup>+</sup> INs as per a previous report that optogenetic activation of rat SDH astrocytes leads to ATP release; ATP is converted to adenosine extracellularly which subsequently suppresses the activity of SDH-INs via adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors (A<sub>1</sub>Rs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. By performing whole-cell current-clamp recordings of Vgat<sup>+</sup> INs in spinal cord slices from <italic>Vgat-Cre</italic>;<italic>Rosa-tdTomato</italic> mice, we found that bath application of NA (20 µM) evoked depolarization in 22.2% (10/45 cells) of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells (Vgat<sup>+</sup> INs), with 30% of these showing action potentials (3/10 cells). The proportion of Vgat<sup>+</sup> INs depolarized by NA is similar to that of <italic>Adra1a</italic> mRNA-expressing INs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In 50% (5/10 cells) of depolarized Vgat<sup>+</sup> INs, additional application of the A<sub>1</sub>R-selective agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA; 1 µM) suppressed NA-induced depolarization/action potentials (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>).

AAV vectors designed to express the <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> Cas9 (SaCas9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> in a Cre-dependent manner (AAV-flex[SaCas9]) and single guide RNA-expression vectors (AAV-flex[mCherry]-U6-sgAdora1 or - flex[mCherry]-U6-sgYFP [as a control]) were co-microinjected into the SDH of <italic>Vgat-Cre</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).

In these SDH-Vgat<sup>+</sup> IN-selective A<sub>1</sub>R conditional knockdown mice (SDH-Vgat<sup>+</sup> IN–A<sub>1</sub>R cKD mice), the inhibitory effect of CPA on NA-induced depolarization/action potentials was completely abolished in mCherry<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, H</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). Using a chemogenetic approach with modified human muscarinic G<sub>q</sub>-protein-coupled receptors (hM3Dq)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, we further examined the effect of G<sub>q</sub>-stimulated Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes on inhibitory synaptic transmission. <italic>Hes5-CreERT2</italic> mice were microinjected with AAV-flex[hM3Dq-HA] into the SDH (<italic>Hes5-CreERT2</italic>;AAV-hM3Dq mice). hM3Dq (detected by HA-tag) was expressed in the SDH, and these cells were double-labeled with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and SRY-related high-mobility group box 9 (SOX9), markers of astrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). Using spinal cord slices from these mice, we performed whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons. Bath application of hM3Dq agonist clozapine N-oxide (CNO; 100 µM) reduced the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in SG neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, K</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">L</xref>).

<title>Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocyte-mediated inhibitory signals to INs affect mechanical hypersensitivity</title>
<p>We investigated whether A<sub>1</sub>Rs in SDH-Vgat<sup>+</sup> INs contributed to the mechanical hypersensitivity elicited by intrathecal NA (0.1 nmol). Acute inhibition of spinal A<sub>1</sub>Rs by intrathecal administration of CPT (3 nmol) suppressed NA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, SDH-Vgat<sup>+</sup> IN–A<sub>1</sub>R cKD mice showed a significant reduction in the behavioral hypersensitivity by NA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that A<sub>1</sub>Rs in SDH-Vgat<sup>+</sup> INs contribute to mechanical hypersensitivity by spinal NA.

These results suggest that Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocyte-mediated negative control for SDH-Vgat<sup>+</sup> INs via A<sub>1</sub>R-mediated signals is crucial for stress-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Moreover, we investigated the role of this interaction in stress-induced alteration of somatosensory information processing in the SDH using phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), a neuronal nociceptive input marker in superficial SDH neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Consistent with the results of a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, Aβ fiber stimulation of the hindpaw alone did not increase the number of pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons in the superficial SDH (laminae I–IIi using isolectin B4 [IB4], a marker of lamina IIi) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Similarly, acute restraint stress alone did not change the number of pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>External and internal stressors elicit a variety of biological responses including pain modulation. Acute exposure to a stressor inhibits or facilitates behavioral responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli applied to the skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. While the mechanism underlying pain inhibition has been studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, the neural basis of pain facilitation by stress remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified a circuit, the descending LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons, that is activated by acute restraint stress exposure and demonstrated that the circuit is necessary for stress-induced pain hypersensitivity. A notable finding of this study was that Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes, a subpopulation of spinal cord astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, are the primary target of NA released from descending LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons for mechanical pain hypersensitivity caused by stress. Thus, this top-down signaling pathway from LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons to Hes5<sup>+</sup> SDH astrocytes is an essential link between stress and pain sensitization.</p>
<p>Spinal NA derived from LC-NA neurons has been classically implicated in pain inhibitory control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The suggested mechanism to this effect is its action on SDH-INs via α<sub>1A</sub>Rs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In contrast, recent our study has unveiled another facet of spinal NA signaling, which is pronociceptive, by identifying Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes in the SDH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Mechanistically, spinal NA acts on α<sub>1A</sub>Rs expressed on Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes, increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels via a G<sub>q</sub>/PLC/IP<sub>3</sub> pathway, and causes mechanical hypersensitivity via release of D-serine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, an activator of NMDA receptors. This study showed that the optogenetic activation of LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons produced mechanical hypersensitivity via α<sub>1A</sub>Rs in SDH-Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes, indicating the pronociceptive effect of LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NAergic signaling. In contrast, it has also been reported that a similar opto-or chemogenetic activation produces an antinociceptive effect on thermal stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. The reason for the difference remains unclear; however, the stimulus modality used for the behavioral assay (mechanical vs. thermal) may be responsible, since the SDH circuits for mechanical and thermal information processing have been shown to be distinct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Given that SDH-INs also express α<sub>1A</sub>Rs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, it is unclear why pain hypersensitivity is the preferentially manifested behavioral phenotype after activation of LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NAergic signal. This study showed that NA-stimulated Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes negatively regulate the activity of SDH-Vgat<sup>+</sup> INs. This astrocytic attenuation of SDH-Vgat<sup>+</sup> IN activity may involve adenosine signaling because A<sub>1</sub>R cKD in SDH-Vgat<sup>+</sup> INs canceled the suppressive effect of A<sub>1</sub>R agonist on NA-induced enhancement of Vgat<sup>+</sup>-IN activity and NA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. The adenosine-mediated inhibition of SDH-INs is consistent with the data from a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Thus, these results suggest that spinal NA acts on α<sub>1A</sub>Rs expressed by both Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes and Vgat<sup>+</sup> INs; however, NA-stimulated Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes suppress Vgat<sup>+</sup> IN activity by adenosine signaling via A<sub>1</sub>Rs; this induces a state where the Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocyte-derived pain-facilitating effect predominates, causing mechanical pain hypersensitivity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>
<p>While a neuronal model for gating peripherally derived sensory signals in the SDH has been previously established by identifying several subpopulations of INs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, our study proposes a new regulatory mechanism in this model in which Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes act as non-neuronal gating cells in the SDH for brain-derived NAergic signaling. This astrocytic gating control of INs may affect processing and transmission of somatosensory information in the SDH. Indeed, a pharmacological blockade of the adenosine signal to SDH-Vgat<sup>+</sup> INs suppressed the Aβ fiber-mediated pERK expression in the superficial SDH of stressed mice. Preproenkephalin<sup>+</sup> IN population may be among the SDH-Vgat<sup>+</sup> INs involved in stress-induced pain modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Interfering with GABA/glycine signaling in the SDH results in abnormal synaptic inputs from primary afferent Aβ fibers onto superficial SDH neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Our view is also supported by previous findings from <italic>in vivo</italic> patch-clamp recordings, which show that, in about a half of SG neurons tested, NA enhances excitatory synaptic responses evoked by tactile stimuli (air puff to the skin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Additionally, our hypothesis that Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes co-release D-serine and ATP/adenosine in response to α<sub>1A</sub>R activation by NA is supported by previous findings in the neocortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Aβ fiber inputs into neurokinin 1 receptor-positive projection neurons in SDH lamina I following inhibition of GABA/glycine signaling is canceled by a pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, supporting our data that the stress-induced mechanical hypersensitivity was suppressed by the antagonist of D-serine site of NMDA receptors DCK. However, the effect of astrocytic adenosine on spinal pain processing has been controversial: both, pronociceptive (consistent with our findings)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and antinociceptive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Such different effects might be related in part to the regionally restricted astrocytic subpopulations and factors for their activation. Pro- and anti-nociceptive effects have been reported to be mediated by astrocytes located in superficial and deeper laminae and stimulated by NA (via G protein-coupled α<sub>1A</sub>Rs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and ATP (via ionotropic P2X7 receptors)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, respectively. In particular, the regional differences in the role of astrocytes has been demonstrated by our previous study in which a selective chemogenetic stimulation of astrocytes in deeper SDH did not cause mechanical hypersensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, it is conceivable that locally released adenosine from NA-stimulated Hes5<sup>+</sup> astrocytes, following acute restraint stress, may suppress SDH-Vgat<sup>+</sup> IN function, which results in mechanical pain hypersensitivity. The spatially restricted neuron–astrocyte communication needs to be investigated in future studies.</p>
<p>In this study, we focused on the mechanisms of mechanical hypersensitivity by acute exposure to restraint stress. Consistent with a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, acute restraint stress caused mechanical hypersensitivity; however, there are also reports showing a reduction in behavioral responses to thermal or mechanical stimuli upon exposure to similar restraint stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. A precise explanation for the bidirectional outcomes remains elusive. However, it is widely recognized that the extent and direction of pain modulation may be due to the nature, duration, and intensity of the stressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Indeed, while acute and short-term exposure (≤1 hour) to restraint stress induces mechanical pain hypersensitivity, longer exposure (2 hours) failed to exhibit the behavioral response (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). It has also been reported that behavioral response to nociceptive thermal stimuli is suppressed by a 2-hour exposure to restraint stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, descending LC<sup>→SDH</sup>-NA neurons, Hes5<sup>+</sup> SDH astrocytes, or their output signals may be attenuated by unidentified inhibitory signals evoked by longer exposure to restraint stress. In addition, a similar bidirectional behavioral outcome on mechanical pain has also been observed with intrathecal NA; low doses of NA induce mechanical pain hypersensitivity while higher doses do not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, the bidirectional change may depend on the level of NA neuronal activity and NA content in the SDH, which is supported by a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Clinically, stressor-evoked psychological and physical responses are considered critical for the development of chronic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, especially nociplastic pain, a condition that arises from altered nociceptive signaling without actual or threatened tissue damage, or disease or lesion of the somatosensory system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In fact, patients with chronic pain have a high incidence of stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, fear, and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>; stressful life events are known to be a key factor in establishing fibromyalgia and enhance pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and headaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Thus, our findings provide a mechanistic insight into the link between stress and pain modulation and may help in understanding and developing a new strategy for chronic pain, including nociplastic pain.</p>

<p>pAAV-CAG-flex[GCaMP6s]-WPRE (#100842) and pAAV-synapsin (Syn)-flex[ChrimsonR-tdTomato]-WPRE (#62723) were purchased from Addgene. The genes encoding GCaMP6m (#40754; Addgene), Cre, and GRAB<sub>NE1m</sub> (#123308; Addgene) were subcloned into the pENTR plasmid (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To produce AAV vectors, we inserted GCaMP6m and GRAB<sub>NE1m</sub> into pZac2.1-gfaABC<sub>1</sub>D-WPRE plasmid and Cre into pZac2.1-enhanced synapsin (ESYN)-WPRE plasmid. To produce the AAV vector for the Cre-switch system, vectors containing the promoters encoding EF1α were generated from pAAV-CA-FLEX (#38042; Addgene) by substituting the promoter. We then inserted AcGFP, DTR-EGFP (kindly provided by Prof. Kenji Kohno, Nara Institute of Science and Technology), mCherry and hM3Dq (#45547; Addgene) into pAAV-EF1α-FLEX.

<p>Viral injection was performed in accordance with our previously described method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Mice were deeply anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). For intra-SDH injection, the skin was incised at Th11–L4 vertebrae, and custom-made clamps were attached to the caudal sites of the vertebral column. Paraspinal muscles around the left side of the interspace between Th13 and L1 vertebrae were removed, and the dura mater and arachnoid membrane were carefully incised using the tip of a 30-G needle to make a small window allowing a glass microcapillary to insert directly into the SDH. The microcapillary was inserted into the unilateral SDH (around 120–150 μm in depth from the surface of the dorsal root entry zone). rAAV solutions (approximately 500 nl) were injected using a Micro4 Micro Syringe Pump Controller (World Precision Instrument). After microinjection, the glass microcapillary was removed, the skin was sutured with 5-0 silk, and the mice were kept on a heating pad until recovery. For intra-LC injection, rAAV solutions were injected (approximately 300 nl in one site) adjacent to the LC (anteroposterior (AP): −5.4 mm from the bregma; mediolateral (ML): ±0.9 mm; dorsoventral (DV): −3.2 mm from the dura). Only AAV2/9-CAG-flex[GCaMP6s]-WPRE was injected unilaterally, and the other AAV vectors were injected bilaterally. To keep the bregma and lambda in the same horizontal plane, tolerance was maintained at &lt;50 µm in the dorsoventral axis between the bregma/lambda. The microcapillary was withdrawn 3 min after ending the injection. The skin was then sutured with 5-0 silk, and the mice were kept on a heating pad until recovery. We used virus-injected mice for further analyses 3 weeks or more after the last injection.

Cannulae were purchased from RWD (#R-FOC-BL400C-50NA, ø1.25 mm ferrule, ø400 μm optic fiber, 0.50 NA). The length of the optic fiber protruding from the tip of the ferrule was 4.0 mm. Optic cannula was implanted in the unilateral LC (AP: −5.4 mm from the bregma; ML: 0.9 mm; DV: −3.0 mm from the dura). Next, the cannula was secured using two types of dental glues (Super-bond; Sun Medical, Shiga, Japan: UNIFAST III; GC, Tokyo, Japan). After implantation, the skin was sutured with 5-0 silk, and the mice were kept on a heating pad until recovery. We used cannula-implanted mice for fiber photometry 3 weeks or more after the surgery. GCaMP fluorescent signals were obtained with the fiber photometry apparatus from Doric Lenses, which includes a fiber photometry console (FPC_V6), a 415-nm LED illumination (CLED_415), a 465-nm LED illumination (CLED_465), an LED driver (LEDD_2), and a fluorescence mini cube with built-in fluorescence photodetector amplifier (iFMC4-G2_IE(410-420)_E(460–490)_F(500–550)_S). A 415-nm light was modulated at 208 Hz, while a 465-nm light was modulated at 572 Hz. The optic cannula implanted in mice and fluorescence mini cube were connected by a low-autofluorescence patch cable (#MAF1L1; Thorlabs). The power output at the fiber tip was 30–40 µW. After connecting to the patch cable, the mice were allowed to move freely in the home cage for at least 10 min for habituation. After habituation, fluorescence recording was started.

A 488-nm diode laser was used for the excitation of GCaMP6m and GRAB<sub>NE1m</sub>. The size of the image was 509 × 509 μm<sup>2</sup> (512 × 512 pixels). The recordings were acquired at a rate of 1.083 s per image. Light stimulations (1 mW, 10 Hz, 5-ms pulse duration, 1–20 s) were generated by an LED driver (#LEDD_2; Doric Lenses) and delivered through an optic fiber (Thorlabs, FT200UMT, ø200 μm, 0.39 NA). For an experiment on α<sub>1A</sub>R inhibition, optogenetic stimulations (10 s) were performed twice (at least 15-min apart) in the same slice. Silodosin (40 nM in aCSF) was continuously applied by bath application starting 5 min before the onset of 2nd optogenetic stimulation. After optogenetic stimulation, NA (1 or 10 μM in aCSF) was applied by bath application as the positive control.</p>

For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging using GCaMP, the size of each region of interest (ROI) was set to a circle with a diameter of 10 μm<sup>22</sup>.

<title>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings using spinal cord slices</title>
<p>According to our previously described method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, mice were deeply anesthetized with urethane (1.2–1.5 mg/kg, i.p.), and the lumbar spinal cord was removed and placed in a cold high-sucrose aCSF (250 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 11 mM glucose). Parasagittal and transverse spinal cord slices (250–300 µm thick) were made with a vibrating microtome (VT1200, Leica) and then the slices kept in oxygenated aCSF solution (125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 20 mM glucose) at room temperature (22–25°C) for at least 30 min. The spinal cord slice was then put into a recording chamber, where it was continuously superfused with aCSF solution at 25– 28°C at a flow rate of 4–6 ml/min. Recordings were made with the Axopatch 700B amplifier and pCLAMP 10.4 acquisition software (Molecular Devices). Data were digitized with an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata 1550; Molecular Devices), stored on a personal computer with a data acquisition program (ClampeX version 10.4; Molecular Devices), and analyzed with a software package (Clampfit version 10.7; Molecular Devices). Spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were recorded in the voltage-clamp mode at a holding potential of 0 mV. Patch pipettes were filled with an internal solution (120 mM CsMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 15 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM QX-314, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 0.2 mM EGTA, 10 mM TEA-Cl and 8 mM NaCl [pH 7.28] adjusted with CsOH), and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from SG neurons. Resting membrane potentials (RMPs) were recorded in current-clamp mode. Patch pipettes were filled with an internal solution (125 mM K-gluconate, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM ATP-Mg, 0.3 mM NaGTP, 10 mM phosphocreatine, pH 7.28 adjusted with KOH), and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from tdTomato<sup>+</sup> or mCherry<sup>+</sup> neurons. The following drugs were used: NA (20 µM; #74480; Sigma-Aldrich), clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 100 µM; #BML-NS105; Enzo Life Sciences), CPT (1 µM), N6-Cyclopentyladenosine (CPA; 1 µM; #119135; Sigma-Aldrich), CNQX disodium salt hydrate (CNQX; 10 µM; #C239; Sigma-Aldrich), (+)-MK-801 hydrogen maleate (MK-801; 20 µM; #M107; Sigma-Aldrich), 1(S), 9(R)-(-)-bicuculline methiodide (10 µM; #14340; Sigma-Aldrich) and strychnine (1 µM; #S0532; Sigma-Aldrich). All drugs were dissolved in aCSF solution. CNO was superfused for 3 min. Bath application of CPT was continuously superfused from 4 min before CNO application. NA was superfused with an antagonist cocktail (CNQX, MK-801, bicuculline and strychnine) for 3–5 min. If the recording neuron was depolarized by NA perfusion, then CPA was co-perfused with NA and an antagonist cocktail for 3 min. The frequency of sIPSCs for 1 min of pre- and post-NA application were quantified using Clampfit version 10.7 (Molecular Devices). We quantified averaged RMP for 1 min of pre- and post-drug application, and a change in RMP (ΔRMP) of 5 mV or more was judged to be depolarization or hyperpolarization.</p>

<title>Electrical stimulation of Aβ fibers and counting of pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons in the SDH</title>
<p>After exposure to 1-hour restraint stress, mice were deeply anesthetized with an i.p. injection of urethane (1.2–1.5 mg/kg). Thirty min after stress, Aβ fiber stimulation was performed. The electrodes were attached to the plantar and dorsal surfaces of the left hindpaw. Transcutaneous nerve stimuli were applied using a stimulus generator (#STG4002-16 mA; Multi Channel Systems). The current intensity of the 2,000-Hz stimuli was 1,000 μA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Mice were fixed at 2 min after electrical stimulation. For quantification of pERK<sup>+</sup> cells, three sections from the L4 spinal cord segments were randomly selected from each mouse, and the number of pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons in the superficial laminae І–IIi (defined by staining of IB4) was counted. Consistent with a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, we confirmed that electrical stimulation of Aδ and C fibers, but not Aβ fibers, induced ERK phosphorylation in SDH neurons (data not shown).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study identifies a novel role for Hes5+ astrocytes in modulating the activity of descending pain-inhibitory noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus during stress-induced pain facilitation. The role of glia in modulating neurological circuits including pain is poorly understood, and in that light, the role of Hes5+ astrocytes in this circuit is a key finding with broader potential impacts. However, the impact of this work is limited by <bold>incomplete</bold> evidence, notably the fact that acute restraint stress is generally anti-nociceptive rather than pro-nociceptive, and a lack of specificity in defining this novel circuit.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this article, Kawanabe-Kobayashi et al., aim to examine the mechanisms by which stress can modulate pain in mice. They focus on the contribution of noradrenergic neurons (NA) of the locus coeruleus (LC). The authors use acute restraint stress as a stress paradigm and found that following one hour of restraint stress mice display mechanical hypersensitivity. They show that restraint stress causes the activation of LC NA neurons and the release of NA in the spinal cord dorsal horn (SDH). They then examine the spinal mechanisms by which LC→SDH NA produces mechanical hypersensitivity. The authors provide evidence that NA can act on alphaA1Rs expressed by a class of astrocytes defined by the expression of Hes (Hes+). Furthermore, they found that NA, presumably through astrocytic release of ATP following NA action on alphaA1Rs Hes+ astrocytes, can cause an adenosine-mediated inhibition of SDH inhibitory interneurons. They propose that this disinhibition mechanism could explain how restraint stress can cause the mechanical hypersensitivity they measured in their behavioral experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Significance. Stress profoundly influences pain perception; resolving the mechanisms by which stress alters nociception in rodents may explain the well-known phenomenon of stress-induced analgesia and/or facilitate the development of therapies to mitigate the negative consequences of chronic stress on chronic pain.</p>
<p>(2) Novelty. The authors' findings reveal a crucial contribution of Hes+ spinal astrocytes in the modulation of pain thresholds during stress.</p>
<p>(3) Techniques. This study combines multiple approaches to dissect circuit, cellular, and molecular mechanisms including optical recordings of neural and astrocytic Ca2+ activity in behaving mice, intersectional genetic strategies, cell ablation, optogenetics, chemogenetics, CRISPR-based gene knockdown, slice electrophysiology, and behavior.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Mouse model of stress. Although chronic stress can increase sensitivity to somatosensory stimuli and contribute to hyperalgesia and anhedonia, particularly in the context of chronic pain states, acute stress is well known to produce analgesia in humans and rodents. The experimental design used by the authors consists of a single one-hour session of restraint stress followed by 30 min to one hour of habituation and measurement of cutaneous mechanical sensitivity with von Frey filaments. This acute stress behavioral paradigm corresponds to the conditions in which the clinical phenomenon of stress-induced analgesia is observed in humans, as well as in animal models. Surprisingly, however, the authors measured that this acute stressor produced hypersensitivity rather than antinociception. This discrepancy is significant and requires further investigation.</p>
<p>(2) Specifically, is the hypersensitivity to mechanical stimulation also observed in response to heat or cold on a hotplate or coldplate?</p>
<p>(3) Using other stress models, such as a forced swim, do the authors also observe acute stress-induced hypersensitivity instead of stress-induced antinociception?</p>
<p>(4) Measurement of stress hormones in blood would provide an objective measure of the stress of the animals.</p>
<p>(5) Results:</p>
<p>a) Optical recordings of Ca2+ activity in behaving rodents are particularly useful to investigate the relationship between Ca2+ dynamics and the behaviors displayed by rodents.</p>
<p>b) The authors report an increase in Ca2+ events in LC NA neurons during restraint stress: Did mice display specific behaviors at the time these Ca2+ events were observed such as movements to escape or orofacial behaviors including head movements or whisking?</p>
<p>c) Additionally, are similar increases in Ca2+ events in LC NA neurons observed during other stressful behavioral paradigms versus non-stressful paradigms?</p>
<p>d) Neuronal ablation to reveal the function of a cell population.</p>
<p>e) The proportion of LC NA neurons and LC→SDH NA neurons expressing DTR-GFP and ablated should be quantified (Figures 1G and J) to validate the methods and permit interpretation of the behavioral data (Figures 1H and K). Importantly, the nocifensive responses and behavior of these mice in other pain assays in the absence of stress (e.g., hotplate) and a few standard assays (open field, rotarod, elevated plus maze) would help determine the consequences of cell ablation on processing of nociceptive information and general behavior.</p>
<p>f) Confirmation of LC NA neuron function with other methods that alter neuronal excitability or neurotransmission instead of destroying the circuit investigated, such as chemogenetics or chemogenetics, would greatly strengthen the findings. Optogenetics is used in Figure 1M, N but excitation of LC→SDH NA neuron terminals is tested instead of inhibition (to mimic ablation), and in naïve mice instead of stressed mice.</p>
<p>g) Alpha1Ars. The authors noted that &quot;Adra1a mRNA is also expressed in INs in the SDH&quot;.</p>
<p>h) The authors should comprehensively indicate what other cell types present in the spinal cord and neurons projecting to the spinal cord express alpha1Ars and what is the relative expression level of alpha1Ars in these different cell types.</p>
<p>i) The conditional KO of alpha1Ars specifically in Hes5+ astrocytes and not in other cell types expressing alpha1Ars should be quantified and validated (Figure 2H).</p>
<p>j) Depolarization of SDH inhibitory interneurons by NA (Figure 3). The authors' bath applied NA, which presumably activates all NA receptors present in the preparation.</p>
<p>k) The authors' model (Figure 4H) implies that NA released by LC→SDH NA neurons leads to the inhibition of SDH inhibitory interneurons by NA. In other experiments (Figure 1L, Figure 2A), the authors used optogenetics to promote the release of endogenous NA in SDH by LC→SDH NA neurons. This approach would investigate the function of NA endogenously released by LC NA neurons at presynaptic terminals in the SDH and at physiological concentrations and would test the model more convincingly compared to the bath application of NA.</p>
<p>l) As for other experiments, the proportion of Hes+ astrocytes that express hM3Dq, and the absence of expression in other cells, should be quantified and validated to interpret behavioral data.</p>
<p>m) Showing that the effect of CNO is dose-dependent would strengthen the authors' findings.</p>
<p>n) The proportion of SG neurons for which CNO bath application resulted in a reduction in recorded sIPSCs is not clear.</p>
<p>o) A1Rs. The specific expression of Cas9 and guide RNAs, and the specific KD of A1Rs, in inhibitory interneurons but not in other cell types expressing A1Rs should be quantified and validated.</p>
<p>(6) Methods:</p>
<p>It is unclear how fiber photometry is performed using &quot;optic cannula&quot; during restraint stress while mice are in a 50ml falcon tube (as shown in Figure 1A).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the role of spinal astrocytes in mediating stress-induced pain hypersensitivity, focusing on the LC (locus coeruleus)-to-SDH (spinal dorsal horn) circuit and its mechanisms. The authors aimed to delineate how LC activity contributes to spinal astrocytic activation under stress conditions, explore the role of noradrenaline (NA) signaling in this process, and identify the downstream astrocytic mechanisms that influence pain hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>The authors provide strong evidence that 1-hour restraint stress-induced pain hypersensitivity involves the LC-to-SDH circuit, where NA triggers astrocytic calcium activity via alpha1a adrenoceptors (alpha1aRs). Blockade of alpha1aRs on astrocytes - but not on Vgat-positive SDH neurons - reduced stress-induced pain hypersensitivity. These findings are rigorously supported by well-established behavioral models and advanced genetic techniques, uncovering the critical role of spinal astrocytes in modulating stress-induced pain.</p>
<p>However, the study's third aim - to establish a pathway from astrocyte alpha1aRs to adenosine-mediated inhibition of SDH-Vgat neurons - is less compelling. While pharmacological and behavioral evidence is intriguing, the ex vivo findings are indirect and lack a clear connection to the stress-induced pain model. Despite these limitations, the study advances our understanding of astrocyte-neuron interactions in stress-pain contexts and provides a strong foundation for future research into glial mechanisms in pain hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is built on a robust experimental design using a validated 1-hour restraint stress model, providing a reliable framework to investigate stress-induced pain hypersensitivity. The authors utilized advanced genetic tools, including retrograde AAVs, optogenetics, chemogenetics, and subpopulation-specific knockouts, allowing precise manipulation and interrogation of the LC-SDH circuit and astrocytic roles in pain modulation. Clear evidence demonstrates that NA triggers astrocytic calcium activity via alpha1aRs, and blocking these receptors effectively reduces stress-induced pain hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite its strengths, the study presents indirect evidence for the proposed NA-to-astrocyte(alpha1aRs)-to-adenosine-to-SDH-Vgat neurons pathway, as the link between astrocytic adenosine release and stress-induced pain remains unclear. The ex vivo experiments, including NA-induced depolarization of Vgat neurons and chemogenetic stimulation of astrocytes, are challenging to interpret in the stress context, with the high CNO concentration raising concerns about specificity. Additionally, the role of astrocyte-derived D-serine is tangential and lacks clarity regarding its effects on SDH Vgat neurons. The astrocyte calcium signal &quot;dip&quot; after LC optostimulation-induced elevation are presented without any interpretation.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>This is an exciting and timely study addressing the role of descending noradrenergic systems in nocifensive responses. While it is well-established that spinally released noradrenaline (aka norepinephrine) generally acts as an inhibitory factor in spinal sensory processing, this system is highly complex. Descending projections from the A6 (locus coeruleus, LC) and the A5 regions typically modulate spinal sensory processing and reduce pain behaviours, but certain subpopulations of LC neurons have been shown to mediate pronociceptive effects, such as those projecting to the prefrontal cortex (Hirshberg et al., PMID: 29027903).</p>
<p>The study proposes that descending cerulean noradrenergic neurons potentiate touch sensation via alpha-1 adrenoceptors on Hes5+ spinal astrocytes, contributing to mechanical hyperalgesia. This finding is consistent with prior work from the same group (dd et al., PMID:). However, caution is needed when generalising about LC projections, as the locus coeruleus is functionally diverse, with differences in targets, neurotransmitter co-release, and behavioural effects. Specifying the subpopulations of LC neurons involved would significantly enhance the impact and interpretability of the findings.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The study employs state-of-the-art molecular, genetic, and neurophysiological methods, including precise CRISPR and optogenetic targeting, to investigate the role of Hes5+ astrocytes. This approach is elegant and highlights the often-overlooked contribution of astrocytes in spinal sensory gating. The data convincingly support the role of Hes5+ astrocytes as regulators of touch sensation, coordinated by brain-derived noradrenaline in the spinal dorsal horn, opening new avenues for research into pain and touch modulation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the data support a model in which superficial dorsal horn (SDH) Hes5+ astrocytes act as non-neuronal gating cells for brain-derived noradrenergic (NA) signalling through their interaction with substantia gelatinosa inhibitory interneurons. Locally released adenosine from NA-stimulated Hes5+ astrocytes, following acute restraint stress, may suppress the function of SDH-Vgat+ inhibitory interneurons, resulting in mechanical pain hypersensitivity. However, the spatially restricted neuron-astrocyte communication underlying this mechanism requires further investigation in future studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) Specificity of the LC Pathway targeting</p>
<p>The main concern lies with how definitively the LC pathway was targeted. Were other descending noradrenergic nuclei, such as A5 or A7, also labelled in the experiments? The authors must convincingly demonstrate that the observed effects are mediated exclusively by LC noradrenergic terminals to substantiate their claims (i.e. &quot;we identified a circuit, the descending LC→SDH-NA neurons&quot;).</p>
<p>a) For instance, the direct vector injection into the LC likely results in unspecific effects due to the extreme heterogeneity of this nucleus and retrograde labelling of the A5 and A7 nuclei from the LC (i.e., Li et al., PMID: 26903420).</p>
<p>b) It is difficult to believe that the intersectional approach described in the study successfully targeted LC→SDH-NA neurons using AAVrg vectors. Previous studies (e.g., PMID: 34344259 or PMID: 36625030) demonstrated that similar strategies were ineffective for spinal-LC projections. The authors should provide detailed quantification of the efficiency of retrograde labelling and specificity of transgene expression in LC neurons projecting to the SDH.</p>
<p>c) Furthermore, it is striking that the authors observed a comparably strong phenotypical change in Figure 1K despite fewer neurons being labelled, compared to Figure 1H and 1N with substantially more neurons being targeted. Interestingly, the effect in Figure 1K appears more pronounced but shorter-lasting than in the comparable experiment shown in Figure 1H. This discrepancy requires further explanation.</p>
<p>d) A valuable addition would be staining for noradrenergic terminals in the spinal cord for the intersectional approach (Figure 1J), as done in Figures 1F/G. LC projections terminate preferentially in the SDH, whereas A5 projections terminate in the deep dorsal horn (DDH). Staining could clarify whether circuits beyond the LC are being ablated.</p>
<p>e) Furthermore, different LC neurons often mediate opposite physiological outcomes depending on their projection targets-for example, dorsal LC neurons projecting to the prefrontal cortex PFCx are pronociceptive, while ventral LC neurons projecting to the SC are antinociceptive (PMIDs: 29027903, 34344259, 36625030). Given this functional diversity, direct injection into the LC is likely to result in nonspecific effects.</p>
<p>Conclusion on Specificity: The authors are strongly encouraged to address these limitations directly, as they significantly affect the validity of the conclusions regarding the LC pathway. Providing more robust evidence, acknowledging experimental limitations, and incorporating complementary analyses would greatly strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) Discrepancies in Data</p>
<p>a) Figures 1B and 1E: The behavioural effect of stress on PWT (Figure 1E) persists for 120 minutes, whereas Ca²⁺ imaging changes (Figure 1B) are only observed in the first 20 minutes, with signal attenuation starting at 30 minutes. This discrepancy requires clarification, as it impacts the proposed mechanism.</p>
<p>b) Figure 4E: The effect is barely visible, and the tissue resembles &quot;Swiss cheese,&quot; suggesting poor staining quality. This is insufficient for such an important conclusion. Improved staining and/or complementary staining (e.g., cFOS) are needed. Additionally, no clear difference is observed between Stress+Ab stim. and Stress+Ab stim.+CPT, raising doubts about the robustness of the data.</p>
<p>c) Discrepancy with Existing Evidence: The claim regarding the pronociceptive effect of LC→SDH-NAergic signalling on mechanical hypersensitivity contrasts with findings by Kucharczyk et al. (PMID: 35245374), who reported no facilitation of spinal convergent (wide-dynamic range) neuron responses to tactile mechanical stimuli, but potent inhibition to noxious mechanical von Frey stimulation. This discrepancy suggests alternative mechanisms may be at play and raises the question of why noxious stimuli were not tested.</p>
<p>(3) Sole reliance on Von Frey testing</p>
<p>The exclusive use of von Frey as a behavioural readout for mechanical sensitisation is a significant limitation. This assay is highly variable, and without additional supporting measures, the conclusions lack robustness. Incorporating other behavioural measures, such as the adhesive tape removal test to evaluate tactile discomfort, the needle floor walk corridor to assess sensitivity to uneven or noxious surfaces, or the kinetic weight-bearing test to measure changes in limb loading during movement, could provide complementary insights. Physiological tests, such as the Randall-Selitto test for noxious pressure thresholds or CatWalk gait analysis to evaluate changes in weight distribution and gait dynamics, would further strengthen the findings and allow for a more comprehensive assessment of mechanical sensitisation.</p>
<p>Overall Conclusion</p>
<p>This study addresses an important and complex topic with innovative methods and compelling data. However, the conclusions rely on several assumptions that require more robust evidence. Specificity of the LC pathway, experimental discrepancies, and methodological limitations (e.g., sole reliance on von Frey) must be addressed to substantiate the claims. With these issues resolved, this work could significantly advance our understanding of astrocytic and noradrenergic contributions to pain modulation.</p>
