<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The vast majority of bacteria live in sessile biofilms that colonize the channels, pores and crevices of confined structures. Flow in these structures carries the nutrients necessary for growth, but also generates stresses and detachment from surfaces. Conversely, bacteria tend to occupy a large part of the available space and, in so doing, increase resistance to flow and modify transport properties. Although the importance of advective transport and hydrodynamic forces on bacteria is well known, the complex feedback effects that control development in confined geome-tries are much less understood. Here, we study how couplings between flow and bacterial development control the spatio-temporal dynamics of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in microchannel flows. We demonstrate that nutrient limitation drives the longitudinal distribution of biomass, while a competition between growth and flow-induced detachment controls the maximum clogging and the temporal dynamics. We find that successive cycles of sloughing and growth cause persistent fluctuations of the hydraulic resistance and prevent the system from ever reaching a true steady-state. Our results indicate that these self-sustained fluctuations are a signature effect of biofilm development in confined flows and could thus be a key component of the spreading of biofilms in infections, environmental processes and engineering applications. Consistent with the description of other bursting events, such as earthquakes or avalanches, we further show that the dynamics of sloughing can be described as a jump stochastic process with a gamma distribution of interevent times. This stochastic modeling approach opens the way towards a new quantitative approach to the characterization of the apparent randomness and irreproducibility of biofilm experiments in such systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fluid flow and transport phenomena control many aspects of the life of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Krsmanovic et al., 2021</xref>), from the motility of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Busscher and van der Mei, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rodesney et al., 2017</xref>) to the morphology of biofilm colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), and even ecological interactions within populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Battin et al., 2016</xref>). As a testimony to the importance of flow, bacteria have evolved specific strategies adapted to their mechanical environment and the rheology of fluids around them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dufrêne and Persat, 2020</xref>). Bacteria have also evolved mechanisms to detect gradients of nutrients or toxic substances and adapt their movement accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sampedro et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies further suggest that bacteria have mechanosensing and rheosensing capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dufrêne and Persat, 2020</xref>). For example, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> has been found to regulate the <italic>fro</italic> operon in response to the shear rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sanfilippo et al., 2019</xref>). Shear also modifies the intracellular levels of cyclic-di-GMP in cells of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> attached to a surface, initiating a sessile phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rodesney et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Even in dense surface-associated colonies known as biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Costerton et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Flemming et al., 2016</xref>), where cells are partially isolated from the fluid by a matrix of self-produced extracellular polymeric substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Flemming and Wingender, 2010</xref>), flow still plays a fundamental role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Thomen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Rusconi et al., 2011</xref>). The flow of a viscous fluid around the matrix generates forces that can induce detachment or remodel the biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Besemer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Stoodley et al., 1998</xref>) – the matrix essentially behaves as a viscoelastic material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Peterson et al., 2015</xref>) and thus can flow in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gloag et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, key solutes, such as oxygen or nutrients, are transported in the fluid before they can diffuse in the biofilm and be consumed. This can lead to complex couplings between advective transport by flow, diffusion in the fluid and in the biofilm, and uptake by the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Taherzadeh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Picioreanu et al., 2000</xref>). It has also been recently demonstrated that flow can generate spatial heterogeneities in the activation of quorumsensing within populations, as a result of autoinducers being washed away by flow in zones at high Péclet number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Emge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mukherjee and Bassler, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>A vast majority of bacteria live in biofilms that colonize confined geometries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Conrad and Poling-Skutvik, 2018</xref>). In such systems, biofilms can occupy a large portion of the available space and thus severely restrict flow. This tends to generate a two-way coupling between biofilm growth and transport phenomena whereby flow and transport mediate the development of the biofilm, but in return the development of the biofilm also modifies flow and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rittmann, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Taylor and Jaffé, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Taylor et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Taylor and Jaffé, 1990b</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Vandevivere and Baveye, 1992b</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Stewart and Fogler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Telgmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Drescher et al., 2013</xref>). In porous media, for instance, <bold><italic>Kurz et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2022</italic></bold>) showed that a <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> biofilm can clog a large part of the pore space, leaving only few preferential flow channels where a competition between shear-induced detachment and growth drives intermittency and spontaneous pressure fluctuations. Such bioclogging is an important component of systems as diverse as bioreactors in the food industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Verran, 2002</xref>), biofilters for wastewater processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aslam et al., 2018</xref>), pipe flow for water distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cowle et al., 2014</xref>), heat exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">García and Trueba, 2020</xref>), catheters used in medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bixler and Bhushan, 2012</xref>), soil bioremediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Singh et al., 2006</xref>), enhanced oil recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kryachko, 2018</xref>) or biobarriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lennox and Ashe, 2009</xref>). Understanding the fundamentals of biofilm growth and feedback mechanisms with flow is therefore a crucial step towards developing better approaches in health and engineering.</p>
<p>Here, we investigate the role of couplings between nutrient transport, growth and detachment on biofilm development in microchannel flows. To do so, we developed a microfluidic setup generating a constant flow rate in a microchannel where a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 GFP biofilm develops. This microfluidic system is further combined with timelapse microscopy, cellular microbiology and mathematical modeling to study the interactions between biofilm and flow, in particular the dynamics and spatio-temporal fluctuations.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Our experimental approach is summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. We inoculated cells of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 GFP in a microchannel and then continuously flowed a culture medium at constant flow rate to observe biofilm development. In what follows, we first study the effects of nutrient limitation on the spatial distribution of biofilm. We then focus on regimes where nutrients are in excess and biofilm development is primarily driven by the interactions with flow to detail the role of flowinduced detachment on the maximum clogging reachable and the temporal dynamics.</p>

<title>Nutrient limitation controls the longitudinal distribution of the biofilm</title>
<p>To assess the impact of nutrient limitation, we performed experiments at flow rates over several orders of magnitude (<italic>Q</italic> = 2 × 10<sup>−2</sup>, 2 × 10<sup>−1</sup>, 2 × 10<sup>0</sup>, and 2 × 10<sup>+1</sup><italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic>) and therefore different total fluxes of nutrients. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref> shows the time-integrated distributions of the GFP fluorescence in the longitudinal direction for the different flow rates. We found that the active biomass expressing GFP is relatively uniform for flow rates between 0.2 and 20<italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> – the sharp decrease on the left-hand side at the outlet corresponds to the effect of the UVCs. For 0.02 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic>, however, we observed a maximum value of the fluorescence intensity at the inlet on the right-hand side and a distinct decrease when moving towards the outlet.</p>

<caption><p>Impact of nutrient limitation on the longitudinal distribution of biofilm. (a): Fluorescence intensity integrated for 72 hours for the flow rates <italic>Q</italic> = 0.02 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic>, 0.2 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic>, 2 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> and 20 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> with 1× concentrated brain heart infusion (BHI) culture medium, along with <italic>Q</italic> = 0.02 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> with either 0.2×BHI or 1×BHI supplemented with 8 <italic>g</italic>/<italic>L</italic> glucose. Nutrient limitation is observed only for <italic>Q</italic> = 0.02 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> and is strongly dependent upon the concentration of BHI components. (b): Simulations for <italic>Q</italic> = 0.02 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> for two values of <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>max</sub> and the corresponding Damköhler numbers. The Damköhler numbers for the case with 0.2×BHI were simply obtained by multiplying those for the case 1×BHI by a factor 5. Each experimental curve in (a) and (b) is averaged over 3 replicates. In the model, we considered that the fluorescence signal is proportional to the product of biomass and concentration. We then integrated this signal in time and normalized it with the maximum value as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="597893v1_inline37.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p></caption>

<p>Considering that the growth of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 GFP is aerobic here <italic>– P. aeruginosa</italic> is a facultative anaerobe and can perform denitrification in anaerobic environments by anoxic respiration using nitrogenated compounds as final electron acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arat et al., 2015</xref>) but this produces less energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bartberger et al., 2002</xref>) – we hypothesized that this heterogeneity in biofilm development along the channel stems from a limitation of solute species required for growth, either oxygen or one of the nutrients in the growth medium. For the largest flow rates, advective transport through the channel should be fast compared to consumption, so that even bacteria at the outlet receive sufficient levels of nutrients and oxygen for biofilm development. For the lowest flow rate, however, one of the components introduced at the inlet is rapidly consumed by bacteria and becomes limiting, so that growth decreases with the distance from the inlet.</p>
<p>To better understand this limitation, we repeated experiments at 0.02 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> either with BHI diluted 5 times or by supplementing 1×BHI with additional glucose. Results in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref> with the glucose supplementation show a similar longitudinal distribution of biofilm compared to assays without glucose, thus suggesting that this carbon source is not the limiting nutrient – it was confirmed by mass spectrometry that only a small fraction of the glucose was consumed. Results with the five times diluted BHI, however, show a much narrower window of biofilm growth, therefore suggesting that one of the components in the BHI is becoming limiting. Although oxygen probably features gradients within the biofilm (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Folsom et al., 2010</xref>) and in the longitudinal direction, the inlet concentration of oxygen is identical for the two cases 1×BHI and 0.2×BHI, therefore indicating that oxygen is not the primary component limiting growth. Another factor that may further alleviate oxygen limitations is that PDMS is highly permeable to oxygen, so that there are in fact two sources of oxygen in our system: dissolved oxygen in the culture medium and oxygen coming from/through the PDMS.</p>
<p>To explore these different hypotheses and quantify the characteristic times of reactive transport, we simulated the development of the biofilm inside the channels, taking into account the couplings between biofilm growth and nutrient transport. The limiting nutrient is treated as a solute being transported by advection/diffusion and consumed by bacteria. We considered that mass transport is much faster than bacterial growth and division, so that the problem is quasi-steady for solute transport (<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">Picioreanu et al., 2000</xref>). The limiting nutrient was thus modeled as</p>

Such approaches, however, were initially developed for flows in reactor systems where shear stress is dominant (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Duddu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">Rittman, 1982</xref>) and neglect the contribution of the pressure stress to detachment <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Characklis et al. (1982</xref>), for instance, measured the rate of biofilm loss under different shear stresses generated by rotating the inner annulus of reactor at different speeds and found a linear relationship between biofilm loss rate and rotational speed. Upon clogging the microchannel, we expect the pressure difference to generate a significant force on the biofilm and to play an important role on detachment. We could have introduced a multi-modal form of detachment, with contributions from both the shear stress at the biofilm/fluid interface, scaling as (1 − <italic>ϕ</italic>)<sup>−3/4</sup>, and the tangential component of the total stress at the biofilm/solid interface, scaling as (1 − <italic>ϕ</italic>)<sup>−1</sup>. For simplicity, however, we consider a contribution of detachment scaling as (1 − <italic>ϕ</italic>)<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>Assuming that ℳ ∈ ]0, 1], the model for the biomass can be written in a simpler form as
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="597893v1_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
with <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>max</sub> the maximum volume fraction of biofilm, defined as ℳ = 1 − <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>max</sub>, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>max</sub> ∈ [0, 1[ and <italic>ϕ</italic> ∈ [0, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>max</sub>]. The only non-trivial steady-state,
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="597893v1_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
reflects an equilibrium between the amount of biomass created and the amount of biomass detached. The trivial steady-state <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>equ</sub> = 0 is stable when detachment exceeds growth, i.e. when <italic>C</italic><sup>⋆</sup> is lower than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="597893v1_inline11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. In assuming that ℳ ∈ ]0, 1] and eliminating cases where ℳ &gt; 1, we have not considered situations of systematic detachment <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>equ</sub> = 0 for any value of the concentration, since this is not a situation that we encountered experimentally.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2(b)</xref> compares results of the model with those of the experimental fluorescence for the flow rate 0.02 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> and <bold><italic>K</italic></bold><sup>⋆</sup> = 0.1. To roughly assess the sensitivity of our simulation to uncertainties in the value of <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>max</sub>, we further considered two extreme values, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>max</sub> <italic>≃</italic> 0.6 and <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>max</sub> <italic>≃</italic> 0.9. The model shows good agreement with experiments for <italic>Da</italic><sub>BHI×1</sub> <italic>≃</italic> 1200 in the case <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>max</sub> <italic>≃</italic> 0.6 and <italic>Da</italic><sub>BHI×1</sub> <italic>≃</italic> 800 in the case <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>max</sub> <italic>≃</italic> 0.9. The corresponding characteristic reaction time for nutrient uptake, <italic>τ</italic><sub>reac</sub> = <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub>/<italic>α</italic>, ranges from <italic>≃</italic> 83<italic>s</italic> to <italic>≃</italic> 125<italic>s</italic>. We further obtain an excellent correspondence between the model and the experimental data for the 5 times dilution of the BHI without any fitting, simply by multiplying the Damköhler number by a factor 5 – recall that, by definition, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="597893v1_inline12.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> with <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub> the inlet concentration so that dividing <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub> by 5 implies multiplying the Damköhler number by a factor 5. The fact that the behavior of the system with 5 times dilution of the BHI can be obtained without any fitting confirms that the primary limitation is indeed one of the components of the BHI, not oxygen.</p>
<p>With these estimations of characteristic times for uptake, we can also evaluate whether any form of radial limitation of nutrient is expected by comparing times for transverse diffusion and uptake. The characteristic time for diffusion in the radial direction is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="597893v1_inline13.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> with <italic>h ≃</italic> 50 <italic>μm</italic> a characteristic length for the distance between the flow channel and the wall. Considering again a diffusion coefficient in the biofilm <italic>D</italic> = 10<sup>−9</sup><italic>m</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>s</italic> for the limiting nutrient, we have <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="597893v1_inline14.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Diffusive transport across the channel is therefore significantly faster than uptake, implying that there is no form of limitation in the transverse direction. In the spirit of the dimensional analysis performed for longitudinal transport, this can also be formalized as a radial Damköhler number,<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="597893v1_inline15.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>The complete picture for nutrient transport is therefore as follows. In the longitudinal direction, the distribution of biomass is driven by a competition between advective transport and reaction. This can be quantified using the ratio of the Péclet and Damköhler numbers, <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>/<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>. When advective transport is faster than uptake, <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>/<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> &gt; 1, the distribution of the biofilm is uniform. On the other hand, when <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>/<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> &lt; 1, uptake is faster than advective transport so that growth is nutrient limited. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the values of <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>/<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> for the different cases and shows that the regime <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>/<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> &lt; 1 is reached only for the flow rate 0.02 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic>. In the transverse direction, there is no nutrient limitation and the amount of biomass is determined by an equilibrium between growth and flow-induced detachment. The details of this mechanisms, and its impact on the temporal dynamics, is the core of the following sections.</p>

<title>Hydrodynamic stresses affect all stages of development</title>
<p>We now focus on the flow rates <italic>Q</italic> = 0.2, 2 and 20 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> that featured no strong nutrient limitation and thus allowed us to separate the effects of molecular transport from that of hydrodynamic stresses. We describe the temporal dynamics through two classes of measurements: the time evolution of the pressure and timelapse microscopy imaging. The evolution of the pressure was monitored in the inlet reservoir, while imposing a constant flow rate. From this measurement, we reconstructed the evolution in time of the hydraulic resistance of the zone of interest in the channel, ℛ (<italic>t</italic>), where biofilm developed (see Material and Methods). This allowed us to determine the dynamics of the ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="597893v1_inline16.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, with ℛ<sub>0</sub> the hydraulic resistance of the empty channel, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> (see also supplementary information figures S5, S8 and S11) and to analyze the different stages in the colonization of the channel. Combined with a model for the distribution of biofilm in the cross-section of the channel – we treated the biofilm as a uniform layer – it was used to indirectly evaluate a mean volume fraction of biofilm, <italic>ϕ</italic>. We further visualized directly the channel using timelapse microscopy with differential interference contrast, bright field and fluorescence imaging.</p>

<p>We found that biofilm development occurs in different phases, in a way that is consistent across flow rates. We propose to decompose the dynamics in two main components: Stage I that corresponds to the initial adhesion, growth and saturation; and stage II that features large fluctuations in the amount of biomass in the channel. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3(a)</xref> illustrates our decomposition in two stages on the temporal evolution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="597893v1_inline17.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> in the case <italic>Q</italic> = 0.2 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic>.

<title>Early stage I is driven by surface adhesion, motility, division and colony formation</title>
<p>Our inoculation process results in the sparse attachment of individual bacterial cells on the boundaries of the channel. On the glass slide, we evaluated the initial density to be about 38800 cells per <italic>mm</italic><sup>2</sup>. Growth of adhered cells started straight away upon flowing the culture medium, with little to no lag time. The apparent macroscopic lag, as visible in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, does not stem from a lag at the cellular level, but rather from the sensitivity of the pressure measurements. The relative hydraulic resistance, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="597893v1_inline18.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, can be linearized as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="597893v1_inline19.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> when <italic>ϕ ≪</italic> 1. The evolution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="597893v1_inline20.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> with <italic>ϕ</italic> is thus affine at the beginning of the experiment, with small changes in the hydraulic conductivity that could not be detected in our experimental system. This generates some amount of noise in the early signal, that tends to decrease when increasing flow rate.</p>
<p>To characterize the growth time at the cellular level, we calculated an apparent doubling time at the cellular level from microscopy images of cells attached to the glass slide in the very early stage (from 0 to 3.5 hours, see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). We first segmented images from differential interference contrast microscopy to identify individual bacteria on the surface and then fitted linearly the log of the number of cells as a function of time. Calculated doubling times were measured as about 198, 95 and 117 minutes on average for, respectively, <italic>Q</italic> = 0.2 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic>, 2 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> and 20 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic>. As a reference, the doubling time in liquid culture was measured as about 110 minutes (standard deviation of ~ 10 minutes). Although understanding exactly what generates this dependence of the doubling time upon the flow rate is beyond the scope of this paper, it is worth noting that nutrient limitation is not likely to play a role, as we have previously validated the fact that there is no limitation for <italic>Q</italic> ≥ 0.2 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic>, even when biofilm has formed. Mechano-and rheo-sensing could be involved, with bacteria directly regulating their response to perceived shear stress or rate (<xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">Sanfilippo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">Rodesney et al., 2017</xref>), as well as heterogeneities in the rate of division – for instance between motile and adhered cells (<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">Rossy et al., 2019</xref>) – or in the attachment/detachment dynamics.</p>

<p>After this initial phase, colonies expand and produce large quantities of EPS that yield a much sharper increase of the hydraulic resistance.

<title>Late Stage I reflects an equilibrium between growth and detachment</title>
<p>We observe an inflection of the signal in late Stage I in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>. This inflection corresponds to the end of the rapid growth phase, with flow-induced detachment progressively increasing, until detachment equilibrates with growth. To further understand this effect, let us consider the mass balance of biofilm in the zone of interest in the channel. The inlet flux of bacteria is zero, since our UVC system prevents growth outside the zone of interest. The source of biomass therefore only results from the uptake of nutrients, division of bacterial cells and EPS production. The sink of biomass is due to flow-induced removal, which includes parts of the biofilm that are displaced out of the zone of interest through the flow/remodelling of the biofilm at the outlet, and parts that are washed away by erosion and seeding (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Krsmanovic et al., 2021</xref>).

<title>Stage II features sloughing-induced jump events followed by re-growth</title>
<p>After growth and detachment start to equilibrate at the end of Stage I, sloughing events become particularly important.

<p>To better visualize the spatio-temporal dynamics and connect the different observations for the pressure and microscopy, we plotted kymographs in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> (see also SI figures S7, S10 and S13), showing both variations in time and in space, along with the corresponding hydraulic resistance signal. These graphics show clearly the correlation between the pressure signal on the right-hand side and the detachment events on the kymographs. We can readily identify that large drops in pressure correspond to large events with detachment over almost the entire length of the microchannel. We also visualize a range of detachment events corresponding to various sizes of biofilm being detached, along the rapid increase of resistance and biomass following each sloughing event.</p>
<p>Each sloughing event is followed by a rapid growth phase resembling late Stage I, leading to a cycle of successive sloughing and re-growth. In each re-growth phase, we observe a sigmoid-like shape of the hydraulic resistance signal that is similar to Stage I. As in Stage I, the maximum stems from an equilibrium between growth and detachment. <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>max</sub> thus corresponds to a critical value of the stress, <italic>σ</italic><sub>crit</sub>, that generates enough detachment to compensate growth.

We found that the volume fraction of biofilm was significantly lower for both mutants and that the Psl mutant was more strongly affected than the Pel mutant. The Psl mutant only weakly attached to the surface and was more prone to detachment – an observation that is consistent with the prominent role of Psl in the mechanics of PAO1 biofilms (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Colvin et al., 2011</xref>).

<title>Sloughing can be understood as a stochastic process</title>
<p>The model presented so far can describe Stage I and the signal in between two sloughing events, but not the catastrophic jumps associated with sloughing. To characterize the latter, we first performed a frequency analysis of the signal, as shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9a</xref>. This approach did not prove very informative as it essentially shows a power spectrum typical of noise, with a slope roughly smaller than −2. This result, however, motivated the construction of a more physical representation of the process. The basis of this representation is the observation that fluctuations have a very specific signature on the hydraulic resistance: they first feature a sharp decrease due to sudden sloughing, followed by a slower increase due to growth. Since growth and smooth biofilm detachment are already described in the model, this observation suggests that we only need to capture the sudden sloughing to improve the description. The model takes the form of the following stochastic differential equation,</p>

<title>Regimes of nutrients and oxygen transport</title>
<p>Our experimental setup, which implements a novel UVC strategy to confine biofilm development within a specific zone in the channels, allowed us to finely control boundary conditions and study the role of molecular transport on biofilm development. Our results suggest that, in confined channels, the longitudinal distribution of biofilm ensues from a competition between advective transport of solutes along the channel and uptake by the cells. Modeling molecular transport as an advection-diffusion-reaction equation, this effect can be quantified using the ratio of longitudinal Péclet and Damköhler numbers, <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>/<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>, which compares advection to reaction. When <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><italic>e</italic>/<italic>Da</italic> &lt; 1, biofilm growth is nutrient-limited and localized close to the inlet. When <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>/<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> &gt; 1, biofilm development is close to homogeneous. In the radial direction, the limitation can be characterized in a similar way via a radial Damköhler number, <italic>Da</italic><sub>radial</sub>, defined as the ratio of reaction and radial diffusion. In our experiments, we always had <italic>Da</italic><sub>radial</sub> &lt; 1 with only weak gradients and no radial limitation.</p>
<p>Although the competition between advective/diffusive transport and uptake is a universal feature of biofilm development in flow, the solute that becomes limiting depends on the details of the setup. In our experiments, we found that nutrients were restricting growth, while other works in microchannel flows, such as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Thomen et al., 2017</xref>), found that the effect of oxygen was dominant. Several factors play an important role here, including the composition of the growth medium, the catabolism of the microorganisms, the kinetics or even the resilience of bacteria to low oxygen concentration. For instance, <xref rid="c82" ref-type="bibr">Thomen et al. (2017</xref>) focused on an <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 derivative. <italic>E. coli</italic> can respond strongly to micro-aerobiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Colón-González et al., 2004</xref>), whereas <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is known to be more resilient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sabra et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alvarez-Ortega and Harwood, 2007</xref>). Factors that affect transport characteristic times, such as the flow velocity or the dimensions of the channels, also modify the competition with uptake. The length of the channel modulates the time for advective transport along the channel and therefore the ratio <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>/<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>. The width and height control the characteristic time for radial diffusion. In <xref rid="c82" ref-type="bibr">Thomen et al. (2017</xref>), for instance, the width of the channel is 1000 <italic>μm</italic> so that diffusion takes about 100 times longer and <italic>Da</italic><sub>radial</sub> is 100 times larger than for 100 <italic>μm</italic> channels.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Temporal dynamics and hydrodynamic stresses</title>
<p>With these regimes clearly identified for molecular transport, we could then study the effect of hydrodynamic stresses on biofilm development and, in particular, the role of flow-induced detachment on the spatio-temporal dynamics. We suppressed any form of nutrient limitation, either radial or longitudinal, by focusing on flow rates ≥ 0.2 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> with <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>/<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> &gt; 1 and <italic>Da</italic><sub>radial</sub> &lt; 1. In so doing, we found that the time response featured two distinct stages: the hydraulic resistance first followed a relatively standard sigmoid-like pattern (Stage I), but then switched to a different regime with large self-sustained fluctuations (Stage II). As discussed in what follows, we argue that this Stage II is a signature effect of biofilm development in confined flow.</p>
<p>Stage I began just after initial inoculation, as soon as the culture medium started flowing in the microchannel. Early Stage I was dominated by cell adhesion, division, surface motility and microcolony formation. The average velocity in the channel at 0.2 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> is above 300 <italic>μm</italic>/<italic>s</italic> so bulk motility is likely not playing an important role when <italic>Q</italic> ≥ 0.2 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rossy et al., 2019</xref>). Contrary to <xref rid="c82" ref-type="bibr">Thomen et al. (2017</xref>) – where no direct initiation of the biofilm of <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm was possible above a shear stress of 10 <italic>m</italic><bold><italic>P</italic></bold> <italic>a</italic> – our results show that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 strongly adhered to the surface and could initiate biofilm formation for all shear stresses. We even observed that the apparent doubling time within the first few hours of growth was the smallest in the case at 2 <bold><italic>P</italic></bold> <italic>a</italic>. Stage I then evolved towards the standard steps of biofilm formation for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rasamiravaka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Krsmanovic et al., 2021</xref>), with clonal microcolonies that extended, joined together and grew into mature biofilms. The exponential growth and EPS production yielded a sharp increase of the hydraulic resistance by several orders of magnitude, which is consistent with previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Cunningham et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Desmond et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Stage II was characterized by large fluctuations in the hydraulic resistance and in the quantity of biomass in the channel. We showed that these fluctuations are the result of successive cycles of growth and sloughing events: parts of the biofilm get detached by the flow upon reaching a critical stress, generating sharp discrete-like events of detachment, followed by a fast re-growth of the biofilm. In both late Stage I and in Stage II, pressure-induced stresses play a crucial role. Most works have focused on shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Krsmanovic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kurz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Telgmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Paul et al., 2012</xref>) because, in many situations, such as biofilm development in large reactors, the effect of pressure can be neglected. However, this is not the case in confined systems, where biofilm can clog a large proportion of the flow channels and the pressure build-up induced by clogging can generate an important force on the biofilm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Maximum clogging</title>
<p>One aspect that stands out in our experiments, because of its physical meaning and reproducibility across replicates, is the concept of maximum clogging. In Stage I and after each sloughing in Stage II, curves for the hydraulic resistance had a sigmoid-like shape, with an inflection that was a signature of a competition between growth and smooth detachment due to erosion, seeding and biofilm flow outside the zone of interest. We found that the maximum value of the hydraulic resistance across the entire experiment scales with the inverse of the flow rate, which is consistent with the modeling hypothesis that smooth detachment scales with the square root of the hydrodynamic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rittman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Duddu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Coyte et al., 2017</xref>). This concept of maximum clogging can also be expressed as a critical value of the hydrodynamic stress generating enough detachment to compensate growth. In our framework, this equilibrium stress was in the order of 100-200 Pascals for the wild type and did not vary significantly with the flow rate.</p>
<p>To further understand the role of the EPS matrix composition on maximum clogging, we studied the behavior of Δpsl and Δpel mutants. Pel and Psl are the two main exopolysacharides produced by nonmucoid strains of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. For both mutants, the maximum amount of biofilm in the microchannel was lower than for the wild type, thus indicating that these mutants were more easily detached by the flow. We also found that Psl had a stronger impact than Pel on the spatiotemporal dynamics and, in particular, on maximum clogging. The Δpsl mutant featured major sloughing events for 2 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic> that led to a near-complete removal of the biofilm. For 20 <italic>μL</italic>/<italic>min</italic>, we observed a complete removal. On the other hand, Pel featured a dynamics similar to that of the wild type, but with a reduced maximum clogging.</p>
<p>Although critical stresses are widely used in characterizing flow-induced detachment of biofilms, they have a broad range of different meanings and values. Critical stresses have been used to characterize a form of complete detachment from the solid surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Ohashi and Harada (1996</xref>) described an adhesion strength as the stress required to remove the biofilm – upon conceptualizing the problem as a surface to surface bonding, the adhesive strength has also be defined as the work required to detach the biofilm from the surface per surface area (in Joule per <italic>m</italic><sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 1998</xref>). <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Ohashi and Harada (1996</xref>) found values for the shear strength in the hundreds of Pascals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lau et al. (2009)</xref> measured an adhesive pressure – adhesive force measured by microbead force spectroscopy divided by contact area – for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 that was in the tens of Pascals. <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Körstgens et al. (2001</xref>) studied the yield strength of a mucoid <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain, discussing its role in the mechanical failure of the biofilm. Considering the biofilm as a viscoelastic gel with plastic flow properties, they found a stress at failure close to 1000 <bold><italic>P</italic></bold> <italic>a</italic>. <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2023</xref>) show that bio-aggregates of <italic>E. coli</italic> at pore throats become fluidized above a critical value of the shear stress with a yield point at roughly 1.8 <bold><italic>P</italic></bold> <italic>a</italic>.</p>
<p>To establish a clear link between these values, our critical stress at 100-200 Pascals and the observed dynamics of sloughing in Stage II, future works will need to further refine our understanding of the role of the different variables on flow-induced detachment, including distributions of stresses within biofilms, adhesive strength to surfaces, mechanical properties of the biofilm, and biological regulation through e.g. quorum sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Emerenini et al., 21 juil. 2015</xref>) and/or rhamnolipids production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boles et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Self-sustained fluctuations</title>
<p>Large fluctuations of the hydraulic resistance, similar to that observed in our Stage II, were previously reported in a few works on porous media flows. <bold><italic>Howell and Atkinson</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>1976</italic></bold>) showed that, in trickling filters, constant influent concentration and operating conditions can yield large fluctuations induced by sloughing events. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stewart and Scott Fogler (2002)</xref> found very large oscillations in the pressure signal due to the formation of successive stable or unstable dextran plugs of <italic>Leuconostoc mesenteroides</italic> biofilm, behaving in a way similar to a yield stress fluid, and allowing flow only through breakthrough channels – see also discussions on the flow of yield stress fluids through porous media in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Talon, 2022</xref>). <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">Sharp et al. (2005</xref>) showed that “the pore channels are dynamic, changing in sized, number and location with time” in a flat plate reactor colonized by <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic> biofilm. <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Kurz et al. (2022</xref>) found successive cycles of growth and shear-induced detachment in the preferential flow paths for <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> biofilm development in a microfluidic system with cylindrical obstacles. <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Bottero et al. (2013</xref>) modeled the coupled effects of flow, clogging and detachment to study the mechanisms that control these self-sustained fluctuations, in particular what leads to the clogging of a preferential flow path and the unclogging of another one – contrary to the development of stable flow paths.</p>
<p>Although there are similarities with our observations, porous media have an inherent degree of complexity in the geometry that, combined with the nonlinear response of biofilms, can lead to a range of complex mechanisms. For instance, some of the works above-mentioned identified changes in the flow paths associated with the fluctuations. Our work shows that, even in a single channel with continuous flow, these fluctuations occur and prevent the system from reaching a true steady-state. This observations leads us to propose that the self-sustained fluctuations observed in Stage II are a signature of biofilm development in confined flows and may occur in the simplest geometries. The underlying idea is that the strong bioclogging in confined geometries generates a pressure build-up that is the main cause of sloughing. Once a large part of the biofilm gets detached, the pressure decreases and the biofilm can re-grow to get a new cycle started. Our work therefore highlights the ubiquity of these fluctuations, which are likely to play a key role in the development and spreading of biofilms in a range of different systems, such as clogging in pipes, catheters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Stickler, 2014</xref>) or stents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Guaglianone et al., 2010</xref>), with applications ranging from infections, to environmental processes and engineering systems.</p>

<sec id="s3e">
<title>Stochastic modeling</title>
<p>Our approach to modeling was constructed in two main parts. We first proposed differential equations to describe nutrient transport coupled with the dynamics of biofilm development in the channel, including growth and smooth detachment. The sharp jumps corresponding to sloughing were then added to this first layer of the model as a jump stochastic process. Although it seems quite natural to characterize the statistics of detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>), there are actually very few attempts to treat such problems in the framework of stochastic processes. <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">Howell and Atkinson (1976</xref>) modeled sloughing in trickling filters through a conceptualization as connected filter units describing the discrete pieces of packing material in the filter. They introduced randomness by permitting sloughing at multiples of a fixed time interval. <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Bohn et al. (2007</xref>) used an approach combining a logistic growth with random sloughing events through a stochastic differential equation. They described sloughing via a discrete expression of the amplitude of jumps occurring independently at each time step, which allowed them do describe daily fluctuations in light absorbance data for phototrophic biofilms development in a flow-lane incubator. In our approach, the jump process was characterized by two random variables: the interevent time between two successive jumps and the relative amplitudes of the jumps. Through the analysis of experimental data, we reconstructed the probability density functions for these random variables, with respectively Gamma and log-normal distributions.</p>
<p>There have been previous discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lewandowski et al., 2004</xref>) on the determinism of biofilm formation, suggesting that sloughing events are intrinsically random events that generate large fluctuations, prevent the system from reaching a steady state and hinder the reproducibility of longterm experiments. Our work confirms that sloughing is integral to biofilm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Telgmann et al., 2004</xref>) in confined flows but shows that, although a true steady state is never reached, the fluctuations can be precisely characterized using stochastic modeling. This approach paves a way forward in terms of reproducibility: even though the state of the biofilm at any given time may not be reproducible, the randomness of the process may very well be.</p>
<p>Our approach to characterizing bursting events in terms of the distribution of the amplitude and interevent time is reminiscent of the description of other physical systems, such as avalanches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Maaß et al., 2015</xref>). For earthquakes, for example, a Gamma distribution for interevent times has been found in many different geographic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Corral, 2004</xref>). The fact that interevent times for biofilm sloughing also seem to follow a Gamma distribution may point towards specific physical mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>), which could be used in future works to better understand the physics of sloughing. One interesting perspective of this work is also to assess the universality of these distributions across microorganisms and whether we could define classes of bacteria with specific signatures on the stochastic process. With the same idea, we could further evaluate the impact of ecological interactions in multispecies biofilm or the effect of various molecules, such as biocides, on the sloughing dynamics.</p>

The system consists of a 3D printed part called the guide carrying in its backside a PCB with a LED light source that delivers UV-C light of 1W power. The light beam follows a straight trajectory until a 45° mirror positioned in the front side of the guide, which reflects the light parallel to the PDMS chip and irradiate it. UVC guides were positioned in both sides of the PDMS microchannel and separated by a 1.2 cm distance to keep a central area unexposed. UVC power is measured by a radiometer after mirror reflection and delivers a power of 200 <italic>mW</italic> /<italic>m</italic><sup>2</sup>equivalent to 2 <italic>mJ</italic> /<italic>cm</italic><sup>2</sup>. The guide is elevated to fit with the PDMS chip dimensions and contains a barrier located in the front side that blocks the diffusion of light through the PDMS polymer in the horizontal direction.</p>

<title>Image analysis for the biofilm distribution in the longitudinal direction</title>
<p>Fluorescence images were loaded as a matrix (30086 x 154) in MATLAB (MathWorks). For each time acquisition, the signal was first integrated in the radial direction to obtain a mean distribution in the longitudinal direction. In plotting curves to analyze the effect of nutrients, all timepoints were then averaged to obtain one dimensional curves of the mean longitudinal profile. For kymographs, one dimensional curves for each time point were stacked together to describe the spatio-temporal dynamics. The intensity values were normalized to the maximum values of each replicate over all times. For each flow and nutrient condition, three biological replicates were performed.</p>

<title>Image analysis for the biofilm segmentation</title>
<p>To estimate changes in channel colonization, GFP images were binarized using a machine learning software (Ilastik) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berg et al., 2019</xref>). Images were pre-treated with imageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) by normalizing all pixel values between 0 and 65535 grayscale levels. In Ilastik, biofilm structures were first differentiated from the empty flow path using pixel-level manual labeling during pixel classification where visible patches of biofilm and empty channel were annotated manually by mouse cursor. Pixel classification workflow employs a Random Forest classifier, known for its generalization properties. Several samples of biofilm and background images were used to train the classifier by annotating pixels with corresponding labels, allowing the algorithm to learn and make predictions in real-time. The chosen features were color, intensity, edges, and texture. The generated probability maps indicating the likelihood of each class at every pixel were used for the object classification and were thresholded at a value of 0.6 with no size filter. Thresholding is a process involved in converting continuous probability maps generated from pixel classification into binary segmentation images by setting a threshold, where pixels above the threshold are classified as belonging to an object. The size, intensity, position and convexity of the biofilm objects was exported in .cvs format and further analysed in matlab. Volumic fraction of biofilm in microchannel was calculated from the sum of the size of segmented objects divided by the interest growth area (non UVC irradiated central part of microchannel).</p>

<p>Separate experiments were performed to study the behavior of cells in the initial phases of attachment in order to increase spatial and temporal resolution.

<p>Images were obtained with a 40× Nikon objective (NA = 0.95) using a differential interference contrast (DIC) brightfield with 2 minutes per frame during 3.5 Hours.

<title>Wavelet analysis</title>
<p>Time series of the pressure data were investigated with a wavelet analysis to identify temporal variations of spectral power (<xref rid="c83" ref-type="bibr">Torrence and Compo, 1998</xref>). Wavelet analysis was carried out using a Morlet wavelet, the product of a sinusoidal wave and a Gaussian envelope, with a frequency parameter of 6 and scale width of 300. We then applied a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) results which gives wave power coefficients dependent on the scale or period and the time, as well as a cone of influence (COI), where edge effects become important. The time series were zeropadded to reduce the edge errors. The cone of influence was removed from the scalograms in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Construction of the probability density functions for jumps and fits</title>
<p>Volume fraction data were processed using a homemade Matlab code. Each dataset was first sub-sampled by keeping only 1 in 150 points. The subsampled signal was then differentiated and only negative values corresponding to detachment events were conserved. Jumps were then identified through the selection of local maxima. For each flow rate, all the values for the times between two successive jumps and the relative amplitude of the jumps – amplitude of the jump relative to the value of the volume fraction just before the jump – for the different replicates were aggregated to construct the distributions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The paper investigates the interplay between fluid flow and biofilm development using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in microfluidic channels. By combining experimental observations with mathematical modeling, the study identifies the significant impact of nutrient limitation and hydrodynamic forces on biofilm growth and detachment. The authors demonstrate that nutrient limitation drives the longitudinal distribution of biomass, while flow-induced detachment influences the maximum clogging and temporal dynamics. The study highlights that pressure buildup plays a critical role in biofilm detachment, leading to cyclic episodes of sloughing and regrowth. A stochastic model is used to describe the detachment process, capturing the apparent randomness of sloughing events. The findings offer insights into biofilm behavior during clogging and fouling, potentially relevant to infections, environmental processes, and engineering applications.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This paper demonstrates a strong integration of experimental work and mathematical modeling, providing a comprehensive understanding of biofilm dynamics in straight microfluidic channel. The simplicity of the microchannel geometry allows for accurate modeling, and the findings have the potential to be applied to more complex geometries. The detailed analysis of nutrient limitation and its impact on biofilm growth offers valuable insights into the conditions that drive biofilm formation. The model effectively describes biofilm development across different stages, capturing both initial growth and cyclic detachment processes. While cyclic pressure buildup has been studied previously, the incorporation of a stochastic model to describe detachment events is a novel and significant contribution, capturing the complexity and randomness of biofilm behavior. Finally, the investigation of pressure buildup and its role in cyclic detachment and regrowth enhances our understanding of the mechanical forces at play, making the findings applicable to a wide range of technological and clinical contexts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The study achieves its primary goal of integrating experiments and modeling to understand the coupling between flow and biofilm growth and detachment in a microfluidic channel, but it should have highlighted the weaknesses of the methods. I list the ones that, in my opinion, are the main ones:</p>
<p>• The study does not consider biofilm porosity, which could significantly affect the flow and forces exerted on the biofilm. Porosity could impact the boundary conditions, such as the no-slip condition, which should be validated experimentally.</p>
<p>
• The research suggests EPS development as a stage in biofilm growth but does not probe it using lectin staining. This makes it impossible to accurately assess the role of EPS in biofilm development and detachment processes.</p>
<p>
• While the force and flow are three-dimensional, the images are taken in two dimensions. The paper does not clearly explain how the 2D images are extrapolated to make 3D assessments, which could lead to inaccuracies.</p>
<p>
• Although the findings are tested using polysaccharide-deficient mutants, the results could have been analyzed in greater detail. A more thorough analysis would help to better understand the role of matrix composition on the stochastic model of detachment.</p>

<p>This manuscript develops well-controlled microfluidic experiments and mathematical modelling to resolve how the temporal development of P. aeruginosa biofilms is shaped by ambient flow. The experiment considers a simple rectangular channel on which a constant flow rate is applied and UV LEDs are used to confine the biofilm to a relatively small length of device. While there is often considerable geometrical complexity in confined environments and feedback between biofilm/flow (e.g. in porous media), these simplified conditions are much more amenable to analysis. A non-dimensional mathematical model that considers nutrient transport, biofilm growth and detachment is developed and used to interpret experimental data. Regimes with both gradual detachment and catastrophic sloughing are considered. The concentration of nutrients in the media is altered to resolve the effect of nutrient limitation. In addition, the role of a couple of major polysaccharide EPS components are explored with mutants, which leads results in line with previous studies.</p>
<p>There has been a vast amount of experimental and modelling work done on biofilms, but relatively rarely are the two linked together so tightly as in this paper. Predictions on influence of the non-dimensional Damkohler number on the longitudinal distribution of biofilm and functional dependence of flow on the maximum amount of biofilm (phi_max) are demonstrated. The study reconfirms a number of previous works that showed the gradual detachment rate of biofilms scales with the square root of the shear stress. More challenging are the rapid biofilm detachment events where a large amount of biofilm is detached at once. These events occur are identified experimentally using an automated analysis pipeline and are fitted with probability distributions. The time between detachment events was fitted with a Gamma distribution and the amplitude of the detachment events was fitted with a log-normal distribution, however, it is not clear how good these fits are. Experimental data was then used as an input for a stochastic differential equation, but the output of this model is compared only qualitatively to that of the experiments. Overall, this paper does an admirable job of developing a well-constrained experiments and a tightly integrated mathematical framework through which to interpret them. However, the new insights this provides the underlying physical/biological mechanisms are relatively limited.</p>
