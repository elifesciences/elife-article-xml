<title>Summary</title>
<p>Humans generate complex hierarchies across a variety of domains, including language and music, and this capacity is often associated with activity in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Non-human animals have also been shown to represent simple hierarchies in spatial navigation, and human neuroimaging work has implicated the hippocampus in the encoding of items-in-contexts representations, which constitute 2-level hierarchical dependencies. These fields of research use distinct paradigms, leading to disjoint models and precluding adequate cross-species comparisons. In this study, we developed a paradigm to bring together these two areas of research and show that anterior hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex encode hierarchical context, mimicking findings from animal spatial navigation. Additionally, we replicated classic neurolinguistic findings of 1) left IFG and posterior temporal cortex in the representation of hierarchies and 2) the association between IFG and processing automaticity. We propose that mammals share an evolutionary ancient system for the generation of simple hierarchies which is complemented in humans by additional capacities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability to generate and process complex hierarchical structures across a variety of domains is a crucial component of human cognition. Some animal species seem able to represent simple hierarchies in social and spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buzsáki &amp; Moser, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Seyfarth &amp; Cheney, 2014</xref>). Beyond these basic capacities, humans can generate structures with multiple levels of embedding and across several domains including language, music, and complex action sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fitch &amp; Martins, 2014</xref>). Recent advances on the domains of language, music, and action neuroscience, as well as from comparative cognition, have provided cues on the neural and computational mechanisms underlying the cognitive representation of hierarchies.</p>
<p>In language, the processing of hierarchical syntax relies on two major hubs: inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior temporal cortex (spanning middle and superior temporal gyri - pMTG and pSTG - and superior temporal sulcus between the two - pSTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Friederici, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hagoort &amp; Indefrey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Matchin et al., 2017</xref>). IFG in particular, has also been implicated in the processing of hierarchies in music and action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fadiga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fitch &amp; Martins, 2014</xref>), inviting the speculation that this area might be central to the human capacity to process hierarchies in general. Interestingly, IFG has undergone recent expansion along the hominin lineage, both in volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Buckner &amp; Krienen, 2013</xref>) and in its connectivity with other brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Xu et al., 2020</xref>) especially with the left pSTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rilling et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of these areas has been discussed along two rationales: On the one hand, combinatorial <italic>operations</italic> within IFG may be necessary to generate hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Friederici, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zaccarella &amp; Friederici, 2015</xref>). On the other hand, IFG might implement domain-general <italic>operations</italic> (e.g., relating to working memory, cognitive control or long-term memory retrieval) acting on domain-specific hierarchical <italic>representations</italic> supported by pSTS and other areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Matchin et al., 2017</xref>; W. G. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Matchin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rogalsky et al., 2011</xref>). In support of the latter view, syntactic comprehension seems to activate pSTS already in children below age 7 while IFG only becomes more active at the age of 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Skeide et al., 2014</xref>) and in adults after extensive training (in comparison with control non-hierarchical tasks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jeon &amp; Friederici, 2013</xref>). Overall, <italic>relative</italic> activity within IFG seems to increase with processing <italic>automaticity</italic>. Moreover, recent studies which control for the effects of automaticity also highlight the role of pSTS in the processing of hierarchies in the visual and musical domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Martins et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">2020</xref>), thus suggesting that pSTS activity is involved in the <italic>representation</italic> of hierarchical structures more broadly, both for low and high levels of automaticity.</p>
<p>A second strand of research has also implicated the hippocampus in the processing of hierarchies across a variety of domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berkers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Garvert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jafarpour et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kepinska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kumaran et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schapiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Stachenfeld et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Theves et al., 2016</xref>). The hippocampal system – encompassing the hippocampus along with surrounding areas such as the entorhinal cortex - is located within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and is associated with spatio-temporal cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Moser et al., 2008</xref>), hierarchical planning and navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brunec &amp; Momennejad, 2019</xref>), episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Collin et al., 2015</xref>), the processing of sequences and de-novo formation and consolidation of new associative relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gridchyn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Klinzing et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore these structures have also been implicated in item-in-context binding (ICB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ranganath, 2010</xref>) - wherein an ‘item’ is represented as subordinate to a ‘context’ in a simple 2-level hierarchical relationship - and in the formation of schemas through memory generalization processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Berens &amp; Bird, 2017</xref>). Crucially, the capacity to form items-in-contexts representations – in which a contextual cue determines how another cue should be interpreted - is used as a signature of hierarchical cognition in the field of animal spatial navigation and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ranganath, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, a strong link between the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been reported in both human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Constantinescu et al., 2016</xref>) and animal literature, in which the mPFC has been identified both as contributor of item-in-context information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">McKenzie et al., 2016</xref>), and as a locus for consolidated long-term memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The molecular, physiological and functional properties of MTL circuitry have been mapped extensively in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Diehl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Donato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Marks et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rowland et al., 2016</xref>) and two of its properties seem particularly suited to the implementation of hierarchical representations of the kind ‘items-in-context’. First, a common finding in the hippocampus in both animals and humans is that of a functional gradient of spatial and mnemonic granularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Collin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Strange et al., 2014</xref>) along the longitudinal axis of the MTL. In general, the anterior-ventral hippocampus is more active in larger spatial and mnemonic scales – which is more suited for the representation of the global context – and posterior-dorsal hippocampus is more active in finer-grained scales – which is more suited for the representation of local information. This functional organization is also paralleled in structural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ray &amp; Brecht, 2016</xref>) and transcriptomic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Vogel et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, waves travelling along the body of the hippocampus – thereby sequentially traversing the different levels of description - have recently been suggested as substrate for multiscale hierarchical planning in the temporal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Stachenfeld et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, this gradient could potentially be used for the representation of different hierarchical levels, which would be encoded by populations of cells occupying different positions along this gradient. Second, the hippocampal system harbours both place and grid cells whose functional properties can quickly shift from one context to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fyhn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Marozzi et al., 2015</xref>), a process referred to as <italic>remapping</italic>. This has been shown to enable the formation of context or state-specific memories. These two properties (organization of scale-sensitive representations along a gradient and context/level-specific remapping) could render the MTL suitable to the encoding of hierarchical structures.</p>
<p>Despite the putative function of the hippocampal system in implementing hierarchical ‘items-in-contexts’ relationships, this system is rarely found active in human studies investigating hierarchies in language, music and action. Two reasons could explain this: 1) The hippocampal activation might be specific to the <italic>acquisition</italic> of new item-in-context relations, while most experiments test participants with extensive training. Crucially, item-in-context associations whose acquisition may initially be enabled/facilitated by the hippocampal system could become externalized to the cortex and compressed as part of a consolidation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gridchyn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Klinzing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lehmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Niethard &amp; Born, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schwindel &amp; McNaughton, 2011</xref>), paralleling changes seen in cortical involvement with increased automaticity. 2) Previous studies usually contrast hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical structures but do not specifically target the contrast between ‘items’ and ‘contexts’ within the hierarchy. Thus, these different strands of literature might focus on different expertise phases and on different aspects of hierarchical processing.</p>
<p>Here, we address these two issues and present two tasks specifically designed to target the contrast between items and contexts in untrained participants. In both tasks, participants are presented with a sequence of two objects, one after the other. Participants are then asked to determine the correct numeric value associated with the specific pair of objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The association between object pair and value is defined by one of two rules: hierarchical (HIER) and iterative (ITER), resulting in two otherwise identical tasks. In ITER, the value of the pair is the sum of the individual items’ numeric values, which does not imply any higher-order structure between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This is similar to linguistic conjunction in which “[second] and [green] ball” refers the second item in the list [red, <italic><bold>green</bold></italic>, blue, green]. In HIER, the numeric value of the pair depends on both the composition and order of the items, whereby the first object determines the context for the interpretation of the second. In other words, there is a 2-level set of cues, in which both (context and item) are essential to interpret the pair, but the reference of the second cue (item) is conditional to the context set by the first. This is similar to linguistic subordination, in which the “[second [green]] ball” refers to the fourth item in the list [red, green, blue, <bold><italic>green</italic></bold>]. This “item-in-context” task structure is also classically used to test for hierarchical encoding of spatial cues in animal spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ranganath, 2010</xref>). Participants learn a rule system with a hierarchical decision structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which when applied to the interpretation of a sequence of two objects, yields a nested 2-level if-then logical decision task. With this setup we can target not only the general contrast between hierarchy and iteration (“effect of TASK”), but also the contrast between first and second object (“effect of POSITION”). Thus, we can determine whether and how the hierarchical context affects the processing of either object, and isolate hierarchy-level specific contributions.</p>

<caption><p>(<bold>A) General Structure of a sample trial of the experimental task.</bold> In this task, participants are presented with two images, sequentially, such that only one image is present on the screen at each time.

These ROIs are based on regions known to yield activity during hierarchical processing either in human language or animal spatial navigation (see literature review in the text).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Using this design, we aim at clarifying the roles of the hippocampus, IFG, pSTS and mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) in the representation and processing of hierarchical structures – as they have been implicated in hierarchical processing in the research strands reviewed above. Based on this literature, we predict that: 1) The hippocampus will be active in the processing of hierarchical relations (in addition to IFG and pSTS), and more specifically show a differential encoding for the first and the second object (items-in-contexts); 2) different levels of hierarchical organization (first and second object) will be preferentially represented in distinct topographic regions along the hippocampal posterior-to-anterior axis. 3) Given its strong link to the hippocampus, we predict that the mPFC will also be active in the processing of hierarchies, and this activity to increase with automaticity (proxied by experience on the task). 4) IFG and pSTS will be active in the processing of hierarchies in general, but hierarchy-specific activity within IFG – in comparison with a non-hierarchical control task - will increase with processing automaticity. Initially, we also sought to test whether items and context would elicit differential grid-cell activity along the hippocampus axis (like in hypothesis 2). However, our individual stimuli did not elicit robust grid-like activity, precluding testing of this hypothesis (see details of the analysis and results in Supplementary Materials).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>On each trial, two objects were presented, one after the other. After the presentation of Object 2, participants provided the corresponding numeric value of the object pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The object pair could be related by a hierarchical (HIER) or an iterative (ITER) rule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1C</xref>). With this design we were able to assess the specific contributions of TASK ([H]IER vs. [I]TER) and object POSITION ([1]<sup>st</sup> and [2]<sup>nd</sup>). Crucially, objects and presentation duration were identical across conditions, thus differences in BOLD response could not be explained by simple visual processing. Furthermore, the experiment unfolded across 6 blocks, 3 per rule, in a counterbalanced order (HIHIHI and IHIHIH). By comparing [E]arly and [L]ate blocks (1-3 vs. 4-6) we were able to assess the specific effect of EXPERIENCE with each task. Thus, we focused on the main effects of TASK, and the interactions of TASK x POSITION (H1, H2, I1, I2) [first model] and of TASK x EXPERIENCE (HL, HE, IE, IL) [second model].</p>

<title>Experimental tasks isolate hierarchical processing and participants’ performance was adequate</title>
<p>Prior to the fMRI experiment, we externally validated the cognitive constructs underlying our tasks (see Supplementary Materials for details). In addition to HIER and ITER, participants performed a Visual Recursion Task (VRT), known to require hierarchical processing, and a Visual Iteration Task (VIT), which does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Martins et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">2019</xref>). Previous research has demonstrated the behavioral and neural similarity between VRT and higher-order syntactic processing in language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Martins et al., 2019</xref>). In the current study, we found that accuracy in HIER was more correlated with VRT, and ITER more correlated with VIT (see Supplementary Figure S1).</p>
<p>28 new participants completed the fMRI experiment, encompassing 192 trails in total, that is 96 per task.

<title>Hierarchical processing activates left prefrontal and posterior temporal cortices</title>
<p>To address the question of which brain structures subserve the processing of hierarchies, we examined the overall effect of TASK (HIER vs. ITER; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We found a significant left hemispheric cluster predominantly localized in middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and a second cluster in left temporal cortex, spanning angular gyrus, posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), middle temporal regions and supramarginal gyrus. All reported activations were significant at the cluster level FWE-corrected threshold of <italic>p</italic> &lt;.05. We did not find significant activations for the inverse contrast (ITER&gt; HIER). This shows that hierarchical processing draws on additional cortical resources in the left hemisphere (left MFG and pSTS) when compared to iteration. These results are in agreement with our hypothesis-driven Region of Interest (ROI) analysis in left IFGop (<italic>F(81)=</italic>5.32, <italic>p</italic>=.024) and in left pSTS (<italic>F(81)=</italic>5.27, <italic>p</italic>=.024).

<title>Hippocampus and mPFC encode hierarchical context</title>
<p>To examine the effect of different object <italic>positions</italic> during the processing of hierarchies (<italic>position 1: ‘</italic>hierarchical context’ vs. <italic>position 2:</italic> ‘embedded item’) we computed the interaction <italic>position</italic> x <italic>task</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). When assessing hierarchy-specific contributions during ‘hierarchical context’ vs ‘embedded item’ (i.e. [H1-H2]-[I1-I2]), we find a range of cortical structures and subcortical regions with clusters spanning precentral, postcentral and superior-frontal cortices, medial prefrontal and bilateral orbitofrontal cortices, putamen, caudate, hippocampus, amygdala, bilateral cingulate gyrus, left precuneus, superior parietal and left supramarginal cortex, and right middle temporal cortex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, interaction 2). Importantly, this set of areas comprises both regions within the dorsal fronto-parietal network, which are related to attention and cognitive effort, but also mPFC, precuneus and hippocampus, which are part of the default-mode network and unrelated to effort <italic>per se</italic>.</p>
<p>Based on our literature review and hypotheses, we performed ROI analyses and confirmed the interaction effect in both bilateral hippocampus (<italic>F(81)</italic>=4.6, <italic>p</italic>=.035) and mPFC (<italic>F(81)</italic>=6.26, <italic>p</italic>=.014). In the hippocampus, this effect is driven by higher betas for the presentation of the first object (H1 &gt; I1) and lower betas for the second object (H2 &lt; I2) when comparing across tasks. When looking at the tasks separately, we find a significant effect of position for HIER (<italic>F(27)</italic>=18.1, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001), but not for ITER (<italic>F(27)</italic>=2.94, <italic>p</italic>=.098). ROIs with left IFGop (<italic>F(81)</italic>=0.07, <italic>p</italic>=.79), right IFGop (F<italic>(81)</italic>=1.196, p=.277), left pSTS (F<italic>(81)</italic>=1.43, p=.235) and right pSTS (F<italic>(81)</italic>=2.208, p=.141) did not show significant interaction. The reverse contrast of ‘embedded item’ vs. ‘hierarchical context’ ([H2-H1]-[I2-I1]), activated a cluster spanning parts of bilateral superior medial frontal cortices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, interaction 1).</p>
<p>These findings are in line with our hypothesis that the network comprising Hippocampus and mPFC is involved in ‘items-in-contexts’ representations also in sequences of 2-items connected by a logical hierarchical structure.</p>

<title>Hierarchical context specifically modulates activity in anterior hippocampus</title>
<p>We predicted that the involvement of the hippocampus could differ along its longitudinal axis. To test this hypothesis, we used functional parcellations that subdivided the hippocampus into three separate regions – head, body and tail - spanning this axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Tian et al., 2020</xref>). We found that mean beta values decrease gradually from posterior to anterior hippocampal regions across conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We developed a new experimental paradigm consisting of two tasks which involved hierarchical (HIER) and iterative (ITER) processing. We confirmed behaviorally, that these new tasks correlated specifically with previously validated visuo-spatial recursive and iteration tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Martins et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">2019</xref>), thus showing that they are suitable for segregating hierarchical from non-hierarchy related processing. In fMRI we found that a left lateralized network encompassing lateral prefrontal and posterior temporal cortices was involved in the processing of hierarchies confirming previous studies in the domains of language and vision We also confirmed previous findings demonstrating that IFG activity becomes increasingly specific for the processing of hierarchies (compared to non-hierarchical controls) with increased task automaticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jeon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jeon &amp; Friederici, 2015</xref>). Against the backdrop of this behavioral and neuroimaging validation <italic>vis a vis</italic> previous literature and methodologies, our main finding was the involvement of <italic>anterior</italic> hippocampus and mPFC in the processing of hierarchical context, mimicking findings of animal spatial navigation. While mPFC became more active with increased training, hippocampus was equally active in early and late trials.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Left IFG/MFG and pMTG/pSTS encode hierarchical structure, and hierarchy-related IFG activity becomes more specific with experience</title>
<p>Our ROI results corroborate the involvement of left posterior temporal lobe and IFG in the processing of hierarchies. Whole brain activity peaked in MFG instead of IFG, which could be related to the low degree of automaticity in the processing of our experimental task, compared to the degree of automaticity that is commonly encountered in natural and artificial language experiments, which often draw on already automated processes. Both MFG and IFG seem to be important for hierarchical processing, as lesions in both areas have previously been associated with agrammatic speech (W. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Matchin et al., 2020</xref>). MFG has been specifically implicated in episodic control in second language acquisition but not first language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jeon &amp; Friederici, 2013</xref>), which supports such a role for the MFG in less automatized contexts. Functional connectivity between left IFG and MFG increases in response to mastery of complex grammar rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kepinska et al., 2018</xref>), which could be reflective of a stronger involvement of IFG with increased automaticity.</p>
<p>Consistent with this interpretation, our results suggest that the relative importance of IFG in the processing of hierarchies (vs. iteration) increases with the degree of automaticity. While bilateral, this interaction seems more robust in the right hemisphere (unlike in language, but similarly to music and action planning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bianco et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">2016</xref>). These results highlight the idea that while the general principles of hierarchical processing might be analogous across domains, the exact neural circuitry recruited might differ across domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blank et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fedorenko et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2012</xref>), especially with increased automaticity. In terms of neural and behavioral efficiency, it seems reasonable to surmise that automatic processing operates over domain-specific and not domain-general representations. The use of similar but non-overlapping processing regions is compatible with the formulation of domain-general operations interacting with domain-specific representations (W. G. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Matchin, 2017</xref>; W. G. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Matchin et al., 2017</xref>). An alternative explanation may be that at least initially, ITER may draw on a wider range of brain areas - including the IFG - when concurrently exploring multiple task processing strategies (or routes), but that IFG is not specifically active for ITER efficient and automatized processing. This could account for the decrease in IFG beta values in case of the ITER, whereas the betas for HIER remain constant. In other words, IFG-specific activity in the processing of hierarchies could result from the inability to offset processing to other brain regions in contrast to the simpler non-hierarchical task.</p>

<title>Anterior Hippocampus and mPFC are involved in the representation of hierarchical context</title>
<p>Second, we found that the hippocampus and mPFC – among other regions - were more active in the representation of hierarchical context. Importantly, we found increased activity in areas associated with the fronto-parietal and dorsal-attention networks, which may indicate increased attentional demand, saliency, or task difficulty – even though accuracy, response times and self-reported difficulty were equivalent in both tasks. However, Hippocampus and mPFC are usually considered to be part of (or at least strongly linked with) the default mode network, whose activity canonically decreases with increasing task-directed attention and cognitive demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, we neither found a significant relationship between accuracy and brain activity in our tasks, nor a significant interaction between task and accuracy in explaining neural activity (Supplementary Figure S4). It is thus unlikely that the increased activity of hippocampus and mPFC is explained by attention or cognitive demands alone. Furthermore, we located the effect of hierarchical context to the anterior hippocampus. This is in line with findings showing that global (albeit spatial) context is preferentially represented in ventral/anterior hippocampus. Crucially, such scale-dependent functional organization along the anatomy of the hippocampus might enable the concurrent representation of multiple hierarchy levels in our task, potentially making use of similar organization principles as have been identified previously for both spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buzsáki &amp; Moser, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kjelstrup et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>) and episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Collin et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Alternative accounts for the differences across tasks</title>
<p>We believe that the differential task × position effects observed in the hippocampus and mPFC may be related to hierarchical processing, in line with literature reviewed above. For example, upon presentation of the first object, participants need to encode a numeric value in ITER, and a color (in addition to the hierarchical contingency) in HIER. This could potentially explain some of the whole-brain findings, but it seems unlikely that this could also account for the differences seen in the analysed ROIs in the frontal and temporal cortices, as color processing is typically associated with occipital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kim et al., 2020</xref>) and number processing with the parietal cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dehaene et al., 1998</xref>) instead.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we cannot rule out that there may be some heterogeneity in subjects regarding the employed strategies across tasks (explicit vs implicit processing). Given the high performance and consistently short reaction times across subjects, we would assume that most participants transition to more implicit strategy early on during the experiment. We sought to further ensure this by providing a few training trials for both tasks before the scanning session.</p>
<p>Finally, task difficulty is unlikely to explain our results as we neither find behavioral differences between the tasks nor significant relationships between brain activity patterns and behavioral performance (Supplementary Figure S4).</p>

<title>Gradual evolution of hierarchical processing on top of pre-existing circuitry</title>
<p>The pattern of activity of mPFC and hippocampus in the representation of hierarchical context and dependencies in our experiment suggests that the underlying mechanisms might be similar to those used in items-in-context representations in non-human animals. Thus, the basic capacity to build hierarchical representations might be available beyond our species. This picture is supported not only by data on spatial navigation and problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>), but also in the social domain, where for instance, baboons are able to represent several levels of social dominancy based on matrilineal groupings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Seyfarth &amp; Cheney, 2014</xref>). Crucially, there is evidence for the involvement of the hippocampus and mPFC in the processing of social dominancy both in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kumaran et al., 2012</xref>, 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Qu et al., 2017</xref>) and other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dwortz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), hinting on the use of the same system in the processing of more complex social hierarchies.</p>
<p>Recent data on the domain of artificial grammar learning also suggest that monkeys are able to acquire simple hierarchical structures although they require more intensive training than human children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ferrigno et al., 2020</xref>). These data suggest that while the basic capacity for hierarchy representation might be present, other factors could limit the scope and depth of those representations in non-human animals. Several such limitations have been proposed, such as a lower capacity for automatization of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Schreiweis et al., 2014</xref>) and for building abstract and symbolic categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sablé-Meyer et al., 2021</xref>) due to limited neural supply and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Changeux et al., 2021</xref>). It is possible that IFG and pSTS are more specifically involved in the automatic retrieval of abstract representations than in hierarchical generativity per se, even though the two functions might feedback on each other. More generally, the human capacity to generate complex hierarchies might result from the incremental evolution of brain structures and associated cognitive abilities on top of preexisting circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Karmiloff-Smith, 2015</xref>) or a recycling of such pre-existing circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dehaene &amp; Cohen, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We designed a paradigm to bridge findings from separate strands of research, one mainly focusing on language, music and action planning in humans and the other on spatial navigation, item-in-context coding and decision making (especially in animals). Using this paradigm, we have shown that anterior hippocampus and mPFC are more active in the encoding of higher hierarchical levels (hierarchical context), mimicking findings from animal spatial navigation. Additionally, we replicated the classic findings of left IFG and pSTS in the representation of hierarchies, and the increased specific relative role of IFG with higher processing automaticity. With these results we were able to unify research from different domains and species and propose a model for the division of labor. We hypothesize that while mammals might share a system to generate simple hierarchies, this is complemented in humans by additional capacities afforded by an expanded neural circuitry subserving, for example, the automatic processing of abstract representations.</p>

<title>Imaging / acquisition Data</title>
<p>The experiment was carried out in a 3.0-Tesla Siemens SKYRA magnetic resonance scanner (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) using a 32-radiofrequency-channel head coil. During the four sessions, functional magnetic resonance images were acquired using a T2*-weighted 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with TE = 24 ms and TR = 500 ms. For each session, we acquired altogether a maximum number of 8000 volumes. Due to a hardcoded limit in maximal volume count at around 4000, the sequence had to be restarted for each participant at least once. This restart happened manually at the middle of the experiment after completion of the 3<sup>rd</sup> block. In two cases, due to interruptions triggered by the participants, a third restart had to be performed. Volumes were acquired with a square FOV of 204 mm, with 36 interleaved slices of 3.20 mm thickness and 10% gap (3.0×3.0×3.2 mm voxel size) aligned to the AC-PC plane, and a flip angle of 45°. T1-weighted images for anatomical co-registration were selected from the database of the institute.</p>

<title>Experimental Tasks &amp; Stimuli</title>
<p>The main task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Scholz, 2020</xref>) consisted in finding the association between pairs of star-shaped objects and a specific integer value. For example, a red object with wide angles followed by a green object with narrow angles could be associated with the value ‘one’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The associated integer value depended on the task rule (HIER vs ITER), and on the category of each object. Object category was first defined by a combination of two features: angle width and line thickness. Taking only a single feature by itself in consideration was by design not sufficient to identify the category accurately. This was done to enable consequent grid analysis on a per object level. The categorical space is depicted in Supplementary Figure S2. In this two-dimensional categorical space, objects in the upper right belonged into one category, and objects in the lower left quadrant belonged to another. In this experiment, we used stimuli that extensively covered the space, apart from the space near the border region, in order to reduce the difficulty of object classification. In addition to being placed in one out of the two halves of the two-dimensional space, objects could be either colored in red or green, yielding a total of four distinct object categories.</p>
<p>In each trial, participants saw two objects presented consecutively on the screen. During the 2s long presentation intervals, each object was morphing into its final shape, which was reached at the offset of the interval and served as the basis for object classification. This again was intended to allow for later grid activity analysis. Participants were asked to provide the corresponding integer value from a range of 1 to 4 for the presented object pair. After providing their answer they received visual feedback. To maximize separability of the BOLD response for different task stages, a fixation period of varying duration was introduced at the beginning of each trial (1-5s) and between both object presentations (3-7s). A sample trial is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. In each trial, the association between objects and value depended on the specific task rule. In HIER, there was a hierarchical dependency between the first and second object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), while for ITER the value of the pair was simply the sum of the values of its objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For each participant, the same base set of 96 object pairs was twice shuffled, and each time split into three blocks yielding 3 blocks for each task (HIER and ITER). Those blocks were presented in interspersed order, and the starting task was counterbalanced across participants.</p>

<sec id="s5d">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>During an out-of-scanner training phase, participants initially learned to categorize the available objects into one of four categories in a forced-choice paradigm. Each trial included a target object that was classified by selecting one of two objects chosen as prototypes of their respective category (one correct and another incorrect). Overall, participants had to successfully complete 84 object categorization trials. If the participant did not identify the class of the target object correctly, the trial was pushed to the end of the queue. The training ended once all trials were successfully completed.</p>
<p>Afterwards, participants were explicitly instructed with the rules of both HIER and ITER using a pre-recorded instructional video and a textual summary of the rules. Participants were then asked to solve 8 trials of each before entering the scanner. Additional oral instructions on up to 4 trials per rule were provided by the experimenter if necessary. In the scanner, participants were presented with six alternating blocks - three of each rule. Each block was composed of 32 trials and was preceded by a screen which indicated the task rule. The order of blocks (starting with either HIER or ITER) was counterbalanced across participants. This blocked design was chosen to minimize habituation effects. Participants received visual input through of a dual mirror projection system and could indicate their choices by means of a 4-key button box placed in comfortable reach of their right hand. After scanning, participants completed a short questionnaire. The entire procedure lasted approximately 1.5-2h.</p>

<p>For single-subject analyses, evoked hemodynamic responses for the different event types (task, object position, feedback type and key presses) were modeled using a single standard general linear model that additionally included six parametric motion correction regressors. A separate single-subject analysis was conducted for the effect of experience, by classifying the respective event onsets into either first (early) and second (late) phases of the experiment. The outputs of the single subject models were used in the group analysis which was conducted using a flexible full factorial design (one GLM for subject, task and position; and a second for subject, task, experience). Using these second level GLMs, we computed whole brain group T-contrasts. FWE-correction of the resulting statistical maps was performed on cluster level and significant clusters were identified using a FWE-corrected p-threshold of 0.05. For the definition of the linear models, t-contrast calculation and cluster correction, the respective standard functions provided by SPM were used.</p>
<p>To test for the involvement of hypothesized regions, we performed region of interest analyses (ROIs) by contrasting mean activity across conditions. The masks for IFG pars opercularis and fronto-medial cortex masks were extracted from the Harvard-Oxford probabilistic atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/fsl-harvard-oxford-atlases.html">http://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/fsl-harvard-oxford-atlases.html</ext-link>) with 50% and 10% threshold, respectively. Furthermore, the mask for the hippocampus and its subregions were taken from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Tian et al., 2020</xref>) and the “LH_Default_Temp_2” parcel from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>) was used as pSTS mask. We used the REX toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.mit.edu/swg/software.htm">http://web.mit.edu/swg/software.htm</ext-link>) to extract mean single-subject beta values across different conditions and ROIs. Using these Betas, we computed the main effect of TASK and interaction effects of TASK x EXPERIENCE and TASK x POSITION with mixed models (fixed effect omnibus tests) in Jamovi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75a"><italic>The Jamovi Project</italic>, 2021</xref>). Brain overlays were plotted using mango (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ric.uthscsa.edu/mango/">http://ric.uthscsa.edu/mango/</ext-link>).</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study investigates how hierarchies are processed in the brain, using a paradigm that intends to bridge disparate domains (e.g., language/music and memory). The main findings are that hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex are sensitive to hierarchy position, while the response in inferior frontal gyrus seems to vary with amount of experience with the hierarchy. Evidence supporting these claims is <bold>solid</bold>, and would be strengthened by additional methodological clarifications (e.g., as to why the particular analyses are most appropriate for the research question) and further discussion of limitations related to the study design (e.g., the possibility that the task does not require hierarchical representations).</p>

<p>In this paper, Scholz and colleagues introduce a new paradigm aimed to bridge the gap between two domains that rely on hierarchical processing: language and memory. They find that, generally in line with their hypotheses, hierarchical processing is associated with activation in hippocampus (especially anterior), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). They also report that these effects in IFG are particularly strong late in the task, once participants have had a lot of experience and processing is presumably more automatic.</p>
<p>This work has many strengths. The goal to bridge these literatures by developing a new task is commendable. I appreciate also that the authors separately validated their new task behaviorally by comparing it to another accepted as tapping hierarchical processing. I also liked that the authors were transparent about their hypotheses, and certain analyses like the grid coding one that was planned but did not work out. I do however have a number of concerns about the interpretations of the findings, such as whether some patterns are ambiguous as to the true underlying effects. I also have a number of clarification questions. All concerns are described below.</p>
<p>1. Broadly, I would like to see the authors provide more information and logic on why hierarchical processing should be associated with a big reduction in univariate activation between P1 and P2-why would this signify item in contexts binding? How does this relate to existing work using other methods (e.g., like animal studies, which seem to make predictions more about representational structures)?</p>
<p>2. There are many differences between what kind of information participants are processing between Position 1 and Position 2 for the HIER but not ITER conditions, and these may not be related to the hierarchical structure specifically. Related to but I think distinct from some of the limitations mentioned in the Discussion is the fact that in the HIER condition, what is happening cognitively between Position 1 and Position 2 items is more distinct (attending to color for position 1, and shape for position 2), whereas the two positions are equivalent in the ITER condition. This is a bit different from the authors' intended manipulation of hierarchy, because it involves a specific dimension. A stronger design might have been to flip the dimensions with respect to position specifically, to make shape sometimes important for position 1, and color for position 2 (perhaps by counterbalancing across subjects, so half would see the current P1=color and P2=shape rules, and the other half P1=shape and P2=color rules). Another important difference between color and shape is that while color is a simple binary distinction that participants can make based on their preexisting knowledge of red versus green, and to which they can assign a verbal label; whereas, the shape distinction was something novel they acquired during the experiment, has no real-world validity or meaning, and would presumably rely more on visuospatial processing. The shape dimension was also much more variable, I believe. I should say that I do find comfort in a few things - (1) that behavior on this task is correlated with another one that also indexes hierarchy processing, and (2) that the results show regional specificity in a pattern at least not easily explained by this distinction. However, I do think future work will be needed to ask whether it is hierarchy processing per se or rather something to do with the particular cognitive states engaged during each phase in this particular task that is eliciting activation in this set of regions. It would strengthen the paper to discuss this issue directly so readers are alerted to the caveat.</p>
<p>3. I did not understand what data went into creating the schematic in Figure 2E. First, I think this depiction of a gradient might be easily misinterpreted because it seems to imply that the authors have a higher resolution analysis than they actually do. I believe the data were just analyzed in three subregions of hippocampus - head, body, and tail. Variability within each subregion (as seems to be implied by certain parts of a region being more grey and others more red/orange), is not something that could be assessed in this analysis. For example, why does the medial part of the head seem to be more &quot;unspecific&quot; whereas lateral regions look more HIER Pos1 specific? This type of depiction would only make sense in my mind if the authors had performed something like a voxelwise analysis to determine where specifically the interaction &quot;peaks.&quot; I would recommend this visualization be cut or significantly changed to do away with the gradient.</p>
<p>4. I believe the authors have not reported enough information for us to know that hippocampus involvement indeed does not change with experience. It is interesting that hippocampus in the task x experience ROI analysis shows, if anything, bigger differentiation between the two tasks (numerically) for the late trials. This seems to go against the authors' hypothesis, and a lot of existing data, that hippocampus is preferentially involved in early (vs. late) learning. Given that the key signature in this region, though, is that it differentiates between position 1 and position 2 in HIER but not ITER, and doesn't show a big difference in magnitude across the two tasks, it makes me wonder whether the task x experience interaction collapsing across the two positions makes sense for this region. Did the authors consider a similar task x experience interaction within hippocampus, but additionally considering position? I think there are multiple ways to look at this question (e.g., either looking for a task x experience x position interaction, a task x experience within position 1, a task x position interaction separately in early vs. late portions of the task, or even a position x experience interaction only within the HIER task), and I'm sure the authors would be in a better place to decide on a specific path forward. The same logic might go for mPFC, which shows an interaction but no main effect of task. This relates to claims in the discussion as well, such as that &quot;hippocampus was equally active in early and late trials,&quot; but given this analysis is collapsing across the dimension hippocampus (and mPFC) seem to be sensitive to (position), it seems like this could be masking an underlying effect in which hippocampus/mPFC might still be differentially involved early vs. late (i.e., they might show the task x position interaction preferentially during some task phases).</p>
<p>5. For the IFG regions, the task x experience interaction seems to be driven mainly by change (decrease in activation) for the ITER, rather than change in the HIER. The authors are at times careful to talk about this as &quot;sustained&quot; activity in IFG, which I appreciated, but other times talk about a &quot;relative increase.&quot; I am not sure how I feel about that. I see the compelling evidence that there are task differences by experience, and that there is reduction for ITER that is interestingly not present for HIER, but I think I am still feeling uncomfortable with the term &quot;increase&quot; or even &quot;relative increase&quot; for HIER. For example, couldn't it simply be that the ITER task is requiring less processing with experience, whereas the HIER does not (perhaps because it requires more processing to begin with)? i.e., we do not know whether the reduction for ITER is simply a neural signal thing (i.e., activations diminish over time/experience) or a cognitive thing, specific to the ITER task. I think the authors are wanting to interpret the reductions as the former, but perhaps it would be more powerful to demonstrate if there was a baseline task that also showed reductions but for which not much would be expected in the way of cognitive change. Can the authors provide more justification for their choice of terminology (through either more logic or analyses), or if not, simply talk about it as sustained activity for HIER-which is especially interesting in the face of reductions for the ITER task?</p>
<p>6. Please define what is meant by the term &quot;automaticity&quot; in the introduction. A clearer definition of the concept would make the paper generally easier to follow, and it would also help foreshadow the hypotheses about mPFC activity in the introduction. To this end, it could be useful to elaborate on how learning takes place in this task, how it could foster increasing automaticity, and how automaticity maps onto behaviour (e.g., is it RT decrease alone, which happens for both conditions in this task?) the brain regions discussed.</p>
<p>7. There was no association between brain and behavior, which the authors interpret as a positive (as therefore task difficulty differences could not explain the effects). However in light of these null findings, it is on the flip side hard to know whether this neural engagement carries any behavioral significance. It seems to me as though the authors' framework makes predictions about brain-behavior correlations that were not tested in the manuscript. For example, I believe the authors asked whether behavior overall was correlated with activation. However, wouldn't the automaticity in IFG explanation for example predict that more engagement or an increase in engagement from early to late should be associated with e.g., faster RTs-not necessarily a relationship overall?</p>
<p>8. On p. 8, it is stated that &quot;In the hippocampus, this effect is driven by higher betas for the presentation of the first object (H1 &gt; I1) and lower betas for the second object (H2 &lt; I2) when comparing across tasks.&quot; Can the authors confirm whether the pairwise comparisons following up on the interaction here are significant, or rather if they are referring to a numerical difference in the betas? It looked like the same (numerically) would be true for mPFC; is there a reason why the same information is not included for the mPFC ROI? Also, might the authors provide more speculation as to why one might see both enhanced and reduced activation for P1 and P2, respectively?</p>
<p>9. I was expecting some discussion of how hippocampus does not seem to show preferential involvement early, given that its potential role being restricted to early in learning (i.e., during acquisition only) was one of the primary motivators for using this task. As noted in my above comment (#4), I am not quite sure that I think there is evidence that the hippocampal role remains constant over this task, given the analyses provided (i.e., that they did not look at the position effect for early vs. late). However upon further analysis if it does seem to be more stable, and/or if it even increases over experience, the authors might want to talk about that in the Discussion.</p>
<p>10. The fact that the hierarchies in this paradigm unfolded over time makes them distinct on some level from the hierarchies present in the VRT task that was used to validate the HIER task's hierarchical processing demands. For example, there might be additional computations required to processes these temporally ordered structures, support online maintenance, and so on. It may be worth considering this aspect of the task, and whether/to what extent the results could be related to it, in the paper.</p>
<p>11. I also have many methodological and analytic clarification questions, which I detail in the recommendations for authors.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Scholz et al., adopt a set of tasks to study how brain regions are differentially activated with temporal context clues. In one task, the first item in a two item sequence will dictate the value of the second. In another task, there is no hierarchy in temporal order, though subjects must still maintain information across the delay to add the value of the two presented items. Using univariate analyses, the authors found many regions that showed an interaction between item position and task, including: the mPFC, anterior hippocampus and the left prefrontal and posterior temporal cortices. The results are interpreted as evidence for a dedicated system for understanding hierarchical relationships across domains as various as spatial cognition, music, and language.</p>
<p>The question raised by the authors is important and fMRI may be an appropriate means of studying the neural basis for hierarchical computations. The main limitation of the manuscript, and one that is briefly mentioned and dismissed in the discussion is the task design, which confounds whether or not a hierarchical relationship must be formed, and the content of the information that must be held across working memory (color in the hierarchy task and number in the iterative task).</p>
<p>The authors also report an interesting difference between the activation observed in the head and tail of the hippocampus during the different tasks. However, the authors compare each region independently, show one is significant and the other is not, and then conclude &quot;the effect of hierarchical context representation in the hippocampus is specific to its anterior regions.&quot; Such a conclusion requires direct comparison of the regions.</p>
<p>Finally, it isn't clear if the motivating prior work makes a simple univariate prediction. A strong prediction however is that the representational similarity should be very different for objects in the first versus second position in the hierarchy task and much less so in the iterative task. Such a representational similarity analysis would better connect this study to prior research and to the hypothesis that hierarchical processing affects the coding of items in sequence.</p>

<p>My biggest concern is that I am not convinced that the HIER task is indeed hierarchical. Based on Figure 1B, it seems that the rules of the task can be listed as &quot;Green and same = 2&quot;, &quot;Green and different = 4&quot;, &quot;Red and same = 1&quot;, &quot;Red and different = 3&quot;. If so, the hierarchical organisation intended by the authors can be trumped by simply memorising these 4 options. The rote memory explanation is even more likely given that the other, ITER task, clearly required rote memory. Hence the two tasks may vary simply in the amount of difficulty/WM involvement.</p>
