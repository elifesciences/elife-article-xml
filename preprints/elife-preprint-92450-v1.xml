<title>Abstract</title><p>The Hippo pathway is among the most frequently altered key signaling pathways in cancer. TEAD1-4 are essential transcription factors and key downstream effectors in the Hippo pathway. Here we identified RNF146 as a ubiquitin ligase (E3) that can catalyze TEAD ubiquitination and negatively regulate their function in cells. We show that this ubiquitin of TEADs is governed by their PARylation state and validated the genetic interaction between RNF146 and the Hippo pathway in cancer cell lines and the model organism <italic>Drosophila melanogaster.</italic> Furthermore, we demonstrate that pharmacologically induced ubiquitination of TEADs by heterobifunctional chemical inducers of protein degradation (CIDE) molecules can promote potent pan-TEAD degradation. These TEAD-CIDEs can effectively suppress activation of TEAD target genes in a dose-dependent manner and exhibited significant anti-proliferative effects in Hippo-dependent tumor cells, thus phenocopy the effect of genetic ablation of TEAD protein. Collectively, this study demonstrates a post-translational mechanism of TEAD protein regulation and provides a proof-of-concept demonstration that pharmacological induced TEAD ubiquitination could be an effective therapeutic strategy to target Hippo-driven cancers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The genetic alterations of Hippo pathway components has been observed in 10% of human cancers including glioma, breast, liver, lung, prostate, colorectal, and gastric cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Steinhardt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, non-genetic dysregulations of the pathway are broadly involved in tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zanconato et al., 2016</xref>). These upstream dysfunctions converge on TEAD transcription factors as a central node to regulate transcriptional output driving tumor progression, metastasis, immunity, cancer metabolism, and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cordenonsi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Halder and Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kapoor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yu and Guan, 2013</xref>). There are four TEAD members in humans, TEAD1 (TEF-1/NTEF), TEAD2 (TEF-4/ETF), TEAD3 (TEF-5/ETFR-1), and TEAD4 (TEF-3/ETFR-2/FR-19) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yasunami et al., 1996</xref>) that share high structural similarity and a conserved palmitoylation pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Calses et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Huh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). Even though TEADs are mostly chromatin-bound in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2015</xref>), they do not exhibit any transcriptional activity on their own and rely on their coactivators to turn on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Xiao et al., 1991</xref>). Conversely, the two main Hippo pathway transcription effectors, YAP (<italic>YAP1</italic>) and TAZ (<italic>WWTR1</italic>), control gene expression via interacting with TEADs at their C-terminal transactivating domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vassilev et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with TEADs’ central roles in controlling the Hippo pathway output, genetic studies revealed that TEADs play important roles during development, including cardiogenesis, neural development, and trophectoderm lineage determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Huh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kaneko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nishioka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yagi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yasunami et al., 1996</xref>). Further more numerous studies underline the importance of TEADs in human cancers. Overexpression of TEADs has been implicated in multiple stages of cancer progression across cancer types. Moreover, the Hippo pathway has been showing as a common mechanism of resistance to chemo- and targeted therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kapoor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Song et al., 2015</xref>). To date, multiple efforts to target the Hippo pathway in cancers have mostly focused on small molecules binding to the palmitoylation pocket of TEAD, which can subsequently block the interaction between YAP/TAZ and TEADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Calses et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dey et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent innovations in the field of targeted protein degradation and manipulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system have enabled new therapeutic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Scheepstra et al., 2019</xref>). Targeted protein degradation using heterobifunctional chemical inducers of protein degradation (CIDEs), also known as PROTACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sakamoto et al., 2001</xref>) to target challenging oncogenic targets have emerged as a new frontier of drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chamberlain and Hamann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Such heterobifunctional degraders consist of two moieties, one binding to the target protein and the other to a E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce proximity between the E3 ubiquitin ligase with the target, thus cause ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the target protein. Such degrader molecules offer several advantages over small molecule inhibitors. They act through an event-driven mechanism instead of conventional occupancy-driven pharmacology, in addition, target protein degradation removes all functions of the target protein and may also lead to destabilization of entire multidomain protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chamberlain and Hamann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Heterobifunctional degraders have been reported for a diverse array of oncoproteins, and some of them have entered clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">You et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we explored intrinsic and induced TEAD regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system as a way to suppress the function of TEAD proteins. We identified PARylation-dependent ubiquitin ligase RNF146 as an endogenous ubiquitin ligase for TEAD transcription factors. We further demonstrate that RNF146 is a potent negative regulator of TEAD transcriptional activity, indicating that TEAD ubiquitination can be explored to suppress the Hippo target gene activation upon YAP/TAZ stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). To this end, we report the discovery and characterization of a TEAD-CIDE, compound D, that can induce potent and sustained degradation of all four human TEAD isoforms by co-opting the CRL4-CRBN ubiquitin ligase complex. Compound D exhibits significant inhibition of cell proliferation and downstream signaling compared to compound A, a reversible TEAD lipid pocket binder that lack the ubiquitin ligase binding moiety. As a proof-of-concept, we show that TEAD-degrader-induced degradation had comparable anti-proliferation effects as genetic TEAD depletion mediated by sgRNA or siRNA in Hippo pathway-dysregulated cell lines. Collectively, our study demonstrates that ubiquitination of TEADs via RNF146 or by TEAD-CIDE-induced CRL4-CRBN recruitment is an effective mechanism to suppress activation of the Hippo pathway target genes. This work highlights previously unrecognized crosstalk of TEAD ubiquitination and PARylation and a new strategy for targeting the Hippo pathway in cancers.</p>

<title>TEAD transcription factors are ubiquitinated in cells</title>
<p>To assess post-translational modifications that could impact TEAD stability, in particular ubiquitination, we transfected HEK-293 cells with expression vectors for each of the four TEAD paralogs followed by a cell-based ubiquitination assay. Our results indicated that all four paralogs can be ubiquitinated in cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), albeit at different levels. Focusing on TEAD4 as a representative example, we found that its ubiquitination levels were further increased upon treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 in a time-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that a fraction of TEAD4 ubiquitination can result in proteasomal degradation. To further assess ubiquitination of endogenous proteins, we performed a peptide level immunoaffinity enrichment (PTMScan) experiment to assess the profiles of K-GG peptides (result of trypsin digestion of ubiquitinated proteins) for endogenously expressed TEAD4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We identified several ubiquitination sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) and mapped them on TEAD4 using known crystal structures. These ubiquitination sites did not reside in any specific TEAD structural domain (Figure S1A, B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mesrouze et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shi et al., 2017</xref>).

Furthermore, we observed multiple ubiquitin linkages in IP-mass spectrometry studies with endogenous TEAD4 including K48-linked ubiquitin that is known to target the modified protein for proteasomal degradation (Table 2). Taken together, our data demonstrates that the TEAD transcription factors can be poly-ubiquitinated in cells, and such poly-ubiquitination may target TEADs for proteasomal degradation and/or modulate the transcriptional activity of TEADs.</p>

<title>RNF146 is an E3 ligase for TEAD transcription factors and negatively regulates TEAD transcriptional activity</title>
<p>We next sought to identify the ligase responsible for TEAD ubiquitination. We performed a screen using a siRNA library for 640 ubiquitin-related genes in the MCF7 cells that carries a luciferase reporter driven by multimerized TEAD binding sites (8xGTIIC-Luc). We identified three ubiquitin ligases – RNF146, TRAF3, and PHF5A – as potential negative regulators for the Hippo pathway from the primary screen using the luciferase reporter (Supplemental Table 3 and Figure S2A). Next, we validated these hits by assessing their impact on the TEAD target genes CTGF and CYR61 upon gene knockdown mediated by siRNA (Figure S2B). Two independent siRNAs targeting RNF146 consistently enhanced the expression of both genes, again indicated <italic>RNF146</italic> as a putative negative regulator of TEAD-mediated gene expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and S2B).</p>

<p>RNF146 had been previously reported to positively regulate YAP activity through degradation of AMOTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). To understand this discrepancy with our finding, we leveraged whole-genome dependency screen results from DepMap to broadly assess the loss-of-function effect of RNF146 across cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>). We systematically mapped the functional interactome of the Hippo pathway by assessing the correlation between the loss-of-function effect of individual genes (measured by their Chronos scores) with that of the known Hippo pathway components across a large panel of 739 cancer cell lines. As a positive control, we captured strong positive correlations between WWTR1/TAZ versus known negative regulators of the Hippo pathway including <italic>NF2</italic>, <italic>LATS2</italic>, <italic>AMOTL2</italic>, and <italic>MAP4K</italic>. Intriguingly, we found that the <italic>RNF146</italic> Chronos score anti-correlated with the Chronos scores of TEAD1 and WWTR1/TAZ similarly to these known negative regulators (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Taken together, this provided orthogonal evidence for E3 ligase RNF146 as a putative negative regulator of the Hippo pathway transcription effectors in TEAD-dependent cancer cell lines.</p>
<p>To further assess the function of RNF146, we depleted RNF146 by either sgRNA or siRNA. We observed significant reduction of TEAD4 poly-ubiquitination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and S2C). Additionally, we performed RNA-seq and examined the effects of <italic>RNF146</italic> knockdown on the transcription output by YAP/TAZ-TEAD using a published Hippo signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pham et al., 2021</xref>). We found that siRNF146 led to up-regulation of Hippo signature genes, while siYAP1 led to down-regulation of the Hippo signature. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and S2D, E and F). This is consistent with the role of YAP1 as a transcriptional coactivator for TEAD while RNF146 negatively regulates TEADs. We further examined whether RNF146 interacts with TEAD by performing immunoprecipitation using a Myc tagged TEAD4 construct. This demonstrated once again that TEAD4 interacts with endogenously expressed RNF146 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Additionally, we observed significant stabilization of TEAD4 under RNF146 depletion by siRNA and sgRNA in multiple cell lines (Figure S2G-I). Notably the effect on TEAD1 was lower, consistent with lower ubiquitination level of TEAD1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We also confirmed that RNF146 and full-length nuclear TEAD4 are present in complex by performing a proximity ligation assay (PLA) using antibodies specific to each protein (Figure S3A-D). Taken together, our studies demonstrate that RNF146 interacts with TEAD4, induces TEAD4 poly-ubiquitination, and negatively regulates TEAD-mediated gene transcription.</p>

<title>The ubiquitination of TEAD is associated with PARylation</title>
<p><italic>RNF146</italic> has been reported to be a poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation)-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether TEAD ubiquitination was also associated with PARylation. IP-mass spectrometry studies with endogenous TEAD4 identified two members of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases including PARP1, and PARP9 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and Supplemental Table 4). As PARP9 is a mono-ADP-ribosylation enzyme, and only PARylates ubiquitin, we focused on PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). First, we confirmed the interaction between TEAD4 and PARP1 by IP and Western blot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Next, we transfected TEAD expression constructs into HEK293 cells and blotted immunoprecipitated TEAD transcription factors with an anti-PAR antibody to confirm their PARylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrated that TEAD4 ubiquitination is partially dependent on PARP1, as <italic>PARP1</italic> depletion using sgRNA reduced TEAD4 ubiquitination levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and S3E). While these results indicate PARP1 is likely responsible for TEAD4 PARylation and subsequent ubiquitination, the incomplete loss of TEAD4 ubiquitination suggests potential roles of other PARPs and PARylation-independent mechanisms of ubiquitination in the process as well.</p>

Notably, this site is distal from the DNA binding surface and lies in the linker region between two α-helices that interacts with the DNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).

<p>First, we induced Hpo loss-of-function in the developing eye by expressing a dsRNA against Hpo using ey::Gal4. This resulted in significantly larger eyes with additional folding of the cuticle behind the eyes compared to luciferase RNAi as a control. We confirmed that Sd is required for eye over-growth in Hpo loss of function conditions, as Hpo knockdown did not increase eye size in Sd RNAi expressing animals (Fig. S4A, B). These phenotypes are consistent with inactivation of the Hippo pathway kinase cascade resulting in nuclear localization of Yki which then binds Sd to activate cell proliferation. In such a Hpo loss-of-function background, we found that overexpression of RNF146 rescued the overgrowth phenotype and resulted in significantly smaller eyes, supporting its role as a negative regulator of the transcriptional program downstream of Sd (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B, C</xref>). Conversely, RNF146 knockdown increased eye size further in animals expressing Hpo RNAi, indicating that RNF146 can negatively regulate the activity of Sd/Yki and limit their full activation in Hpo loss of function conditions (Fig. S4C, D). Next, we assessed the genetic interaction between RNF146 and Hpo using an eyFLP system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Newsome et al., 2000</xref>) to generate <italic>hpo<sup>KC202</sup></italic> mutant clones and overexpress RNF146 in a genetic background in which non-clonal cells (twinspots) are eliminated by the presence of GMR::Hid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Newsome et al., 2000</xref>). Using this system, we again observed that overexpression of RNF-146 suppresses the overgrowth phenotype of Hpo mutant clones compared to wild type clones (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E</xref>). Of note, overexpression of RNF146 alone resulted in a modest increase in eye sizes compared to luciferase RNAi control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). This is in contrast to the anti-growth effect of RNF-146 in the Hpo loss-of-function background and indicates RNF146 may regulate other genes/pathways controlling eye sizes besides its role as a negative regulator of Sd/yki activity. Taken together, the genetic interaction between RNF146 and Hpo in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eyes demonstrate that RNF146 functions as a negative regulator of over-growth phenotype associated with dysregulation of the Hippo pathway, consistent with our earlier computational and experimental results in human cell line models described above.</p>
<p>Of note, we also attempted to assess the genetic interactions between Sd and RNF146 with overexpression assays. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Simmonds et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>), overexpression of the fly homolog of TEAD Sd resulted in a dominant-negative anti-growth phenotype (Figure S4E). Intriguingly, co-overexpression of Sd and RNF146 seems to enhance such dominant-negative effect into a cell-lethal phenotype, as only a few animals emerged from such crosses and these animals had no eyes (Fig. S4E). These results indicate interaction between RNF146 and Sd in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is complex and require additional studies to fully resolve.</p>

<title>Development and Screening of pan-TEAD lipid pocket degraders</title>
<p>In cells, TEAD transcription factors can be very stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pham et al., 2021</xref>). We reasoned that the very low turn-over rate, the intermediate step of being PARylated, as well as different ubiquitination levels of all four TEAD paralogs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and S2G) may limit the ability of RNF146 and potentially other endogenous E3-ligase in reducing TEAD protein levels in cells. Thus, we sought to deplete TEAD proteins by directly target them for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation via pharmacologically inducing interactions between TEAD and other abundantly expressed and PARylation-independent E3 ligases.</p>
<p>To this end, we designed and synthesized a series of heterobifunctional TEAD CIDEs based on reversible TEAD lipid pocket binding ligand compound A and B with several E3 ligase ligands (compound C-E in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and compound F-K in Figure S5E). Compound A is a close in analog of Compound B as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Holden et al., 2020</xref>). Compound A binds the same site as Compound B in a very similar manner and the only modifications to Compound B were made to include a handle to attach an E3 Ligase ligand. These compounds have been previously disclosed in patent application: WO2020051099. To facilitate structure-based design of potent TEAD degraders, we solved the co-crystal structure of compound A bound to TEAD2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, D</xref>). As expected, based on previous reports and our biochemical data, this compound strongly binds all the TEAD isoforms via the lipid pocket in a TEAD lipid HTRF assay. Compound A makes hydrogen bonds to the backbone amides of Cys380 and Glu381, but binding appears to be driven primarily by van der Waals interactions deep in the pocket as well as with the benzyl group, which is sandwiched between Cys380 (which would otherwise be lipid-modified) and Lys357 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). This moiety provides an optimal vector for the terminal amide to exit the pocket, allowing for conjugation of an E3 ligase ligand via a linker in our TEAD-CIDEs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and S5E). A set of TEAD CIDEs were evaluated, containing ligands that bind the ubiquitin ligases XIAP, CRL2-VHL, and CRL4-CRBN. Reversible TEAD lipid pocket ligands, compound A and compound B, both bind pan-TEAD but show no inherent cellular activity in the TEAD dependent OVCAR8 cell line (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). These two compounds were selected as non-degrader control compounds (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Gratifyingly, TEAD-CIDEs based on compound A maintained good pan-TEAD biochemical potency when linked to all three evaluated ligase ligands. Additionally, TEAD/CRBN CIDEs led to significant activity in our cellular OVCAR-8 antiproliferation assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Based on these data, compound D and compound E were selected for further evaluation. We attempted to obtain co-crystal structures of TEAD, CRBN, and either of the compounds but were unsuccessful, likely owing to the highly flexible nature of the PEG linkers in our compounds.</p>
<p>Through multiplexed mass spectrometry-based global proteomics in MDA-MB-231 cell line, we next assessed compound D and compound E for TEAD specificity and selectivity. We identified significant downregulation of shared as well as unique TEAD peptides (TEAD1, 3) when cells were treated with compound D and compound E for both 4 h and 8 h compared to compound A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> and S5F). Other than TEAD peptides, we noted that PDE68 (Retinal rod rhodopsin-sensitive cGMP 3’,5’-cyclic phosphodiesterase subunit delta) and RNF166 (Ring finger protein 166) as the only other significantly reduced proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> and S5F). RNF166 has been previously identified as a target of other CRBN-based ligands (lenalidomide) and degraders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">You et al., 2020</xref>), indicating it could be a off-target for the CRBN binding portion of Compound D and Compound E. As expected, the parent ligand compound A did not induce any significant changes in protein abundance, indicating TEAD degradation induced by CIDEs depends E3 ligase recruitment.</p>

<title>CIDE-induced TEAD degradation is dependent on CRBN modulation and the proteasome</title>
<p>We next evaluated and confirmed that both compound D and compound E induced TEAD degradation in TEAD-dependent cell lines in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>, Fig S6A). No TEAD degradation was observed upon treatment with a TEAD lipid pocket binder (compound A or compound B) indicating that both TEAD and CRBN engagement are required for CIDE-mediated TEAD degradation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and S6B). In addition, we confirmed PDE68 degradation with compound D (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Based on this degradation, we docked compound A into the crystal structure of the PDE68 ligand binding pocket (PDB ID: 5ML2) and found that it could occupy that pocket without significant clashes (Figure S6C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tian et al., 2010</xref>). However, from genome-wide CRISPR screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>), PDE68 dependency was not correlated with other Hippo pathway members (Figure S6D, E) and was not essential in the TEAD-dependent cell lines tested here suggesting that PDE68 loss would not lead to anti-growth effects in the TEAD-dependent cell lines used in our study.</p>

<title>TEAD-CIDEs inhibit proliferation and downstream signaling in Hippo pathway dependent cell lines</title>

<title>TEAD CIDE specifically reduced chromatin accessibility at TEAD motifs</title>
<p>To assess whether TEAD-CIDE could lead to remodeling of the chromatin, we performed ATAC-seq on OVCAR-8 cells treated with Compound D or DMSO control for 48 hours.

</fig>
<p>Using systematic unbiased motif enrichment analysis, we found that regions which were associated with loss of chromatin accessibility were significant enriched for TEAD DNA binding motifs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). Since the majority of the downregulated peak regions were distal, we assigned enhancer-gene targets using links derived from aggregated chromatin capture data by Poly-Enrich. The most significantly enriched pathway corresponded to Cordenonsi_YAP_conserved_signature. This suggests that the observed downregulation of Hippo pathway target genes is likely due to the loss of TEAD-associated chromatin accessibility <italic>in vitro</italic>. Interestingly, we noted, among the ten most downregulated pathways, many were related to cell adhesion (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>), which has been previously associated with YAP/TAZ biology. Given that these pathways were modulated through the loss of TEAD-associated chromatin accessibility, together this study suggests that TEAD is a critical conduit of Hippo pathway activity. Loss of TEAD protein through degradation can potently alter the chromatin landscape of Hippo-driven cancers. Collectively, this highlights TEAD degraders as valuable tools to uncover the role of TEAD accessibility in cancers to guide future drug development efforts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we show that the activity of TEAD transcription factors can be post-transcriptionally regulated via the ubiquitin/proteasome system. We demonstrate that TEAD proteins can be poly-ubiquitinated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and identify RNF146 as an E3 ligase for TEADs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Such ubiquitination is dependent, at least in part, on TEAD PARylation by the PARP-family members (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Our study also demonstrated the genetic interaction of RNF146 with the Hippo pathway in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, establishing RNF146 as a conserved negative regulator of the Hippo pathway across species (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, we observed that RNF146 over expression induced an over-growth phenotype on its own, which will require future investigation and imply a role of RNF146 in developmental homeostasis in general.</p>
<p>RNF146 has been previously reported as a PARylation-dependent ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). TEAD transcription factors have been previously reported as targets of PARylation, which in turn impact their DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Butler and Ordahl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jungmichel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). The conserved Asp70 PARylation-target residue, as well as other Asp residues in the DNA-binding domain, do not reside in the DNA-binding interface of TEAD4 whereas ubiquitinated Lysine residues do. Thus, we speculate that PARylation of TEAD may indirectly impact DNA-binding through ubiquitination, rather than directly affecting DNA-binding. This raises the possibility that ubiquitination by RNF-146 may directly modulate TEAD activity in addition to marking them for proteosome mediated degradation. However, the requirement of PARylation as the intermediate step between RNF146 and TEAD, the exact interaction interface between RNF146 and TEAD, and the direct versus indirect role of ubiquitination in regulating TEAD transcriptional activity will require future genetic and biochemical studies in diverse models.</p>
<p>Of note, previous studies demonstrated that RNF146 may positively regulate YAP activity through degradation of AMOTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). However, our study demonstrates RNF146 functions as an E3 ligase and negative regulator of TEADs. We speculate the different modes of RNF146 action could be influenced by the cellular context, its subcellular localization, and PARylation status of different RNF146 substrates. Furthermore, our analysis of pan-cancer gene dependency revealed a clear function of RNF146 as a negative regulator of YAP/TAZ/TEAD across many cancer cell lines of diverse indications (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>TEADs are central components of the transcriptional machinery controlled by the Hippo pathway. Genetic depletion of TEADs induces strong anti-proliferative effects in Hippo-dependent cancer cell lines. While we identified RNF146 as an E3 ligase for TEAD transcription factors, knockdown of RNF146 had limited effects on TEAD stability in cancer cells. This prompted us to further explore pharmacologically engage other ubiquitin ligases and the proteasome system as a mean to limit the activity of all TEAD isoforms using CIDEs to therapeutically target the Hippo pathway. To this end, we designed, synthesized and evaluated a series of potent heterobifunctional TEAD-CIDEs based on reversible TEAD lipid pocket binding ligand compound A. As a proof-of-concept study, we engineered TEAD-CIDEs (compound D, compound E) that were able to reduce TEAD protein levels in a CRBN-dependent manner with concentrations as low as 0.1 µM. CIDE-induced TEAD degradation resulted in significant concentration- and time-dependent reduction in downstream Hippo signaling genes in Hippo pathway dysregulated cells. This study demonstrated, to our knowledge, the first class of TEAD degraders that specifically inhibit cell proliferation and suppress Hippo downstream signaling validates TEAD degraders as a potential therapeutic modality to target the Hippo pathway.</p>
<p>We identified PDE68 as an off-target protein for these TEAD-CIDEs. Structural biology studies suggest that while the pockets of TEAD and PDE68 are quite different, PDE68 may still be able to accommodate certain classes of TEAD ligands and should be considered as a potential off-target for TEAD lipid pocket-binding molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tian et al., 2010</xref>). While PDE68 loss is unlikely to impact the observed Hippo pathway specificity, next-generation TEAD-CIDEs should be engineered to achieve higher TEAD lipid pocket binding specificity and degradation efficiency. Further development of TEAD-CIDEs is needed to optimize the pharmacological properties to enable <italic>in vivo</italic> testing.</p>
<p>In summary, we have identified an important mechanism of regulating TEAD protein levels by the ubiquitin/proteasome system and demonstrated that this can be pharmacologically enhanced through TEAD-CIDEs. TEAD-CIDEs serve as potent chemical probes for studying the effects of pan-TEAD degradation for potential therapeutic intervention. As many cancer targets lack enzymatic function, CIDEs enable a tractable option to convert inactive ligands to functional degraders. This study provides further proof-of-concept for degraders as a therapeutic strategy for targeting challenging and hard to drug pathways in cancer.</p>

The Dharmacon library comprised 4 siRNAs per gene, whereas as the Ambion had 3 per gene. Screening was conducted in biological replicate. Briefly, 2 pmol of siRNA (20 nM final concentration) was spotted to 384 well plates, and 0.08 μL Lipofectamine RNAiMax was added in 20 μL of serum-free EMEM media. This complex was incubated at ambient temperature for 30 minutes before adding 2,000 MCF-7 TEAD reporter cells in 20 μL of 20% serum EMEM media. Cells were incubated for 72 h before assaying by OneGlo luciferase assay reagent (Promega). All plates included 8 wells of negative control siRNA (Ambion Silencer Select Negative Control #2), 8 wells of cell death control (Qiagen AllStars Positive Control siRNA), and 8 wells of YAP targeting siRNA (Ambion Silencer Select, cat# s20366). Positive controls were used to gauge transfection efficiency and yielded assay z’ factors of 0.5 and 0.3 respectively.

<p>Mass spectrometric analysis: Samples were reconstituted in solvent A (2% ACN/0.1% formic acid (FA)), and injected via an auto-sampler for separation by reverse phase chromatography on a NanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters, Dublin, CA). Peptides were loaded onto a Symmetry® C18 column (1.7 mm BEH-130, 0.1 x 100 mm, Waters, Dublin, CA) with a flow rate of 1 μL/minute and a gradient of 2% to 25% Solvent B (where Solvent A is 0.1% Formic acid (FA)/2% acetonitrile (ACN)/water and Solvent B is 0.1% FA/2% water/ACN) applied over 85 minutes, with a total analysis time of 120 minutes. Duplicate injections were made. Peptides were eluted directly into an Advance CaptiveSpray ionization source (Michrom BioResources/Bruker, Auburn, CA) with a spray voltage of 1.4 kV and were analyzed using a Q Exactive-HF mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA). Precursor ions were analyzed in the Orbitrap at 60,000 resolution; MS/MS data were acquired at 15,000 resolution. The instrument was operated in data-dependent mode whereby the top 10 most abundant ions were subjected for HCD fragmentation.</p>

A 50 ppm precursor ion mass tolerance and 0.05 Da fragment ion tolerance were selected with tryptic specificity, up to 3 miscleavages were allowed. Variable modifications were permitted for methionine oxidation (+15.9949 Da), iodoacetamide adduct for cysteine residues (+57.0215 Da), and ubiquitin di-glycine remnant (-GG signature) on lysine residues (+114.0429 Da). Peptide assignments were first filtered to a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) at the peptide level followed by filtering at the protein level at 2 % FDR.

<title>TEAD Lipid Pocket TR-FRET Assay</title>
<p>His-tagged TEAD proteins were pre-incubated with TEAD project compounds for 30 minutes at room temperature. Biotinylated lipid pocket probes are then added to the TEAD/Compound mixture and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. The lipid pocket probe competes with the test compound for the TEAD lipid pocket until equilibrium is reached. After 60 minutes, Europium labelled anti-His (Perkin Elmer # AD0110) and XL665 labelled streptavidin (CIS Bio 610SAXAC) are added to the TEAD/test compound/lipid pocket mixture and incubated for 30 minutes. TR-FRET values are then measured using an EnVision multi-label plate reader (Perkin Elmer Cat# 2104-0010A.) If the lipid pocket probe binds to TEAD as expected, a TR-FRET signal results from the proximity of anti-His Eu and XL665. If a TEAD lipid pocket binder such as binds and displaces the lipid pocket probe, the disruption of the TEAD:probe interaction results in a decrease in TR-FRET signal. The potency of compounds as TEAD lipid pocket binders is determined by IC50 value generated using a non-linear 4 parameter curve fit.</p>

For mass spectrometry analysis peptides were surveyed within FTMS1 analyses (120,000 resolution, AGC = 1×106, maximum injection time [max IT] = 50 ms) and the top 10 peaks were selected for MS/MS ensuring that any given peak was only selected once in a 45 second window (ppm tolerance = 5 ppm). For dynamic exclusion the “one precursor per charge state” was ON. For MS2 analysis precursors were isolated using the quadrupole (0.5 Th window), fragmented using CAD (NCE = 35, AGC = 1.5×10<sup>4</sup>, max IT = 100 ms), and analyzed in the ion trap (scan speed = Turbo). Following MS2 analysis, the top 8 ions were simultaneously selected (synchronous precursor selection – SPS, AGC = 1.5×10<sup>5</sup>, max IT = 150 ms) and fragmented by HCD (NCE=55) before analysis in the Orbitrap (resolution = 50,000). Raw data files are available via the MASSIVE data repository using the identifier MSV000085331.</p>
<p>All mass spectrometry data was searched using Mascot against a concatenated target-decoy human database (downloaded June 2016) containing common contaminant sequences. For the database search a precursor mass tolerance of 50 ppm, fragment ion tolerance of 0.8 Da, and up to 2 missed cleavages. Carbamidomethyl cysteine (+57.0214) and TMT labeled n-terminus and lysine (+229.1629) were applied as static modifications, while methionine oxidation (+15.9949) was set as a dynamic modification. Peptide spectral matches for each run were filtered using line discriminant analysis (LDA) to a false discovery rate (FDR) of 2% and subsequently as an aggregate to a protein level FDR of 2%. TMT-MS3 quantification was performed using Mojave, with only those PSMs possessing isolation specificities greater than or equal to 0.7 considered for the final dataset. Intensities of each PSM were added to the peptide and then protein (proteome) level within R. Expression is reported as relative abundance, which is the measured intensity of any given channel divided by the total intensity for that protein.</p>

<title>ATAC-seq analysis</title>
<p>ATAC-seq reads were analyzed using the ENCODE ATAC-seq pipeline v1. Briefly, reads were trimmed of adapters by cutadapt (version 1.9.1, cite DOI:10.14806/ej.17.1.200) and mapped to hg38 by Bowtie2 (version 2.2.6, cite <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1923">https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1923</ext-link>). Bam files were converted to tagAlign format which was then adjusted for Tn5 insertion sites by shifting +4bp for positive strand and by -5bp for negative strand. TagAlign files were used to call peaks using MACS2 (version 2.1.0, cite DOI: 10.1186/gb-2008-9-9-r137) and those peaks with p&lt;1e-6 were retained for differential analysis by Diffbind (version 3.0.13, cite <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7381/full/nature10730.html">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7381/full/nature10730.html</ext-link>). Differential peaks were defined by absolute fold change &gt; 1 and FDR &lt; 0.01. Genomic distribution of differential peaks was annotated by ChIPpeakAnno (version 3.24.1, cite doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-11-237). Bigwigs corresponding to fold change against the background control were generated by MACS2 and used to generate heatmaps by the pheatmap function of Deeptools (version 3.5.0, cite doi:10.1093/nar/gkw257). Motif analysis of differential peaks was performed using HOMER (version 4.10) with all peaks as the background. The peaks were assigned using Poly-Enrich (cite <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqaa006">https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqaa006</ext-link>) with distal enhancer-gene target links (&gt;5kb from TSS) plus 5kb locus definitions. Gene set enrichment was searched against Gene Ontology, MsigDB Oncogenic and Hallmark.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In the first half of this study, Pham et al. investigate the regulation of TEAD via ubiquitination and PARylation, identifying an E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF146, as a negative regulator of TEAD activity through an siRNA screen of ubiquitin-related genes in MCF7 cells. The study also finds that depletion of PARP1 reduced TEAD4 ubiquitination levels, suggesting a certain relationship between TEAD4 PARylation and ubiquitination which was also explored through an interesting D70A mutation. Pham et al. subsequently tested this regulation in D. melanogaster by introducing Hpo loss-of-function mutations and rescuing the overgrowth phenotype through RNF146 overexpression.</p>
<p>In the second half of this study, Pham et al. designed and assayed several potential TEAD degraders with a heterobifunctional design, which they term TEAD-CIDE. Compounds D and E were found to effectively degrade pan-TEAD, an effect which could be disrupted by treatment with TEAD lipid pocket binders, proteasome inhibitors, or E1 inhibitors, demonstrating that the TEAD-CIDEs operate in a proteasome-dependent manner. These TEAD-CIDEs could reduce cell proliferation in OVCAR-8, a YAP-deficient cell line, but not SK-N-FI, a Hippo pathway independent cell line. Finally, this study also utilizes ATAC-seq on Compound D to identify reductions in chromatin accessibility at the regions enriched for TEAD DNA binding motifs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study provides compelling evidence that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146 is a novel negative regulator of TEAD activity. The authors convincingly delineate the mechanism through multiple techniques and approaches. The authors also describe the development of heterobifunctional pan-degraders of TEAD, which could serve as valuable reagents to more deeply study TEAD biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The scope of this study is extremely broad. The first half of the paper highlights the mechanisms underlying TEAD degradation; however, the connection to the second half of the paper on small molecule degraders of TEAD is jarring, and it seems as though two separate stories were combined into this single massive study. In my opinion, the study would be stronger if it chose to focus on only one of these topics and instead went deeper.</p>
<p>Additionally, the figure clarity needs to be substantially improved, as readability and interpretation were difficult in many panels. Lastly, there are numerous typos and poor grammar throughout the text that need to be addressed.</p>

<body>
<p>The paper is made of two parts. One deals with RNF146, the other with the development of compounds that may cause TEAD degradation. The two parts are rather unrelated to each other.</p>
<p>The main limit of this work is the lack of evidence that TEAD factors are in fact regulated by the proteasome and ubiquitylation under endogenous conditions. Also lacking is the demonstration that TEADs are labile proteins to the extent that such quantitative regulation at the level of stability can impact on YAP-TAZ biology. Without these two elements, the relevance and physiological significance of all these data is lacking.</p>
<p>As for the development of new inhibitors of TEAD, this is potentially very interesting but underdeveloped in this manuscript. Irrespectively, if TEAD is stable, these molecules are likely lead compounds of interest. If TEAD is unstable, as entertained in the first part of the paper, then these molecules are likely marginal.</p>
<p>Here are a few other specific observations:</p>
<p>1 The effect of MG is shown in a convoluted way, by MS. What about endogenous TEAD protein stability?</p>
<p>2 The relevance of siRNF on YAP target genes of Fig.2D is not statistically significant.</p>
<p>3 All assays are with protein overexpression and Ub-laddering</p>
<p>4 An inconsistency exists on the only biological validation (only by overexpression) on the fly eye size. RNF gain in Fig4C is doing the opposite of what is expected from what is portrayed here as a YAP/TEAD inhibitor: RNF gain is shown to INCREASE eye size, phenocopying a Hippo loss of function phenotype. According to the model proposed, RNF addition should reduce eye size. The authors stated that &quot; This is in contrast to the anti-growth effect of RNF-146 in the Hpo loss-of-function background and indicates RNF146 may regulate other genes/pathways controlling eye sizes besides its role as a negative regulator of Sd/yki activity&quot;. This raises questions on what the authors are really studying: why, according to the authors, these caveats should occur on the controls, and not when they study Hpo mutants?</p>
<p>5 The role of TEAD inactivation on YAP function is already well known. Disappointingly no prior literature is cited. In any case, this is a mere control.</p>
<p>6 The second part of the paper on the Development and Screening of pan-TEAD lipid pocket degraders is interesting but unconnected to the above. The degradation pathway it involves has nothing to do with the enzyme described in the first figures.</p>
<p>7 The role of CIDE on YAP accessibility to Chromatin is superficially executed. Key controls are missing along with the connection with mechanisms and prior knowledge, of TEAD, YAP, chromatin, and other TEAD inhibitors, just to mention a few.</p>
<p>8 The physiological relevance and the mechanistic interpretation of what should be in the ATAC seq in ovcar cells is missing.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
Pham, Pahuja, Hagenbeek, et al. have conducted a comprehensive range of assays to biochemically and genetically determine TEAD degradation through RNF146 ubiquitination. Additionally, they designed a PROTAC protein degrader system to regulate the Hippo pathway through TEAD degradation. Overall, the data appears robust. However, the manuscript lacks detailed methodological descriptions, which should be addressed and improved. For instance, the methods used to analyze the K48 ubiquitination site on TEAD and the gene expression analysis of Hippo Signaling are unclear. Furthermore, the multiple proteomics, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq data must be made publicly available upon publication to ensure reproducibility. Most of the main figures are of low resolution, which needs addressing.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- A broad range of assays was used to robustly determine the role of RNF146 in TEAD degradation.</p>
<p>
- Development of novel PROTAC for degrading TEAD.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- An orthogonal approach is needed (e.g., PARP1 inhibitor) to demonstrate PARP1's dependency in TEAD ubiquitination.</p>
<p>- The data from Table 2 is unclear in illustrating the association of identified K48 ubiquitination with TEAD4, especially since the experiments were presumably to be conducted on whole cell lysates with KGG enrichment. This raises the possibility that the K48 ubiquitination could originate from other proteins. Alternatively, if the authors performed immunoprecipitation on TEAD followed by mass spectrometry, this should be explicitly described in the text and materials and methods section.</p>
<p>- Figure 2D: The methodology for measuring the Hippo signature is unclear, as is the case for Figures 7E and F regarding the analysis of Hippo target genes.</p>
<p>- Figure S3F requires quantification with additional replicates for validation.</p>
<p>- There is a misleading claim in the discussion stating &quot;TEAD PARylation by PAR-family members (Figure 3)&quot;; however, the demonstration is only for PARP1, which should be corrected.</p>
