<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Identical stimuli can be perceived or go unnoticed across successive presentations, producing divergent behavioral outcomes despite similarities in sensory input. We sought to understand how fluctuations in behavioral state and cortical layer and cell-class specific neural activity underlie this perceptual variability. We analyzed physiological measurements of state and laminar electrophysiological activity in visual area V4 while monkeys were rewarded for correctly reporting a stimulus change at perceptual threshold. Hit trials were characterized by a behavioral state with heightened arousal, greater eye position stability, and enhanced decoding performance of stimulus identity from neural activity. Target stimuli evoked stronger responses in V4 in hit trials, and excitatory neurons in the superficial layers, the primary feed-forward output of the cortical column, exhibited lower variability. Feed-forward interlaminar population correlations were stronger in hits. Hit trials were further characterized by greater synchrony between the output layers of the cortex during spontaneous activity, while the stimulus-evoked period showed elevated synchrony in the feed-forward pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that a state of elevated arousal and stable retinal images allow enhanced processing of sensory stimuli, which contributes to hits at perceptual threshold.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Physical properties of stimuli strongly influence perception such that low-intensity stimuli are detected infrequently. As intensity increases, detection probability remains low until some perceptual threshold is crossed, after which stimuli are perceived robustly. A psychometric function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) mathematically describes this property of perception. Only within a narrow range around the perceptual threshold do stimuli lead to significant trial-to-trial perceptual variance. While many studies present stimuli at threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), few have probed the laminar cortical microcircuit mechanisms that underlie successful or unsuccessful perception under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior studies have characterized how perceived stimuli trigger stronger information propagation from earlier visual areas to higher-order visual and frontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). This information propagation and sensory processing are strongly influenced by brain states such as arousal and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Arousal has long been recognized for its role in modulating cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) and affecting performance in various sensory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). In visual area V4, a key intermediate region in the ventral visual processing stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), attention strongly modulates neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Attention increases the firing rates of V4 neurons, enhances the reliability of individual neuron firing, and reduces correlated fluctuations among pairs of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Brain state dynamics impact both cortical and subcortical structures, contributing to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Fluctuations in attention are reflected in the onâ and off-state dynamics of V4 ensembles, which have been shown to correlate with behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>
<p>The visual cortex has a columnar architecture in which multiple cell classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) across the cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) form distinct sub-populations. These sub-populations have unique and stereotyped patterns of connectivity, thus forming a canonical microcircuit that orchestrates the encoding and flow of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Moreover, these sub-populations contribute uniquely to sensory processing and are differentially modulated by brain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). While it has been shown that attentional modulation varies across cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), the role of these sub-populations in attentive perception at threshold remains poorly understood. Moreover, the influence of physiological states, which may be responsible for different outcomes at threshold, on these sub-populations has not been studied in detail.</p>
<p>Here we examine the neural mechanisms that regulate perception at threshold. We specifically focus on the columnar microcircuit mechanisms within area V4. We hypothesized that minor fluctuations in behavioral state, such as arousal and visual sensitivity, and in the activity of neural sub-populations across the layers of the visual cortex, result in different perceptual outcomes at threshold. Specifically, we hypothesized that output layer (II-III, V-VI) sub-populations, ones projecting to higher cortical areas and subcortical structures, would show evidence of improved capacity for stimulus representation during successful perception. We also hypothesized that such successful events would be accompanied by improved information propagation throughout a cortical column. We find that differences in behavioral states and lamina-specific neural states characterize correct and incorrect trials at threshold and explain perceptual variability.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To study the neural dynamics responsible for determining whether a stimulus presented at perceptual threshold is perceived, we analyzed behavioral and cortical layer-specific neural data from area V4, collected while monkeys performed a cued attention task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Monkeys were trained to detect an orientation change in one of two Gabor stimuli that were presented concurrently at two spatial locations, and to report having seen the change by making an eye movement to the changed stimulus. Prior to a block of trials, monkeys were cued as to which of the two spatial locations was likely to undergo the orientation change (95% valid cue; presented at the start of each block). During a trial, ânon-targetâ stimuli at a fixed reference orientation were repeatedly presented. Non-targets were turned on for 200ms at the two spatial locations, and then turned off for a variable interval (200-400ms). At a random time (1-5s, mean 3s) a âtargetâ stimulus, differing in orientation from the non-targets, was presented at one of the locations. If the monkey reported having detected the orientation change by making an eye movement to the location of the target stimulus, it received a juice reward (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, âhitâ trial). If the monkey failed to detect the orientation change and instead continued to maintain fixation on the center of the monitor, it was not rewarded (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, âmissâ trial). In this study, we focused exclusively on trials in which the target stimulus was presented at the cued location (95% of trials). All figures relate exclusively to trials in which the change occurred at the cued location.</p>

<caption><title>Orientation change detection task at perceptual threshold</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of task structure. The monkey initiated a trial by fixating on the center of the screen. Two Gabor stimuli (represented by oriented lines) were presented for 200 ms and then turned off for 200-400ms. This was repeated until, at an unpredictable time, one of the stimuli changed orientation. The monkey could report having seen the change by making an eye movement to the location of the target stimulus to receive a reward (hit trials). If the monkey failed to report the orientation change and maintained fixation on the center of the screen it was not rewarded (miss trials). Before a block of trials, the monkey was cued as to which stimulus was likely to undergo the change (95% valid cue). In 5% of trials the orientation change occurred at the other location (foil trials). Circles indicating the cued location and receptive field are drawn for figure reference only and were not presented during the task.

</fig>
<p>On each trial, the magnitude of the orientation change was drawn from a distribution that spanned multiple levels of difficulty. We fit the behavioral data with a logistic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) and defined the threshold condition as the orientation change that was closest to the 50% threshold of the fitted psychometric function for that session (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Methods; see Figure 1-figure supplement 2 for additional examples and Figure 1-figure supplement 3A-G for logistic fit parameters). We selected this subset of trials for further analysis, since the constant target stimuli in these trials were equally likely to be perceived or not perceived. Target presentation times were not different between hit and miss trials (Figure 1-figure supplement 3H; p=0.15, Wilcoxon rank sum test). There was a slight difference in threshold trial performance based on time in the session (Figure 1-figure supplement 3I, p&lt;0.01, permutation test). Performance in the middle of the recording session (second and third quartiles) was higher than in the beginning and end of the session (first and fourth quartiles). Monkeys initiated a median of 905 trials per session (range: 651 to 1086).</p>
<p>While monkeys performed this task, singleâ and multi-unit activity and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded in area V4 using 16-channel linear array electrodes (Plexon inc., Figure 1-figure supplement 1A-E). The array was inserted perpendicular to the cortical surface and spanned the cortical layers. We used current source density (CSD) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) to estimate the boundaries between the superficial (I-III), input (IV), and deep (V-VI) cortical layers (Figure 1-figure supplement 1E-F), and assign individual neurons their layer identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Single units were classified as either broad-spiking (putative excitatory neurons) or narrow-spiking (putative inhibitory neurons) on the basis of their waveform width using previously published techniques (peak to trough duration; Figure 1-figure supplement 1D; see Methods; 31, 39, 40, 49, 50). Eye position and pupil diameter were also recorded (ISCAN ETL-200). When analyzing pupil diameter and eye position data, we considered all trials in the threshold condition in which the change occurred at the cued location, regardless of whether the cued location was within the receptive field of the recorded neurons. For all electrophysiological analyses, we only considered trials in which the cued stimulus was within the receptive field of the recorded neurons, and the stimulus change occurred at the cued location.</p>
<p>To assess the behavioral impact of variations in arousal and retinal image stability across trials at the threshold condition, we compared pupil diameter and microsaccade incidence across trial outcomes. Larger pupil diameter is thought to be a proxy for elevated alertness and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). We found that hit trials were associated with larger pupil diameters compared to miss trials, both before and during non-target and target stimulus presentations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We quantified this difference in the estimation statistics framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) by comparing effect sizes and using bootstrapping to estimate uncertainty in the differences. We found that the mean of the distribution of pupil diameters associated with hit trials is greater than that associated with misses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; complementary null hypothesis testing results in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Prior work has shown that the optimal state for sensory performance occurs at intermediate levels of arousal, with states of low and hyper arousal associated with decreased performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). In both hit and miss trials, the mean pupil diameter was close to the optimal arousal state for perceptual performance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; 15). The average differences in pupil diameter across hit and miss trials reflect differences within the optimal state of intermediate arousal. All results were held for individual animals (Figure 2-figure supplement 2A-C). Our results thus suggest that hits are more likely to occur during periods of greater arousal.</p>

<p>Microsaccades, small fixational eye movements of &lt;1Â° in amplitude that occur during normal fixation, are associated with periods of decreased visual sensitivity due to unstable retinal images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Microsaccades have been linked to suppressed neural responses in visual areas during perceptual tasks, impairing fine visual discrimination and behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). We grouped trials in the threshold condition based on whether a microsaccade occurred in a 400ms window preceding the onset of the target stimulus. Most trials with a pre-target microsaccade were misses, whereas the majority of trials without a microsaccade in this window were hits (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; see Figure 2-figure supplement 2D for individual animal plots). There is a strong link between microsaccade direction and attention deployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). Consistent with previous reports we also find that microsaccades toward the attended stimulus were overrepresented in correct trials (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A, upper left). Conversely, microsaccades towards the attended stimulus were underrepresented in incorrect trials (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A, lower left). There was a very low but statistically significant negative correlation between pupil diameter and microsaccade rate (Figure 2-figure supplement 1B, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.006, Ï &lt; 0.001). Microsaccade rates and inter-microsaccade times are reported in Figure 2-figure supplement 1C-D. Overall, these results suggest that successful trials at threshold are significantly more likely to occur during a state of greater arousal and improved visual sensitivity.</p>
<p>Having established that hit trials are more likely to occur in states of elevated arousal and visual stability, we investigated whether hits are characterized by differential information processing in V4. We first examined the ability to discriminate target stimuli from non-target stimuli using the firing rates of single and multi-unit V4 neurons in each of the three identified cortical layers (superficial, input, and deep). A linear decoder could better discriminate targets from non-targets in hits compared to misses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-Figure supplement 1 for individual animal plots), suggesting differences in firing rates across these trial types. This improved stimulus discriminability was consistent across all three layers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>Elevated stimulus-evoked firing rates would indicate a stronger representation of the stimulus that could cause this improved discriminability in hits. We compared the firing rates of all neurons (single and multi-units) recorded in each cortical layer across hit and miss trials. For non-target stimuli, firing rates were equivalent for hits and misses in both the pre-stimulus (0-200ms before stimulus onset) and stimulus-evoked (60-260ms following stimulus onset) periods (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; see Figure 3-figure supplement 2 for individual animal plots). For the target stimulus, firing rates were once again equivalent in the pre-stimulus period, but hit trials were characterized by elevated firing across cortical layers in the stimulus-evoked period (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>). Broad and narrow-spiking neurons in both the input and deep layers respond more to target stimuli in hit trials, and trend towards elevated firing rates in the superficial layers during hits (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The average firing rate in response to target stimuli for each neuron is shown in Figure 3-figure supplement 3A for both hit and miss trials. It is important to note that the stimuli presented to the animals were identical for both hits and misses. Moreover, the responses to the target stimuli occur early, and elevated firing in hits emerges at the time of expected V4 response latencies (70-100 ms; Figure 3-figure supplement 3C), and thus cannot be attributed to elevated levels of firing due to subsequent saccade planning in these trials (Figure 3-figure supplement 3B; expected &gt;200ms; 72).</p>
<p>Variability in response reflects how reliably information is encoded by a neural population. Lower baseline variability can enhance the ability of neurons to encode stimulus differences. We calculated the Fano factor, a mean-normalized measure of trial-to-trial variability in firing, for single-units in our population (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; see Figure 4-figure supplement 1 for individual animal plots). We find that broad-spiking units in the superficial layer exhibited lower Fano factor during the pre-stimulus period in hit trials (0-60ms before non-target stimulus onset, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating this population of neurons fired more reliably when the animal correctly detected the orientation change. This was not the case for broad-spiking neurons in other layers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) or narrow-spiking neurons (Figure 4-figure supplement 2).</p>

<p>We next wanted to test how the relationship between spiking activity and LFPs may differ across hits and misses.

We calculated the PPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>), a frequency-resolved measure of spike-LFP phase-locking, for single and multi-units relative to their local LFP signal during the pre-stimulus period (0-200ms before non-target stimulus onset, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; see Figure 5-figure supplement 2 for individual animal plots). We averaged PPC values at low (3-12Hz), medium (15-25Hz), and high (30-80Hz) frequency bands (superficial &amp; Input: Figure 5-figure supplement 1A-B; deep: <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> &amp; Figure 5-figure supplement 1C). Deep layer neurons exhibit reduced low-frequency phase-locking in hit trials than in misses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).

<p>Our results at the individual neuron or neural-sub-population levels suggest enhanced processing of perceived stimuli. However, it is the concerted activity among neural sub-populations that ultimately determine information flow through the laminar cortical circuit. We turned to canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to investigate the strength of feed-forward communication across layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>). CCA has previously been used to describe interactions among multiple cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). We performed CCA on each pair of layers: input to superficial, input to deep, and superficial to deep, where the two elements in each pair correspond to the upstream and downstream layers respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We refer to the results of CCA as population correlations. Interlaminar feed-forward population correlations were higher in hits than in misses in both the pre-stimulus and stimulus-evoked periods (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-C</xref>). This suggests that feed-forward information flow through the column is more effective in hits than in misses.</p>

<p>To further investigate interlaminar communication, we analyzed interlaminar synchrony as signatures of differential information flow between hit and miss trials. Spike-spike coherence (SSC) is a frequency-resolved measure of the degree to which two spike trains fluctuate together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). We measured interlaminar SSC for spike trains from pairs of cortical layers, each spike train being comprised of all recorded action potentials in a given layer (See Methods). We computed interlaminar SSC separately for hit and mis trials in both the pre-stimulus (0-200ms before non-target stimulus onset, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>) and non-target stimulus-evoked (60-260ms after non-target stimulus onset, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>) periods, matching the firing rates across hit and miss trials separately for the pre-stimulus and non-target stimulus-evoked conditions (see Figure 7-figure supplement 1 for individual animal plots). We averaged SSC for each pair of layers across three frequency bands, 3-12Hz, 15-25Hz, and 30-80Hz (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B and D</xref>).</p>

<p>Overall, hit trials have greater interlaminar SSC compared to misses at almost all frequencies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B and D</xref>). In the pre-stimulus period, the strongest SSC difference between hits and misses was observed between the superficial and deep layers across all frequencies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, middle panel). This implies greater synchrony of the output layers of the cortex during hit trials. In contrast, this pattern was directionally the same during the non-target stimulus-evoked period, but stronger in the other layer pairs, with greater SSC differences being found in pairs that involve the input layer (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, top and bottom). This may reflect a higher degree of stimulus-driven feed-forward information propagation during hit trials. When comparing across time (pre-stimulus vs non-target stimulus-evoked), layers, and frequency band, there was a significant interaction effect of layer pair and time window (three-way ANOVA, Ï = 0.0075).</p>
<p>Finally, we sought to compare the predictive power of our results on the monkeyâs perceptual performance. We created a generalized linear model (GLM) to regress behavioral outcome from the pupil diameter, number of microsaccades in the pre-target window, and average target-evoked multi-unit firing rate in each of the three layers (see Methods; 80). Other reported measures (Fano factor, PPC, interlaminar population correlations, and SSC) that we could not estimate reliably on a single trial basis were not considered in the GLM analysis. Pre-target microsaccades were by far the strongest predictor of performance (<italic>weight</italic> = â1.3116; Ï = 6.0757<italic>e</italic> â 08). Input layer firing rate also significantly predicted perception (<italic>weight</italic> = 0.3276; Ï = 0.020068). Superficial firing rate, deep firing rate, and pupil diameter were not significant predictors (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, all Ï &gt; 0.5). This indicates that, among the variables that we could estimate reliably on a single trial basis, stable retinal images in the pre-target window are critical for behavioral performance, and elevated firing in the input layer is the most reliable physiological signature of a perceived stimulus.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We investigated the physiological processes responsible for variable behavioral outcomes at perceptual threshold. Controlling for <italic>both</italic> the attentive instruction (thus minimizing large-scale attentional effects) and the stimulus condition that elicited performance at a threshold level allowed us to examine the physiological and neural correlates that underlie correct versus incorrect behavioral outcomes. While this study cannot disentangle the independent roles of behavioral state fluctuations and neural fluctuations in determining behavioral outcomes, evidence suggests that differences in both are associated with hits. We found multiple lines of evidence which suggest that a state of higher arousal and eye-position stability and the accompanying enhanced processing of visual stimuli contributes to accurate perception in hit trials (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig8" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">

<caption><title>Conceptual model for stimulus processing at perceptual threshold</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hit trials have a larger pupil diameter and fewer pre-target microsaccades, reflecting a state of increased arousal and greater eye position stability. Conversely, miss trials show decreased arousal and eye position stability. (<bold>B</bold>) In the spontaneous pre-stimulus period, hits are characterized by decreased variability in superficial layer broad-spiking neurons, which we hypothesize is reflective of lower membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) variability (inset). Hit trials are also characterized by greater synchrony between the superficial and deep layers (indicated by thicker arrows), which could be reflecting a stronger top-down influence on the cortical column. (<bold>C</bold>) In the stimulus-evoked period there is greater interlaminar synchrony between pairs that include the input layer (represented by thicker arrows), which we propose reflects improved feed-forward propagation of information. We propose these state differences in hits contribute to elevated firing rates in response to target stimuli, particularly in the superficial layers (inset), resulting in a higher-fidelity output to downstream areas.

</fig>
<p>Pupil diameter is elevated in hit trials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>), and prior studies have shown that pupil diameter is strongly linked to arousal and alertness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). This provides evidence that a state of higher arousal may contribute to improved sensory processing. The much lower hit rate in trials with a microsaccade preceding the target (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>) and our GLM analysis show that stability of retinal images is critical for accurate discrimination at threshold. It is unlikely that these two measures are reflecting the same phenomenon, as there is a very weak correlation between them over the course of a trial (Figure 2-figure supplement 1B).</p>
<p>There is a strong link between oculomotor control and attentional deployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>). In this study, hits and misses differ in their behavioral responses, with hit trials being characterized by a saccade to the target stimulus. Almost all of our neural results reflect differences around the time of non-target stimulus presentations during which the monkeys maintained fixation at the center of the screen and, therefore, were hundreds of milliseconds prior to saccade planning and execution in the case of hit trials. Trials in which saccades were made to non-target stimuli were excluded from analysis, as were trials in which the monkey made a saccade to the target too soon after its presentation to have been a behavioral response to stimulus perception (see Methods). The analysis of microsaccade occurrence focused on the window just before target stimulus presentation and before monkeys could begin oculomotor planning. Only the analysis of neural responses to target stimuli appears in conjunction with divergent oculomotor behavior between the hit (saccade) and miss (no saccade) trials. However, here too firing rates diverge much earlier, particularly in the input layer, than would be consistent with the effects of saccade planning (Figure 3-figure supplement 1B; 72).</p>
<p>Non-target stimulus contrasts were slightly different between hits and misses (mean: 33.1% in hits, 34.0% in misses, permutation test, Ï = 0.02), but the contrast of the target was higher in hits compared to misses (mean: 38.7% in hits, 27.7% in misses, permutation test, Ï = 1.6 <italic>e</italic> â 31). Firing rates were normalized by contrast in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. In all other figures, we considered only non-target stimuli, which had very minor differences in contrast (&lt;1%) across hits and misses. While we cannot completely rule out any other effects of stimulus contrast, the normalization in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and minor differences for non-target stimuli should minimize them.</p>
<p>A body of evidence (See 84 for review), suggests that microsaccades directed toward a target stimulus reflect attention-related processing and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). In our dataset, during the pre-target period, microsaccades towards the attended stimulus were overrepresented in correct trials (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A, upper left). Conversely, microsaccades towards the attended stimulus were underrepresented in incorrect trials (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A, lower left). Microsaccades directed towards the location of the eventual target may reflect elevated attentional deployment that can compensate for reduced sensitivity due to a higher incidence of microsaccades.</p>
<p>Our electrophysiological findings and their laminar patterns associated with hit trials <italic>within</italic> a cued attention state mirror several previous findings that are associated with the deployment of covert spatial attention. Attention has long been known to increase firing rates in V4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>), and there is evidence that this increase occurs in all cortical layers in V4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). We find improved target vs non-target discriminability in hits (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) across all cortical layers. Additionally, elevated target-evoked firing rates in hits occur across all layers in conjunction with elevated arousal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-D</xref>; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Attention reduces the variability in the firing of V4 neurons, and this reduction is thought to contribute to the improved information coding capacity of a population of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>). The reduction in Fano factor among broad-spiking superficial-layer neurons in hit trials mirrors the effects of attention (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Multiple lines of evidence suggest broadâ and narrow-spiking correspond to putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons respectively. Narrow-spiking neurons exhibit higher firing rates, which corresponds well with inhibitory interneuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). Repolarization times in broad-spiking neurons are also longer, as they are in excitatory pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>). Since these neurons are putative projection neurons to downstream cortical areas, this reduction in Fano factor may indicate increased reliability in stimulus encoding that could contribute to hits. Our finding is also in agreement with previous reports of higher variability in representations of unperceived stimuli in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>). Synchronous neural activity appears to modulate perceptual and cognitive ability in a variety of contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>). We found that deep-layer neurons exhibit less low-frequency phase-locking in hit trials (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This is consistent with prior studies that find an attention-mediated reduction in the power spectrum of the spike-triggered-averaged LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>).</p>
<p>In examining interlaminar population synchrony, we found that hit trials were characterized by stronger feed-forward interactions across the cortical column (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). This state of improved inter-laminar information flow could be a result of neuromodulatory or top-down processes that maintain the cortex in a state of sustained depolarization corresponding to a state of higher arousal during hits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Our examination of inter-laminar synchrony revealed two interesting and complementary patterns: hits were associated with greater coherence between the superficial and deep layers during spontaneous activity in the pre-stimulus period (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-B</xref>; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>); in contrast, we found enhanced coherence between the input layer and both the output layers (superficial and deep) in the stimulus-evoked period during hits (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-D</xref>; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Increased superficial-deep coherence in the pre-stimulus period could be the result of the same neuromodulatory or top-down processes. Increased synchrony between the input layer and the output layers during the stimulus-evoked period provides further evidence of stronger information propagation through the cortical circuit, and hence with improved stimulus detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>). In contrast to broad global synchrony or local correlated fluctuations, which may signal a default state of minimal processing or decreased information coding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>), these patterns of interlaminar coherence that we found suggest that successful perception at threshold is mediated by pathway-specific modulation of information flow through the laminar cortical circuit.</p>
<p>Prior studies showing decreased correlations under attention typically do not contain laminar information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) or only consider decreased correlations within a layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). In contrast, the correlation and synchrony analyses presented here are interlaminar, which we expect could reflect improved information processing in a column, similar to principles of communication across areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results provide insight about how information about a threshold stimulus may successfully propagate through a cortical column and influence sensory perception. Lower baseline variability among broad-spiking superficial layer neurons and decreased low-frequency synchronous activity in the deep layers could be indicative of improved capacity to encode sensory information. Higher target-evoked firing rates and elevated interlaminar synchrony could enhance the propagation of this encoded signal. These results associate pre-stimulus baseline state differences with enhanced cortical processing in the stimulus-evoked period.</p>
<p>Several studies have examined how information flow differs for perceived and unperceived stimuli at a more macroscopic scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). van Vugt et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) recorded from three brain regions, V1, V4, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), while a monkey performed a stimulus detection task at threshold. Their work supports the model that feedforward propagation of sensory information from the visual cortex to the PFC causes a non-linear âignitionâ of association areas resulting in conscious perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>). Herman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) found that conscious human perception triggers a wave of activity propagation from occipital to frontal cortex while switching off default mode and other networks. Our study provides insight into the functions of the cortical microcircuit at the columnar level that could reflect these large-scale sweeping activity changes in perception.</p>
<p>Overall, we identified substantial layer-specific differences in cortical activity between hits and misses at perceptual threshold, leading to the following conceptual model (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). During spontaneous activity, the state of elevated arousal and eye position stability during hits (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>) is manifested by increased interlaminar synchrony between the superficial and deep layers (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>, thicker orange arrows), which we propose is due to top-down influences. We predict that decreased firing variability in broad-spiking neurons in the superficial layer is caused by a lower variability in membrane potential closer to the action potential threshold among these neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>, inset). Elevated feed-forward propagation in the stimulus-evoked period (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>) and a membrane potential closer to action potential threshold could both contribute to higher firing rates in the output layers of the cortex (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>, inset), and are indicative of greater fidelity of stimulus processing in hits. These physiological differences in the laminar microcircuit likely contribute to successful perceptual discrimination at threshold.</p>

<title>Surgical Procedures</title>
<p>Surgical procedures have been described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>). In brief, an MRI compatible low-profile titanium chamber was placed over the pre-lunate gyrus, on the basis of preoperative MRI in two rhesus macaques (right hemisphere in Monkey A, left hemisphere in Monkey C). The native dura mater was then removed, and a silicone based optically clear artificial dura (AD) was inserted, resulting in an optical window over dorsal V4 (Figure 1-figure supplement 1A, B). Antibiotic (amikacin or gentamicin) soaked gauzed was placed in the chamber between recording sessions to prevent bacterial growth. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to NIH guidelines.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>At the beginning of each recording session a plastic insert, with an opening for targeting electrodes, was lowered into the chamber and secured. This served to stabilize the recording site against cardiac pulsations. Neurons were recorded from cortical columns in dorsal V4 using 16-channel linear array electrodes (âlaminar probesâ, Plexon Inc., Plexon V-probe). The laminar probes were mounted on adjustable X-Y stages attached to the recording chamber and positioned over the center of the pre-lunate gyrus under visual guidance through a microscope (Zeiss Inc., Figure 1-figure supplement 1C). This ensured that the probes were maximally perpendicular to the surface of the cortex and thus had the best possible trajectory to make a perpendicular penetration down a cortical column. Across recording sessions, the probes were positioned over different sites along the center of the gyrus in the parafoveal region of V4 with receptive field (RF) eccentricities between 2 and 7 degrees of visual angle. Care was taken to target cortical sites with no surface micro-vasculature, with surface micro-vasculature used as reference so that the same cortical site was not targeted across recording sessions. The probes were advanced using a hydraulic microdrive (Narishige Inc.) to first penetrate the AD and then through the cortex under microscopic visual guidance. Probes were advanced until the point that the top-most electrode (toward the pial surface) registered local field potential (LFP) signals. At this point, the probe was retracted by about 100-200 Î¼m to ease the dimpling of the cortex due to the penetration. This procedure greatly increased the stability of the recordings and increased the neuronal yield in the superficial electrodes.</p>
<p>The distance from the tip of the probes to the first electrode contact was either 300 Î¼m or 700 Î¼m. The inter-electrode distance was 150 Î¼m, thus minimizing the possibility of recording the same neural spikes in adjacent recording channels. Electrical signals were recorded extracellularly from each channel. These were then amplified, digitized and filtered either between 0.5 Hz and 2.2 kHz (LFPs) or between 250 Hz and 8 kHz (spikes) and stored using the Multichannel Acquisition Processor system (MAP system, Plexon Inc.). Spikes and LFPs were sampled at 40 and 10 kHz respectively. LFP signals were further low-pass filtered with a 6<sup>th</sup> order Butterworth filter with 300Hz cut-off and down-sampled to 1 kHz for further analysis. Spikes were classified as either multi-unit clusters or isolated single units using the Plexon Offline Sorter software program. Single units were identified based on two criteria: (a) if they formed an identifiable cluster, separate from noise and other units, when projected into the principal components of waveforms recorded on that electrode and (b) if the inter-spike interval (ISI) distribution had a well-defined refractory period. Single-units were classified as either narrow-spiking (putative interneurons) or broad-spiking (putative pyramidal cells) based on methods described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Specifically, only units with waveforms having a clearly defined peak <italic>preceded</italic> by a trough were potential candidates. The distribution of trough-to-peak duration was clearly bimodal (Hartiganâs Dip Test, Ï = 0.012) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>). Units with trough-to-peak duration less than 225 Î¼s were classified as narrow-spiking units; units with trough-to-peak duration greater than 225 Î¼s were classified as broad-spiking units (Figure 1-figure supplement 1D; teal=narrow, gold=broad).</p>
<p>Data was collected over 32 sessions (23 sessions in Monkey A, 9 in Monkey C), yielding a total of 413 single units (146 narrow-spiking, 267 broad-spiking) and 296 multi-unit clusters. Per session unit yield was considerably higher in Monkey C compared to Monkey A, resulting in a roughly equal contribution of both monkeys toward the population data.</p>

<title>Task, Stimuli and Inclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Stimuli were presented on a computer monitor placed 57 cm from the eye. Eye position was continuously monitored with an infrared eye tracking system (ISCAN ETL-200). Trials were aborted if eye position deviated more than 1Â° (degree of visual angle, âdvaâ) from fixation. Experimental control was handled by NIMH Cortex software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cortex.salk.edu/">http://www.cortex.salk.edu/</ext-link>).

<title>Receptive Field Mapping</title>
<p>At the beginning of each recording session, neuronal RFs were mapped using subspace reverse correlation in which Gabor (eight orientations, 80% luminance contrast, spatial frequency 1.2 cycles/degree, Gaussian half-width 2Â°) or ring stimuli (80% luminance contrast) appeared at 60 Hz while the monkeys maintained fixation. Each stimulus appeared at a random location selected from an 11Ã11 grid with 1Â° spacing in the appropriate visual quadrant. Spatial receptive maps were obtained by applying reverse correlation to the evoked local field potential (LFP) signal at each recording site. For each spatial location in the 11Ã11 grid, we calculated the time-averaged power in the stimulus evoked LFP (0-200ms after each stimulus flash) at each recording site. The resulting spatial map of LFP power was taken as the spatial RF at the recording site. For the purpose of visualization, the spatial RF maps were smoothed using spline interpolation and displayed as stacked contours plots of the smoothed maps (Figure 1-figure supplement 1G). All RFs were in the lower visual quadrant (lower-left in Monkey A, lower-right in Monkey C) and with eccentricities between 2 and 7 dva.</p>

<title>Current Source Density Mapping</title>
<p>In order to estimate the laminar identity of each recording channel, we used a current source-density (CSD) mapping procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Monkeys maintained fixation while 100% luminance contrast ring stimuli were flashed (30ms) centered at the estimated RF overlap region across all channels. The size of the ring was scaled to about three-quarters of the estimated diameter of the RF. CSD was calculated as the second spatial derivative of the flash-triggered LFPs (Figure 1-figure supplement 1E). The resulting time-varying traces of current across the cortical layers can be visualized as CSD maps (Figure 1-figure supplement 1F; maps have been spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel for aid in visualization). Red regions depict current sinks in the corresponding region of the cortical laminae; blue regions depict current sources. The input layer (Layer 4) was identified as the first current sink followed by a reversal to current source. The superficial (Layers 1-3) and deep (Layers 5-6) layers had opposite sink-source patterns. LFPs and spikes from the corresponding recording channels were then assigned to one of three layers: superficial, input or deep.</p>

<title>Attention task</title>
<p>In the main experiment, monkeys had to perform an attention-demanding orientation change-detection task (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). While the monkey maintained fixation, two achromatic Gabor stimuli (orientation optimized per recording session, spatial frequency 1.2 cycles/degree, Gaussian halfwidth 2 degrees, 6 contrasts randomly chosen from an uniform distribution of luminance contrasts, Monkey A: <italic>contrast</italic> = [10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50%], Monkey C: <italic>contrast</italic>(8 <italic>sessions</italic>) = [20, 28, 36, 44, 52, 60%] or <italic>contrast</italic>(1 <italic>sessions</italic>) = [30,40,50,60,70,80%]) were flashed on for 200 ms and off for a variable period chosen from a uniform distribution between 200-400 ms. One of the Gabors was flashed at the receptive field overlap region, the other at a location of equal eccentricity across the vertical meridian. The range of stimulus contrasts was the same at both locations. At the beginning of a block of trials, the monkey was spatially cued (âinstruction trialsâ) to covertly attend to one of these two spatial locations. During these instruction trials, the stimuli were only flashed at the spatially cued location. No further spatial cue was presented during the rest of the trials in a block. At an unpredictable time drawn from a truncated exponential distribution (minimum 1 s, maximum 5 s, mean 3 s), one of the two stimuli changed in orientation. The monkey was rewarded for making a saccade to the location of orientation change. The monkey was rewarded for only those saccades where the saccade onset time was within a window of 100-400 ms after the onset of the orientation change. The orientation change occurred at the cued location with 95% probability and at the uncued location with 5% probability (âfoil trialsâ). We controlled task difficulty by varying the degree of orientation change (Î<sub>ori</sub>), which was randomly chosen from one of the following: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12Â°. The orientation change in the foil trials was fixed at 4Â°. These foil trials allowed us to assess the extent to which the monkey was using the spatial cue, with the expectation that there would be an impairment in performance and slower reaction times compared to the case in which the change occurred at the cued location. If no change occurred before 5s, the monkey was rewarded for maintaining fixation (âcatch trialsâ, 13% of trials). We refer to all stimuli at the baseline orientation as ânon-targetsâ and the stimulus flash with the orientation change as the âtargetâ. Monkeys initiated a median of 905 trials (range of 651 to 1086).</p>

<title>Inclusion criteria</title>
<p>Of the 413 single units, we included only a subset of neurons that were visually responsive for further analysis. For each neuron we calculated its baseline firing-rate for each attention condition (attend into RF [âattend-inâ or âINâ], attend away from RF [âattend-awayâ or âAWAYâ]) from a 200ms window before a stimulus flash. We also calculated the neuronâs contrast response function for both attention conditions (Figure 1-figure supplement 1H). This was calculated as the firing rate over a window between 60-200 ms after stimulus onset and averaged across all stimulus flashes (restricted to non-targets) of a particular contrast separately for each attention condition. A neuron was considered visually responsive if any part of the contrast response curves exceeded the baseline rate by 4 standard deviations for both attention conditions. This left us with 274 single units (84 narrow-spiking, 190 broad-spiking) and 217 multi-unit clusters for further analysis.</p>

<title>Behavioral Analysis</title>
<p>For each orientation change condition Î<sub>ori</sub>, we calculated the hit rate as the ratio of the number of trials in which the monkey correctly identified the target by making a saccadic eye-movement to the location of the target over the number of trials in which the target was presented. The hit rate as a function of Î<sub>ori</sub>, yields a behavioral psychometric function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We performed this analysis independently for each recording day for each monkey, yielding a similar but distinct psychometric function for every session. Psychometric functions were fitted with a smooth logistic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Error bars were obtained by a jackknife procedure (20 jackknives, 5% of trials left out for each jackknife). Performance for the foil trials were calculated similarly as the hit rate for trials in which the orientation change occurred at the un-cued location (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, square symbol). When fitting the psychometric function, we did not include the contrast of the target stimulus as a variable, and fits were calculated by including trials with target stimuli of all tested contrasts. For each fitted psychometric function in both the attend-in and attend-away conditions, we calculated the threshold of the fitted logistic function (i.e. the Î<sub>ori</sub> at which performance was mid-way between the lower and upper asymptotes). Because the threshold of the fitted function always lies somewhere on the axis of Î<sub>ori</sub>, but not exactly at an orientation change presented to the subject, we then defined the threshold condition as the subset of trials in which the orientation change of the target stimulus was closest to the threshold of the fitted function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We restricted further analysis to this threshold condition. For this threshold condition we identified the trials in which the monkey correctly identified the target as âhitâ trials and those in which the monkey failed to identify the target as âmissâ trials. Analysis of behavior, pupil diameter, and microsaccades was conducted on both the attend-in and attend-away conditions; all electrophysiological analysis was applied only to the attend-in condition.</p>
<p>To compare the effect of target timing across hits and misses, we determined the time between trial initiation and target presentation in all trials in the threshold condition. For comparison purposes, the contrast values of all target and non-target stimuli presented in the threshold condition were compared in hit and miss trials using a permutation test.</p>

<sec id="s4d2">
<title>Pupil Diameter</title>
<p>The raw pupil diameter measurements from the infrared eye-tracking system could differ across days due to external factors such as display monitor illumination. To control for this, we normalized the raw data by a Z-score procedure separately for each session (using the mean and standard deviation of all measurements during the session). We analyzed normalized pupil diameter traces for hit and miss trials in the threshold condition, over a time window from 100 ms before to 100 ms after all stimulus presentations (non-target and target), excluding the first stimulus presentation in a trial. The first stimulus was excluded to avoid pupil diameter changes due to the pupillary near response caused by acquiring fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>). The pupil diameter was averaged over this time period and compared across conditions using bootstrap estimation and <italic>t</italic>-test. Distribution violin plots were generated using kernel density estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>) (bandwidth(hit) = 0.0801, bandwidth(miss) = 0.0648). When analyzing pupil diameter, we did not include the contrast of the target and non-target stimuli as a variable, and all analyses were performed including by including stimuli of all tested contrasts.</p>

<title>Microsaccade Analysis</title>
<p>Saccadic eye-movements were detected using ClusterFix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>). We identified microsaccades by filtering for eye movements with amplitudes between 0.1 and 1 degree of visual angle. We then split all trials in the threshold condition into two groups: those in which a microsaccade was detected in the 400ms preceding the target stimulus presentation, and those without a detected microsaccade. We calculated the hit rate for trials within those two groups. For all trials in which a target stimulus was presented at the attended location, we determined the direction of all microsaccades in the 400ms period preceding target presentation, relative to both the attended and unattended stimuli. The relative microsaccade direction was defined as the angle between two vectors: the one defined by the eye positions at the beginning and end of the microsaccade, and the vector from the initial eye position to the center of the stimulus (calculated separately for attended and unattended stimuli). Relative microsaccade directions were grouped into 12 bins from 0-360Â°. The distribution of relative microsaccade directions were calculated separately for correct and incorrect trials, relative to both the attended and unattended stimuli (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A).</p>
<p>We next created a null distribution of relative microsaccade direction. This was done by pooling together microsaccades from correct and incorrect trials and then sampling with replacement from this pooled data (bootstrap procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>); 1000 samples). The number of microsaccades chosen for each sample was the same as the number in correct or incorrect trials respectively. These bootstrapped samples were used to create 99.5% confidence intervals for the count of microsaccades expected in each of the 12 bins. A bin was considered significantly different from chance if itâs true count fell outside this confidence interval.</p>
<p>We calculated microsaccade rate for an entire trial by dividing the total number of detected microsaccades in the whole trial by the trial length (4592 total trials). The Pearson correlation between microsaccade rate and mean normalized pupil diameter (see above) for the trial was calculated for all trials with pupil diameter data, regardless of trial type or outcome (Figure 2-figure supplement 1B). Not pictured in Figure 2-figure supplement 1B but included in correlation analysis were trials with a mean normalized pupil diameter greater than 2 or less than â2 (â¼4% of trials). Only 4 of these trials were longer than 1 s, out of which 2 trials contained detected microsaccades. The mean pupil diameter in these trials is shown in Figure 2-figure supplement 1B inset. Inter-microsaccade time was calculated as the time between microsaccade onset of microsaccades detected in the same trial. 4% of microsaccades separated by &gt;538 ms are excluded from Figure 2-figure supplement 1D as they were more than 1.5x the interquartile range above the third quartile. When analyzing microsaccades, we did not include the contrast of the target and non-target stimuli as a variable, and all analyses were performed including by including stimuli of all tested contrasts.</p>

<title>Decoding Analysis</title>
<p>For each single-or multi-unit neuron, we extracted spike counts from 60-260ms following all non-target or target stimulus onsets in the threshold condition. Using these spike counts, we fit a Poisson distribution to estimate the mean firing rate for each neuron in each of four stimulus conditions (non-targets and targets in hit and miss trials). Responses to stimuli of all contrasts were pooled together to create the Poisson fit. We then created a pseudo-population of neurons in each layer. We generated spike counts drawn from the fitted Poisson distributions to create synthetic spike counts for target and non-target stimuli in hits and misses separately (1000 repeats). We used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to decode target from non-target stimuli. Decoders were trained separately for hit and miss trials. The procedure was repeated for a 20-fold cross-validation. We calculated the chance performance by training the decoder on data generated from all trials in the threshold condition (both hits and misses) and with shuffled labels (target or non-target).</p>

<title>Firing Rate</title>
<p>Firing rates were normalized per neuron to that neuronâs maximum stimulus-evoked response to each contrast before being combined across contrasts and trial types. PSTH of firing rates were calculated in 30ms bins shifted in 5ms increments. For each tested contrast level, we calculated each neuronâs maximum average firing rate in any bin from 0-260ms after stimulus onset in hit and miss trials together. We divided all bins in the entire PSTH for that contrast by this maximum firing rate to obtain the normalized firing rate for each contrast. We then combined PSTHs across contrasts and split the data between hit and miss trials. We averaged stimulus-evoked firing rates from 60-260ms following non-target or target stimulus presentations. We used bootstrapped estimation to compare firing rates in hit and miss trials in a paired comparison. This was done for all single and multi-unit clusters, as well as broadâ and narrow-spiking single-units in each layer. Firing rates were also compared across hit and miss trials by paired <italic>t</italic>-test for each group. To calculate the time of firing rate divergence, we compared the difference in each single neuron or multi-unit firing rate in the two conditions over time. At each time point, we performed a Wilcoxin rank-sum test comparing the firing rates across hits and misses, and defined the divergence point as the first time the firing rates were significantly different. Divergence was calculated separately for each layer. To determine the time at which firing rates rose above baseline levels, we used bootstrapping to estimate 95% confidence intervals for each neuronâs pre-stimulus firing rate (0-100 ms before target or non-target stimulus onset). We then calculated the target PSTH for each neuron in 30ms bins shifted in 5ms increments. We defined the response latency as the first time bin in which the neuronâs firing rate in the PSTH exceeded the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of baseline firing. We calculated the response latency independently for hit and miss trials for each neuron.</p>

<title>Fano factor</title>
<p>Trial-to-trial variability was estimated by the Fano factor, which is the ratio of the variance of the spike counts across trials over the mean of the spike counts for each broad and narrow-spiking single unit.

<p>We calculated PPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>) for single and multi-units in the non-target pre-stimulus period (0-200ms preceding onset regardless of stimulus conrrast) in trials in the threshold condition. Although PPC is unbiased by spike count, we set a threshold of 50 spikes for analysis so that only units with enough spikes for a reliable estimate of PPC were included (superficial: <italic>n</italic> = 26, input: <italic>n</italic> = 41, deep: <italic>n</italic> = 64). LFP phase was calculated using Morlet wavelets. PPC for each unit was calculated for the phase of the LFP recorded on the same channel and averaged in three frequency bands (3-12 Hz, 15-25 Hz, and 30-80 Hz). PPC was calculated separately for hit and miss trials and compared across trial outcomes by t-test, corrected for multiple comparisons.</p>

<title>Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)</title>
<p>We used CCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref>) to capture the correlation between layers at different time periods and with different amounts of temporal delays. We considered all possible combinations of pairs of layers. We took two windows of activity, one in each layer, in either the pre-stimulus period (0-200ms before non-target stimulus onset) or stimulus-evoked period (60-260ms after non-target stimulus onset), including responses to stimuli of all contrasts. Window length was 50ms and the window was advanced in 10ms steps. The activity within each window was then binned using 10ms bins. We reported correlation associated with the first two canonical pairs, and calculated it separately for hit and miss trials. For each pair of layers, we limited CCA to sessions in which there were at least two neurons recorded in both layers. Feed-forward (FF) layer pairs were defined as follows: input to superficial, input to deep, and superficial to deep. The correlations along the FF signaling pathways (<italic>C<sub>FF</sub></italic>) were calculated as the mean correlation at positive delays:

<title>Spike-spike coherence (SSC)</title>
<p>For each recording session, all spikes recorded from visually responsive single and multi-units in each layer were combined into a single spike train for that layer (layer multi-unit). Separately for both the pre-stimulus and non-target stimulus-evoked periods, we randomly deleted spikes from the layer multi-unit with a higher firing rate so that the firing rates were matched across hit and miss trials. SSC was calculated for each of the three possible pairs of layer multi-units in each session for both the pre-stimulus (0-200 ms preceding stimulus onset) and non-target stimulus evoked period (60-260 ms following non-target stimulus onset, including all stimuli regardless of contrast) separately for hit and miss trials using Chronux (NW = 1; K = 1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chronux.org">http://chronux.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). To control for differences in firing rates across hit and miss trials we used a rate matching procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). For estimation statistics, interlaminar SSC values was calculated for each frequency and subsequently averaged across three frequency bands: 3-12 Hz, 5-15 Hz, and 30-80 Hz and compared across hit and miss trials for each pair of layers in each recording session. For null-hypothesis testing, we calculated the SSC modulation index, defined as

The SSC MI was calculated for each frequency and subsequently averaged across three frequency bands: 3-12 Hz, 5-15 Hz, and 30-80 Hz. MI values for each frequency band were compared to zero by t-test, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. We tested for interaction effects with a three-factor ANOVA, with frequency, pair of layers, and time window (pre or post stimulus) as factors. We calculated a shuffled distribution of SSC by shuffling the trial identities of the spikes in one of the layers in the pair. We then calculated SSC with the shuffled trial identities. This procedure was repeated 10 times to create the shuffled distribution.</p>

In order to be able to compare weights across regressors, each regressor was transformed into a z-score before being included in the model. We fit the GLM using a logit link function, using the predictors to regress the categorical binary trial outcome (hit or miss). A total of 309 trials were included in the GLM. Stimulus contrast was not a variable in the GLM.</p>

<caption><title>Laminar recordings in V4 (Modified from Nandy et al. (2017)).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An artificial dura (AD) chamber is shown over dorsal V4 in the right hemisphere of Monkey A. The native dura mater was resected and replaced with a silicone based artificial dura, thereby providing an optically clear window into the cortex. Scale bar = 5mm. (<bold>B</bold>) An enlarged view of the boxed region in <bold>A</bold> clearly shows the sulci and the microvasculature. sts = superior temporal sulcus, lu = lunate sulcus, io = inferior occipital sulcus. Area V4 lies on the pre-lunate gyrus between the superior temporal and lunate sulci. Scale bar = 2mm. (<bold>C</bold>) Electrophysiology setup: a plastic stabilizer with a circular aperture is secured in place inside the chamber such that the aperture is centered over the pre-lunate gryus. A 16-channel linear array electrode (electrode spacing 150 Î¼m) is positioned over the center of the gyrus and lowered into the cortex under microscopic guidance. The microvasculature pattern was used as a reference to target different cortical sites across recording sessions. (<bold>D</bold>) Example recording session in monkey C depicting 12 single unit waveforms (mean +/â s.e.m.) isolated along the cortical column. Teal waveforms correspond to narrow-spiking putative interneurons and gold waveforms correspond to broad-spiking putative excitatory units. (<bold>E</bold>) Stimulus triggered local field potentials (LFPs) obtained by flashing 30ms high contrast ring stimuli in the receptive field of a V4 cortical column. LFP traces averaged across all stimulus repeats are shown color-coded as being part of either the superficial (green), input (gray) or deep (pink) layers. Layer assignment was done after current source-density analysis. (<bold>F</bold>) Current source-density (CSD) calculated as the second spatial derivative of the stimulus triggered LFPs and displayed as a colored map. The x-axis represents time from stimulus onset; the y-axis represents cortical depth oriented such that the pial surface is at the top and the white matter is at the bottom. Red hues represent current sink, blue hues represent current source. The input layer is identified as the first current sink followed by a reversal to current source. The superficial and deep layers have the opposite sink-source pattern. The CSD map has been spatially smoothed for visualization. (<bold>G</bold>) Stacked contour plots show spatial receptive fields (RFs) mapped along each contact point in the laminar probe. The spatial receptive fields were obtained by applying reverse correlation to the LFP power evoked by sparse pseudo-random sequences of Gabor stimuli. The RFs are well aligned, indicating perpendicular penetration down a cortical column. Zero depth represents the center of the input layer as estimated from the CSD. (<bold>H</bold>) Contrast response functions â spikes rate as a function of stimulus contrast â are shown for 2 example units identified in a single recording session in Monkey A. Red and blue traces correspond to the attend-in to RF and attend-away from RF conditions respectively. The dotted lines represent the corresponding background firing-rates. The dashed lines are 4 standard deviations above baseline. A unit was considered as visually responsive, if the contrast response functions exceeded this threshold in both the attention conditions. Mean +/â s.e.m. Panels are reproduced from Nandy et al. (2017).</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study by Nandy and colleagues examined relationships between behavioral state, neural activity in cortical area V4, and trial-by-trial variability in the ability to detect weak visual stimuli. They present <bold>solid</bold> evidence indicating that certain changes in arousal and eye-position stability, along with patterns of synchrony in the activity of neurons in different layers of V4, can show modest correspondences to changes in the ability to correctly detect a stimulus. These findings are likely to be of interest to those who seek a deeper understanding of circuit mechanisms that underlie perception.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Nandy and colleagues examine neural, physiological and behavioral correlates of perceptual variability in monkeys performing a visual change detection task. They used a laminar probe to record from area V4 while two macaque monkeys detected a small change in stimulus orientation that occurred at a random time in one of two locations, focusing their analysis on stimulus conditions where the animal was equally likely to detect (hit) or not-detect (miss) a briefly presented orientation change (target). They discovered two behavioral and physiological measures that are significantly different between hit and miss trials - pupil size tends to be slightly larger on hits vs. misses, and monkeys are more likely to miss the target on trials in which they made a microsaccade shortly before target onset. They also examined multiple measures of neural activity across the cortical layers and found some measures that are significantly different between hits and misses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall the study is well executed and the analyses are appropriate (with some possible caveats discussed below).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I have two remaining concerns. First, with the exception of the pre-target microsaccades, the correlates of perceptual variability (differences between hits and misses) appear to be weak and disconnected. The GLM analysis of the predictive power of trial outcome based on the behavioral and neural measures is only discussed at the end of the paper. This analysis shows that some of the measures have no significant predictive power, while others cannot be examined using the GLM analysis because these measures cannot be estimated in single trials. Given these weak and disconnected effects, my overall sense is that the current results provide a limited advance to our understanding of the neural basis of perceptual variability.</p>
<p>In addition, because the authors combine data across stimulus contrasts, I am somewhat uneasy about the possible confounding effect of contrast. As expected, stimulus contrast affected the probability of hits vs. misses. Independently, contrast may have affected some of the physiological measurements. Therefore, showing that contrast is not the source of the covariations between the physiological/behavioral measurements and perception can be challenging, and I am not convinced that the authors have ruled this out as a possible confound. It is unclear why the authors had to vary contrast in the first place, and why the analyses had to be done by combining the data across contrasts or by ignoring contrast as a variable (e.g., in the GLM analysis).</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As you can see from the assessment (which is unchanged from before) and the reviews included below, the reviewers felt that the revisions did not yet address all of the major concerns. There was agreement that the strength of evidence would be upgraded to &quot;solid&quot; by addressing, at minimum, the following:</p>
<p>(1) Which of the results are significant for individual monkeys; and</p>
<p>(2) How trials from different target contrasts were analyzed</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this revision, we have addressed the two primary editorial recommendations:</p>
<p>(1) We apologize if this information was not clear in the previous version. We have updated Table 1 to highlight clearly the significant results for individual monkeys. Six of our key results â pupil diameter (Fig 2B), microsaccades (Fig 2D), decoding performance for narrow-spiking units (Fig 3A), decoding performance for broad-spiking units (Fig 3B), target-evoked firing rate for all units (Fig 3E) and target-evoked firing rate for broad-spiking units (Fig 3F) â are significant for individual animals and therefore gives us high confidence regarding our results. Please also note that we present all results for individual animals in the Supplementary figures accompanying each main figure.</p>
<p>(2) We have updated the manuscript and methods to explain how trials of each contrast were included in each analysis, and how contrast normalization was performed for the analysis in Figure 3. In addition, we discuss this point in the Discussion section, which we quote below:</p>
<p>âNon-target stimulus contrasts were slightly different between hits and misses (mean: 33.1% in hits, 34.0% in misses, permutation test, ð = 0.02), but the contrast of the target was higher in hits compared to misses (mean: 38.7% in hits, 27.7% in misses, permutation test, ð = 1.6   ð â 31). To control for potential effects of stimulus contrast, firing rates were first normalized by contrast before performing the analyses reported in Figure 3. For all other results, we considered only non-target stimuli, which had very minor differences in contrast (&lt;1%) across hits and misses. In fact, this minor difference was in the opposite direction of our results with mean contrast being slightly higher for misses. While we cannot completely rule out any other effects of stimulus contrast, the normalization in Figure 3 and minor differences for non-target stimuli should minimize them.â</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>My main concern with this study is that, with the exception of the pre-target microsaccades, the correlates of perceptual variability (differences between hits and misses) appear to be weak, potentially unreliable and disconnected.

</disp-quote>
<p>Please see our response above to item #1 of the editorial recommendation. Six of our key results are individually significant in both animals giving us high confidence about the reliability and strength of our results.</p>
<p>Regarding the reviewerâs comment about the GLM, we note (also stated in the manuscript) that among the measures that we could estimate reliably on a single trial basis, two of these â pre-target microsaccades and input-layer firing rates â were reliable signatures of stimulus perception at threshold. This analysis does not imply that the other measures â Fano Factor, PPC, inter-laminar population correlations, SSC (which are all standard tools in modern systems neuroscience, and which cannot be estimated on a single-trial basis) â are irrelevant. Our intent in including the GLM analyses was to <italic>complement</italic> the results reported from these across-trial measures (Figs 4-7) with the predictive power of single-trial measures.</p>
<p>While no study is entirely complete in itself, we have attempted to synthesize our results into a conceptual model as depicted in Fig 8.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments were well-designed and executed with meticulous control. The analyses of both behavioural and electrophysiological data align with the standards in the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Many of the findings appear to be subtle differences and incremental compared to previous literature, including the authors' own work. While incremental findings are not necessarily a problem, the manuscript lacks clear statements about the extent to which the dataset, analysis, and findings overlap with the authors' prior research. For example, one of the main findings, which suggests that V4 neurons exhibit larger visual responses in hit trials (as shown in Fig. 3), appears to have been previously reported in their 2017 paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the assessment that the findings reported here are incremental over the results reported in our prior study (Nandy et al,. 2017). In the previous study, we compared the laminar profile of neural modulation due to the deployment of attention i.e. the main comparison points were the attend-in and the attend-away conditions while controlling for visual stimulation. In this study, we go one step further and home in on the attend-in condition and investigate the differences in the laminar profile of neural activity (and two additional physiological measures: pupil and microsaccades) when the animal either correctly reports or fails to report a stimulus with equal probability. We thus control for <italic>both</italic> the visual stimulation and the cued attention state of the animal. While there are parallels to our previous results (as the reviewer correctly noted), the results reported here cannot be trivially predicted from our previous results. Please also note that we discuss our new results in the context of prior results, from both our group and others, in the manuscript (lines 310-332).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, the manuscript does not explore potentially interesting aspects of the dataset. For instance, the authors could have investigated instances where monkeys made 'false' reports, such as executing saccades towards visual stimuli when no orientation change occurred, which allows for a broader analysis that considers the perceptual component of neural activity over pure sensory responses. Overall, lacking broad interest with the current form.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs feedback on analyzing false alarm trials. Our focus for this study was to investigate the behavioral and neural correlates accompanying a correct or incorrect perception of a target stimulus presented at perceptual threshold. False alarm trials, by definition, do not include a target presentation. Moreover, false alarm rates rapidly decline with duration into a trial, with high rates during the first non-target presentation and rates close to zero by the time of the eighth presentation (see figure). Investigating false alarms will thus involve a completely different form of analysis than we have undertaken here. We therefore feel that while analyzing false alarm trials will be an interesting avenue to pursue in the future, it is outside the scope of the present study.</p>
