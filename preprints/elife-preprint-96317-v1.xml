<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly serious threat to global public health. Our recent finding that many tRNA modification genes are involved in the response to antibiotics from different families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) led to further investigate the links between environmental factors (e.g. traces of antibiotics), tRNA modifications and bacterial survival to antibiotics. The regulatory roles of RNA modifications was first proposed for eukaryotes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) and their importance in human diseases has recently emerged(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). In bacteria, while some tRNA modifications are essential(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), the absence of many RNA modification shows no growth phenotype in unstressed cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). At the molecular level, the roles of tRNA modifications in differential codon decoding have been described in various species(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). In most cases, no growth phenotype was associated with these variations in decoding in bacteria. Recent studies, however, do highlight the links between tRNA modifications and stress responses in several bacterial species(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), and new modifications are still being discovered(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Until recently, few tRNA modification factors have been clearly linked with resistance and persistence to antibiotics, via differential codon decoding in cell membrane and efflux proteins (TrmD(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), MiaA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)). A link between stress and adaptation was described to occur via the existence of modification tunable transcripts, or MoTTs.</p>
<p>MoTTs were first (and mostly) defined in eukaryotes as transcripts that will be translated more or less efficiently depending on the presence or absence of tRNA modifications(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), namely upon stress(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). In bacteria, links between tRNA modifications and the response to several stresses are highlighted by studies focusing on the following MoTT/codon and tRNA modification couples (reviewed in(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>)): differential translation of RpoS/leucine codons via MiaA (<italic>E. coli</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>); Fur/serine codons via MiaB, in response to low iron (<italic>E. coli</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>); MgtA/proline codons via TrmD, in response to low magnesium(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>); catalases/phenylalanine and aspartate codons via TrmB, during oxidative stress (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Mycobacterial response to hypoxic stress(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) also features MoTTs. In this latter study, specific stress response genes were identified <italic>in silico,</italic> through their codon usage bias, and then experimentally confirmed for their differential translation. tRNA modification-dependent translational reprogramming in response to antibiotic stress has not been the focus of a study so far in bacteria.</p>
<p>During studies in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, we recently discovered that t/rRNA modifications play a central role in response to stress caused by antibiotics with very different modes of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), not through resistance development, but by modulating tolerance. The identified RNA modification genes had not previously been associated with any antibiotic resistance phenotype. The fact that different tRNA modifications have opposite effects on tolerance to different antibiotics highlights the complexity of such a network, and shows that the observed phenotypes are not merely due to a general mistranslation effect. Since tRNA modifications affect codon decoding and accuracy, it is important to address how differential translation can generate proteome diversity, and eventually adaptation to antibiotics.</p>
<p>In particular, deletion of the <italic>tgt</italic> gene encoding tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> confers a strong growth defect in the presence of aminoglycosides at doses below the minimal inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Tgt incorporates queuosine (Q) in the place of guanosine (G) in the wobble position of four tRNAs with GUN anticodon (tRNA-Asp GUC, tRNA-Asn GUU, tRNA-Tyr GUA, tRNA-His GUG)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The tRNAs with “AUN” anticodons are not present in the genome, and thus each one of the four GUN tRNAs decodes two synonymous codons (aspartate GAC/GAT, asparagine AAC/AAT, tyrosine TAC/TAT, histidine CAC/CAT which differ in the third position). Q is known to increase or decrease translation error rates in eukaryotes in a codon and organism specific manner(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Q was shown to induce mild oxidative stress resistance in the eukaryotic parasite <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, the causative agent of amebic dysentery, and to attenuate its virulence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the absence of Q modification was found to decrease mistranslation rates by tRNA-Tyr, while increasing it for tRNA-Asp(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). No significant biological difference was found in <italic>E. coli Δtgt</italic> mutant, except for a slight defect in stationary phase viability(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Recent studies show that the <italic>E. coli tgt</italic> mutant is more sensitive to aminoglycosides but not to ampicillin nor spectinomycin and is more sensitive to oxidative stress but the molecular mechanisms were not elucidated(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<p>We asked here how queuosine (Q) modification by Tgt modulates the response to sub-MIC aminoglycosides. We find that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> Δ<italic>tgt</italic> displays differential decoding of tyrosine TAC/TAT. Molecular reporters, coupled to proteomics and <italic>in silico</italic> analysis, reveal that several proteins with codon usage biased towards TAT (versus TAC) are more efficiently translated in Δ<italic>tgt</italic>. One of these proteins is RsxA, which prevents activation of SoxR oxidative stress response regulon(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We propose that sub-MIC TOB treatment leads to increased expression of <italic>tgt</italic> and Q modification, which in turn allows for more efficient Sox regulon related oxidative stress response, and better response to sub-MIC TOB. Lastly, bioinformatic analysis identified DNA repair gene transcripts with TAT codon bias as transcripts modulated by Q modification, which was confirmed by decreased UV susceptibility of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> Δ<italic>tgt</italic>.</p>

<title>Media and Growth Conditions</title>
<p>Platings were done at 37°C, in Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar media. Liquid cultures were grown at 37°C in MH in aerobic conditions, with 180 rotations per minute.</p>
<p><bold>Competition experiments</bold> were performed as described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>): overnight cultures from single colonies of mutant <italic>lacZ</italic>+ and WT <italic>lacZ</italic>-strains were washed in PBS (Phosphate Buffer Saline) and mixed 1:1 (500 μl + 500 μl). At this point 100 μl of the mix were serial diluted and plated on MH agar supplemented with X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside) at 40 μg/mL to assess T0 initial 1:1 ratio. At the same time, 10 μl from the mix were added to 2 mL of MH or MH supplemented with sub-MIC antibiotics (concentrations, unless indicated otherwise: TOB: tobramycin 0.6 μg/ml; GEN: 0.5 µg/ml; CIP: ciprofloxacin 0.01 μg/ml, CRB: carbenicillin 2.5 μg/ml), PQ: paraquat 10 µM, or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>: 0.5 mM. Cultures were incubated with agitation at 37°C for 20 hours, and then diluted and plated on MH agar plates supplemented with X-gal. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C and the number of blue and white CFUs was assessed. Competitive index was calculated by dividing the number of blue CFUs (<italic>lacZ</italic>+ strain) by the number of white CFUs (<italic>lacZ</italic>-strain) and normalizing this ratio to the T0 initial ratio. When a plasmid was present, antibiotic was added to maintain selection: kanamycin 50 µg/ml for pSEVA.</p>

<title>Construction of complementation and overexpression plasmids in pSEVA238</title>
<p>Genes were amplified on <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genomic DNA using primers listed in Table S4 and cloned into pSEVA238 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) under the dependence of the <italic>Pm</italic> promoter(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), by restriction digestion with XbaI+EcoRI and ligation using T4 DNA ligase. Sodium benzoate 1 mM was added in the medium as inducer.</p>
<p><bold>Survival/tolerance tests</bold> were performed on early exponential phase cultures. The overnight stationary phase cultures were diluted 1000x and grown until OD 600 nm = 0.35 to 0.4, at 37°C with shaking, in Erlenmeyers containing 25 mL fresh MH medium. Appropriate dilutions were plated on MH plates to determine the total number of CFUs in time zero untreated cultures. 5 mL of cultures were collected into 50 mL Falcon tubes and treated with lethal doses of desired antibiotics (5 or 10 times the MIC: tobramycin 5 or 10 μg/mL, carbenicillin 50 μg/mL, ciprofloxacin 0.025 μg/mL) for 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours and 4 hours if needed, at 37°C with shaking in order to guarantee oxygenation. Appropriate dilutions were then plated on MH agar without antibiotics and proportion of growing CFUs were calculated by doing a ratio with total CFUs at time zero. Experiments were performed 3 to 8 times.</p>

<title>MIC determination</title>
<p>Stationary phase cultures grown in MH were diluted 20 times in PBS, and 300 μL were plated on MH plates and dried for 10 minutes. Etest straps (Biomérieux) were placed on the plates and incubated overnight at 37°C.</p>
<p><bold>Quantification of fluorescent neomycin uptake</bold> was performed as described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Neo-Cy5 is the neomycin aminoglycoside coupled to the fluorophore Cy5, and has been shown to be active against Gram-bacteria(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Briefly, overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold in rich MOPS (Teknova EZ rich defined medium). When the bacterial strains reached an OD 600 nm of ∼0.25, they were incubated with 0.4 μM of Cy5 labeled neomycin for 15 minutes at 37°C. 10 μl of the incubated culture were then used for flow cytometry, diluting them in 250 μl of PBS before reading fluorescence. WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, was incubated simultaneously without neo-Cy5 as a negative control. Flow cytometry experiments were performed as described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) and repeated at least 3 times. For each experiment, 100,000 events were counted on the Miltenyi MACSquant device.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>PMF measurements</title>
<p>Quantification of PMF was performed using the Mitotracker Red CMXRos dye (Invitrogen) as described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), in parallel with the neo-Cy5 uptake assay, using the same bacterial cultures. 50 µL of each culture were mixed with 60 µL of PBS. Tetrachlorosalicylanilide TCS (Thermofischer), a protonophore, was used as a negative control with a 500 µM treatment applied for 10 minutes at room temperature. Then, 25 nM of Mitotracker Red were added to each sample and let at room temperature for 15 minutes under aluminium foil. 20 μL of the treated culture were then used for flow cytometry, diluted in 200 μL of PBS before reading fluorescence.</p>

<p>For RNA extraction, overnight cultures were diluted 1:1000 in MH medium and grown with agitation at 37°C until an OD600 of 0.3-0.4 (exponential phase). 0.5 mL of these cultures were centrifuged and supernatant removed. Pellets were homogenized by resuspension with 1.5 mL of room temperature TRIzol Reagent. Next, 300 μL chloroform were added to the samples following mix by vortexing. Samples were then centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes. Upper (aqueous) phase was transferred to a new 2mL tube and mixed with 1 volume of 70% ethanol. From this point, the homogenate was loaded into a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) column and RNA purification proceeded according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were then subjected to DNase treatment using TURBO DNA-free Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<p>Samples were analyzed on a high-resolution mass spectrometer, Q Exactive™ Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™ Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), coupled with an EASY 1200 nLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen). One µg of peptides was injected onto a home-made 50 cm C18 column (1.9 μm particles, 100 Å pore size, ReproSil-Pur Basic C18, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). Column equilibration and peptide loading were done at 900 bars in buffer A (0.1% FA). Peptides were separated with a multi-step gradient from 3 to 22 % buffer B (80% ACN, 0.1% FA) in 160 min, 22 to 50 % buffer B in 70 min, 50 to 90 % buffer B in 5 min at a flow rate of 250 nL/min.

All searches were performed with oxidation of methionine and protein N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications and cysteine carbamidomethylation as fixed modification. Trypsin was selected as protease allowing for up to two missed cleavages. The minimum peptide length was set to 5 amino acids. The false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide and protein identification was set to 0.01. The main search peptide tolerance was set to 4.5 ppm and to 20 ppm for the MS/MS match tolerance. One unique peptide to the protein group was required for the protein identification. A false discovery rate cut-off of 1 % was applied at the peptide and protein levels. All mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited at ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD035297.</p>
<p>The statistical analysis of the proteomics data was performed as follows: three biological replicates were acquired per condition. To highlight significantly differentially abundant proteins between two conditions, differential analyses were conducted through the following data analysis pipeline: (1) deleting the reverse and potential contaminant proteins; (2) keeping only proteins with at least two quantified values in one of the three compared conditions to limit misidentifications and ensure a minimum of replicability; (3) log2-transformation of the remaining intensities of proteins; (4) normalizing the intensities by median centering within conditions thanks to the normalizeD function of the R package DAPAR(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), (5) putting aside proteins without any value in one of both compared conditions: as they are quantitatively present in a condition and absent in another, they are considered as differentially abundant proteins and (6) performing statistical differential analysis on them by requiring a minimum fold-change of 2.5 between conditions and by using a LIMMA t test(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) combined with an adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg correction of the <italic>p</italic>-values thanks to the adjust.p function of the R package cp4p(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). The robust method of Pounds and Cheng was used to estimate the proportion of true null hypotheses among the set of statistical tests(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). The proteins associated with an adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value inferior to an FDR level of 1% have been considered as significantly differentially abundant proteins.

The codon usage bias for a given codon and a given gene was then computed by subtracting the corresponding proportion obtained from the global counts from the proportion obtained for this gene. Codon usage biases were then standardized by dividing each of the above difference by the standard deviation of these differences across all genes, resulting in standardized codon usage biases “by amino acid” (“SCUB by aa” in short).

<p>We confirmed <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae Δtgt</italic> strain’s growth defect in sub-MIC tobramycin (TOB) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>) and that expression of <italic>tgt</italic> in trans restores growth in these conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). We further tested tolerance to lethal antibiotic concentrations by measuring survival after antibiotic treatment during 15 minutes to 4 hours.

In specific cases, the levels of a given tRNA modification can depend on the presence of other ones(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). One example is the m<sup>5</sup>C38 modification of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> which is favored by the presence of Q in eukaryotes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). However, bacterial tRNAs do not harbor m<sup>5</sup>C and neither do they harbor mal-Q or gal-Q hypermodifications, unlike in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> is modified by RluF which introduces a pseudouridine (Ψ) at position 35 of the anticodon, next to the G/Q at position 34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>).

<title>Overexpression of the canonical tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup><sub>GUA</sub> rescues growth of <italic>Δtgt</italic> in TOB</title>
<p>We next investigated whether all four tRNAs with GUN anticodon modified to QUN by Tgt, are equally important for the TOB sensitivity phenotype of the <italic>Δtgt</italic> mutant: Aspartate (Asp)/Asparagine (Asn)/Tyrosine (Tyr)/Histidine (His). The absence of Q could have direct effects at the level of codon decoding but also indirect effects such as influencing tRNAs’ degradation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> levels showed no major differences between WT and <italic>Δtgt</italic> strains, making it unlikely that the effect of Q modification on codon decoding is caused by altered synthesis or degradation of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. S2A</xref></bold>). The levels of the other three tRNAs modified by Tgt also remained unchanged (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. S2A</xref></bold>). These results do not however exclude a more subtle or heterogeneous effect of Q modification on tRNA levels, which would be below the detection limits of the technique in a bacterial whole population.</p>
<p>We next adopted a tRNA overexpression strategy from a high copy plasmid. The following tRNAs-<sub>GUN</sub> are the canonical tRNAs which are present in the genome: Tyr<sub>GUA</sub> (codon TAC), His<sub>GUG</sub> (codon CAC), two isoforms of Asn<sub>GUU</sub> (codon AAC), Asp<sub>GUC</sub> (codon GAT). The following tRNAs-<sub>AUN</sub> are synthetic tRNAs which are not present in the genome: Tyr<sub>AUA</sub>, His<sub>AUG</sub>, Asn<sub>AUU</sub>, Asp<sub>AUC</sub>. tRNA<sup>Phe</sup><sub>GAA</sub> was also used as non Tgt-modified control. Overexpression of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, but not tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> rescues the <italic>Δtgt</italic> mutant’s growth defect in sub-MIC TOB (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref></bold>). Overexpression of tRNA<sup>His</sup><sub>AUG</sub> also seemed to confer a benefit compared to empty plasmid (p0), but not as strong as tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Sup.

<title>Q modification influences amino acid incorporation at tyrosine codons</title>
<p>We decided to measure the efficiency of amino acid incorporation at corresponding codons in <italic>Δtgt</italic>, using <italic>gfp</italic> reporters. First, we confirmed that GFP fluorescence from native GFP (encoded by <italic>gfpmut3</italic>) is not affected in <italic>Δtgt</italic> compared to WT (<italic>gfp+</italic> in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>), indicating that there are no major differences on expression or folding of the GFP in <italic>Δtgt</italic>. We next constructed <italic>gfp</italic> fluorescent reporters by introducing within their coding sequence, stretches of repeated identical codons, for Asp/Asn/Tyr/His. This set of reporters revealed that the absence of Q leads to an increase of amino acid incorporation at Tyr TAT codons, both without and with sub-MIC TOB (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold> NT and TOB). This was not the case for Asp (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), nor for Asn (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), and we observed a slighter and more variable change for His (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). No significant effect of <italic>tgt</italic> was observed for 2<sup>nd</sup> near-cognate codons obtained by changing 1 base of the triplet for TAC and TAT codons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>): Phe TTC/TTT, Cys TGT/TGC, Ser TCT/TCC (the 3<sup>rd</sup> near-cognate stop codons TAA and TAG were not tested in this setup).

<title>The absence of Q decreases misincorporation at Tyr TAT</title>
<p>GFP reporters tested above with codon stretches were pivotal for the identification of codons for which decoding efficiency differs between WT and <italic>Δtgt</italic>, even though it’s not a natural setup. We next developed a biologically relevant β-lactamase reporter tool to assess differences in the decoding of the tyrosine codons in WT and <italic>Δtg</italic>t strains. The amino acid Tyr103 of the β-lactamase, was previously shown to be important for its function in resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, such as carbenicillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). We replaced the native Tyr103 TAC with the synonymous codon Tyr103 TAT (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). While in the WT, both versions of β-lactamase conferred similar growth in carbenicillin with or without sub-MIC TOB (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3AB</xref></bold>), in the <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain the Tyr-TAT version grows better than the Tyr-TAC version upon exposure to TOB stress (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3CD</xref></bold>).

<p>Presence or absence of a modification could also affect aminoacylation of the tRNA. Both TAT and TAC codons are decoded by the same and only one tRNA, tRNA<sup>TYR</sup><sub>GUA</sub>. In this case, a defect in aminoacylation of this tRNA would impact the decoding of both codons. Our results do not support such an aminoacylation problem, because the efficiency of decoding of TAT but not TAC increases in <italic>Δtgt</italic>, and the difference is clearer in TOB. These results are also consistent with rescue of TOB-sensitive phenotype by tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup><sub>GUA</sub> but not tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup><sub>AUA</sub> overexpression in <italic>Δtgt</italic>.</p>
<p>Altogether, results suggest that in the presence of sub-MIC TOB stress, the absence of Q namely leads to better translation of the TAT vs TAC codon, leading to differential translation of proteins with codon usage biases towards TAC or TAT codons.</p>

<title>Proteomics study identifies RsxA among factors for which translation is most impacted in <italic>Δtgt</italic></title>
<p>These observations show a link between Q modification of tRNA, differential decoding of Tyr codons (among others) and susceptibility to aminoglycosides. We hypothesized that proteins that are differentially translated according to their Tyr codon usage could be involved in the decreased efficiency of the response to aminoglycoside stress in <italic>Δtgt.</italic> We conducted a proteomics study comparing WT vs <italic>Δtgt,</italic> in the absence and presence of sub-MIC TOB (proteomics <bold><xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). Loss of Q results in generally decreased detection of many proteins in TOB (shift towards the left in the volcano plot <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4AB</xref></bold>), and in increases in the levels of 96 proteins. Among those, RsxA (encoded by VC1017) is 13-fold more abundant in the <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain compared to WT in TOB. RsxA is part of an anti-SoxR complex. SoxR is an oxidative stress response regulator(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) that controls <italic>sodA</italic> (VC2694, superoxide dismutase) and <italic>acrA</italic> (VC0913, efflux), among other genes of the regulon.

Consistently, we find that the levels of SodA and AcrA proteins are decreased in <italic>Δtgt</italic> compared to WT in TOB (indicated in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). With 83% of Tyr-TAT codons, instead of the expected 53% average, RsxA has a clear codon usage bias. To test whether some of the differentially abundant protein groups in the Q deficient mutant show similar biases, the Tyr codon usage was calculated for the 96 more abundant and 195 less abundant proteins expressed in TOB.

<p>We thus performed Ribo-seq (ribosome profiling) analysis on extracts from WT and <italic>Δtgt</italic> strains grown in presence of sub-MIC TOB. Unlike for eukaryotes, technical limitations (e.g. the RNase which is used displays significant sequence specificity), do not allow to obtain codon resolution in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). However, we determined 159 transcripts with increased and 197 with decreased translation in <italic>Δtgt</italic> and we plotted their standardized codon usage bias for codons of interest (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4DEFG</xref></bold>). The calculation of this value is explained in details in the materials and methods section, and shown for <italic>rsxA</italic> as example in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref></bold>. Briefly, we took as reference the mean proportion of the codons of interest in the genome (e.g. for tyrosine: TAT= 0.53 and TAC= 0.47, meaning that for a random <italic>V. cholerae</italic> gene, 53% of tyrosine codons are TAT). For each gene, we calculated the proportion of each codon (e.g. for <italic>rsxA</italic>: TAT=0.83 and TAC=0.17). We next calculated the codon usage bias as the difference between a given gene’s codon usage and the mean codon usage (e.g. for <italic>rsxA</italic>, the codon usage bias for TAT is 0.83-0.53=+0.30). Finally, in order to consider the codon distribution on the genome and obtain statistically significant values, we calculated standardized bias by dividing the codon usage bias by standard deviation for each codon (e.g. for <italic>rsxA</italic>, 0.30/0.25 = +1.20). This is done to adjust standard deviation to 1, and thus to get comparable (standardized) values, for each codon.</p>
<p>Ribo-seq data <bold>(<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref></bold>) shows that TAT (and GAT) codon usage was decreased in the list of transcripts with decreased translation in <italic>Δtgt</italic>, while it was increased in the list of transcripts with increased translation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4DE</xref></bold>). No difference was detected for AAT and CAT (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4FG</xref></bold>). Data is thus consistent with more efficient translation of TAT codons in <italic>Δtgt</italic>.</p>
<p>In addition to mistranslation and codon decoding efficiency, other factors also influence detected protein levels, such as transcription, degradation, etc. Moreover, the localization and sequence context of the codons for which the efficiency of translation is impacted, may be important. Nevertheless, as translation of proteins with a codon usage bias towards TAC or TAT may be impacted in <italic>Δtgt</italic>, and as the most abundant protein RsxA in <italic>Δtgt</italic> in TOB shows a strong TAT bias, we decided to evaluate whether RsxA is post-transcriptionally regulated by the Q modification and whether it may affect fitness in the presence of TOB.</p>

<title>RsxA is post-transcriptionally upregulated in <italic>Δtgt</italic> due to more efficient decoding of tyrosine TAT codons in the absence of Q modification</title>
<p>Transcriptomic analysis comparing at least 2-fold differentially expressed genes between <italic>V. cholerae Δtgt</italic> and WT strains (<bold><xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref></bold>) showed that, respectively, 53 and 26 genes were significantly downregulated in MH and sub-MIC TOB, and 34 were up in sub-MIC TOB. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the most impacted GO categories were bacteriocin transport and iron import into the cell (45- and 40-fold enriched) in MH, and proteolysis and response to heat (38- and 15-fold enriched) in TOB. In both conditions, the levels of <italic>rsxA</italic> transcript remained unchanged.</p>
<p>RsxA carries 6 tyrosine codons among which the first 5 are TAT and the last one is TAC. RsxA is 13-fold more abundant in <italic>Δtgt</italic> than WT, but transcript levels measured by digital RT-PCR are comparable in both strains <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>), consistent with RNA-seq data. We constructed transcriptional and translational <italic>gfp</italic> fusions in order to evaluate the expression of <italic>rsxA</italic> in WT and <italic>Δtgt</italic> strains. As expected from digital RT-PCR results, no significant differences in fluorescence were observed for the transcriptional fusion of the <italic>rsxA</italic> promoter with <italic>gfp</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>), excluding transcriptional regulation of <italic>rsxA</italic> in this context. For translational fusions, we used either the native <italic>rsxA</italic> sequence bearing 5 TAT + 1 TAC codons, or a mutant <italic>rsxA</italic> allele carrying all 6 TAC codons (hereafter called respectively RsxA<sup>TAT</sup> and RsxA<sup>TAC</sup>). Confirming the proteomics results, the RsxA<sup>TAT</sup>-GFP fusion was more fluorescent in the <italic>Δtgt</italic> mutant, but not the RsxA<sup>TAC</sup>-GFP one (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold> and detailed flow cytometry data in <bold>Sup. <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3ABC</xref></bold>). Since increased <italic>rsxA</italic> expression appeared to be somewhat toxic for growth, and in order to test translation on a reporter which confers no growth defect, we chose to test directly the translation of <italic>gfp</italic>, which originally carries 4 TAT (36%) and 7 TAC (64%) codons in its native sequence. We constructed two synonymous versions of the GFP protein, with all 11 tyrosine codons either changed to TAT or to TAC. Similar to what we observed with <italic>rsxA</italic>, the GFP<sup>TAT</sup> version, but not the GFP<sup>TAC</sup> one, generated more fluorescence in the <italic>Δtgt</italic> background, (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold> and detailed flow cytometry data in <bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Sup.

<p>Since not all TAT biased proteins are found to be enriched in <italic>Δtgt</italic> proteomics data, the sequence context surrounding TAT codons could affect their decoding. Overall, our results demonstrate that RsxA is upregulated in the <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain at the translational level, and that proteins with a codon usage bias towards tyrosine TAT are prone to be more efficiently translated in the absence of Q modification, but this is also dependent on the sequence context.</p>

<title>Increased expression of RsxA hampers growth in sub-MIC TOB</title>
<p>We asked whether high levels of RsxA could be responsible of <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain’s increased sensitivity to TOB. <italic>rsxA</italic> cannot be deleted since it is essential in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (see our TN-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>)). We overexpressed <italic>rsxA</italic> from an inducible plasmid in WT strain (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Sup.

This shows that increased <italic>rsxA</italic> levels can be toxic during growth in sub-MIC TOB and is consistent with decreased growth of the <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain.</p>
<p>Unlike for <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, <italic>rsxA</italic> is not an essential gene in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and does not bear a TAT bias. It has however the same function. In order to confirm that the presence of RsxA can be toxic during growth in sub-MIC TOB, we additionally performed competition experiments in <italic>E. coli</italic> with simple and double mutants of <italic>tgt</italic> and <italic>rsxA</italic>.

<p>Regarding induction by sub-MIC TOB, the mechanism remains to be determined.

Since induction of <italic>tgt</italic> expression by SHX and by TOB seems to be in the same order of magnitude, we hypothesized that sub-MIC TOB could induce <italic>tgt</italic> through the activation of the stringent response. Using a <italic>P1rrnB-gfp</italic> fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), which is down-regulated upon stringent response induction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>), we found that the stringent response is significantly induced by sub-MIC TOB, both in WT and <italic>Δtgt</italic>.

<title>Q modification levels can be dynamic and are directly influenced by <italic>tgt</italic> transcription levels</title>
<p>We have identified conditions regulating <italic>tgt</italic> expression. We next addressed whether up/down-regulation of <italic>tgt</italic> affects the actual Q modification levels of tRNA. We measured Q levels by mass spectrometry in WT and the <italic>Δcrp</italic> strain, where the strongest impact on <italic>tgt</italic> expression was observed (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref></bold>). We find a significant 1.6-fold increase in Q levels in <italic>Δcrp</italic>. We also tested the effect of sub-MIC TOB, but smaller differences are probably not detected using our approach of mass spectrometry in bulk cultures.</p>
<p>In order to get deeper insight into modification level of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> tRNAs potentially having Q34 modification, we decided to adapt a recently published protocol for the detection and quantification of queuosine by deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). This allowed us to validate the presence of Q34 modification in the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> tRNAs Asp, His and Asn_GTT2 and precisely measure its level and modulation under different growth conditions (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref></bold>). We also showed that Q34 detection is robust and reproducible, and reveals increased Q34 content for tRNA<sup>His</sup> and tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> in <italic>Δcrp</italic> strain where <italic>tgt</italic> expression was induced, while for tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> Q34 level remains relatively constant. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> tRNA<sup>Asn</sup>_GTT1 is very low expressed and likely contains only sub-stoichiometric amounts of Q34, while analysis of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> is impeded by the presence of other modifications in the anticodon loop (namely i<sup>6</sup>A37 or its derivatives), which prevents the correct mapping and quantification of Q34 modifications using deletion signature. In order to evaluate Q34 levels in tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> more specifically, we performed APB northern blots allowing visualization and quantification of Q-modified and unmodified tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). As anticipated from increased <italic>tgt</italic> expression, Q-modified tRNA levels were strongly increased in <italic>Δcrp</italic> strain. Sub-MIC TOB also increases the proportion of Q containing tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> compared to the non-treated condition (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref></bold>). However, this result was variable suggesting a subtle fine-tuning of the Q levels depending on growth state (optical density) and TOB concentration. These results show that tRNA Q modification levels are dynamic and correlate with variations in <italic>tgt</italic> expression, depending on the tRNA.</p>

<title>DNA repair genes are TAT-biased</title>
<p>We further analyzed <italic>in silico</italic> the codon usage of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome, and for each gene, we assigned a codon usage value to each codon (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C and</xref></bold> doi:10.5281/zenodo.6875293).

We hypothesized that translation of DNA repair transcripts could be more efficient in <italic>Δtgt</italic>, and that such basal pre-induction would be beneficial during genotoxic treatments as UV irradiation (single stranded DNA breaks). UV associated DNA damage is repaired through RecA, RecFOR and RuvAB dependent homologous recombination.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We show here that Q modification levels can be dynamic in bacteria and respond to external conditions; and that Q levels on <italic>V. cholerae</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> correlate with <italic>tgt</italic> expression. This is clearer in conditions where <italic>tgt</italic> transcription is highly induced (<italic>Δcrp</italic>), and more variable in conditions where this induction is intermediate (sub-MIC TOB). As summarized in <bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref></bold>, we propose that exposure to sub-MIC aminoglycosides increases <italic>tgt</italic> expression in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, and impacts the decoding of tyrosine codons. The TAT biased transcripts RsxA is an anti-SoxR factor. SoxR controls a regulon involved in oxidative stress response and sub-MIC aminoglycosides trigger oxidative stress in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). A link between Q and oxidative stress has also been previously found in eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Better decoding at TAT versus TAC codons in the absence of Q observed here in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is also consistent with recent findings in human tRNAs, where the presence of Q increases translation of transcripts biased in C-ending codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). Our findings are in accordance with the concept of the so-called modification tunable transcripts (MoTTs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). We thus show that a proteins’ codon content can influence its translation in a Q modification dependent way, and that this can also impact the translation of antibiotic resistance genes (here β-lactamase). Note that, our results do not exclude the involvement of additional Q-regulated MoTTs in the response to sub-MIC TOB, since Q modification leads to reprogramming of the whole proteome. Finally, we show that we can predict <italic>in silico</italic>, candidates for which translation can be modulated by the presence or absence of Q modification (e.g. DNA repair genes), which was confirmed using phenotypic tests (UV resistance).</p>

<caption><title>Model.</title>
<p>Upon exposure to sub-MIC aminoglycosides, the expression of <italic>tgt</italic> is up-regulated in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and influences the decoding of tyrosine TAC vs TAT codons. This leads to differential translation from transcripts bearing a codon usage bias for tyrosine codons. The <italic>rsxA</italic> transcript bears a tyrosine codon bias and its translation can be tuned by tRNA Q modification. RsxA is an anti-SoxR factor. SoxR controls a regulon involved in oxidative stress response. When RsxA levels are high, SoxR is increasingly inactivated and oxidative stress response efficiency decreases. It has been previously shown that sub-MIC aminoglycosides trigger oxidative stress in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). Increasing RsxA levels thus reduces fitness in TOB by hampering efficient oxidative stress response. As a corollary, decreased RsxA would lead to increased expression of the SoxR regulon, which would allow for more efficient response to oxidative stress, and increased fitness in the presence of sub-MIC TOB. We propose that when Tgt/Q levels in tRNA increase, RsxA synthesis is low and active SoxR levels are high, facilitating the bacterial response to aminoglycoside dependent oxidative stress.</p></caption>

<p>Essential/housekeeping genes are generally TAC biased (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. S6AB</xref></bold>), as well as ribosomal proteins, which carry mostly tyrosine TAC codons both in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. It has been proposed that codon bias corresponding to abundant tRNAs at such highly expressed genes, guarantees their proper expression and avoids titration of tRNAs, allowing for efficient expression of the rest of the proteome(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). Induction of <italic>tgt</italic> by stress could also possibly be a signal for the cell to favor the synthesis of essential factors. Our results are also consistent with the fact that synonymous mutations can influence the expression of genes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>V. cholerae</italic> is the model organism for different species of <italic>Vibrio</italic>. We have previously shown that <italic>V. cholerae’s</italic> response to sub-MIC antibiotic stress is transposable to other Gram-negative pathogens (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></italic>), while there are differences between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, in the response to sub-MIC antibiotics and oxidative stress phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>). Here, we have also addressed some of the effects of TOB in <italic>E. coli Δtgt</italic> mutant. In <italic>E. coli,</italic> the deletion of <italic>tgt</italic> has a less dramatic effect on the susceptibility to TOB ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) and <bold><xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Sup. Fig S4F</xref></bold>). <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> globally show similar tyrosine codon usage in their genomes (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. S6AB</xref></bold>). However, <italic>E. coli rsxA</italic> does not display a codon bias towards TAT, and neither do DNA repair genes. One can think that in regard to MoTTs, different organisms have evolved according to the environments where they grow, selecting the integration of specific stress response pathways under specific post-transcriptional regulations.</p>
<p>It was recently shown that <italic>E. coli Δtgt</italic> strain is more resistant than the WT to nickel toxicity, most certainly because the nickel importer genes <italic>nikABCDE</italic> are less expressed, but the underlying molecular mechanism had not been elucidated(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). As NikR, the repressor of the <italic>nik</italic> operon is enriched in TAT codons (100%), a more efficient translation of the <italic>nikR</italic> gene in the absence of Q would lead to the observed repression phenotype. In addition, the nickel exporter gene <italic>rcnA</italic> is also enriched is TAT (100%), while one of the genes for subunits of the nickel importer <italic>nikD</italic> is enriched in TAC codons (100%). In combination this could explain the clear resistance of the <italic>tgt</italic> strain to high levels of nickel.</p>
<p>However, protein levels are not always in line with the codon bias predictions. The positions of the codons of interest and their sequence context may also be important for differential translation. The presence of the codon of interest in the 5’-end vs 3’-end of a transcript could have a bigger impact on the efficiency of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>). A recent study testing TAC/TAT codons placed between two genes in a translational fusion yielded different results compared to our constructs with the tested codons at the 5’ of the transcript(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>). Similarly, the distance between two codons of interest, or the identity of the nearby codons may be important. The translation of highly transcribed genes and genes with low levels of mRNAs could be dissimilar. Codon usage may also directly impact gene expression at mRNA levels with an effect on transcription termination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>), especially for constitutive genes. Thus, the search for MoTTs could be facilitated by comparing transcriptomics to proteomics data, and additional experiments need to be performed to elucidate post-transcriptional regulation-related phenotypes, but the differential expression of specific TAT/TAC biased proteins finally allows to propose a model for the pleiotropic phenotype caused by Q deficiency in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>
<p>Studies, mostly in eukaryotes, reveal that tRNA modifications are dynamic and not static as initially thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>). Modification levels depend on growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>), environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>) and stress (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>)). Stress regulated tRNA modification levels have an impact on the translation of regulators, which in turn trigger translational reprogramming and optimized responses to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>). We show here that <italic>tgt</italic> expression is regulated by sub-MIC TOB, the stringent response and CRP, and that tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> Q modification levels increase with <italic>tgt</italic> expression. The fact that such correlation between <italic>tgt</italic> expression and Q levels does not occur for all tRNAs (e.g. tRNA<sup>Asp</sup>), indicates that other parameters also influence Q modification levels. One possibility is that other modifications, such as those on the anticodon loop of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, may influence the way Tgt modifies these tRNAs, as documented for other modification circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>). Tgt may also bind these tRNAs differently (for a review on modification specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>)). Since sub-MIC TOB triggers the stringent response, one hypothesis could be that sub-MIC TOB induces <italic>tgt</italic> through stringent response activation. The stringent response is usually triggered upon starvation, for example when amino acids are scarce. <italic>tgt</italic> expression was also recently shown to be regulated by tyrosine levels and to affect tRNA-Tyr codon choice in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding CRP, the carbon catabolite regulator, it represses transcription of <italic>tgt</italic>. Interestingly, <italic>V. cholerae crp</italic> carries only TAC codons for tyrosine, and is strongly down-regulated in <italic>Δtgt</italic> in our Ribo-seq data, while its transcription levels remain unchanged. The downregulation of CRP translation when Q modifications are low (as in the <italic>Δtgt</italic> strain), could be a way to de-repress <italic>tgt</italic> and increase Q modification levels. Note that CRP is involved in natural competence of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, during growth on crustacean shells where horizontal gene transfer occurs. One can thus speculate that during exogenous DNA uptake, <italic>tgt</italic> repression by CRP could lead to better decoding of AT rich (i.e. TAT biased) mRNAs. Thus, modulation of <italic>tgt</italic> levels during natural transformation may modulate the expression of horizontally transferred genes, which by definition may bear different GC content and codon usage. Moreover, if <italic>tgt</italic> expression is repressed by CRP during competence state, this would favor the translation of TAT-biased DNA repair genes and possibly recombination of incoming DNA into the chromosome. Translational reprogramming in response to DNA damage can thus be an advantageous property selected during evolution.</p>
<p>Our results also demonstrate that we can identify other Q-dependent MoTT candidates using <italic>in silico</italic> codon usage analysis. In fact, since we now have extensively calculated the codon usage biases at all codons for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> genes, this approach is readily adaptable to any tRNA modification for which we know the differentially translated codons. Such regulation may be a possible way to tune the expression of essential or newly acquired genes, differing in GC-content. It may also, in some cases, explain antibiotic resistance profiles in bacterial collections with established genome sequences, and for which observed phenotypic resistance does not always correlate with known resistance factors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>). Further studies are needed to characterize the determinants of tRNA modification-dependent translational reprogramming.</p>

<p>This study investigates the role of queuosine (Q) tRNA modification in aminoglycoside tolerance in Vibrio cholerae and presents <bold>convincing</bold> evidence to conclude that Q is essential for the efficient translation of TAT codons, although this depends on the context. The absence of Q reduces aminoglycoside tolerance potentially by reprogramming the translation of an oxidative stress response gene, rxsA. Overall, the findings point to an <bold>important</bold> mechanism whereby changes in Q modification levels control the decoding of mRNAs enriched in TAT codons under antibiotic stress.</p>

<p>Summary of the work: In this work, Fruchard et. al. study the enzyme Tgt and how it modifies guanine in tRNAs to queuosine (Q), essential for Vibrio cholerae's growth under aminoglycoside stress. Q's role in codon decoding efficiency and its proteomic effects during antibiotic exposure is examined, revealing Q modification impacts tyrosine codon decoding and influences RsxA translation, affecting the SoxR oxidative stress response. The research proposes Q modification's regulation under environmental cues reprograms the translation of genes with tyrosine codon bias, including DNA repair factors, crucial for bacterial antibiotic response.</p>
<p>The experiments are well-designed and conducted and the conclusions, for the most part, are well supported by the data. However, a few clarifications will significantly strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>
Figure S4 A-D. These growth curves are important data and should be presented in the main figures. Moreover, given that it is not possible to make a rsxA mutant, I wonder if it would be possible to connect rsx and tgt using the following experiment: expression of tgt results in resistance to TOB (in B), while expression of only rsx lower resistance to TOB (in D). Then simultaneous overexpression of both tgt/rsx in the WT strain should have either no effect on TOB resistance or increased resistance, relative to the WT. Perhaps the authors have done this, and if so, the data should be included as it will significantly strengthen their model.</p>
<p>Figure S4 - Is there a rationale for why it is possible to make rsx mutants in E. coli, but not in V. cholerae? For example, does E. coli have a second gene/protein that is redundant in function to rsxA, while V. cholerae does not? I think your data hint at this, since in the right panel growth data, your double mutant does not fully rescue back to rsx single mutant levels, suggesting another factor in tgt mutant also acts to lower resistance to TOB. If so, perhaps a line or two in text will be helpful for readers.</p>
<p>-For growth curves in Figure 2 and relative comparisons like in Figure 5D and Figure S4 (and others in the paper), statistics and error bars, along with replicate information should be provided.</p>
<p>-Figure 6A - Is the transcript fold change in linear or log? If linear, then tgt expression should not be classified as being upregulated in TOB. It is barely up by ~2-fold with TOB- 0.6....which is a mild phenotype, at best.</p>
<p>-Line 779- 780: &quot;This indicates that sub-MIC TOB possibly induces tgt expression through the stringent response activation.&quot; To me, the data presented in this figure, do not support this statement. The experiment is indirect.</p>
<p>-Figure 3B and D. - These samples only have tobramycin, correct? The legend says both carbenicillin and tobramycin.</p>
<p>-Figure 5. The color schemes in bars do not match up with the color scheme in cartoons below panels B and C. That makes it confusing to read. Please fix.</p>
<p>-A lot of abbreviations have been used. This makes reading a bit cumbersome. Ideally, less abbreviations will be used.</p>

<p>Fruchard et al. investigate the role of the queuosine (Q) modification of the tRNA (Q-tRNA) in the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae. First, the authors state that the absence of Q-modified tRNAs (tgt mutant) increases the translation of TAT codons and proteins with a high TAT codon bias. Second, the absence of Q increases rsxA translation, because rsxA gene has a high TAT codon bias. Third, increased RsxA in the absence of Q inhibits SoxR response, reducing resistance towards the antibiotic tobramycin (TOB). Authors also predict in silico which genes harbor a higher TAT bias and found that among them are some involved in DNA repair, experimentally observing that a tgt mutant is more resistant to UV than the wt strain. It is worth noting that authors employ a wide variety of techniques, both experimental and bioinformatic. However, some aspects of the work need to be clarified or reevaluated.</p>
<p>(1) The statement that the absence of Q increases the translation of TAT codons and proteins encoded by TAT-enriched genes presents the following problems that should be addressed:</p>
<p>(1.1) The increase in TAT codon translation in the absence of Q is not supported by proteomics, since there was no detected statistical difference for TAT codon usage in proteins differentially expressed. Furthermore, there are some problems regarding the statistics of proteomics. Some proteins shown in Table S1 have adjusted p-values higher than their p-values, which makes no sense. Maybe there is a mistake in the adjusted p-value calculation. In addition, it is not common to assume that proteins that are quantitatively present in one condition and absent in another are differentially abundant proteins. Proteomics data software typically addresses this issue and applies some corrections. It would be advisable to review that.</p>
<p>(1.2) Problems with the interpretation of Ribo-seq data (Figure 4D). On the one hand, the Ribo-seq data should be corrected (normalized) with the RNA-seq data in each of the conditions to obtain ribosome profiling data, since some genes could have more transcription in some of the conditions studied. In other articles in which this technique is used (such as in Tuorto et al., EMBO J. 2018; doi: 10.15252/embj.201899777), it is interpreted that those positions in which the ribosome moves most slowly and therefore less efficiently translated), are the most abundant. Assuming this interpretation, according to the hypothesis proposed in this work, the fragments enriched in TAT codons should have been less abundant in the absence of Q-tRNA (tgt mutant) in the Rib-seq experiment. However, what is observed is that TAT-enriched fragments are more abundant in the tgt mutant, and yet the Ribo-seq results are interpreted as RNA-seq, stating that this is because the genes corresponding to those sequences have greater expression in the absence of Q. On the other hand, it would be interesting to calculate the mean of the protein levels encoded by the transcripts with high and low ribosome profiling data.</p>
<p>(1.3) This statement is contrary to most previously reported studies on this topic in eukaryotes and bacteria, in which ribosome profiling experiments, among others, indicate that translation of TAT codons is slower (or unaffected) than translation of the TAC codons, and the same phenomenon is observed for the rest of the NAC/T codons. This is completely opposed to the results showed in Figure 4. However, the results of these studies are either not mentioned or not discussed in this work. Some examples of articles that should be discussed in this work:</p>
<p>
- &quot;Queuosine-modified tRNAs confer nutritional control of protein translation&quot; (Tuorto et al., 2018; 10.15252/embj.201899777)</p>
<p>
- &quot;Preferential import of queuosine-modified tRNAs into Trypanosoma brucei mitochondrion is critical for organellar protein synthesis&quot; (Kulkarni et al., 2021; doi:10.1093/nar/gkab567.</p>
<p>
- &quot;Queuosine-tRNA promotes sex-dependent learning and memory formation by maintaining codon-biased translation elongation speed&quot; (Cirzi et al., 2023; 10.15252/embj.2022112507)</p>
<p>
- &quot;Glycosylated queuosines in tRNAs optimize translational rate and post-embryonic growth&quot; (Zhao et al., 2023; 10.1016/j.cell.2023.10.026)</p>
<p>
- &quot;tRNA queuosine modification is involved in biofilm formation and virulence in bacteria&quot; (Diaz-Rullo and Gonzalez-Pastor, 2023; doi: 10.1093/nar/gkad667). In this work, the authors indicate that Q-tRNA increases NAT codon translation in most bacterial species. Could the regulation of TAT codon-enriched proteins by Q-tRNAs in V. cholerae an exception? In addition, authors use a bioinformatic method to identify genes enriched in NAT codons similar to the one used in this work, and to find in which biological process are involved the genes whose expression is affected by Q-tRNAs (as discussed for the phenotype of UV resistance). It will be worth discussing all of this.</p>
<p>(1.4) It is proposed that the stress produced by the TOB antibiotic causes greater translation of genes enriched in TAT codons. On the one hand, it is shown that the GFP-TAT version (gene enriched in TAT codons) and the RsxA-TAT-GFP protein (native gene naturally enriched in TAT) are expressed more, compared to their versions enriched in TAC in a tgt mutant than in a wt, in the presence of TBO (Fig. 5C). However, in the absence of TOB, and in a wt context, although the two versions of GFP have a similar expression level (Fig. 3SD), the same does not occur with RsxA, whose RsxA-TAT form (the native one) is expressed significantly more than the RsxA-TAC version (Fig. 3SA). How can it be explained that in a wt context, in which there are also tRNA Q-modification, a gene naturally enriched in TAT is translated better than the same gene enriched in TAC? It would be expected that in the presence of Q-tRNAs the two versions would be translated equally (as happens with GFP) or even the TAT version would be less translated. On the other hand, in the presence of TOB the fluorescence of WT GFP(TAT) is higher than the fluorescence of WT GFP(TAC) (Figure S3E) (mean fluorescence data for RsxA-GFP version in the presence of TOB is not shown). These results may indicate that the apparent better translation of TAT versions could be due to indirect effects rather from TAT codon translation.</p>
<p>(2) Another problem is related to the already known role of Q in prevention of stop codon readthrough, which is not discuss at all in the work. In the absence of Q, stop codon readthrough is increased. In addition, it is known that aminoglycosides (such as tobramycin) also increase stop codon readthrough (&quot;Stop codon context influences genome-wide stimulation of termination codon readthrough by aminoglycosides&quot;; Wanger and Green, 2023; 10.7554/eLife.52611). Absence of Q and presence of aminoglycosides can be synergic, producing devastating increases in stop codon readthrough and a large alteration of global gene expression. All of these needs to be discussed in the work. Moreover, it is known that stop codon readthrough can alter gene expression and mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of stop codon readthrough. Thus, this process could also affect to the expression of recoded GFP and RsxA versions.</p>
<p>(3) The statement about that the TOB resistance depends on RsxA translation, which is related to the presence of Q, also presents some problems:</p>
<p>(3.1) It is observed that the absence of tgt produces a growth defect in V. cholerae when exposed to TOB (Figure 1A), and it is stated that this is mediated by an increase in the translation of RsxA, because its gene is TAT enriched. However, in Figure S4F, it is shown that the same phenotype is observed in E. coli, but its rsxA gene is not enriched in TAT codons. Therefore, the growth defect observed in the tgt mutant in the presence of TOB may not be due to the increase in the translation of TAT codons of the rsxA gene in the absence of Q. This phenotype is very interesting, but it may be related to another molecular process regulated by Q. Maybe the role of Q in preventing stop codon readthrough is important in this process, reducing cellular stress in the presence of TOB and growing better.</p>
<p>(3.2) All experiments related to the effect of Q on the translation of TAT codons have been performed with the tgt mutant strain. Considering that the authors have a pSEVA-tgt plasmid to overexpress this gene, they would have to show whether tgt overexpression in a wt strain produces a decrease in the translation of proteins encoded by TAT-enriched genes such as RsxA. This experiment would allow them to conclude that Q reduces RsxA levels, increasing resistance to TOB.</p>
<p>(3.3) On the other hand, Fig. 1B shows that when the wt and tgt strains compete, both overexpressing tgt, the tgt mutant strain grows better in the presence of TOB. This result is not very well understood, since according to the hypothesis proposed, the absence of modification by Q of the tRNA would increase the translation of genes enriched in TAT, therefore, a strain with a higher proportion of Q-modified tRNAs as in the case of the wt strain overexpressing tgt would express the rsxA gene less than the tgt strain overexpressing tgt and would therefore grow better in the presence of TOB. For all these reasons, it would be necessary to evaluate the effect of tgt overexpression on the translation of RsxA.</p>
<p>(3.4) According to Figure 1I, the overexpression of tRNA-Tyr(GUA) caused a better growth of tgt mutant in comparison to WT. If the growth defect observed in tgt mutant in the presence of TOB is due to a better translation of the TAT codons of rsxA gene, the overexpression of tRNA-Tyr(GUA) in the tgt mutant should have resulted in even better RsxA translation a worse growth, but not the opposite result.</p>
<p>(4) It cannot be stated that DNA repair is more efficient in the tgt mutant of V. cholerae, as indicated in the text of the article and in Fig 7. The authors only observe that the tgt mutant is more resistant to UV radiation and it is suggested that the reason may be TAT bias of DNA repair genes. To validate the hypothesis that UV resistance is increased because DNA repair genes are TAT biased, it would be necessary to check if DNA repair is affected by Q. UV not only produces DNA damage, but also oxidative stress. Therefore, maybe this phenotype is due to the increase in proteins related to oxidative stress controlled by RsxA, such as the superoxide dismutase encoded by sodA. It is also stated that these repair genes were found up for the tgt mutant in the Ribo-seq data, with unchanged transcription levels. Again, it is necessary to clarify this interpretation of the Ribo-seq data, since the fact that they are more represented in a tgt mutant perhaps means that translation is slower in those transcripts. Has it been observed in proteomics (wt vs tgt in the absence of TOB) whether these proteins involved in repair are more expressed in a tgt mutant?</p>
<p>(5) The authors demonstrate that in E. coli the tgt mutant does not show greater resistance to UV radiation (Fig. 7D), unlike what happens in V. cholerae. It should be discussed that in previous works it has been observed that overexpression in E. coli of the tgt gene or the queF gene (Q biosynthesis) is involved in greater resistance to UV radiation (Morgante et al., Environ Microbiol, 2015 doi: 10.1111/1462-2920.12505; and Díaz-Rullo et al., Front Microbiol. 2021 doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2021.723874). As an explanation, it was proposed (Diaz-Rullo and Gonzalez-Pastor, NAR 2023 doi: 10.1093/nar/gkad667) that the observed increase in the capacity to form biofilms in strains that overexpress genes related to Q modification of tRNA would be related to this greater resistance to UV radiation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript the authors begin with the interesting phenotype of sub-inhibitory concentrations of the aminoglycoside tobramycin proving toxic to a knockout of the tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) of the important human pathogen, Vibrio cholerae. Tgt is important for incorporating queuosine (Q) in place of guanosine at the wobble position of GUN codons. The authors go on to define a mechanism of action where environmental stressors control expression of tgt to control translational decoding of particularly tyrosine codons, skewing the balance from TAC towards TAT decoding in the absence of the enzyme. The authors use advanced proteomics and ribosome profiling to reveal that the loss of tgt results in increased translation of proteins like RsxA and a cohort of DNA repair factors, whose genes harbor an excess of TAT codons in many cases. These findings are bolstered by a series of molecular reporters, mass spectrometry, and tRNA overexpression strains to provide support for a model where Tgt serves as a molecular pivot point to reprogram translational output in response to stress.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript has many strengths. The authors use a variety of strains, assays, and advanced techniques to discover a mechanism of action for Tgt in mediating tolerance to sub-inhibitory concentrations of tobramycin. They observe a clear phenotype for a tRNA modification in facilitating reprogramming of the translational response, and the manuscript certainly has value in defining how microbes tolerate antibiotics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions of the manuscript are mostly very well-supported by the data, but in some places control experiments or peripheral findings cloud precise conclusions. Some additional clarification, discussion, or even experimental extension could be useful in strengthening these areas.</p>
<p>(1) The authors have created and used a variety of relevant molecular tools. In some cases, using these tools in additional assays as controls would be helpful. For example, testing for compensation of the observed phenotypes by overexpression of the Tyrosine tRNA(GUA) in Figure 2A with the 6xTAT strain, Figure 5C with the rxsA-GFP fusion, and/or Figure 7B with UV stress would provide additional information of the ability of tRNA overexpression to compensate for the defect in these situations.</p>
<p>
(2) The authors present a clear story with a reprogramming towards TAT codons in the knockout strain, particularly regarding tobramycin treatment. The control experiments often hint at other codons also contributing to the observed phenotypes (e.g., His or Asp), yet these effects are mostly ignored in the discussion. It would be helpful to discuss these findings at a minimum in the discussion section, or possibly experimentally address the role of His or Asp by overexpression of these tRNAs together with Tyrosine tRNA(GUA) in an experiment like that of Figure 1I to see if a more &quot;wild type&quot; phenotype would present. In fact, the synergy of Tyr, His, and/or Asp codons likely helps to explain the effects observed with the DNA repair genes in later experiments.</p>
<p>
(3) Regarding Figure 6D, the APB northern blot feels like an afterthought. It was loaded with different amounts of RNA as input and some samples are repeated three times, but Δcrp only once. Collectively, it makes this experiment very difficult to assess.</p>
<p>Minor Points:</p>
<p>
(4) Fig S2B, do the authors have a hypothesis why the Asp and Phe tRNAs lead to a growth decrease in the untreated samples? It appears like Phe(GAA) partially compensates for the defect.</p>
<p>
(5) Lines 655 to 660 seem more appropriate as speculation in the discussion rather than as a conclusion in the results, where no direct experiments are performed. The authors might take advantage of the &quot;Ideas and Speculation&quot; section that eLife allows.</p>
