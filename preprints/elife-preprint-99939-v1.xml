<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The T6SS of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> plays an essential role in the establishment of chronic infections. Inflammatory cytokines mediated by inflammasomes are crucial for the body to resist bacterial infections. Here we found that during the infection of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, non-canonical inflammasome was activated in macrophages, but the activation of downstream NLRP3 inflammasome was inhibited. The VgrG2b of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is recognized and cleaved by caspase-11, generating a free C-terminal fragment. The VgrG2b C-terminus can bind to NLRP3, inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by rejecting NEK7 binding to NLRP3. Administrating a specific peptide that inhibits the cleavage of VgrG2b by caspase-11 to mice can significantly improve their survival rate during infection. Our discovery elucidates a mechanism by which <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> inhibits host immune response, providing a new approach for the future clinical treatment of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Non-canonical inflammasomes are composed of caspase-11 from mice or caspase-4/5 from humans, which can recognize bacteria lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Once activated, non-canonical inflammasomes induce the maturation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) to form pores on cell and mitochondrial membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. It also activates the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. NLRP3 is an important intracellular receptor that can respond to various endogenous and exogenous stimulus signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. NLRP3 recruits NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) and undergoes polymerization, inducing the activation of caspase-1 and maturation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Non-canonical inflammasomes promote the assembly and final activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome through activating the nuclear orphan receptor NUR77 with the help of LPS and mitochondrial dsDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium widely distributed in the environment, which can cause acute and chronic infections in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has multiple secretion systems that are used to secrete virulence factors to the external environment or host cells to promote its survival and infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Among them, the type III secretion system (T3SS) and the type VI secretion system (T6SS) are two important secretion systems that play important roles in acute and chronic infections of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. T3SS can directly inject effector proteins into target cells to alter their function or cause target cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> encodes three different T6SSs, namely Hcp secretion island-I (H1)-T6SS, H2-T6SS, and H3-T6SS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. These T6SSs play a crucial role in biofilm formation, competition between bacteria, and toxicity to host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. H1-T6SS only targets bacteria and is used for competition between bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. H2-T6SS and H3-T6SS are involved in interactions between bacteria and host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The effector proteins of H2-T6SS can target both bacteria and eukaryotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. T6SS is composed of structural proteins and virulence factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Structural proteins such as hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp), valine-glycine repeat protein G (VgrG), and proline-alanine-alanine-arginine repeats (PAAR) form a stable spike-like structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Toxic factors are transported to the extracellular space through T6SS, thereby exerting toxic effects on other bacteria or host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. VgrG2b is an important component of T6SS, which usually binds tightly to other components of T6SS such as the Hcp protein, together forming the core component of the secretion system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The VgrG2b protein has a special structure for recognizing and binding effector proteins, which are transported to the tip of the secretion system and injected into the target cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. VgrG2b entering eukaryotic cells can also regulate the biological functions of host cells through binding to cytoskeletal proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we found that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection activates caspase-11 but inhibits the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in macrophages. The VgrG2b entering the host cell is recognized and cleaved by caspase-11 to generate a free C-terminal fragment. This fragment can bind to NLRP3 and inhibit its binding to NEK7, thereby preventing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The inhibitory effect of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> effectively avoids further activation of the host immune system and plays a crucial role in establishing bacterial infection. Our findings may provide a new perspective for the treatment of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections in the future.</p>

<title><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> causes abnormal signaling of non-canonical inflammasome</title>
<p>Non-canonical inflammasomes are activated during the infection of Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic>P. aeruginosa in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Obstruction of the inflammasome pathway can lead to chronic infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. To investigate whether T6SS of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> modulated the non-canonical inflammasome pathway to establish chronic infections, we used an <italic>RetS</italic> mutant strain that specifically expresses T6SS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. As an extracellular bacterial, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> synthesizes outer membrane vesicles (OMV) to induce non-canonical inflammasome activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. We therefore added <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and OMVs to macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> to simulate the real situation of infection <italic>in vivo</italic> as much as possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. We found that activation of caspase-11 and cleavage of GSDMD in BMDM cells were not affected after incubation with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and OMVs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). However, activation of caspase-1 was significantly inhibited in cells infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Consistent with the results of immunoblotting, the secretion of IL-1β was diminished after infection with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Although the mortality rate of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-infected cells was increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) and the survival rate was decreased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), there was not much difference compared to cells stimulated with intracellular <italic>E. coli</italic>. These results indicate that the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes post non-canonical inflammasome stimulation is inhibited in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Similar results were observed in human macrophage experiments, with normal caspase-4 activation and GSDMD cleavage after <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection (Fig. S1A, B). However, the activation of caspase-1 was suppressed and IL-1β could not be secreted normally in these cells (Fig. S1A, C). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection, the cell mortality rate was increased (Fig. S1D) and the survival rate was decreased (Fig. S1E), showing no much difference with cells treated only with intracellular <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>

<p>There might be two mechanisms by which NLRP3 inflammasomes were inhibited during this process. One was that the NLRP3 inflammasome lacked necessary stimuli for activation, and the other was that the NLRP3 inflammasome was inhibited by a bacterial substance. The release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm is a prerequisite for NLRP3 activation in the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. We first detected the localization of GSDMD N-terminus on the mitochondrial membrane during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. The results indicate that GSDMD-N can be normally localized on the mitochondrial membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). In addition, the release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm was not affected by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection (Fig. S1F). The binding of NUR77 and NLRP3 was not affected during the infection of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Fig. S1G). However, the binding of NLRP3 to NEK7 was significantly inhibited (Fig. S1H). These data suggest that the inhibition of NLRP3 is potentially influenced by a certain inhibitory factor from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>
<p>To verify this, we introduced LPS and mitochondrial DNA into macrophages to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation, bypassing the caspase-11-GSDMD prerequisite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. To avoid the activation of the AIM2 inflammasome by mitochondrial DNA, we conducted the following experiments under an <italic>Aim2</italic> knockout background. We found that after introducing LPS and mitochondrial DNA, NLRP3 inflammasomes were activated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). However, NLRP3 activation was inhibited (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>) and the secretion of IL-1β was tremendously inhibited (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>) after incubation with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The percentage of cells undergoing pyroptosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>) and the cell viability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>) did not change due to infection with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. This was consistent with previous reports suggesting that GSDMD cleavage by caspase-11, rather than subsequent GSDMD cleavage by NLRP3, is the main factor causing cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Next, we used <italic>Gsdmd</italic> and <italic>Aim2</italic> double knockout cells to detect the effect of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We found that after <italic>Gsdmd</italic> knockout, the NLRP3 inflammasome became active when LPS and mitochondrial DNA were introduced into macrophages. However, NLRP3 was still inhibited after incubation with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Fig. S1I). The secretion of IL-1β was also inhibited due to <italic>Gsdmd</italic> deficiency (Fig. S1J). The cell death rate was low due to the absence of GSDMD (Fig. S1K), while the percentage of viable cells was relatively high (Fig. S1L). These results suggest that potent inhibitory factors of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> may act upstream of GSDMD. Therefore, we conducted infection experiments using <italic>Casp11</italic> and <italic>Aim2</italic> double knockout cells. After incubation with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was not affected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>). The secretion of IL-1β was no longer inhibited (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1L</xref>). And the cell death rate was high due to the processing of GSDMD by activated caspase-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1M</xref>), while the survival rate was low (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1N</xref>). These data indicate that the inhibitory factors of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> requires caspase-11 to take effect.</p>

<title>Caspase-11 cleaves VgrG2b of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></title>
<p>In order to search for potential substrates of caspase-11 in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we designed a systematic screening system (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Simply, we constructed two fluorescent plasmids, one containing green fluorescent protein (GFP), polyclonal sites, and mitochondrial outer membrane localization signals, and the other containing red fluorescent protein (RFP) and mitochondrial outer membrane localization signals. We extracted the mRNA of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and prepared it into a library for insertion into GFP containing plasmids. We co-transfected it with the RFP plasmid into HEK293T cells and sorted the monoclonal cells containing both RFP and GFP signals into a 96-well plate using flow cytometry. Subsequently, the plasmid encoding caspase-11 was transfected into cells, and cells with disappearance of green signal on mitochondria were selected. The target proteins in these cells were cleaved by caspase-11, causing the detachment of GFP from mitochondria. After sequencing, we found that VgrG1a and VgrG2b repeatedly appeared in cells that met the screening criteria.</p>

<p>(A) Screening strategy for identifying caspase-11 substrates in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Briefly, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cDNAs were cloned into GFP vectors containing a mitochondrial localization signal. RFP vectors with a mitochondrial localization signal were used as transfection controls. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with these vectors and caspase-11.

<p>We cloned the genes of VgrG1a and VgrG2b and cleaved them using mouse caspase-11. We found that they can both be cleaved (Fig. S2A and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We also found that they can be cleaved by human caspase-4 (Fig. S2B and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), but not by caspase-11/4 mutants lacking enzymatic activities. These results indicate that our screening system is reliable. The number of target genes screened was very limited, which was consistent with the particularly narrow substrate spectrum of caspae-11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. We also tested other members of the VgrG family and found that neither mouse caspase-11 nor human caspase-4 could cleave these members (Fig. S2C–L). VgrG1a and VgrG2b belong to the secretion systems of H1-T6SS and H2-T6SS, and H1-T6SS does not have an effect on eukaryotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, our subsequent research focused on VgrG2b.</p>
<p>Our next concern was whether VgrG2b entered macrophages. We found that after co-culturing of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with BMDM cells, the VgrG2b protein appeared in macrophages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Immunofluorescence experiments also showed the presence of bacterial proteins in macrophages after co-incubation with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). We then incubated <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with wild-type BMDM cells and found that VgrG2b was cleaved in macrophages, while the cleavage band of VgrG2b disappeared in <italic>Casp11</italic><sup>–/–</sup> BMDM cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). We restored caspase-11 expression in <italic>Casp11</italic><sup>–/–</sup> BMDM cells and found that the presence of caspase-11 induced VgrG2b cleavage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). We also rescued <italic>Casp11</italic><sup>–/–</sup> BMDM cells with wild-type and enzymatic mutant caspase-11 and found that mutant caspase-11 could not induce VgrG2b cleavage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). In addition, we incubated human macrophages with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. As expected, VgrG2b was cleaved in human cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). Finally, to verify that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> affected inflammasome activation through H2-T6SS, we generated a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain with VgrG2b deficiency. We found that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lacking VgrG2b no longer inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref> and Fig. S2M) and IL-1β could be secreted normally in the mutant bacteria-treated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>). However, the percentage of cell death was not affected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L</xref>) and the level of cell viability remained unchanged among mutants and wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2M</xref>). These data indicate that H2-T6SS plays an important role in inhibiting host immune response through VgrG2b during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection, primarily targeting NLRP3 inflammasome activation rather than caspase-11 activation and GSDMD cleavage.</p>

<title>VgrG2b cleavage at its C-terminus is crucial for NLRP3 inhibition</title>
<p>Caspase-11 recognizes its substrate through a tertiary structure formed by its p22/p10 fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. To further verify that VgrG2b was a substrate of caspase-11, we co-expressed caspase-11 p22/p10 and VgrG2b in HEK293T cells. Co-immunoprecipitation results showed that VgrG2b bound to the p22/p10 complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). VgrG2b also bound to the p22/p10 complex of human caspase-4 (Fig. S3A). These results suggest that VgrG2b can indeed be recognized by caspase-11/4. Based on the size of the cleaved VgrG2b fragment, we speculated that the cleavage site should be at its C-terminus. We constructed mutant plasmids carrying aspartic acid substitutions for VgrG2b and found that only the D883A mutant was no longer cleaved by caspase-11 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). We also verified that this VgrG2b mutant could not be cleaved by human caspase-4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Meanwhile, we constructed a chimeric protein containing VgrG2a N-terminus, a linker sequence around D883 and VgrG2b C-terminus (Fig. S3B). This chimeric protein could be cleaved by caspase-11 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Another chimeric protein containing VgrG2b N-terminus, a linker sequence around D883 and GFP cannot be cleaved by caspase-11 (Fig. S3C). Based on the substrate cleavage characteristic of caspase-11 that it needs to bind the target first to mediate cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, we speculated that the VgrG2b C-terminus was the site where VgrG2b bound to caspase-11. Therefore, we tested the binding of VgrG2b C-terminus with caspase-11. Indeed, the C-terminus of VgrG2b bound to the p22/p10 complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Similarly, VgrG2b C-terminus also bound to p22/p10 of human caspase-4 (Fig. S3D). VgrG2b was recombinantly expressed and incubated with the p22/p10 complex. We found that caspase-11 induced the cleavage of the recombinant VgrG2b (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>

<title>VgrG2b C-terminus interacts with NLRP3</title>
<p>In order to investigate how VgrG2b C-terminus inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminus of VgrG2b as a bait and screened a mouse bone marrow cDNA library. In the positive clones obtained from the screening, the NLRP3 fragments repeatedly appeared (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We validated their interaction in HEK293T cells and found that VgrG2b C-terminus indeed bound to NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Full-length VgrG2b also bound to NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), but the N-terminus of VgrG2b did not bind to NLRP3 (Fig. S4A). VgrG2b C-terminus was introduced into BMDM cells through cell-penetrating peptides, and it was found that the C-terminus interacted with endogenous NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Similarly, VgrG2b C-terminus also interacted with the human NLRP3 (Fig. S4B). In addition, we incubated <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with mouse BMDM cells and found that NLRP3 interacted with the C-terminus of VgrG2b rather than the full-length one (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). The same result was observed after incubation of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with human macrophages, where NLRP3 bound to the C-terminus of VgrG2b (Fig. S4C). The colocalization between VgrG2b C-terminus and NLRP3 was observed inside BMDM cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). The VgrG2b C-terminus did not bind to mouse GSDMD (Fig. S4D), ASC (Fig. S4E), nor caspase-1 (Fig. S4F), indicating that the binding targets of VgrG2b in host cells is very specific. We further searched for the region where VgrG2b C-terminus interacted with NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>), and found that their interaction area was at the NACHT-LRR junction of NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H, I</xref>).</p>

<title>VgrG2b C-terminus suppresses the NLRP3 inflammasome</title>
<p>Whether VgrG2b C-terminus directly inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes was the focus of our next exploration. We validated this hypothesis in the HEK293T recombination system. The VgrG2b C-terminus significantly inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome originated from mouse (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) or human (Fig. S5A). In addition, overexpression of VgrG2b C-terminus suppressed the activation of classical NLRP3 inflammasomes in both mouse (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) and human macrophages (Fig. S5B). These data indicate that VgrG2b C-terminus exhibits a broad-spectrum inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Introducing VgrG2b C-terminus into BMDM cells through cell-penetrating peptides can significantly inhibit the activation of NLRP3 post intracellular LPS stimulation, without affecting the activation of caspase-11 and GSDMD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, D</xref>). The secretion of IL-1β was significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). The cell death (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>) and survival rates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>) were not affected. The activation of NLRP3 could also be inhibited by introducing VgrG2b C-terminus through cell-penetrating peptides when classical NLRP3 inflammasomes stimuli were present (Fig. S5C), accompanied by a reduction of IL-1β secretion (Fig. S5D), a decrease in cell death (Fig. S5E) and an increase in cell viability (Fig. S5F).</p>

<p>We next searched for the specific mechanism by which VgrG2b C-terminus inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome. We first tested the ability of NLRP3 to catalyze ATP hydrolysis after the addition of VgrG2b C-terminus and found that the hydrolysis potential of NLRP3 was not affected (Fig. S5G). Meanwhile, VgrG2b C-terminus did not influence the binding of NLRP3 to mitochondrial DNA (Fig. S5H), as well as to Nur77 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). The binding of NLRP3 to NEK7 was immensely inhibited by the C-terminus of VgrG2b (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). VgrG2b C-terminus did not bind to NEK7 (Fig. S5I). Domain mapping showed that the VgrG2b C-terminus bound to the same NLRP3 segment as NEK7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G–I</xref>). We therefore detected the competitive binding between VgrG2b C-terminus and NEK7 to NLRP3. VgrG2b C-terminus competed against NEK7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>), while NEK7 couldn’t compete with VgrG2b C-terminus (Fig. S5J), indicating that VgrG2b C-terminus has a stronger binding ability with NLRP3 compared to NEK7.</p>

<p>We designed a short peptide of VgrG2b C-terminus containing the VgrG2b linker region with a D883A substitution and a transmembrane TAT sequence. Peptides were then myristoylated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, aiming to target this peptide to inner membrane and suppress bacterial VgrG2b cleavage through competing with wild-type VgrG2b for caspase-11 (Fig. S6A). We first conducted tests at the cellular level and found that adding this peptide to BMDM cells after incubation with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> relieved the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Fig. S6B) and the secretion of IL-1β was significantly increased (Fig. S6C). The cell death rate did not change significantly and the viability rate was not affected by this peptide (Fig. S6D, E). The same effect was observed in human macrophages, where this designed peptide could relieve the inhibition of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> on the NLRP3 inflammasome (Fig. S6F) and the secretion of cytokine IL-1β was also increased (Fig. S6G).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found that the structural protein VgrG2b from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can be cleaved by caspase-11 in host cells. The C-terminal fragment of VgrG2b bound to NLRP3, inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammatory and the secretion of IL-1β. The delivery of VgrC2b C-terminus mimics significantly improved the infection symptoms caused by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, providing an optional treatment approach for chronic infections of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>
<p>The infection of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, especially those in chronic infections, is an important factor causing pulmonary fibrosis in clinicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. LPS from Gram-negative bacterium can be transported to host cells and activate non-canonical inflammasomes within them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. There are many ways for LPS from bacteria to be transported into host cells, including binding with HMGB1 originated from the liver and entering the interior of the cells through the surface of macrophages, as well as enveloping and delivering LPS into the host cells through extracellular vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. We observed the activation of non-canonical inflammasomes in macrophages after infection with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, indicating that LPS was also transported into the cells. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is not a typical intracellular bacterium, and its LPS entry into target cells is likely through the out membrane vesicles <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mainly utilizes the T6SS secretion system to promote the establishment of chronic infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. During this process, H2-T6SS plays many important roles, responsible for delivering known and yet to be explored virulence factors into host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Here we have found that VgrG2b is not only responsible for the delivery of bacterial virulence proteins, but it can also serve as a virulence factor on its own. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it requires cutting to be effective. Whether there are other proteins secreted through the H2-T6SS in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that need to be cleaved by host proteases before they exert their function is a very worthwhile research topic. Of course, this processing from the host is not limited to cleavage, but may also be post-translational modifications of proteins such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Systematically identifying these possible modifications and their substrates will be of great significance for understanding the pathogenic mechanism of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>
<p>The non-canonical inflammasome receptor caspase-11 has a very narrow substrate spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. The process of substrate cleavage by inflammatory caspases can be divided into two parts. Firstly, inflammatory caspases bind to a part of the substrate, which is often not their cleavage site, and the other is the recognition of the true site of their cleavage. This mechanism ensures that limited proteins are cleaved by host cells when inflammasomes are activated, thereby confining the severity of the inflammatory response. Here, we found that caspase-11/4 specifically cleaves the structural proteins of the secretion system of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and the generated new fragments can play an inhibitory role. This is a new way for pathogenic microorganisms to hijack the host’s immune system. Because traditional hijacking usually directly affects the host immune system without cutting. It is very effective for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> using VgrG2b fragment to inhibit NLRP3. On the one hand, VgrG2b transports virulence factors into the host cell, and on the other hand, the cleaved substrate plays a role in inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome.</p>
<p>In summary, we have discovered a new pattern of recognition between bacterial proteins and the host immune system during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection, which involves hijacking the host’s protease to produce a new virulence factor that can inhibit the host’s immune response.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study on strategies used by Pseudomonas to subvert hots immunity identifies a new immune evasion strategy. The study presents <bold>solid</bold> evidence on the cleavage of VgrG2B by Caspase 11 and the generation of fragments that inhibit activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This work should be of interest to immunologists and microbiologists.</p>

<p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;A VgrG2b fragment cleaved by caspase-11/4 promotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection through suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome&quot;, Qian et al. found an activation of the non-canonical inflammasome, but not the downstream NLRP3 inflammasome, during the infection of macrophage by P. aeruginosa, which is in sharp contrast to that by E. coli (Figure 1). In realizing that the suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome is Caspase-11 dependent, the authors performed a screening among P. aeruginosa proteins and identified VgrG2b being a major substrate of Caspase-11 (Figure 2). Next, the authors mapped the cleavage site on VgrG2b to D883, and demonstrated that cleavage of VgrG2b by Caspase-11 is essential for the suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Figure 3). Furthermore, they found that a binding between the C-terminal fragment of the cleaved VgrG2b and NLRP3 existed (Figure 4), which was then proved to block the association of NLRP3 with NEK7 (Figure 5). Finally, the authors demonstrated that blocking of VgrG2b cleavage, by either mutation of the D883 or administration of a designed peptide, effectively improved the survival rate of the P. aeruginosa-infected mice (Figure 6). This is a well-designed and executed study, with the results clearly presented and stated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, Quian and colleagues identified a novel mechanism by which Pseudomonas control inflammatory responses upon inflammasome activation. They identified a caspase-11 substrate (VgrG2b) which, upon cleavage, binds and inhibits the NLRP3 to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This is a unique mechanism that allows for the tailoring of the innate immune response upon bacterial recognition.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors are presenting here a novel conceptual framework in host-pathogen interactions. Their work is supported by a range of approaches (biochemical, cellular immunology, microbiology, animal models), and their conclusions are supported by multiple independent evidences. The work is likely to have an important impact on the innate immunity field and host-pathogen interactions field and may guide the development of novel inhibitors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although quite exhaustive, a few of the authors' conclusions are not fully supported (e.g., caspase-11 directly cleaving VgrG2b, the unique affinity of VgrG2b-C for NLRP3) and would require complementary approaches to validate their findings fully. This is minimal.</p>
