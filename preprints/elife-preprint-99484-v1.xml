<title>Abstract</title><p>Bacterial pathogens that are successful in hospital environments must survive times of intense antibiotic exposure and times of no antibiotic exposure. When these organisms are closely associated with human hosts, they must also transmit from one patient to another for the resistance to spread. The resulting evolutionary dynamics have, in some settings, led to rising levels of resistance in hospitals. Here, we focus on an important but understudied aspect of this dynamic: the loss of resistance when the resistant organisms evolve in environments where the antibiotic pressure is removed. Based on prior data, we hypothesize that resistance arising in the context of strong selection may carry a high cost and revert to sensitivity quickly once the selective pressure is removed. Conversely, resistant isolates that persist through times of no antibiotic pressure should carry a lower cost and revert less quickly. To test this hypothesis, we utilize a genetically diverse set of patient-derived, daptomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> isolates that include cases of both <italic>de novo</italic> emergence of resistance within patients and putatively transmitted resistance. Both of these sets of strains have survived periods of antibiotic exposure, but only putatively transmitted resistant strains have survived extended periods without antibiotic exposure. These strains were then allowed to evolve in antibiotic free laboratory conditions. We find that putatively transmitted resistant strains tended to have lower level resistance but that evolution in antibiotic-free conditions resulted in minimal loss of resistance. In contrast, resistance that arose <italic>de novo</italic> within patients was higher level but exhibited greater declines in resistance <italic>in vitro</italic>. Sequencing of the experimentally evolved isolates revealed that reversal of high level resistance resulted from evolutionary pathways that were frequently genetically associated with the unique resistance mutations of that strain. Thus, the rapid reversal of high-level resistance was associated with accessible evolutionary pathways where an increase in fitness is associated with decreased resistance. We describe how this rapid loss of resistance may limit the spread of resistance within the hospital and shape the diversity of resistance phenotypes across patients.</p>

<label>2</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antibiotic resistance is a significant public health concern, particularly in hospitals, where increasing levels of resistance are facilitated by two processes that occur at elevated rates. First, strong selective pressure from therapeutic usage of antibiotics acts to promote the <italic>de novo</italic> evolution of resistance within hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Second, hospitals function as hot spots for transmission, where large numbers of contacts between patients increase the spread of isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Despite the selection and transmission of resistant isolates, antibiotic resistance often does not reach universally high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). This constraint on the evolution of resistance is rarely due to the inability of the organisms to evolve resistance: It is frequently possible to evolve high-level resistance in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Rather, resistance evolution appears constrained by pleiotropic effects on the ability to survive within the patient and transmit to other patients in environments without antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>).</p>
<p>In this work, we seek to understand these constraints on resistance evolution by investigating the evolutionary steps that lead to the successful transmission of resistant mutants. We study the nosocomial pathogen <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> and the evolution of resistance to the antibiotic daptomycin, which remains a preferred treatment for these infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Daptomycin resistance was rare in <italic>E. faecium</italic> before the widespread use of daptomycin, but has increased concurrently with daptomycin usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Resistance evolution within patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) and transmission between patients have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Thus, daptomycin resistance in <italic>E. faecium</italic> represents a clinical setting where the early steps toward the evolution of transmissible resistance can be studied. Specifically, we hypothesize that robustness to phenotypic reversions in antibiotic-free conditions plays a significant role in the spread of nosocomial resistant pathogens.</p>
<p>The conceptual basis of our hypothesis is as follows. Resistance emerges when an antibiotic-sensitive bacterial population is exposed to an antibiotic. This newly resistant population must continue to transmit between hosts in antibiotic free conditions to ensure its survival. Multiple evolutionary processes may occur during the transmission process and with the removal of antibiotic selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). First, evolution may lead to the loss of resistance, either through precise molecular reversions or secondary mutations that negate the impact of the initial resistance mutation. In this case, we would be unlikely to observe reversion and it would not contribute to the problem of transmitted resistance. Second, compensatory mutations may arise which maintain the resistance phenotype while alleviating the costs of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, a subset of resistance mutations may have low or no fitness cost in antibiotic free conditions. In this case, repeated sampling of the mutational landscape may allow some populations to find these lower-cost resistance phenotypes. The latter mechanism would imply that <italic>de novo</italic> evolution produces a range of resistance mechanisms and that transmission acts as a filter to select for resistance with a lower cost or lower chance of reversion. Thus, when we observe resistance strains transmitting in the hospital, we propose that the resistant strains are less likely to revert to sensitivity, either because of compensatory mutations or the filtering mechanism.</p>
<p>To assess our hypothesis, we test the prediction that antibiotic resistance arising <italic>de novo</italic> will revert more readily than transmitted resistance. We identify a collection of daptomycin-resistant clinical isolates from a hospital system that experienced a rise in cases of daptomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The isolates were drawn from two groups: those that were resistant at the time of the patient’s first positive blood culture (putatively transmitted strains) and isolates that were initially sensitive on the patient’s first blood culture but had resistant isolates following daptomycin treatment (<italic>i.e.</italic> potentially <italic>de novo</italic> resistance). We begin by characterizing the resistance phenotype and genetic pathways of resistance from these two groups. We then experimentally evolve these isolates in antibiotic-free medium, tracking both the phenotypic changes and genetic changes using whole genome sequencing. Our work suggests that antibiotic-resistant isolates that reverted rapidly do so because their resistance mutations also resulted in readily accessible mutational pathways for reversion to susceptibility. This shared evolutionary pathway may be an important process constraining the spread of high-level daptomycin resistance of <italic>E. faecium</italic>.</p>

<label>3.1</label><title>Selection of Clinical Isolates</title>
<p>Bacterial isolates were obtained from the University of Michigan Clinical Microbiology Laboratory and classified as daptomycin sensitive (MIC<italic>≤</italic> 4µg<italic>/</italic>mL) or resistant (MIC<italic>&gt;</italic> 4µg<italic>/</italic>mL) using the Trek diagnostic system (ThermoFisher). Isolates were obtained from six patients with <italic>de novo</italic> resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> bacteremias (hereafter DN), where the first isolate was daptomycin susceptible, but one or more subsequent isolates were identified as daptomycin resistant. Isolates were also obtained from six patients with a putatively transmitted resistant bacteria (hereafter PT), where a daptomycin-resistant, <italic>E. faecium</italic> bacteremia was identified on their first culture. For each DN patient, the earliest dated sensitive (DNS isolates) and resistant (DNR isolates) isolates were selected for further study. For each PT patient, the initial, daptomycinresistant isolate (PTR isolates) was selected for further study. In total, 18 patient-derived isolates (6 PTR, 6 DNR, 6 DNS) were used. Isolates from patient PT6 were classified as sensitive by the clinical microbiology lab, but among the more daptomycin resistant internally tested isolates and therefore considered resistant for this study.</p>

<label>3.2</label><title>Laboratory evolution</title>
<p>A single colony from each blood culture sample was isolated on Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar (Becton, Dickinson and Company, 211065) and stored in BHI broth (Becton, Dickinson and Company, 237500) supplemented with 20% glycerol at -80<italic><sup>◦</sup></italic>C. To initiate experimental populations, a single clone from each isolate was streaked onto BHI agar and grown overnight at 36<italic><sup>◦</sup></italic>C. Thus, we expect no shared genetic variation between evolved replicate populations. Three replicate populations for each of the 18 clinical isolates were inoculated from the single colony. Cultures were grown in 10mL BHI broth in test tubes (18×150mm, Fisher 14-961-32), incubated at 36<italic><sup>◦</sup></italic>C. Daily transfers were performed by transferring 10 µL from the overnight culture into 10mL fresh BHI broth and were continued for 32 days. Transfers were interrupted for one day on Day 17 and re-started in 10mL of the Day 17 stock frozen in 20% glycerol stored at -80<italic><sup>◦</sup></italic>C. On the final day, three random clones were chosen from each population for subsequent genetic and phenotypic testing.</p>

<label>3.3</label><title>Population assessment of daptomycin resistance during experimental evolution</title>
<p>Evolving populations were assayed for susceptibility to daptomycin on days 8, 10, 17, 18, 25, and 32. A well mixed sample of each population after each growth cycle was serially diluted from 10<sup>0</sup> to 10<italic><sup>−</sup></italic><sup>5</sup> in 10-fold steps with 0.85% saline. A 100 µL sample of each dilution was plated onto cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton agar (BD Difco, catalog number. 212322) agar prepared with no daptomycin and 8 µg<italic>/</italic>mL daptomycin supplemented with 50 µg/mL Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Plates were incubated at 36 <italic><sup>◦</sup></italic>C for 24 hours. Colony forming units (CFUs) were counted at each concentration level.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<label>3.4</label><title>Daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration calculation</title>
<p>Daptomycin resistance was measured with a broth micro-dilution assay. Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with 50 µg<italic>/</italic>mL Ca<sup>2+</sup> and daptomycin concentrations ranging from 0.5 µg<italic>/</italic>mL to 16 µg<italic>/</italic>mL in serial two-fold increments. Each assay was performed in duplicate. Optical density readings were taken at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) at 21 hours (FLUOstar Omega, BMGTech) and a custom R script was used to fit a Hill function to calculate the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). We defined the MIC as the concentration at which the OD is predicted to drop below the detection limit. Three reference clones, having low, medium, and high daptomycin resistance, were used as standard MICs to confirm internal consistency between blocks.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<label>3.5</label><title>Statistical analysis of resistance phenotypes</title>
<p>A comparison of antibiotic resistance between groups was performed using linear mixed-effects models. The dependent variable was log<sub>2</sub>(MIC<sub>evolved</sub> <italic>−</italic> MIC<sub>anc</sub>), where MIC<sub>evolved</sub> is the calculated MIC of an evolved clone, and MIC<sub>anc</sub> is the calculated MIC of the isolate from which it was experimentally evolved. Fixed effects included the evolved group (DNR, DNS, PTR) and initial MIC. Random effects allowed for variation due to replicated MIC measurements, with each clone nested within the replicated experimental population and each replicated experimental population nested within the patient. Models were fit by maximizing the log-likelihood using nlme package v3.1.141 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) in R v3.5.1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<label>3.6</label><title>Fitness estimation in laboratory media</title>
<p>Fitness estimates were determined by analyzing growth curves of individual clones over 20 hours. Frozen stocks of clones were inoculated into BHI liquid media, the same media used in the evolution experiment, and grown overnight. Clones were then diluted 1:1000 in BHI media and 100 µL of each sample was aliquoted into 96 well flat-bottom plates (Celltreat). OD<sub>600</sub> measurements were taken using an automatic plate reader (FLUOstar Omega, BMGTech) every 15 minutes for 20 hours. Plates were shaken at 300 rpm for 1 minute prior to each reading.</p>
<p>The OD<sub>600</sub> measurements were then fitted to a five parameter logistic growth model as described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The growth model is as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="597162v1_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where N is the density of cell growth as measured by OD<sub>600</sub> measurements, <italic>α</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is a logistic function of two parameters representing the proportion of cells actively dividing, r is the maximum growth rate, and K is the carrying capacity. Relative fitness was estimated assuming competition for a single limiting resource with no interaction between strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The ances-tral clone from patient PT4 was used as an arbitrary reference for all relative-fitness calculations. Blocks were structured such that initial and experimentally evolved clones from one DN patient and one PTR patient were measured on the same plate. Each clone was independently grown on three different days. Five wells from each plate contained only growth media, which served as blanks.</p>
<p>Rather than fitting the model with least squares as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), we use the POMP package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) to better account for sources of measurement error across the growth cycle. Specifically, we used log-normal errors to account for multiplicative errors arising from cell clumping occurring at the end of the growth cycle. For each replicate, growth model parameters were initialized using a range of starting values. Parameter values were then optimized using the Nelder-Mead algorithm from the optim function of the stats package to identify the maximum likelihood estimate of each parameter. More details can be found in the supplement.</p>

<label>3.7</label><title>Sequencing Library preparation</title>
<p>Each of the 18 clones used to found experimentally evolved populations were sequenced using both long read (MinIon MIN-101B, Oxford Nanopore) and short read (NovaSeq 6000, Illumina) technology. Nanopore sequencing libraries were prepared using the SQK-LSK109 kit according to manufacturer protocols. Long read samples were multiplexed in two libraries containing 4 and 14 samples and barcoded with the EXP-NBD104 Kit. The first library of 4 samples was run for 6 hours using a MIN-101B sequencer on a MinION R9.4.1 flow cell. The flow cell was then washed using the EXP-WSH003 flowcell wash kit. The second library of 14 samples was then loaded and allowed to run for 24 hours. Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared using an Illumina TruSeq DNA LT kit according to manufacturer protocols. The short and long read sequencing data is available on NCBI Bioproject PRJNA975905 with labels as indicated in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<label>4.1</label><title>Identification of strains and isolates for the evolution experiments</title>
<p>Patients were classified as either <italic>de novo</italic> resistant (DN) or putatively transmitted (PT). DN patients had an initial blood culture grow daptomycin susceptible <italic>E. faecium</italic>. After daptomycin treatment, a subsequent blood culture grew daptomycin resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic>. PT patients had an initial positive blood culture grow a daptomycin resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic>. The isolates derived from these patients were labeled according to the patient classifier (DN or PT), the resistant status, and a unique number. For example, DNS1 and DNR1 are the sensitive and resistant isolates from patient DN1. The DNR isolates, DNS isolates, and putatively transmitted resistant isolate (PTR) were further studied using experimental evolution in antibiotic free conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The patient, clones, MLST, and clinical MIC for each initial isolate are listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<label>4.2</label><title>Resistance levels of <italic>de novo</italic> resistant and transmitted strains</title>
<p>The mean calculated MIC of the PT strains was 4.65 µg/ml (range 1.46 to 14.7), while the calculated MIC of the DN resistant strains was 10.3 µg/ml (range 1.22 to 45.3) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Given the small sample size, this difference is not unexpected (p=0.31, Mann-Whitney U). Reassuringly, the resistant isolate of the DN pairs was more resistant than their corresponding sensitive relative (p=0.031, Wilcoxon sign rank test). As a group, sensitive isolates from the DN pairs had MICs significantly lower than resistant isolates in both DN and PT patients (p=0.002, Mann-Whitney U). As in prior studies, there were differences between MICs determined by the clinical microbiology laboratory and those determined using laboratory protocols described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Some strains classified as daptomycin resistant by the clinical lab were experimentally assayed MICs below the CLSI breakpoint of resistance (MIC <italic>&gt;</italic> 4µg/ml), a reflection of the difference in assays and the continuous nature of our MIC measurement.</p>

<label>4.3</label><title>Experimental evolution in antibiotic-free media reveals different patterns of adaptation</title>
<p>Daptomycin resistance was assessed periodically by spreading samples from each experimentally evolving population onto agar plates with and without daptomycin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). In five of the six populations founded with the resistant clone from an DN patient, there was a consistent decrease in the ratio of resistant colonies among all three populations by the end of the evolution experiment(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, a decline across all three populations was observed from only one PT ancestor (PT6). We also note that none of the populations from PTR2 showed any growth on daptomycin plates. This lack of growth for a resistant strain was not entirely unexpected, given differences in testing methodology and the high variability in testing daptomycin MICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>).</p>

<p>We next selected three random clones from the final time point of each experimental population and measured their daptomycin MIC. We assess the hypothesis that resistance that recently evolved <italic>de novo</italic> within-host would revert more than the resistance that is transmitted between hosts. We compared the relative changes in MICs in the DNR and the PTR using a linear mixed model (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The patient group was not a significant predictor of the relative change in MIC (Model 1, p=0.26).

<p>While we did not find a significant difference in the initial MICs between DNR and PTR isolates, isolates with higher MIC tended to belong to DNR and show greater absolute declines in MIC. Populations founded with resistant isolates from four of the DN patients (DN1, DN3, DN5, DN6) and one PT patient (PT5) had a decline of more than 2 µg/ml, when averaged across the three replicate populations. In contrast, populations evolved from three PT isolates (PT1, PT2, PT4) had no significant change (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Four of the six resistant clones from DN patients (DN2, DN4, DN5, and DN6) had at least one of their evolved populations return to MIC near their sensitive pair.

For each DN patient, we measured the fitness of the initial DNS, initial DNR, and 3 clones from each of the 3 evolved populations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). For each PT patient, we measured the fitness of the initial PTR and 3 clones from each of the 3 evolved populations. We find no significant difference between the initial fitness of DNS and DNR isolates (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, p=0.0636, Model 1) or DNR and PTR isolates (p=0.697, model 2). Laboratory evolved clones had greater fitness than their ancestors (p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.01, model 3). Fitness changes were influenced by starting MIC (model 4, p=0.0002) and starting fitness (p=0.0003, model 5).

<p>Bacterial chromosomes were fully closed and circularized for 13 of the 18 clinical isolates, while the remaining 5 isolates had at least one contig <italic>&gt;</italic> 2.7Mb. These isolates were genetically diverse, with multiple MLSTs represented (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All strains were separated by 40 or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), except strains PT1 and PT3 which were separated by 11 SNPs.

<p>Mutations in genes previously associated with daptomycin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) were found in most, but not all clinically resistant isolates (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

<label>4.6</label><title>Genetic evolution in experimental populations</title>
<p>We identified 0-10 genetic changes in the laboratory evolved clones relative to the founding clone for each population, with a mean of 3.8 (IQR 2.5-5), though this number differed between the <italic>de novo</italic> sensitive, <italic>de novo</italic> resistant, and the transmitted groups (3.1 vs 3.7 vs 4.6 respectively).</p>
<p>Parallel evolution consisting of mutations in the same gene or operon across replicate laboratory evolved populations from the same founding genotype was observed in some cases. This parallelism was more common in the DNR isolates than in the PTR isolates (5 out of 6 DNR versus 1 out of 6 PTR). Notably, the site of parallel evolution varied across founding genotypes and in all of the DNR founded populations. Mutations in these populations were associated with genes or operons previously suggested to be resistant isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), whereas the one case of parallel evolution from a PTR isolate was not.</p>
<p>We found that for DNR1, the genotype of the initial resistant clone used to found the replicate populations differed between populations. This was identified when two mutations in DNR1 were not found in population 1. Resequencing of the DNR1 population revealed these two mutations were polymorphic in what had been assumed to be a clonal population. Thus, we suspect the initial resistant isolate used to found populations 2 and 3 did not carry these two mutations not found in population 1. These mutations are marked in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and have not been linked to daptomycin resistance.</p>
<p>Among PTR populations, one replicate population from PTR4 showed a second mutation within <italic>ClsA</italic>.

<label>5</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Under strong antibiotic pressure, most bacteria can evolve resistance to antibiotics. Yet, most of these adaptations are evolutionary dead-ends once antibiotic pressure is removed or the host clears the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Antibiotic resistance arising within hosts and spreading between hosts is rarer but far more concerning. This study examined isolates that recently evolved <italic>de novo</italic> resistance within host or transmitted between hosts. We find significant differences in their phenotypic robustness in antibiotic free conditions that likely constrain the spread of daptomycin resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic>.</p>
<p>The experimental evolution of these two groups of resistant bacteria in antibiotic free laboratory conditions identified three consistent and related patterns. First, the more resistant the founding isolate, the more the populations evolved towards sensitivity during the experimental period. Second, the three independent replicate populations from isolates in the <italic>de novo</italic> group often showed parallel molecular evolution with mutations occurring in the same gene or operon. Third, genes involved in the parallel evolution were unique to each resistant isolate and often occurred as a second mutation in the same gene or operon associated with resistance that evolved within the patient. These parallel mutations were never precisely the same across replicate populations and no precise genetic reversions were observed. The parallel mutations were often highly disruptive, such as the insertion of IS elements, frameshifts, and nonsense mutations. In contrast, we did not observe patterns of parallel evolution in resistance associated genes among putatively transmitted isolates. Together, these findings support our hypothesis that transmitted resistance strains are less likely to revert.</p>
<p>Previous research has focused on <italic>in vitro</italic> fitness costs as a limit to resistance transmission and spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Our results suggest that the spread of daptomycin resistance <italic>E. faecium</italic> may also be slowed due to the accessibility of evolutionary pathways. The evolutionary pathways of resistant isolates once antibiotics are removed appear influenced by the initial resistance mutations. Indeed, unique second mutations occurred in or around a resistance mutation among all replicate populations in five of six <italic>de novo</italic> isolates, resulting in increased fitness in antibiotic-free environments and decreased resistance levels. Together, this suggests that the reversion of resistance phenotype among DNR may have been facilitated by a large mutational target not present among transmitted isolates. This pattern held across different genes, including enzymes (<italic>clsA</italic> and <italic>glpQ</italic>) and regulatory elements (<italic>liaFSR</italic> and <italic>croRS</italic>). In contrast, the evolutionary trajectories of transmitted resistant strains were less predictable, with no clear patterns of parallel molecular evolution, smaller decreases in resistance, but similar increases in fitness. Further study of this mechanism at the hospital level is warranted.</p>
<p>This study also demonstrates the utility of experimental evolution for understanding the evolutionary potential of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Using controlled, replicated evolution in identical environments with defined starting genotypes, we can assess how commonly a particular evolutionary pathway is accessed. While the experimental environment differs from the clinical environment, we find a similar evolutionary pattern <italic>in vivo</italic> in patient DN1. A blood culture obtained after daptomycin was stopped showed a second site LiaS E192* nonsense mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), which is consistent with experimental results showing disruptive mutations in LiaF or LiaS in all three replicate <italic>in vitro</italic> populations.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. A relatively small number of isolates were used; thus, not all genetic backgrounds and resistance pathways were represented. It is also not possible to definitively say that resistance was <italic>de novo</italic> or transmitted, as the apparent <italic>de novo</italic> resistance could have resulted from two independent transmission events from closely related donors. Similarly, the incomplete records from these patients mean it is possible that putative transmitted resistance had daptomycin exposure. Further, the experimental environment differs in many important ways from the typical environment experienced <italic>in vivo</italic> by <italic>E. faecium</italic>. The calculated fitness is, therefore, an inexact measure of competitive fitness even in the laboratory environment. Despite these limitations, all of which would tend to obscure a pattern of difference, we nonetheless observe these convergent evolutionary patterns.</p>
<p>The rise of antibiotic resistance remains a pressing public health threat. Understanding the complex evolutionary dynamics leading to widespread resistance is a high priority. This study identifies the phenotypic reversion of resistance through a common evolutionary pathway as a potentially important process in limiting the spread of daptomycin resistance in <italic>E. faecium</italic>. The results presented here emphasize that the long-term success of a resistant isolate may depend on more than the fitness cost of resistance but also on the resulting evolutionary potential of the isolates in the absence of the antibiotic.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Tracy and colleagues study the loss of daptomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium isolates from bloodstream infections using in vitro evolution experiments in the absence of antibiotics. They test the hypothesis that antibiotic resistance arising de novo during treatment will carry a higher fitness cost and will revert more readily than resistance isolates which have been transmitted and have therefore already survived in the absence of antibiotic selection pressure.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an important question as a fitness cost to resistance is typically found in lab evolution experiments and assumed in modelling studies, but often not identified in clinical isolates. Here the authors find examples of clinical isolates which do and don't revert to sensitivity in in vitro evolution in the absence of antibiotics. Sequencing of the lab evolved isolates revealed that reversal of resistance was often due to mutations in the same gene that evolved in vivo, which is nice evidence that these resistance mutations did confer a fitness cost.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although this is an interesting study on an important topic, currently the results are overinterpreted do not justify the title of the paper 'Reversion to sensitivity explains limited transmission of resistance in a hospital pathogen' for several reasons. Firstly, the patient group, e.g. 'putatively transmitted' isolates vs 'de novo' isolates was not a significant predictor of change in MIC. Instead the change in MIC in the absence of antibiotics was significantly associated with the starting MIC of the isolate in the evolution experiments, but this would be expected since isolates with a higher MIC have more potential to decrease in MIC in the evolution experiments. The abstract and some conclusion do not match the results in some instances, for example the abstract states 'resistance that arose de novo within patients was higher level but exhibited greater declines in resistance in vitro'. In the discussion: they state &quot;these findings support our hypothesis that transmitted resistance strains are less likely to revert&quot;. However, on page 14 the initial MICs between DNR and PTR were not significantly different and patient group was not a significant predictor of change in MIC. Sequencing of the lab evolved isolates revealed that reversal of resistance was often due to mutations in the same gene that evolved in vivo. However, there were also some example of mutations in the same genes within the PTR isolates, so it remains unclear if there is a significant difference in behaviour between the DNR and PTR isolates in terms of reversion mutations. Significance testing, controlling for the starting MIC, would help confirm this.</p>
<p>Secondly, the 'putatively transmitted isolates', i.e. isolates that were resistant in the first positive blood culture, do not necessarily represent resistant isolates that have been transmitted between hosts. E. faecium is primarily a commensal of the intestinal tract, but which can cause opportunistic extra-intestinal infections. These bacteremia cases were most likely caused by within-host translocation of a strain already colonizing the intestine to the bloodstream - indeed, it has been shown that antibiotics can lead to Enterococcus overgrowth in the intestine and subsequent bloodstream invasion (DOI: 10.1172/JCI43918). The 'putatively transmitted isolates' may have initially colonised the intestine via between host transmission in an already resistant state, as assumed by the authors, but they may also have evolved resistance de novo within the host's intestine prior to causing bloodstream infections. Since they do not have data on past daptomycin exposure in these individuals it cannot be assumed that these isolates were transmitted with high resistance between hosts. An alternative explanation for any differences between the 'de novo' and 'putatively transmitted' could be the environment where resistance evolved, e.g. the intestine with strong competition from other strains and species, or within the otherwise sterile bloodstream environment. The authors hypothesise that &quot;newly resistant population must continue to transmit between hosts in antibiotic free conditions to ensure its survival&quot; and that &quot;transmission acts as a filter to select for resistance with a lower cost or lower chance of reversion&quot;. Rather than transmission per se, it is equally plausible that survival of the newly resistant population within the primary niche, the intestinal microbiota, is the crucial to filter for resistance with a lower cost.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors combine the study of clinical samples of antibiotic resistant bacteria with experimental evolution and evolutionary genomics to address important questions about the propensity for reversion in two different schema: de novo resistance arising within a patient, and transmitted resistance. The authors' use of a combination of methods help to answer the question outlined in their hypothesis, that de novo resistance mechanisms appear to revert to sensitive phenotypes more readily in a drug-free environment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study is exceptionally well-written and organized. The authors state their hypothesis clearly, and follow it up with an impressive effort that is truly translational-they make direct use of clinical samples of bacteria, and combine that with approaches in experimental evolution and evolutionary genomics. The conclusions follow naturally from the results, and there are no irresponsible leaps made.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I will divide my criticism into two areas, conceptual (most of my critique), with a very small methodological question.</p>
<p>(1) In the end, the authors offer findings that appear to be correct, and (again) are reported very clearly. However, this study is very surface-level in its theoretical underpinnings and construction, which is puzzling, because the field of antibiotic resistance and adaptation more broadly, is full of relevant studies and explanatory tools. Below I'll identify several areas where this manifests.</p>
<p>For one, the authors do not engage with a large recent literature on reversion, reversal, and compensation. It provides much more conceptual grounding for what the authors observe, much of it compatible with the findings from this study:</p>
<p>To offer two quick examples:</p>
<p>
- Avrani S, Katz S, Hershberg R. Adaptations accumulated under prolonged resource exhaustion are highly transient. MSphere. 2020 Aug 26;5(4):10-128.</p>
<p>
- Pennings, P.S., Ogbunugafor, C.B. and Hershberg, R., 2022. Reversion is most likely under high mutation supply when compensatory mutations do not fully restore fitness costs. G3, 12(9), p.jkac190.</p>
<p>Examinations of the studies on adaptation and reversion offer a richer mechanistic take on what was observed. But this literature alone is less of a problem than the general offering of different takes for the results. One can turn to a different literature - from ecology - to find a different explanation that is compatible with the findings.</p>
<p>De novo evolution involves the strong selection and rapid fixation of populations that are evolving largely to a relatively simple ecological milieu: their only primary function is to promote replication and survival of populations experiencing the negative fitness effects of drug pressure. Alternatively, transmitted resistant populations must deal with a multitude of selective pressures, working dynamically across time and space. In such a scenario, one would expect populations to locate places on the fitness landscape that are commensurate with survival in both drug-poor and drug-rich environments, as this is the ecological reality of the transmitted resistant bacteria. I could envision selection for &quot;generalism&quot; in this setting, corresponding to populations that have fixed mutations that promote resistance, but also those that ensure replication in drug-free environments. This regime might even reflect selection for &quot;generalism&quot; or &quot;increased niche breadth.&quot; That is, transmitted resistance may have adopted a &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; phenotype. The de novo resistance strains, alternatively, are selected for &quot;generalism.&quot;</p>

<p>Note that this classically ecological explanation is only one of several other literatures that offer models for the findings in this study.</p>
<p>To the authors' credit, their study was about the very real-world problem of antibiotic resistance, using a system that is far less tractable than the model systems research that has generated a lot of data and theory. And sure: the study is valuable because it communicates an interesting finding using a combination of methods (impressively). But in some ways, the study almost reads as a descriptive exercise: it offers a good question (does de novo or transmitted resistance revert more readily), and tells you what they found (de novo does). However the explanatory mechanisms do not advance our understanding much. Reporting the presence of unstable and disruptive mutations in the de novo populations is hardly an explanation. That is, alternatively, data in support of a proper explanation. There is nothing magical about de novo evolution that should be selected for disruptive mutations.</p>
<p>The reasons for the different sorts of mutation could have to do with the population genetic particulars of the de novo regime: large populations, strong selective pressure, relatively static fitness landscape. In such a setting, selection marches a population greedily up a peak. Alternatively, a transmitted population arises from a lineage that has observed a multitude of ecologies, across different fitness landscapes and has fixed mutations that confer survival across all of them.</p>
<p>There's a literature that speaks to this:</p>

- Bono LM, Draghi JA, Turner PE. Evolvability costs of niche expansion. Trends in genetics. 2020 Jan 1;36(1):14-23.</p>
<p>The findings are simple enough (a testament to the strong study design and execution) that supporting population genetic simulations, or analytical descriptions (maybe not relevant) could offer insight as to what really happened here.</p>
<p>(2) I recognize the challenge of working with clinical samples. It is very difficult to understand everything about them. But even having considered that, I might be missing something.</p>
<p>My main question here involves the origin of the putatively transmitted strains. The authors state that &quot; Isolates were also obtained from six patients with a putatively transmitted resistant bacteria (hereafter PT), where a daptomycin-resistant, E. faecium bacteremia was identified on their first culture.&quot;</p>
<p>This seems like an awfully dubious way to identify transmitted resistance. I suppose I understand the logic (de novo evolution requires the observer to have seen the evolution happen in real-time). But this definition leaves the study wide open for an &quot;apples to oranges&quot; comparison that might render the other aspects questionable.</p>
<p>The de novo strains are being compared to transmitted strains that may have been part of lineages that had passed between many, many patients. If this were true, then we should expect the genomic architecture of the transmitted strains to be far different. The transmitted strains might have undergone more selection in different regimes and genetic drift. Drift might have fixed mutations in transmission bottlenecks, altering the genetic architecture. In such a scenario, one might expect these populations to have a more difficult time unwinding their resistance phenotype.</p>
<p>In the end, I applaud the authors on a well-done and well-written study.</p>
