<title>Summary</title>
<p>Antimalarials are now used in combination with partner drugs to stem parasite drug resistance. Partners are often older, safe, cheap drugs, but resistance is already circulating for many, which raises the risk of selecting for multidrug resistance. If the partner drug(s) could be refractory to the spread of resistance, better resistance control could be implemented. We tested whether resistance to the antibiotic azithromycin, which kills malaria parasites by perturbing prokaryote-like protein synthesis in the apicoplast (relict plastid), had fitness costs to the spread of parasites via mosquitoes where parasites are not under drug pressure. Azithromycin resistance mutations in both rodent and human malaria parasites had a negative impact on the ability of resistant parasites to transmit from one vertebrate host to another via mosquitoes. Azithromycin resistance will therefore be less likely to spread geographically, making it an attractive option as a perennial partner compound to protect appropriate frontline antimalarials.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Drug resistance is a major challenge to controlling, let alone eradicating, malaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Resistant parasites emerge, spread geographically and eventually erode drug efficacy. A Sisyphean cycle of using-then-losing malaria drugs has repeated itself at least four times, starting in the 1950s with chloroquine and currently playing out with artemisinin, resistance to which has now spread through the Greater Mekong Delta <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and emerged in Africa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Clearly, we need to do things differently to gain more control of malaria drug resistance and stop relying on one promising new drug to replace the previous one that we have set up for failure.</p>
<p>Combination therapies have slowed the spread of artemisinin resistance, and any new frontline drug will require protection by some form of partner compound(s). Triple and even quadruple combinations are now being considered <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, but where do we turn for the partner drugs? Older, inexpensive drugs with acceptable safety profiles are one option, but resistance is already circulating for many, raising the risk of selecting for multidrug resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Ideally, the partner compounds should not only be safe, cheap, compatible, and effective but also be refractory to the spread of resistance. This would prolong the life of the frontline compound whilst also minimising the risk of selecting for multidrug resistance.</p>
<p>Atovaquone is an antimalarial refractory to the spread of resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Atovaquone resistance is unable to be transmitted because resistant parasites with mutations in the mitochondrially-encoded cytochrome <italic>b</italic> suffer fitness deficits during the mosquito phase of their life cycle where they rely on higher rates of mitochondrial electron transport <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In search of further resistance-refractory drugs, we turned to other drug/target systems with similar life cycle constraints. We hypothesised that changes to the parasite fitness landscape when switching from vertebrate to mosquito hosts might also occur in other metabolic pathways that are more active in the insect and/or liver phases of the life cycle. An obvious candidate is the apicoplast, a relict plastid of malaria parasites that is substantially more active in mosquito and liver stages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and for which a wide selection of safe, cheap inhibitors is known <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The apicoplast is a non-photosynthetic plastid homologous to the chloroplasts of plants and algae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Apicoplasts have their own DNA and express proteins encoded by their genome using housekeeping machinery within the organelle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Apicoplasts, like their chloroplast relatives, arose by endosymbiosis of a photosynthetic cyanobacterium <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and contain their own DNA replication, RNA transcription, and protein translation and modification machinery, which is bacterial in nature and sensitive to a raft of antibacterials <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. For this reason, various antibacterials, including azithromycin, are also parasiticidal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic that blocks apicoplast translation by binding to the peptide exit tunnel of the 50S subunit of the apicoplast ribosome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Like many other drugs targeting the apicoplast, azithromycin has a key drawback as a therapeutic—its lethal effect is delayed until the second intraerythrocytic after treatment. This “delayed death” response results primarily from apicoplast metabolic fatigue that prevents parasite feeding during blood stage, resulting in slow starvation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Despite the delayed drug effects, azithromycin is used as monotherapy to treat uncomplicated malaria and in combination with chloroquine or artesunate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. There are calls to increase the use of azithromycin as an antimalarial for combinations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, and this push is strengthened by the recent discovery that azithromycin has two targets in malaria parasites: one in the apicoplast, and a second that inhibits parasite invasion of the red blood cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Azithromycin is safe for infants and pregnant women and has a very long half-life in the body, all of which make it attractive as a partner compound <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Investigations into the role of the apicoplast in malaria parasites across the two-host life cycle show that the organelle is essential at every stage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, but the roles of the apicoplast wax and wane across the life cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In the blood stage the apicoplast has only two roles: to manufacture the five-carbon isoprenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, and to synthesise coenzyme A (CoA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. By contrast, in the mosquito oocyst stage the apicoplast also has to make fatty acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and heme <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, although these metabolic requirements are also parasite species-specific <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. The apicoplast thus has different roles—and hence demands—in the two hosts, which implies that selection constraints on apicoplast efficiency will differ across the life cycle, much as they do with mitochondrial electron transport <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We hypothesised that malaria parasites resistant to azithromycin will experience differential selection across the parasite life cycle and incur a deferred fitness cost that restricts their ability to develop in mosquitoes and/or liver stages. Thus, apicoplast mutations allowing parasites to survive under drug pressure in the blood stage should be sub-optimal in mosquito and/or liver stages, when drug pressure is released. To test our hypothesis, we generated azithromycin resistant rodent (<italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>) and human (<italic>P. falciparum</italic>) malaria parasites and assayed their ability to transmit from vertebrate-to-vertebrate via mosquitoes.</p>

<title>Generation of resistance to azithromycin in vivo in P. berghei and in vitro in P. falciparum</title>
<p>Azithromycin resistance has been reported in malaria parasites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, but to assay resistance transmissibility, we generated new azithromycin resistant parasites in genetic backgrounds able to be transmitted in the laboratory. In <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA, several cycles of treatment→recrudescence→treatment with azithromycin at the ED<sub>95</sub> (60 mg/kg q.d.; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>) or ED<sub>99</sub> (70 mg/kg q.d.; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>) yielded three, independently derived lines of <italic>P. berghei</italic> azithromycin resistant parasites: PbAZMR_G95D_1, PbAZMR_G95D_2 (both selected on a 70 mg/kg q.d. drug regimen), and PbAZMR_S89L (selected on 60 mg/kg q.d.). The delayed-death kinetics of azithromycin make <italic>ex vivo</italic> drug trials impossible for <italic>P. berghei</italic> so resistance phenotypes were confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Stable resistance was observed at the maximal allowable azithromycin dose of twice the ED<sub>99</sub> dose (140 mg/kg q.d.) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), but animal ethics constraints prevented treatment at higher doses and, therefore, precluded ED<sub>50</sub> determinations for these resistant strains. The slow growth rate of PbAZMR_S89L (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>) prevented <italic>in vivo</italic> confirmation of resistance after multiple attempts failed to produce high enough blood stage parasitemia and exflagellations.</p>

<p>We selected for azithromycin resistance <italic>in vitro</italic> in the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> mosquito-transmissible strain NF54 as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The IC<sub>50</sub> of azithromycin in a 120-hour, delayed-death assay for the parental line was 0.059 ± 0.017 μM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Two independent cultures of a clonal line of NF54, and one of a clonal line of the non-transmissible 3D7 strain, were grown in the presence of 300 nM azithromycin for 196 hours and then maintained in drug-free culture for 24-days, at which time parasites recrudesced. Resistance to azithromycin in both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains was achieved in a single treatment cycle. Time to recrudescence was similar for control parasites selected for resistance to pyrimethamine or atovaquone. An increase of drug to 600 nM azithromycin to azithromycin selected cultures did not inhibit growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Resistance to azithromycin at IC<sub>50</sub>s ∼100-fold greater than the parental line was maintained in all lines following cloning (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and E</xref>).</p>

<title>Azithromycin resistance in P. berghei and P. falciparum is apparently conferred by mutations in Rpl4</title>
<p>It is well established that azithromycin targets apicoplast translation in malaria parasites, specifically the 50S ribosomal subunit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, reported resistance to azithromycin in malaria parasites is conferred by apicoplast-encoded mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Whole genome sequencing of several clones of each of our independently generated <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> azithromycin resistant lines revealed mutations in a conserved region of the apicoplast-encoded 50S ribosomal protein L4 (Rpl4; PBANKA_API00430 in <italic>P. berghei</italic> and PF3D7_API01300 in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> respectively; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Two different point mutations in Rpl4, S89L and G95D, were found in <italic>P. berghei</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Another mutation, G76V, was found in Rpl4 of azithromycin resistant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). These Rpl4 point mutations were observed in the absence of any other identifiably relevant point mutations, indels, or copy number variations.</p>

<title>Azithromycin resistant P. berghei parasites are severely impaired during mosquito stage development</title>
<p>To test the sexual viability of our <italic>P. berghei</italic> azithromycin resistant strains we quantified the numbers of exflagellating males before each infection. There were no significant differences in the number of exflagellations seen in PbAZMR_G95D_1, PbAZMR_G95D_2, and the Pb_WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). It is unclear if the reduction in PbAZMR_S89L parasites was a specific effect or resulted from the poor blood stage growth of this mutant (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). Furthermore, this blood stage growth defect limited us to only two independent experiments, so statistical analysis was not robust.</p>

<title>Mosquito infection data for both <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> azithromycin resistant parasites.</title>
<p>A.) Exflagellations were counted per 1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> red blood cells (RBCs) and are shown as the mean ±95%CI, with no significant difference between strains (ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons; WT [n=17], PbAZMR_G95D_1 [n=20], PbAZMR_G95D_2 [n=10], PbAZMR_S89L [n=2], where ‘n’ is the number of independent biological replicates). At 9-to-14 days post blood feed, a minimum of 10 midguts were dissected for each ‘n’ independent infection (WT [n=13], PbAZMR_G95D_1 [n=11], PbAZMR_G95D_2 [n=5], PbAZMR_S89L [n=2]) and assessed for infection prevalence (pie charts below, percentage indicates the mean; ns= not significant by way of ordinary one-way ANOVA). Oocysts of infected midguts were counted and pooled, and non-zero values were plotted (error bars represent the mean ±95%CI). All azithromycin resistant strains had significantly fewer oocysts than WT (*=P&lt;0.05; ****=P&lt;0.0001; ordinary one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test); B.) Mean number of salivary gland sporozoites per mosquito. Between days 20- and 26-post blood feed, a minimum of 12 mosquitoes (WT) or 20 mosquitoes (PbAZMR_G95D_1, PbAZMR_G95D_2, and PbAZMR_S89L) were dissected. All azithromycin resistant strains produce fewer salivary gland sporozoites than WT (****=P&lt;0.0001, Welch’s t-test; error bar represents +95% CI). Results are from ‘n’ independent mosquito infections: WT (n=21), PbAZMR_G95D_1 (n=14), PbAZMR_G95D_2 (n=10), PbAZMR_S89L (n=2); C.) Quantitative PCR on genomic DNA isolated from midguts infected with both <italic>P. berghei</italic> azithromycin resistant parasites and WT strains. Copy numbers of genes encoded in each organelle were first normalised to nuclear genes, then expressed as a ratio to WT parasites. There is a clear reduction in apicoplast genome copy number in PbAZMR_G95D_1 (n=4), PbAZMR_G95D_2 (n=3) and PbAZMR_S89L (n=1), where n=number of biological replicates. Error bars represent the SEM; D.) Immunofluorescence assay on midgut oocysts, 14 days post blood feed. Green represents labelling of the <italic>P. berghei</italic> apicoplast, with anti-ACP antibodies. Hoechst is staining DNA. PbAZMR_G95D_1 oocysts consistently show dispersed ACP staining (bottom panel), while WT oocysts show a branched ACP staining (top panel). Images are maximum projections (except brightfield, which shows the largest single slice). Scale bar=10μm; E.) Quantification of development of blood-feed-ready stage V gametocytes produced by Pf_WT and Pf_AZMR parasites. No significant difference is seen (Unpaired t-test, two-tailed P value); F.) At 7 days post blood feed, a minimum of 10 midguts were dissected for each ‘n’ independent infection (Pf_WT [n=3], Pf_AZMR [n=3]) and assessed for infection prevalence (pie charts below, percentage indicates the mean; ns= not significant by way of Unpaired t-test, two-tailed P value). No significant difference was observed between the number of midgut oocysts in mosquitoes infected with either Pf_WT or Pf_AZMR parasites (Unpaired t-test, two-tailed P value); G.) At day 17 post blood feed, a minimum of 12 mosquitoes were dissected per genotype. No significant difference was observed between the number of salivary gland sporozoites in mosquitoes infected with either Pf_WT or Pf_AZMR parasites (Unpaired t-test, two-tailed P value).</p></caption>

<p>We next infected female <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes with our azithromycin resistant <italic>P. berghei</italic> lines and Pb_WT control parasites by allowing the mosquitoes to bite infected mice. In a minimum of five independent mosquito infections with PbAZMR_G95D_1, PbAZMR_G95D_2, and Pb_WT strains, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of mosquito infection, but the resistant lines developed significantly fewer oocysts with means of 114 ± 12.4, 191± 17.5, and 261 ± 15.8 oocysts per midgut respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The development impairment in PbAZMR_S89L parasites during mosquito midgut stages likely reflects a mix of specific mosquito stage effects and very slow blood stage growth producing fewer sexual stages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and therefore fewer oocysts.</p>
<p>At 20-26 days post blood feed, salivary glands were dissected from mosquitoes infected with PbAZMR_G95D_1, PbAZMR_G95D_2, PbAZMR_S89L, and Pb_WT. Again, all our azithromycin resistant lines produced significantly fewer salivary gland sporozoites than Pb_WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The reduction in sporozoite numbers was markedly greater than would be expected from the lower number of oocysts observed, and suggests a defect in development during the oocyst stage.</p>
<p>To visualise oocyst stage development in our azithromycin resistant <italic>P. berghei</italic> strains, we performed an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on whole, infected mosquito midguts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). <italic>P. berghei</italic> azithromycin resistant oocysts had abnormal, dispersed staining with the apicoplast-directed antibody to anti-acyl carrier protein (ACP), whereas Pb_WT oocysts showed the expected branched apicoplast pattern (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). ACP is encoded in the parasite nucleus and targeted to the apicoplast <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and continues to be produced even if the apicoplast is not intact. The dispersed ACP staining seen in our PbAZMR oocysts suggests that the apicoplast structure has been disrupted, and ACP is likely accumulating in vesicles destined for the non-existent or deformed apicoplast. Although IFA of whole midguts is informative, it is not quantitative, partly because the epithelial and basal lamina cells of the <italic>A. stephensi</italic> midgut and the <italic>P. berghei</italic> oocyst wall are significant barriers to consistent reagent entry and prevent consistent antibody staining of oocysts.</p>
<p>To quantify the developmental defect in the apicoplasts of azithromycin resistant <italic>P. berghei</italic> oocysts we measured their organllear DNA by quantitative PCR (qPCR), which revealed a loss of between 74.3% and 82.8% of apicoplast genomes in the <italic>P. berghei</italic> azithromycin resistant strains compared to Pb_WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Loss of the apicoplast genome confirms the microcsopic observations that azithromycin resistance-conferring mutations in apicoplast-encoded Rpl4 disrupt apicoplast development during mosquito stages in <italic>P. berghei</italic>. The concomitant increase in mitochondrial genome copy number in all the azithromycin resistant strains compared to Pb_WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) was not expected but could be due to abberent nuclear development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) and disruption of the timing of genome replication, perturbing normalisation of organelle genome number to nuclear gene numbers.</p>

<title>Azithromycin resistant P. falciparum parasites develop normally in mosquitoes</title>
<p>To determine if azithromycin resistance mutations impeded <italic>P. falciparum</italic> mosquito stage development, we selected a single clone (Pf_AZMR_C4, hereafter Pf_AZMR) to conduct downstream analyses. We compared the development of Pf_AZMR, and the parent line <italic>P. falciparum</italic> NF54 wildtype (Pf_WT) in female <italic>A. stephensi</italic> mosquitoes following standard membrane feeding. Both Pf_AZMR and Pf_WT parasite lines produced equivalent numbers of mature stage V gametocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Similarly, both Pf_AZMR and Pf_WT parasites produced equivalent numbers of midgut oocysts at day 7 post blood feed, with an equivalent infection prevalence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Furthermore, Pf_AZMR and Pf_WT parasites had no significant difference in the number of salivary gland sporozoites at day 17 post blood feed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, Pf_AZMR, despite having a point mutation in Rpl4 near those that severely disrupt mosquito infectivity of Rpl4 mutants in <italic>P. berghei</italic>, is apparently uninhibited in its ability to infect mosquitoes.</p>

<title>Azithromycin resistant P. berghei sporozoites lose their apicoplast</title>
<p>Immunofluorescence assays of apicoplast morphology in PbAZMR_G95D_1 and PbAZMR_G95D_2 sporozoites revealed the absence of a defined apicoplast, with only diffuse ACP staining visible throughout the length of the sporozoite (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This constrasts with Pb_WT sporozoites that have a canonical, punctate apicoplast structure adjacent the nucleus as expected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The diffuse ACP staining seen in azithromycin resistant sporozoites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) is reminiscent of the dispersed apicoplast marker labelling in oocysts of azithromycin resistant parasites and may again indicate futile ACP trafficking. To quantify this aberration, we used IFA microscopy to assess &gt;100 sporozoites from each parasite strain, across three independent mosquito infections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Only 12.6% of PbAZMR_G95D_1 sporozoites, and 18.8% of PbAZMR_G95D_2 sporozoites exhibited intact apicoplasts, whereas 93% of Pb_WT sporozoites had clearly identifiable, punctate apicoplasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Apparently, the disruption of apicoplast development in oocysts that results from the azithromycin resistance-conferring Rpl4 mutations reduces apicoplast integrity during <italic>P. berghei</italic> mosquito stage development, culminating in the production of sporozoites that predominantly lack an apicoplast.</p>

<p>A.) Sporozoites were stained with anti-circumsporozoite protein (CSP; red) to mark the outer surface of the sporozoite, anti-ACP (green) to mark the apicoplast, and Hoechst (blue) to mark the nucleus. WT sporozoites have a clear, punctate apicoplast (top panel), while azithromycin resistant sporozoites have diffuse apicoplast marker staining (bottom two panels).

A minimum of 110 sporozoites were counted for each parasite strain, for each of three independent mosquito infections. Green bars indicate the mean percentage apicoplast positive apicoplast, error bar represents +95% CI. Both azithromycin resistant strains produce sporozoites with significantly fewer intact apicoplasts than WT (P&lt;0.0001, Fisher’s exact test); C.) Quantification of sporozoite motility trails from PbAZMR_G95D_1 (n=159), PbAZMR_G95D_2 (169), and WT (n=175) sporozoites, from two independent mosquito infections.

<p>To assess potential viability of these azithromycin resistant sporozoites, we performed a sporozoite gliding motility assay comparing the movement of PbAZMR_G95D_1 and PbAZMR_G95D_2 sporozoites to Pb_WT sporozoites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). PbAZMR_G95D_1 and PbAZMR_G95D_2 sporozoites are somewhat impaired in their gliding motility compared to Pb_WT, but the differences were not statistically significant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Motility of the PbAZMR_G95D_1 and PbAZMR_G95D_2 sporozoites, despite mostly lacking a distinct apicoplast, is congruent with the fact that they had successfully made the journey from the midgut to the mosquito salivary glands (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Previous studies have noted, however, that even a modest reduction in sporozoite gliding can severely impact <italic>in vivo</italic> infectivity of sporozoites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Thus, the motility differences observed here, although not statistically significant, may be biologically relevant to the infectivity of azithromycin resistant sporozoites, particularly <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Azithromycin resistant P. berghei parasites are critically diminished in their capacity to establish an infection in a naïve vertebrate host</title>
<p>After assaying the <italic>P. berghei</italic> azithromycin resistant parasites through mosquito stage development and showing that they produce fewer sporozoites—most of which lack a distinct apicoplast—we next tested their ability to establish a patent infection in a naïve vertebrate host, either by bites from infected mosquitoes or direct intravenous (IV) injection of isolated sporozoites. Neither PbAZMR_G95D_1 or PbAZMR_G95D_2 was able to establish a patent infection in naïve mice bitten by at least 15 infected <italic>A. stephensi</italic> mosquitoes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, IV injection of 1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> PbAZMR_G95D_1 or 1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> PbAZMR_G95D_2 sporozoites failed to produce patent infections (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), whereas Pb_WT sporozoites reliably produced infections with a time-to-patency (as observed by microscopy of Giemsa stained thin blood smears) of 3-4 days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A and B</xref>). When the inoculum of IV injected sporozoites was increased to 1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> sporozoites, PbAZMR_G95D_2 sporozoites were able to establish a patent blood stage infection in all of six attempts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). It is important to note that patency for the resistant mutant required 4-13 days (mean 8.5 days ± 3.8 days; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), whereas Pb_WT sporozoites produced a patent infection in 3 days for all of 10 attempts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). DNA sequencing confirmed that the G95D Rpl4 mutation was present in the newly established PbAZMR_G95D_2 passage zero (P0) infection (data not shown). PbAZMR_G95D_1 sporozoites were unable to produce a patent infection in a naïve host in five attempts of IV injection of 1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> sporozoites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, through substantial mechanical intervention to provide a large sporozoite inoculum directly into a vein, we were able to achieve transmission of PbAZMR_G95D_2 but not PbAZMR_G95D_1. Even then, the PbAZMR_G95D_2 parasites showed a clear fitness defect over and above their liver stage delay, with blood stage parasites failing to increase substantially in parasitaemia when monitored over 14 days post sporozoite IV injection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

At least 15 infected mosquitoes were allowed to feed on naïve mice for at least 15 minutes and mice were monitored for 14 days by Giemsa smear (one mouse infected with PbAZMR_G95D_1 was only monitored until day 7, indicated by the initial triangle marker). Number of transmission attempts per strain were WT, n=8; PbAZMR_G95D_1, n=4; PbAZMR_G95D_2, n=4.

Number of transmission attempts per strain were WT, n=10; PbAZMR_G95D_1, n=5; PbAZMR_G95D_2, n=6. Only naïve mice infected with either WT or PbAZMR_G95D_2 by 1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> IV were able to establish an infection, but infection with PbAZMR_G95D_2 sporozoites showed delayed patency (mean 8.5 days ± 3.8 days [SD]) and impaired growth.

Growth curve comparison of P0 infections established by WT and PbAZMR_G95D_2 by 1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> IV of sporozoites. Mice infected with PbAZMR_G95D_2 sporozoites grow slowly.

Immunofluorescence assay of liver cells infected with WT, PbAZMR_G95D_1 and PbAZMR_G95D_2 sporozoites in vitro and fixed at 48 hours post infection.

Azithromycin resistant liver stage schizonts only show dispersed ACP (apicoplast) staining. Nuclei (blue) in azithromycin resistant liver stage schizonts appear clustered and donut-shaped.

<p>These data again suggest there is a difference in phenotype penetrance between PbAZMR_G95D_1 and PbAZMR_G95D_2, which recapitulates similar differences during mosquito stage development. Despite both resistant mutants having the same azithromycin resistance conferring Rpl4 mutation, there remains a slight fitness advantage in the PbAZMR_G95D_2 parasites over the PbAZMR_G95D_1 parasites. There is, however, still a significant deficiency in the PbAZMR_G95D_2 sporozoites in that they are only transmission-competent when directly IV injected; and then only in massive numbers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A-C</xref>).</p>
<p>The clear difficulty (or block in the case of PbAZMR_G95D_1) in the ability of our <italic>P. berghei</italic> azithromycin resistant parasites to establish a patent infection in a naïve host points to liver stage developmental defects, and the significant delay in patency of P0 infections induced by PbAZMR_G95D_2 sporozoites is consistent with this. This is not surprising given the importance of a proper functioning apicoplast during <italic>P. berghei</italic> liver stage development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Indeed, while some transmission of PbAZMR_G95D_2 is feasible, the parasites exhibit impaired development during mosquito stages, liver stages, and transmission to naïve hosts, identifying a clear fitness cost associated with the G95D Rpl4 mutation.</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Late liver stage development of azithromycin resistant P. berghei parasites is impeded</title>
<p>To investigate further the apparently aberrant liver stage development of our <italic>P. berghei</italic> azithromycin resistant strains, we inoculated <italic>in vitro</italic> grown HC-04 hepatocytes with sporozoites and observed the parasites by IFA to measure size and observe the morphology of the apicoplasts and nuclei. Firstly, we wanted to confirm whether PbAZMR_G95D_1 sporozoites are even able to infect liver cells given that they were unable to establish a blood stage infection in a naïve host by any method attempted. Secondly, while PbAZMR_G95D_2 sporozoites are clearly impeded in their ability to establish a blood stage infection in a naïve host, we wanted to examine the reasons for the apparent liver stage developmental delay and requirement for such massive sporozoite numbers to establish an infection in a naïve vertebrate host at all. Thirdly, we wanted to observe any associated aberrations in apicoplast morphology and visualise development of nuclei during liver stage development of PbAZMR_G95D_1 and PbAZMR_G95D_2.</p>
<p>Preliminary analyses revealed no differences in liver stage schizont size between azithromycin resistant parasites and Pb_WT at 24-hours post inoculation (data not shown). We therefore concentrated our efforts, and limited sporozoite supply, on a later liver stage timepoint of 48-hours.</p>
<p>IFA of liver cells inoculated with PbAZMR_G95D_1, PbAZMR_G95D_2 or Pb_WT sporozoites after 48 hours of development revealed marked difference in morphology (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). WT liver stage schizonts, irrespective of size, typically showed reticulated ACP staining, indicative of normal apicoplast morphology at this point of liver stage development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> (top two panels, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Furthermore, the nuclei of Pb_WT liver stage schizonts showed clear differentiation with each nucleus beginning to be associated with a developing merozoite (top two panels, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Contrast this with the PbAZMR_G95D_1 and PbAZMR_G95D_2 liver stage schizonts at 48-hours post infection where the ACP staining marking the apicoplast was cloudy and diffuse (bottom two panels, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), reminiscent of what is seen in oocysts and sporozoites with these strains. Additionally, the nuclei of PbAZMR_G95D_1 and PbAZMR_G95D_2 developing liver stage schizonts appeared aggregated, forming unusual donut-shaped clusters (bottom two panels, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). These images are typical of what we observed for 48-hour liver stages.</p>
<p>To quantify these observations, we used maximum projections of 48-hour post infection IFAs over two biological replicates and measured the size of each liver stage schizont, and we also quantified the nuclei in each developing parasite (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). Both PbAZMR_G95D_1 (n=31) and PbAZMR_G95D_2 (n=47) liver stage parasites were significantly smaller than Pb_WT (n=60; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and contained fewer nuclei (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Moreover, this reduction in nuclei was independent of liver stage parasite size because normalising number-of-nuclei to the area of the liver stage parasite optical section still showed significantly fewer nuclei in PbAZMR_G95D_1 and PbAZMR_G95D_2 parasites compared to Pb_WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). These late liver stage data essentially recapitulate the phenotype seen during development throughout mosquito stages; i.e. aberrant apicoplast morphology, and inability to properly differentiate nuclei. In sum, these defects in apicoplast integrity and nuclei biogenesis at both the oocyst and liver stages of the life cycle appear to severely hamper or even abrogate transmission of our <italic>P. berghei</italic> azithromycin resistant parasites.</p>

<p>To mimic the <italic>in vivo</italic> life cycle phenotyping performed with azithromycin resistant <italic>P. berghei</italic> parasites, we infected humanised mice—with chimeric livers containing mostly human and some mouse hepatocytes—with Pf_AZMR sporozoites. Livers from humanised mice infected with either Pf_WT (n=two mice) or Pf_AZMR (n=three mice) sporozoites were harvested at day 5 post sporozoite IV inoculation and analysed by qRT-PCR to determine i/ the level of liver chimerism, and ii/ parasite loads. All mice had &gt;75% human hepatocytes (data not shown), indicating a uniform infection potential, yet there was an 80% reduction in parasite load of Pf_AZMR parasites compared to Pf_WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, Pf_AZMR parasites have a significantly reduced capacity to replicate in liver cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>IFA on thin sections from these infected humanised mouse livers revealed defects in liver stage schizont development of Pf_AZMR in comparison to Pf_WT parasites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, 5E). The Pf_AZMR liver stage schizonts show little to no staining with either the cytosolic marker anti-HSP70 or the parasitophorous vacuole marker anti-PTEX150 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), indicative of severe overall morphological anomalies. Additionally, Pf_AZMR liver stage schizonts exhibit aberrant nuclear staining with no clear individual nuclei (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Indeed, nuclei often appeared to be aggregated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), reminiscent of the donut-shaped clusters of nuclei in <italic>P. berghei</italic> azithromycin resistant liver stages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, whilst the size of the liver stage parasites was the same for Pf_AZMR in comparison to Pf_WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), the azithromycin resistant parasites had significantly fewer nuclei (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Apicoplast morphology is also aberrant in Pf_AZMR late liver stage schizonts, with anti-ACP staining of Pf_AZMR revealing their apicoplasts to be collapsed and poorly defined in comparison to Pf_WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these severe defects of gross morphology, nuclear proliferation/separation, and apicoplast integrity for the Pf_AZMR parasites at liver stage, they appear to be experiencing severe fitness costs at day 5 of liver stage development attributable to the G76V Rpl4 mutation.</p>

<title>Rpl4 is a hotspot for macrolide resistance</title>
<p>Our four azithromycin selection regimens, across two <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, all retrieved parasites with point mutations in the apicoplast-encoded ribosomal protein Rpl4. Mutations in Rpl4 are also associated with azithromycin resistance in other strains of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, zoonotic infections of people with <italic>Babesia microti</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, in the plastid of the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, and in various bacteria related to the ancestor of plastids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Mutations in Rpl4 thus seem to be a universal mechanism of resistance to azithromycin and closely related macrolides.</p>
<p>Why are apicoplast Rpl4 mutations so prevalent in malaria parasite azithromycin resistance? We previously argued that malaria parasite organelle genomes, which are multi copy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, are hotspots for resistance generation simply because more chances exist for mutations to arise than do in single copy nuclear genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, organelle genomes could be heteroplasmic, allowing selection of pre-existing mutations by a drug to rapidly generate resistance, as likely occurs with atovaquone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, several different Rpl4 mutations can confer azithromycin resistance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), somewhat akin to different mutations in mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>b</italic> being able to confer atovaquone resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, which provides higher mathematical probability of resistance arising in a particular gene. Whatever the case, the frequency of Rpl4 mutations in resistance to azithromycin, both in this and other studies, demonstrates that apicoplast Rpl4 is a hotspot for azithromycin resistance. Sequencing Rpl4 should be a first point-of-call for surveillance of malaria parasite azithromycin resistance.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Rpl4 mutations confer fitness advantage to parasites under drug pressure during the asexual, blood stages, but fitness deficits for transmission</title>
<p>Drug pressure is intermittent across the malaria parasite life cycle. Most drugs target the asexual blood phase in the human vertebrate host, yet drug pressure subsides when parasites progress through their sexual cycle in the mosquito host. Pressure can recommence if the parasites make it back into a new human host who is using antimalarials. At this point, a resistance-conferring mutation becomes an obvious selective advantage again, but the resistance allele(s) must transit the mosquito stages and the human liver to achieve transmission (and ultimately spread) of resistance. The fitness landscape for a parasite gene thus changes quite dramatically across the parasite life cycle.</p>
<p>Both <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> are dependent on their apicoplast during mosquito stage development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, and we set out to determine if mutations in apicoplast genes impacted parasite fitness in mosquitoes. Here, we showed that mutations conferring resistance to azithromycin (selected for by drug pressure during the blood phase) have differing consequences on fitness during mosquito phases. In <italic>P. berghei,</italic> the fitness deficit is severe in mosquito stages such as oocyst development and sporozoite production. However, in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> a different mutation in the same gene created no detectable fitness cost to the human parasite in mosquitoes. The difference between <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> azithromycin resistant parasites in mosquito stage fitness likely relates to a combination of interacting factors. Firstly, the specific, resistance causing mutations in Rpl4 differ between parsite species (G95D or S89L in <italic>P. berghei</italic> versus G76V in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Secondly, each parasite species is differentially reliant on its apicoplast in mosquitoes. For instance, based on the essentiality of apicoplast fatty acid biosynthesis for mosquito phase development in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> but not rodent malaria species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, one might expect <italic>P. berghei</italic> with a sub-optimal apicoplast to cope better in mosquitoes. However, that was not the case for <italic>P. berghei</italic> Rpl4 mutants phenotyped here, all of which exhibited marked reduction in fitness in mosquitoes. Differences in the mosquito host-parasite interaction could also impact the metabolic requirements for sporozoite development. <italic>A. stephensi</italic> is less susceptible to <italic>P. berghei</italic> than the natural mosquito host, <italic>A. dureni</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> whereas <italic>A. stephensi</italic> is an efficient natural host of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Thus, the differences in the infection rates by different parasites might reflect the evolutionary adaptation of each parasite to our provided mosquito host, as has been observed with immune responses in different mosquito/parasite interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>If a mutant parasite is able to complete the mosquito lifecycle stages, and sporozoites accumulate in the mosquito salivary glands, its next phase—after being delivered by a bite—is to find and infect the vertebrate liver. Again, drug resistance mutations undergo selection for sufficient fitness during this liver phase. Interestingly, there is a convergence of phenotypes between <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> azithromycin resistant parasites at late liver stage, both having defective apicoplasts and reduced/abnormal nuclei biogenesis. The malaria parasite liver stage is tremendously proliferative with extremely high metabolic demands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, and our phenotyping indicates that a putatively sub-optimal apicoplast translation apparatus is apparently a major impediment to liver development of both <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In <italic>P. berghei</italic>, the combined burden of poor/abnormal growth of azithromycin resistant parasites in mosquitoes and liver blocked transmission, except where we provided massive mechanical intervention. In <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, a severe detrimental effect in the liver stage <italic>in vivo</italic> (in humanised mice) predicts a severe impairment of transmission. Whilst we were unable to test whether the Pf_AZMR parasites are competent to progress from liver stage to blood stage and thus achieve transmission, it seems likely that the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> azithromycin resistant mutant—despite performing better in mosquitoes—will nevertheless experience impediments to transmission. Whether or not the G76V mutation will block or reduce transmission of azithromycin resistance in a real-world setting is not yet possible to say, but the indications are that the mutation will not circulate freely, which should ultimately result in reduced transmission of azithromycin resistance, which gives azithromycin one more desirable characteristic as a potential partner drug. Refractoriness to spread of resistance would also mean that use of azithromycin for prophylaxis might pose less of a risk for resistance selection than is commonly assumed.</p>

<title>Activity of drugs <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To test for the curative dose and to confirm the efficacy and tolerance of each drug, an initial <italic>in vivo</italic> drug dosing assay was performed. Briefly, a donor mouse was pre-infected with <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA parasites via intraperitoneal (IP) injection of frozen stock. Once the donor mouse reached 5% parasitaemia, it was euthanised and infected blood collected via cardiac puncture. Infected blood was diluted in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Cat no. 61870-036) + 10% foetal bovine serum (Gibco, Cat no. 10100147) to a concentration of 1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> infected red blood cells (iRBC) per 200 μL. Two cohorts of three mice (placebo/vehicle treated [n=3] and drug treated [n=3]) were infected with 1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> iRBC via intravenous (IV) tail vein injection on day 0. Once mice reached 2% parasitaemia (approximately day 3), they were treated with the placebo/vehicle or drug by OG or IP injection (on days 3-6) and monitored daily by Giemsa (10% [v/v]) stained thin blood smears to determine parasite clearance. Mice were further monitored for health by daily weight measurements.</p>
<p>To evaluate the reported schizontocidal activity, dosing range and dosing methods of azithromycin, and to determine the 50% and 90% effective doses (ED50 and ED90 respectively) a Peters’ four-day suppressive test <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> was performed. Two donor mice were pre-infected with WT <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA parasites via IP injection of fresh blood from a P0 infection. Once the donor mice reached approximately 5% parasitaemia, they were euthanised and infected blood collected via cardiac puncture. Infected blood from both mice was mixed and diluted in RPMI 1640 medium + 10% foetal bovine serum to a concentration of 1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> iRBC per 200 μL. Seven cohorts of four mice were infected with 1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> iRBC via IV tail vein injection on day 0. All seven cohorts were administered the vehicle (200 μL PEG400) as a control or a given concentration of azithromycin (5 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 45 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 70 mg/kg in 200 μL PEG400) q.d. by OG on days 0-3, with the initial dose on day 0 given 4 hours post-infection (pi). Parasitaemia was measured on day 4 by Giemsa-stained thin blood smears to determine percentage suppression in comparison to the untreated control. Mice were also monitored daily for health and to confirm parasites were being cleared. Percentage suppression (PS) of parasitaemia was calculated using the formula: PS=100 x ([C<sub>AV</sub>-T]/C<sub>AV</sub>), where C<sub>AV</sub>= average parasitaemia in the control group, and T=parasitaemia of each treated replicate. Each PS replicate was then plotted against the dose, and a non-linear regression curve was fitted using GraphPad Prism 9 (Version 9.1.0) to determine the ED50 and ED90 doses of azithromycin.</p>

<title>Generating drug resistant <italic>P. berghei</italic> parasites</title>
<p>Selection of resistant <italic>P. berghei</italic> parasites <italic>in vivo</italic> was performed in the same way for each drug. After inoculation via IV injection with 1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> iRBCs from a WT <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA infected donor mouse, mice were treated with a clearance dose of the drug (60 mg/kg or 70 mg/kg azithromycin) administered as described above. Mice were monitored daily by Giemsa-stained thin blood smears, and once recrudescence was observed and parasitaemia reached approximately 1-2%, mice were treated with another clearance dose of the drug. Parasites were occasionally passaged into naïve mice should an immune response appear to have been suppressing growth. This recrudescence→treatment→recrudescence→treatment cycle was repeated until parasitaemia failed to reduce in the presence of the drug, at which point parasites were deemed resistant and parasite lines were cloned by limiting dilution. Cloned lines were then confirmed to be resistant to the clearance dose by performing an <italic>in vivo</italic> drug assay as described above.</p>

<title>Generating drug resistant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites</title>
<p>NF54 and 3D7 parasites were cloned by limiting dilution prior to resistance generation. Two independent clones of NF54 and one of 3D7 were used for selection. Parasite cultures containing 5×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> parasites were treated continuously for 96 hours with 300 nM azithromycin or 72 hours with 30 nM atovaquone, or 200 nM pyrimethamine. All three parasite lines were also grown without drug as a sequencing control. Following treatment, cultures were allowed to recover in drug free media until recrudescence (28 days post azithromycin treatment, 30-38 days post atovaquone treatment, and 24-29 days post pyrimethamine treatment). Drug was reapplied to recrudescent parasites at the initial concentration. For azithromycin resistance, parasites grew normally at 300 nM azithromycin and continued to grow at concentrations up to 1.2 µM. Atovaquone and pyrimethamine resistant parasites required from two to five cycles of treatment and recovery before stable drug resistance at three times the initial concentrations was obtained. Resistance parasites were cloned by limiting dilution, and drug resistance confirmed by standard SYBRgreen drug assays. DNA was prepared from independent clones for whole genome sequening.</p>

The following day, sporozoites were dissected directly into HepG2 medium, purified and counted and up to 2×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> sporozoites were added into each well and allowed to settle and invade for 2 hours at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Media was changed after the 2-hour invasion process, and then twice daily thereafter until cells were fixed. Infected HepG2 or HC-04 cells were fixed on the coverslips for 20 minutes with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in dPBS, at either 24-or 48-hours post sporozoite infection. Coverslips were washed with dPBS three times for 5 minutes in the 24-well plate before adding 1 mL ice-cold methanol for storage (no more than 3 weeks) at 20°C. After removing the methanol, coverslips were washed three times for 5 minutes with dPBS before cells were permeabilised with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in dPBS for 20 minutes at room temperature. Washing steps were repeated, and cells were then blocked for 30 minutes at room temperature with 3% (w/v) BSA in dPBS. Coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies (mouse anti-<italic>P. berghei</italic> [1:500] and rabbit anti-ACP [1:250]) and secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 [Abcam]; goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 568 [Abcam]) in 3% BSA in dPBS for one hour at room temperature, washing three times for 5 minutes with dPBS in between each incubation. Following the probing with secondary antibodies, coverslips were washed three times for 5 minutes in dPBS, with the second wash containing Hoechst 33342 diluted to 1:10000 and mounted with Dako fluorescence mounting medium on glass slides and sealed with clear nail polish.

<title>Immunofluorescence assay</title>
<p>Purified NF54 and azithromycin resistant sporozoites were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/ 0.0075% glutaraldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 minutes. Sporozoites were permeabilised in 0.1% Triton X 100 for 10 minutes before being blocked in 3% BSA PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Samples were incubated with primary antibodies; rabbit anti-ACP antibody (1:500), and mouse anti-CSP 2A10 (1:1000), for 1 hour in 3% BSA PBS followed by secondary antibodies; anti-mouse 488 and anti-rabbit 594 (1:1000, Invitrogen). Images of NF54 or azithromycin sporozoites were taken at random based on CSP and DAPI and presence or absence of apicoplast was then determined by staining with ACP.</p>
<p>For liver stage immunofluorescence analysis; livers were perfused with 1x PBS and fixed in 4% PFA PBS overnight before being exchanged for sucrose and snap frozen in OCT (Invitrogen). Sections of 8 mm were cut on the cryostat apparatus HMM550. Samples were permeabilised using ice cold 10% methanol 90% acetone and blocked using 3% BSA PBS. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies; mouse anti-CSP (2A10; 1:1000), mouse anti-HSP70 (1:500), rabbit anti-PTEX150 (1:500), mouse anti-EXP2 (1:500), rabbit anti-ACP (1:500) diluted in 3% BSA PBS. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 and anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:1000; Invitrogen). All samples were then incubated with DAPI (4’,6’-diamidino-2-phenylindole) at 1 ug/ml in PBS to visualize DNA and mounted in Prolong Gold mounting media (Invitrogen). Images were acquired on the Zeiss LSM 980 microscope.</p>
<p>Z stacks of both NF54 and azithromycin resistant liver stages were acquired using the same settings to allow quantitative analysis between different samples. The number of nuclear centres were counted by eye based on DAPI signal at the centre of each Z stack. For analysis of parasite size; a region of interest was drawn around each parasite based on DAPI signal and then the membrane area was calculated using FIJI software.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work addressed the identifcation of antimalarial drug resistance mutations that do not readily transmit to new human hosts, focusing on azithromycin resistance. The technically challenging analyses of azithromycin-resistant parasites as they traverse the mosquito host and human liver are conducted using state-of-the-art tools, including humanized mice. While the claim regarding the lack of transmission by atovaquone-resistant P. berghei is <bold>convincing</bold>, the evidence for the lack of transmission by atovaquone-resistant P. falciparum is insufficient. This work will appeal to biologists and biomedical scientists in parasitology and drug discovery, offering insights into combating antimalarial drug resistance and understanding the fitness costs associated with drug-resistant parasites.</p>

<p>In this manuscript by Buchanan and colleagues, the authors set out to determine if mutations associated with resistance to the Plasmodium apicoplast inhibitor azithromycin (AZ) had a measurable impact on the fitness of Plasmodium berghei and P. falciparum parasites as they traverse both the mosquito host and vertebrate liver.</p>
<p>The Plasmodium endosymbiotic organelles - the mitochondrion and apicoplast - are attractive drug targets as they (1) possess essential functions across the multi-host multi-compartment life cycle of these parasites, and (2) are of bacterial origin and thus are vulnerable to inhibition both to extant antibiotics, and novel drugs with high parasite specificity.</p>
<p>Historically however the high resistance propensity of drug targets encoded in the organellar genomes (most notably atovaquone and doxycycline) has precluded the use of these drugs in an endemic setting, limiting these potent compounds to use in prophylaxis for travelers from non-endemic countries. Several studies in the last decade now fairly definitively show that mutations conferring resistance to atovaquone in the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b are, in a mutation-dependent manner, totally or near-totally compromised in their ability to infect, grow, and escape the mosquito host, leading to a reexamination of the potential utility of this extraordinarily potent drug in endemic settings. Symmetries exist between the Plasmodium mitochondrion and apicoplast, which both appear to have highly fexpanded roles in the mosquito and liver relative to the blood stages. Thus, the authors set out to explore whether mutations in essential apicoplast genes were, in a similar manner to mutations in cytochrome B, associated with fitness effects in the mosquito and/or liver.</p>
<p>Towards this, the authors selected for several AZ-resistant parasite populations, all of which acquired mutations in the apicoplast genome-encoded ribosomal protein Rpl4. Interestingly, the authors observed contrasting fitness effects caused by these mutations, both between mutants within Plasmodium species, and between species. In P. berghei, AZ mutants were compromised in their ability to form oocysts and sporozoites, and a large proportion of sporozoites lacked an intact apicoplast and displayed aberrant gliding behaviour. Similarly, in the liver, Rpl4 mutant P. berghei liver schizonts were smaller, had fewer nuclei, and appeared extremely limited in their ability to cause a patent infection - crucially in particular via mosquito bites. Surprisingly, a P. falciparum Rpl4 mutant (notably in a different position of the protein) had no impact on sporogony but appeared to have a strong impact on liver schizont development in a liver-humanized mouse model, suggesting that establishment of blood stage infection in a subsequent human host would be less likely for mutant parasites.</p>
<p>This is a well-executed study, that presents novel and noteworthy findings. The impact of drug-resistance-conferring mutations in Plasmodium outside of the blood stage is woefully understudied, primarily due to significant challenges associated with studying Plasmodium, especially P. falciparum, in both the mosquito and liver which the authors navigate commendably. The results presented in this manuscript leverage state-of-the-art techniques and clearly support the authors' conclusion that AZ-conferring resistance mutations have a strong negative effect on the ability of Plasmodium parasites to both reinfect and cause symptomatic infection in a subsequent vertebrate host. This could indicate that apicoplast-targeted inhibitors are more attractive as co-drugs for malaria treatment than previously thought, due to the reduced probability of the spread of resistance, which has been a perennial issue in malaria therapeutic care.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript answers an important question about the transmission of Plasmodium parasites resistant to apicoplast inhibitors, specifically azithromycin. This study builds on previous work showing the inability to transmit parasites resistant to mitochondrial inhibitor, atovaquone, based on fitness defects in transmission stages in the mosquito. The transmissibility of drug-resistant parasites is grounded in the basic biology of the Plasmodium lifecycle and has implications for the selection of drug regimens for clinical treatment, so these questions are highly significant. The authors clearly demonstrate severe defects in mosquito stages of azithromycin-resistant (AZR) P. berghei (rodent species) inhibiting transmission of AZR parasites. However, surprisingly AZR P. falciparum (human species) is unaffected in mosquito stages, rather defects are observed in liver-stage development suggesting AZR P. falciparum can transmit but may not mount a productive blood infection. The differences in the observed defects in the 2 species are important and well demonstrated in the results but are obscured in the title/summary of the manuscript. The results demonstrate that AZR parasites are unlikely to spread.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors performed experiments with both P. berghei (rodent species) and P. falciparum (human species). P. falciparum is the more relevant species from a clinical standpoint, however, there are limitations to studying the full lifecycle of P. falciparum which only infects humans and some primates, for example requiring humanized mice without intact immune systems. Pberghei is commonly used in lifecycle analyses as a proxy for experimental tractability, however, there are cases where the biology of P. berghei does not reflect that in P. falciparum. So the use of both species is complementary and most informative. Specific modification of the apicoplast genome, where AZR mutations are located, is not currently possible so matched genotypes could not be produced but multiple AZR mutants were analyzed for each species. Acknowledging these limitations in the experimental systems available, the authors perform a thorough set of experiments to pinpoint the specific defects in AZR Pb vs Pf during mosquito and liver developmental stages. The results show phenotypic differences between AZR Pb and Pf in mosquito stages which was not expected but in line with differences in apicoplast biology of Pb vs Pf that are important to document and be aware of when using P. berghei as a model for P. falciparum development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The claim that human AZR malaria parasites (P. falciparum) is not readily transmitted to mosquitoes is incorrect, as stated in the title and abstract. Strictly speaking, transmission refers to the infection of a human host by another via mosquitos. The evidence that AZR Pf is unaffected in mosquito development indicates that transmission is not reduced compared to WT Pf. Rather transmitted AZR Pf has disrupted liver stage development and may not mount a productive blood infection. This distinction between the phenotypes of AZR Pb vs Pf is surprising, significant (suggesting differences between Pb and Pf and/or specific mutations in Rpl4), and should be more accurately represented in the title/abstract. To their credit, the authors performed thorough experiments to pinpoint the specific defects in AZR Pb vs Pf, but the current claim about AZR Pf is misleading.</p>
<p>Additional context:</p>
<p>Clinical trials (MORDOR studies) in several African countries have shown that biannual administration of azithromycin reduces childhood mortality (PMID: 31167050). The mechanism of this survival benefit is unknown and may be multifactorial. The findings in this manuscript can also be considered in the context that azithromycin is a commonly used antibiotic and may be administered for purposes other than malaria treatment. In theory, AZR-resistant parasites could be selected in asymptomatic patients not receiving malaria treatment but receiving azithromycin. This study indicates that mass distribution of azithromycin for other clinical applications would not result in adverse effects on malaria transmissions in the same population.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Drug resistance is a perennial problem for malaria control and strategies to prevent the acquisition and spread of drug resistance mutations are desperately needed. One strategy is to identify drug resistance mutations that arise in blood-stage parasites, but cannot be readily spread to a new human host. Since malaria parasites must survive and replicate in mosquitoes in order to be transmitted, mutations with elevated mosquito-stage fitness defects will not spread efficiently. Buchanan and coworkers focus on the drug azithromycin and its known role of inhibiting the ribosomes found in parasite apicoplast organelles. Apicoplast organelles are known to have elevated metabolic activity in mosquito stage parasites and azithromycin resistance mutations could interfere with mosquito stage parasite development and parasite transmission.</p>
<p>To address this hypothesis, azithromycin-resistant P. berghei and P. falciparum parasites were generated and analyzed for transmission defects. All lines had mutations in the apicoplast ribosomal protein Rpl4 consistent with the known role of azithromycin inhibiting the 50S ribosomal subunit. Overall, the three lines (3 berghei and one falciparum) had phenotypes that should limit parasite transmission, however, detailed characterization showed that there were surprising differences between the two parasite species and even between the P. berghei lines. The P. berghei lines produced fewer oocysts and sporozoites with aberrant apicoplast morphology compared to wild-type controls. Sporozoites from azithromycin-resistant lines appeared to have motility defects and typically were not able to infect mice (one strain produced infections when 10,000 sporozoites were injected, but not when 1,000 were).</p>
<p>By contrast, the azithromycin-resistant P. falciparum strain did not display any mosquito-stage phenotypes and produced motile sporozoites with intact apicoplast organelles. These sporozoites, however, developed abnormally in a humanized mouse model with reduced liver-stage nuclear division and abnormal apicoplast morphology. These defects combined with a five-fold lower prevalence suggest that azithromycin-resistant P. falciparum parasites experience significant fitness costs during liver stage development (at least those harboring the G76V mutation).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work was carefully conducted and transparently presented. It provides a comprehensive view of how parasite development is impacted by azithromycin resistance mutations during the mosquito and liver stages in P. berghei and P. falciparum. It adds a new dimension to the growing literature on the transmissibility of drug-resistant parasites, by showing that mutations in the apicoplast genome can impact transmission.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Whether these liver-stage defects in P. falciparum are severe enough to completely block subsequent blood-stage infection remains to be seen and would require experiments with humanized mice continuously grafted with human red blood cells - a difficult and expensive model system.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their positive comments and valuable suggestions for improvements to the manuscript. We intend to revisit the discussion to clarify our interpretation of how azithromycin resistance mutations impact the transmission potential of P. falciparum and expand on the differences between mouse and human malaria. Additionally, we intend to adjust the title to better align with the revised interpretation of the main findings. These changes will be reflected in the revised manuscript to be submitted as the eLife Version of Record.</p>
