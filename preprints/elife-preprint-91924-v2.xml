<title>Abstract</title><p>Muscle regeneration is a complex process due to dynamic and multiscale biochemical and cellular interactions, making it difficult to identify microenvironmental conditions that are beneficial to muscle recovery from injury using experimental approaches alone. To understand the degree to which individual cellular behaviors impact endogenous mechanisms of muscle recovery, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) using the Cellular Potts framework to simulate the dynamic microenvironment of a cross-section of murine skeletal muscle tissue. We referenced more than 100 published studies to define over 100 parameters and rules that dictate the behavior of muscle fibers, satellite stem cells (SSC), fibroblasts, neutrophils, macrophages, microvessels, and lymphatic vessels, as well as their interactions with each other and the microenvironment. We utilized parameter density estimation to calibrate the model to temporal biological datasets describing cross-sectional area (CSA) recovery, SSC, and fibroblast cell counts at multiple time points following injury. The calibrated model was validated by comparison of other model outputs (macrophage, neutrophil, and capillaries counts) to experimental observations. Predictions for eight model perturbations that varied cell or cytokine input conditions were compared to published experimental studies to validate model predictive capabilities. We used Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficient to identify <italic>in silico</italic> perturbations of cytokine diffusion coefficients and decay rates to enhance CSA recovery. This analysis suggests that combined alterations of specific cytokine decay and diffusion parameters result in greater fibroblast and SSC proliferation compared to individual perturbations with a 13% increase in CSA recovery compared to unaltered regeneration at 28 days. These results enable guided development of therapeutic strategies that similarly alter muscle physiology (i.e. converting ECM-bound cytokines into freely diffusible forms as studied in cancer therapeutics or delivery of exogenous cytokines) during regeneration to enhance muscle recovery after injury.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Skeletal muscle injuries account for more than 30% of all injuries and are one of the most common complaints in orthopedics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The standard treatment for muscle injuries is limited mostly to rest, ice, compression, elevation, anti-inflammatory drugs, and immobilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. These treatments lack a firm scientific basis and have varied outcomes, some resulting in incomplete functional recovery, formation of scar tissue, and high injury recurrence rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Our fundamental understanding of the individual cellular and subcellular behaviors of muscle cells has advanced and made it clear that interactions between cells and their microenvironment is critical for healthy regeneration. These interactions are dynamic, involve feedback mechanisms, and lead to complex emergent phenomena; therefore, there are numerous possible interventions that could enhance muscle regeneration.</p>
<p>Muscle regeneration requires an abundance of cells and cytokines to interact in a highly coordinated mechanism involving five interrelated cascading phases including: degeneration, inflammation, regeneration, remodeling, and functional recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Following an acute muscle injury, there is a time-dependent recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages to remove necrotic tissue and release factors that regulate fibroblast behavior and SSC activation, proliferation, and division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Following initial inflammatory response, fibroblasts and SSCs activate and proliferate with the macrophages shifting from their pro to anti-inflammatory phenotype. In healthy muscle, this process would be followed by remodeling of the muscle where the fibroblasts apoptose and SSCs differentiate and fuse to repair the myofibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Each cell involved in this process secretes cytokines that help regulate cell recruitment and chemotaxes to modulate the dynamics of the recovery. It has also been shown that the molecular events implicated in angiogenesis occur at early stages of muscle regeneration to restore microvascular networks that are crucial for successful muscle recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There are numerous cytokines involved in muscle regeneration, many of which have been individually studied to examine their influence on muscle regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. These cytokines play key roles in dictating cell behaviors and are major drivers of the regeneration cascade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The dynamics of these cytokines control many aspects of the microenvironment and altering their properties to optimize treatments has been proposed in a variety of settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Testing alterations in cytokine dynamics experimentally has proven to be complex and expensive due to difficulties in cytokine identification and quantification as well as confounding factors due to pleiotropic activities of cytokines and interactions with soluble receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. These challenges make it difficult to holistically test different diffusion and decay properties for numerous cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, if we could better understand the synergistic effects of alteration in cytokines, we could design a more effective therapy for treating muscle injury.</p>
<p>There are over a million possible combinations of cytokine alterations, making it unrealistic to study all combinations with experiments alone. For this reason, an <italic>in silico</italic> approach is needed to fully explore the possible treatment landscape and make predictions on potential targets to enhance muscle recovery. Over the last several years, Agent Based Models (ABM) of muscle regeneration have developed to study muscle regeneration in a variety of applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. These models were foundational for exploring the role of SSCs in a variety of muscle milieus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and for demonstrating how ABMs can be used to simulate therapeutic interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, previous models employed simplistic, non-spatial representations of cytokine behaviors and properties, which limited their ability to recapitulate cytokine alterations such as injection of TGF-β<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, these prior models did not include microvessel adaptations and dynamic ECM properties which are crucial for understanding the altered microenvironmental state following muscle injury. These critical limitations must be addressed in order for ABMs of muscle regeneration to provide meaningful insights into treatments for muscle injury.</p>
<p>The goals of this work were to: 1) develop an ABM of muscle regeneration that includes cellular and cytokine spatial dynamics as well as the microvascular environment, 2) calibrate the model to capture cell behaviors from published experimental studies, 3) validate model outcomes by comparison with multiple published experimental studies, 4) conduct <italic>in silico</italic> experiments to predict how altering cytokine dynamics impacts muscle regeneration. For model calibration, we implemented an iterative and robust parameter density estimation protocol to refine the parameter space and calibrate to temporal biological datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) was used to guide <italic>in silico</italic> experiments by identifying parameters and timepoints that were most critical for ideal regeneration metrics.</p>

<title>Agent-Based Model Development Overview</title>
<p>ABMs represent the behaviors and interactions of autonomous agents, such as cells, which are governed by literature-derived rules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Agent-based modeling provides an excellent platform for studying complex cellular dynamics because they reveal how the interactions between individual cellular behaviors lead to emergent behaviors in the whole system.</p>
<p>We implemented the ABM in CompuCell3D (version 4.3.1), a Python-based modeling software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The ABM’s code is available for download (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zenodo.org/records/10403014">https://zenodo.org/records/10403014</ext-link>). To build the model, we extended upon about 40 rules developed in previous agent based models of muscle regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> in combination with a deep literature search referencing over 100 published studies to define approximately 100 total rules that dictate the behavior of fiber cells, SSC, fibroblasts, neutrophils, and macrophages, as well as their interactions with the microenvironment, including microvasculature remodeling and cytokine diffusion and secretion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). For a rule to be incorporated into the model, there had to be an established understanding within the literature supporting the behavior (i.e. multiple studies reporting similar findings or supported by other reputable publications). When available, we used experimental data to define the parameters associated with the model rules. There were 52 parameters that could not be related to known physiological measurement; therefore, these parameters were calibrated using parameter density estimation which will be described below in <italic>Model Calibration</italic>. Following calibration of model parameters, separate model outputs were validated by comparison with experimental data, and various model perturbations were conducted and compared to literature results. This process allowed us to have confidence in the predictive capabilities of the model so that we could simulate and predict the sensitivity of muscle regeneration to changes in cytokines.</p>

<title>Cellular-Potts Modeling Framework</title>
<p>Prior work to construct computational models to represent muscle recovery have used ordinary differential equations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> or agent-based modeling software, such as software such as Netlogo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> or Repast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. While these models have yielded great insights into skeletal muscle damage and recovery processes, they have limited capacity to represent the spatial diffusion of cytokines accurately and explicitly throughout the skeletal muscle. The Cellular-Potts model framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (CPM, also known as the Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg model), proved an ideal choice because it allows for logic-based representation of cellular behavior and interactions characteristic of agent-based modeling (see Supplemental Text 1 for additional details on CPM).</p>

<title>ABM Design</title>
<p>The ABM spatially represents a two-dimensional male murine skeletal muscle fascicle cross-section of approximately 50 muscle fibers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The ABM depicts the microenvironment of the cross-section as well as the spatial migration of cells and diffusion of various cytokines. The ABM simulates the emergent phenomenon of muscle tissue from an acute injury over the course of 28 days. The spatial agents in the model include muscle fibers, necrotic muscle tissues, extracellular matrix (ECM), capillaries, lymphatic vessels, quiescent and activated fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, quiescent and activated SSCs, myoblasts, myocytes, immature myotubes, neutrophils, monocytes, resident macrophages, pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1), and anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2). In addition, the ABM includes seven diffusing factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and interleukin 10 (IL-10). A review of the literature led us to determine that these factors and cytokine isoforms were most critical for representing the behaviors of each cell during the regeneration cascade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="553247v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>The muscle cross-section geometry was created by importing a histology image stained with laminin α2 into a custom MATLAB script that masked the histology image to distinguish between the fibers and ECM. The mask was imported into an initialization CC3D script that defined the muscle fibers, ECM, and microvasculature to specific cell types and generated a PIF file that was imported into the ABM as the starting cross-section. The injury is simulated by stochastically selecting a region within the cross-section to replace the fiber elements with necrotic elements, where the percentage of CSA damage is an input parameter. When a threshold of fiber elements within a muscle fiber becomes damaged the entire muscle fiber turns necrotic and requires clearance. If the damage is below the threshold, only the region of necrosis must be removed and the SSCs can fuse to the remaining fiber. During model initialization, the injury criteria can be altered to simulate various degrees of myotoxin injury by changing the percent of necrotic tissue following injury.</p>
<p>Each Monte Carlo step (mcs) represents a 15-minute timestep, and the model simulations were run until 28 days post-injury. The cell velocity is limited by how many times the Cellular-Potts algorithm is run, so we set 45 Cellular-Potts evaluations per mcs to ensure stability in migratory agent behavior. The number of Cellular-Potts evaluations per mcs and the lambda chemotaxis parameters were tuned in a simplified simulation of individual cells and their respective chemotactic gradients so we could obtain cell speeds that were consistent with speeds derived from literature sources (<xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). At each mcs, the agent behaviors are governed by rules that were derived from experimental data found in the literature. The behaviors of each agent are based on environmental conditions, such as nearby cells and cytokine gradients, as well as probability-based rules. As an example, a capillary located near a damaged fiber has a probability of becoming non-perfused and then senses the amount of VEGF-A and MMP-9 at its location to decide if the levels are adequate to induce angiogenesis (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Model outputs include CSA recovery (sum of total healthy fiber elements normalized by the initial CSA), capillary and collagen density, cell counts, relative cytokine abundance, and spatial coordinates of cells and cytokines.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Overview of Agent Behaviors</title>
<p>Simulated behaviors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) of the neutrophils and macrophages include cytokine-dependent recruitment, chemotaxis, phagocytosis of damaged fibers (neutrophils, monocytes, and M1 macrophages), phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils (monocytes and M1 macrophages), secretion and uptake of cytokines, and apoptosis. The SSC and fibroblast agent behaviors also include cytokine-dependent recruitment, chemotaxis, secretion and uptake of cytokines, and apoptosis, in addition to quiescence, activation, division, and differentiation. The biological intricacy of some cell types, such as SSCs which have a more complex cell cycle and are regulated by dynamic interplay of intrinsic factors and an array of microenvironmental stimuli, led to the necessity for adding more rules that govern their behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The SSCs have 33 parameters dictating the 17 agent rules (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), fibroblasts have 27 parameters for 11 agent rules (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), macrophages have 31 parameters for 15 agent rules (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), neutrophils have 18 parameters for 7 agent rules (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), fibers have 18 parameters for 4 agent rules (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), and microvessels have 22 parameters for 6 agent rules (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). At each mcs, cytokines are secreted by agents if certain conditions were met. For cell recruitment, the levels of recruiting cytokines for each agent are checked, and if the concentration is high enough to signal cell recruitment (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 1</xref>), a new agent is added to the field at the location of the highest concentration. The agents also undergo chemotaxis by sensing the surrounding cytokine gradients and move towards higher concentrations of cytokines, binding and removing that cytokine as they move along it to simulate physical binding of the cytokine to the receptor. Agents that are in a quiescent state require a certain threshold level of cytokines to become activated and cannot chemotax, secrete, divide, or differentiate until this threshold is reached. Our model assumes each unique cell type secretes the same concentration of cytokines per timestep for all relevant cytokines to drive model agent decisions. Each computational timestep represents 15 minutes of real-world time. We assume that this is of sufficient resolution to accurately reproduce immune cell agent behaviors during regeneration.</p>

<title>ECM Agents</title>
<p>ECM elements surround the fiber elements and are assigned a collagen density parameter which varies based on the amount of necrotic tissue removed and the extent of fibroblast/myofibroblast collagen secretion. When necrotic elements are removed, the phagocytosing inflammatory cells secrete MMP-9s which degrade some of the collagen within that section of the ECM, thereby causing that element to have a lower collagen density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The collagen density of the ECM alters the diffusivity of the secreted factors, and fiber placement is dependent on the collagen density (discussed below). The fibroblasts help rebuild the ECM by secreting collagen on low collagen density ECM elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Myofibroblasts can secrete collagen on any ECM element and if prolonged results in high density collagen elements, representing a fibrotic state.</p>

<p>Upon model initialization, a portion of the muscle fiber agents are converted to necrotic fibers based on the user prescribed injury. Fibers that reach a damaged threshold became fully necrotic whereas those surrounding the area of necrosis were damaged but not fully apoptotic cells.

The neutrophils and monocytes are added to the simulation at the lattice sites above capillaries (within the cell layer <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) and chemotax along their respective gradients. The recruitment of the neutrophils and monocytes are distributed among the healthy capillaries with a higher affinity for capillaries at locations with higher concentrations of HGF and MCP-1, respectively. Under physiologically reasonable chemotactic gradient conditions, the recruited immune cells dispersed efficiently, with no aggregation. Capillaries that are neighboring areas of necrosis become non-perfused and therefore are unable to transport cells into the microenvironment until regenerated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. Angiogenesis can occur as long as there is enough VEGF-A present at the non-perfused capillary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>. Similar to published studies, there is an increase in the capillary-to-myofiber ratio during muscle regeneration, which is due to the formation of new capillary sprouts modulated in part by local MMP-9 and VEGF-A levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Binding, Diffusivity, and Collagen Density</title>
<p>For many of the agent behaviors described above, there are associated binding events that play key roles in regulation of the cytokine fields. Any cytokine dependent behavior is coupled with removal of a portion of that cytokine once the behavior is initiated. For example, upon SSC activation the amount of HGF required to activate is taken up by the SSC and removed from the cytokine field to simulate the ligand binding and endocytosis resulting from SSC activation. Similar binding events were modeled for SSC and fibroblast division and differentiation, macrophage transitions, cell apoptosis, and chemotaxis along a cytokine gradient.</p>
<p>Due to limited data availability quantifying the diffusion constants of the modeled cytokines in the context of the tissue microenvironment (which includes diffusion-altering elements including collagen and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)), we applied a diffusivity estimation technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup>. To do so, previously developed methods (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation 1</xref>) were applied to account for the combined effects of collagen and GAGs (<xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup>. The expression includes the radius of the cytokine (r<sub>s</sub>), the radius of the fiber (r<sub>f</sub>), the volume fraction (<italic>ϕ</italic>), <italic>D</italic> and <italic>D</italic><sub>∞</sub> are the diffusivities of the cytokines in the polymer solution and in free solution, respectively.

<p>Throughout the model simulation, the diffusivity is recalculated with the updated collagen volume fraction, as the collagen density changes throughout the microenvironment.

<title>Model Calibration</title>
<p>Known parameters were fixed to literature values, and uncertain parameters were calibrated by comparing simulation outcomes to published experimental data. Calibration data included published findings from injury models that have synchronous regeneration after tissue necrosis (i.e., cardiotoxin, notexin, and barium chloride)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>. The metrics that were used to calibrate the model included time-varying CSA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup>, SSC counts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, and fibroblast counts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. These metrics were used for calibration because of their key roles in the regeneration of muscle and the complex interplay between these outputs. Cell count data were normalized by the number of cells on the day of the experimental peak to allow for comparison between experiments and simulations. For CSA, the experimental and model outcomes were normalized using fold-change from pre-injury to compare model-simulated with experimental CSA, as percent change from baseline is commonly used experimentally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>. Model cell counts were normalized by the number of cells at the peak time point in the experimental data. SSC and fibroblast counts were normalized to day 5. Neutrophil counts were normalized to day 1. Total macrophage, M1, and M2 counts were normalized to day 3. The capillaries were normalized to fiber area, as done in the experimental data.</p>
<p>Initial ranges for the 52 unknown parameters were determined by literature review or by running the model to test possible upper and lower thresholds for parameters (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). To narrow the parameter ranges beyond those initial ranges, we used a recently published calibration protocol, CaliPro, which utilizes parameter density estimation to refine parameter space and calibrate to temporal biological datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. CaliPro was selected as the calibration method because it is model-agnostic which allows it to handle the complexities of stochastic models such as ABMs, selects viable parameter ranges in the setting of a very high-dimensional parameter space, and circumvents the need for a cost function, a challenge when there are many objectives, as in our case. Briefly, Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) was used to generate 600 samples which were run in triplicate. These runs were then evaluated against a set of pass criteria, and the density functions of the passing runs and failing runs were calculated (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). Parameter ranges were narrowed by alternative density subtraction (ADS), where the new ranges were determined by the smallest and largest parameter values where the density of passing is higher than the density of failing. The sensitivity of the model outputs to the parameters was examined using LHS in combination with partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup>. LHS/PRCC methods have been used for various differential equation models and ABMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup>. PRCC was computed using MATLAB to determine the correlation between ABM parameters (i.e. cytokine threshold for activation) and the ABM output (i.e. fibroblast cell count). Correlations with a p-value less than 0.05 were assumed to be statistically significant. This helped refine initial parameter bounds as well as make model adjustments based on the parameter dynamics elucidated from PRCC. This process of sampling parameter ranges, evaluating the model, and narrowing parameter ranges was repeated in an iterative fashion while updating pass criteria until a parameter set was identified that consistently met the strictest criteria (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>). The final passing criteria were set to be within 1 SD of the experimental data for CSA recovery and 2.5 SD for SSC and fibroblast count. These criteria were selected so that the model followed experimental trends and accounted for both model stochasticity and experimental variability in datasets that had narrower SDs for certain timepoints. Early iterations had a wide parameter range to avoid missing portions of the realistic parameter space. At first, narrowing the parameter space increased passing simulations, but upon reaching the ideal parameter space, further narrowing eliminated viable parameters, resulting in fewer passing runs. Following 8 iterations of narrowing the parameter space with CaliPro, we reached a set of parameters that had fewer passing runs than the previous iteration. We then returned to the runs from the prior iteration and set the bounds such that all 3 runs from the parameter set fell within the final passing criteria. The final parameter set was run 100 times to verify that the variation from the stochastic nature of the rules did not cause output that was inconsistent with experimental trends.</p>

<p>We compared model outputs (M1, M2, and total macrophage counts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref></sup>, neutrophil counts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup>, and capillary counts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup>) that were kept separate from the calibration criteria with published experimental data to verify that these outputs followed trends from the experimental data without requiring extra model tuning. In addition, we also altered various model input conditions (cell input conditions, cytokine dynamics, and microvessel dynamics) to simulate an array of model perturbations (<xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>) which allowed comparison of a set of model outputs with separate published experiments. For example, we simulated an IL-10 knockout condition by eliminating IL-10 secretion and adjusting the diffusion and decay parameters so that the concentration of IL-10 throughout the simulation was reduced, decreasing the behaviors driven by the cytokine as a result of the KO condition. One hundred replicates of each model perturbation were performed, and perturbation outputs were compared with control simulation outputs via a two-sample t-test with a significance level of 0.05. We were then able to compare how the model outputs aligned with published experimental findings to determine if the model could capture the altered regeneration dynamics.</p>

Second, macrophage depletion simulations predicted decreased TGF-β concentrations throughout the simulation while experiments measured an initial decrease in concentration followed by increased concentrations at days 7 and 14.

The impact of VEGF-A injection on peak SSC and fibroblast counts was dependent on dosage amount, with the extra high VEGF-A injection resulting in the largest peaks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Cytokine concentration trends were similar for all injections, but most peak levels were dosage dependent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G-L</xref>).

<title>Cytokine dynamic analysis leads to new model perturbations that predict improved regeneration</title>
<p>LHS-PRCC of cytokine decay and diffusion parameters elucidated temporal relationships between cytokine parameters and key regeneration metrics, such as positive correlations between CSA and TGF-β and MMP-9 decay (<xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). Of all cytokine parameters, the model outputs were most sensitive to HGF decay, with all outputs except M1 cell count being significantly impacted. PRCC plots showed that TGF-β and MMP decay were positively correlated and HGF decay was negatively correlated with CSA recovery, with higher significance at timepoints after 12 days (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>). Correlation plots for various cytokine concentrations and regeneration metrics showed trends in cytokine dependent cell behaviors such as the TNF-α concentration that led to heightened fibroblast cell counts as well as the corresponding TNF-α concentration threshold that results in diminished fibroblast response (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 3</xref>). These PRCC trends guided cytokine parameter perturbations to include lower HGF and VEGF-A decay, higher TGF-β, MMP-9, and MCP-1 decay, and higher MCP-1 diffusion because each of the cytokine modifications indicated some form of enhanced regeneration outcome metrics (<xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 3</xref>). All these perturbations except MCP-1 decay show increased CSA, increased healthy capillaries, and increased SSCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Finally, a combination of all changes except for MCP-1 decay was simulated. The combined cytokine alteration resulted in the highest CSA recovery (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>), as well as increased M1 macrophage counts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>), decreased M2 macrophage counts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>), increased fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>) and SSCs cell counts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). Capillaries regenerated faster in the combined perturbation than under unaltered conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). It is likely that the combination of cytokines perturbed cell dynamics in a manner that promoted regeneration in both the early and later phases. During early regeneration, lower HGF decay, higher TGF decay, and MCP-1 diffusion contributed to increased SSCs while lowered VEGF decay increased angiogenesis. During late regeneration, lower HGF decay and higher MMP decay contributed to an increased anti-inflammatory state and SSC differentiation. The combined cytokine perturbation predicted a 13% improvement in CSA recovery compared to the unaltered regeneration amount at 28 days. The combined cytokine perturbation also had higher peaks in SSC and fibroblast counts than any of the singular cytokine perturbations, indicating the synergistic effects of altering the cytokine dynamics in combination.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We developed a novel ABM that recapitulates muscle regeneration and, unique from prior work, includes spatial interactions between cytokines and the microvasculature based on relevant literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The creation of the model provides a more controlled environment for studying muscle regeneration, reducing error and variation commonly encountered with <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments.

Through <italic>in silico</italic> experiments, we gained new insight into how the combination of key cytokine dynamic alterations could increase SSC cells and enhance CSA recovery. The ability for altered cytokine concentrations to change regeneration outcomes is consistent with studies that have found enhanced muscle recovery with delivery of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) which contain VEGF and TGF-β<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup>. These model perturbations allow development of hypotheses and can provide the basis for future experiments and potential therapeutic interventions such as plasminogen activators to alter cytokines dynamics to enhance muscle recovery.</p>

<title>ABM provides biological insight on nonlinear effects of cytokine levels</title>
<p>The ABM offers valuable insights into the muscle regeneration dynamics under various altered conditions, elucidating the complex interplay of cytokines, angiogenesis, and cell behaviors. Systematic simulations reveal critical thresholds, nonlinear effects, and synergistic cytokine combinations impacting regeneration. Perturbations varying VEGF-A injection doses showed increased CSA recovery up to a threshold (high VEGF-A injection simulation), beyond which further improvements in CSA recovery cease. Cytokine KO simulations revealed the complex nature of the relationship between cytokines; removal of one cytokine from the system has a cascading temporal impact. Relationships between cytokines and cellular outputs exhibit nonlinear effects, as seen with the limited impact of elevated HGF on CSA recovery beyond a threshold and the non-monotonic relationship between TNF-α and fibroblast counts (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>). Further analysis revealed that specific combinations of cytokine perturbations could enhance regeneration beyond singular cytokine interventions. For example, a combined intervention of: 1) decreasing HGF and VEGF-A decay, 2) increasing TGF-β and MMP-9 decay, and 3) increasing MCP-1 diffusion enhanced muscle regeneration. Prior studies have shown that individually, increased HGF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup>, VEGF-A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, and MCP-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref></sup> stimulate muscle regeneration whereas reduced TGF-β<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref></sup> and MMP-9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref></sup> stimulate muscle regeneration. The model suggests that combined alterations have a stronger regenerative effect than individual cytokine changes, enhancing muscle recovery through distinct mechanisms—increasing healthy capillaries, SSC counts, and reducing inflammatory cells.</p>
<p>Cytokine modifications intended to enhance muscle recovery can have clinical relevance and have been studied in various settings. For example, synthetic biomaterials coated with IL-4 have been implanted as a cytokine delivery vehicle and were successful in increasing M2 cells within the muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref></sup>. Cytokine antagonist have been successful at promoting muscle regeneration, seen in prior work with anti-IL-6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref></sup>. Studies have also shown that activation of plasmin is able to induce the release of ECM bound VEGF, increasing angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref></sup>. Due to the complex network of cytokines, studies that deliver simple modulation of one or two cytokines typically have an insufficient response to generate appreciable improvements. This suggests that using a combination of biologic and synthetic biomaterials to modulate multiple cytokines is necessary, which aligns with our findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref></sup>. Multiple cytokines have been modulated through the use of PRP which contains VEGF-A and an array of other cytokines, but PRP has had mixed success in a clinical setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">121</xref></sup>. Our model has the capability to test and optimize various combinations of cytokines, along with exploring different temporal schedules for delivering specific treatments. For instance, it can predict whether modified combinations of cytokines prove beneficial at specific timepoints, aiding in the development of optimal treatment compositions aligned with the temporal dynamics of the regeneration cascade. These predictions provide novel concepts for future experiments and potential interventions. For example, the predictions from the model suggest that interventions that combine activation of plasmins for bound VEGF release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref></sup> with delivery of synthetic biomaterials coated with HGF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref></sup>, TGF-β antagonist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref></sup>, nuclear factor-kappa B inhibitory peptide to inhibit MMP-9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref></sup>, and recombinant MCP-1 hydrogels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref></sup> to alter diffusion rate would result in improved regeneration outcomes.</p>

<title>Advancements from prior muscle regeneration models</title>
<p>Previous studies have employed computational models to investigate muscle regeneration across diverse contexts, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and volumetric muscle loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Earlier muscle regeneration ABMs from our group have been used to test the effects of priming muscle with inflammatory cells prior to injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. While these models laid the foundation for simulating muscle adaptations, they were constrained by limited diffusion capabilities and an absence of critical features related to microvessel growth and remodeling throughout the regeneration process. Similarly, other ABMs from our group have examined altered microenvironments, but their omission of spatial cytokine diffusion hindered comprehensive representation of cell behaviors pivotal to regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Recently, new ABMs have been published that focus on cerebral palsy and the impact of injury type on eccentric contraction-induced damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The model presented here provides advancements over prior models in three areas: 1) explicit modeling of cytokine-specific diffusion and decay that depends on the ECM environment, 2) addition of microvasculature, and 3) incorporation of a robust and rigorous calibration and validation process. The addition of microvessel growth and remodeling dynamics empowers investigations into how interventions impact angiogenesis during regeneration, thereby influencing muscle recovery outcomes. By considering the intricate relationship between microvessels and regeneration, our model opens avenues for evaluating the effects of interventions on the broader recovery process. Secondly, understanding how cytokines influence cell behaviors at different times during regeneration is crucial for determining optimal treatment targets and dosing. While cytokine dynamics can be altered experimentally, doing so is expensive and time consuming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> so exploring many combinations of alterations would be practically infeasible. Our model incorporates decay and diffusion dynamics of a subset of cytokines to allow testing of far more alterations in cytokines than would be reasonable to conduct experimentally. Lastly, we leveraged the CaliPro technique for parameter density estimation-based calibration and LHS-PRCC to gain biological insight by analyzing how altered microenvironmental parameters could benefit regeneration outcomes. This approach of implementing parameter identification to guide model perturbations demonstrates the capabilities of the model as a novel tool for generating new hypotheses and identifying mechanisms to target for enhanced regeneration outcomes.</p>
<p>Our model predictions are generally consistent with these prior models, with added biological complexity that has yielded several new important insights. For example, simulation of hindered angiogenesis predicted a decrease in SSCs leading to poor CSA recovery, similar to how lower SSC counts resulted in lower CSA recovery in perturbations in both healthy and DMD simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Our model provides additional understanding about the corresponding spatial cytokine changes that ultimately result in modulation of SSC dynamics within the microenvironment. The additional model advancements incorporated address prior muscle regeneration modeling gaps in understanding of how angiogenesis alters recovery outcomes as well as the response of complex spatial cell and cytokine dynamics.</p>

<title>Limitations and future work</title>
<p>There are some important limitations of this study that should be discussed. First, the model does not include all cell types and cytokines that are known to influence muscle regeneration and does not account for cytokine subtype or differences between endogenous and exogenous cytokines. These cells and cytokines likely have redundant functions, given the model effectively captures muscle regeneration using the included cells and cytokines. Second, the model does not currently represent hypertrophy during regeneration, which restricts CSA recovery from surpassing 100%; however, the cell dynamics it portrays remain consistent with those observed in studies that lead to hypertrophy following injury. Third, we assume a 2D cross-section based on similar ABMs that have explored the relations of 2D to 3D simulations. These studies found that the diffusion accuracy is not greatly varied and that 2D is sufficient to predict the same mechanisms seen in 3D simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">126</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">127</xref></sup>. To determine the robustness of the 2D initial cross-section, preliminary testing has shown that the initial spatial configuration can be altered and still achieve similar results (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 5</xref>), but further examination is needed to determine sensitivity to numerous configurations. Fourth, the calibration and validation dataset integrated multiple datasets from diverse sources. We acknowledge inherent limitations arising from variations in sample sizes and experimental techniques across sources. Fifth, it is also possible that the calibrated parameters are unable to capture behaviors that were not exhibited within the experimental datasets used in parameterization. While we tested ranges for each parameter and settled on a single parameter set that best fit the calibration data, there may be additional parameters sets that fit the calibration data but have varied levels of stochasticity and altered reproducibility of replicate simulations. Lastly, the current model was calibrated to male mice data despite known sex difference in skeletal muscle, regeneration mechanisms, and the timeline of recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">130</xref></sup>. Experimental measurements of female muscle regeneration are fairly limited because most muscle injury studies only use male mice or do not distinguish between sexes, making it difficult to incorporate sex differences into the model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">131</xref></sup>. Experiments that incorporate female mice and measure hormone levels are needed to accurately incorporate rules to distinguish between the sex dependent dynamics of muscle regeneration.</p>
<p>This paper describes a significant advancement in modeling the complex process of muscle regeneration. Future efforts will extend the use of parameter density estimation to optimize the selection, doses, and timing of injections of exogenously delivered cytokines. Further refinement of analysis methods could be pursued to disentangle specific underlying mechanisms of the dynamic feedbacks that drive the observed model outputs. Predictions from model simulations will also be used to inform future experiments by highlighting crucial time points to measure and predicted effect sizes for power analysis. Additionally, we aim to explore diverse muscle injury types and locations (i.e. injury relative to microvascular components) and their varying recovery responses, addressing challenges in comparing different acute injury techniques found in the literature. This study underscores the significance of cellular and cytokine spatial dynamics in muscle regeneration. Further inclusion of additional factors and hormones would provide a more holistic understanding of the system and how treatments may be altered based on microenvironmental conditions, providing a unique framework for the study of personalized muscle injury treatment.</p>

The value ℋ* represents our <italic>temperature</italic> parameter in the CPM, or the parameter that affects stochasticity of lattice site copy attempts. Δℋ is the change in effective energy due to a lattice site copy attempt. The Cellular-Potts simulation discussed here was implemented using CompuCell3D (CC3D), an open-source Python-based CPM platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Cellular-Potts model initialization</title>
<p>The muscle cross-section geometry was initialized by importing a histology image of (murine gastrocnemius stained with laminin α2) masked to distinguish between muscle fiber and ECM. The mask was imported into an initialization CC3D script that defined the muscle fibers, ECM, and microvasculature to specific Cellular-Potts lattice types and generated a Potts Initialization File (PIF) that was imported into the ABM as the starting cross-section. This initial configuration resulted in a square lattice of dimensions 321×417 pixels. The model consisted of 2 layers in the z axis: a tissue environment layer consisting of muscle, ECM, capillaries, and lymphatic channels, and an immune cell layer where immune cell agents migrated and interacted in the “2.5D” model. CPM interaction neighbor order was 4 for typical adhesion energy terms, and 1 for all other CPM Hamiltonian terms. Cellular-Potts model parameters are documented in <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 4</xref>, adhesion terms are described in <xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 5</xref>. Non-zero parameter values for adhesion energies between lattice types were calibrated visually to prevent aggregation of migratory cell types.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work extends previous agent-based models of murine muscle regeneration by the authors (especially Westman et al., 2021) and by others (especially Khuu et al, 2023) by incorporating additional agent rules (altogether now based on over 100 published studies), threshold parameters and interactions with fields of cytokines and growth factors as well as capillaries (dynamically changing through damage and angiogenesis) and lymphatic vessels. The estimation of 52 unknown parameters against three time courses of tissue-scale observables (muscle cross-sectional area recovery, satellite stem cell count and fibroblast cell count) employs the CaliPro algorithm (Joslyn et al., 2021) and sensitivity analysis. The model is validated against additional time courses of tissue-scale observables and qualitative perturbation data, which match almost all conditions. This model is here used to predict (also non-monotonic) responses of (combinations of) cytokine perturbations but it moreover represents a valuable resource for further analysis of emergent behavior across multiple spatial scales in a physiologically relevant system.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work (almost didactically) demonstrates how to develop, calibrate, validate and analyze a comprehensive, spatially resolved, dynamical, multicellular model. Testable model predictions of (also non-monotonic) emergent behaviors are derived and discussed. The computational model is based on a widely-used simulation platform and shared openly such that it can be further analyzed and refined by the community. The single-used parameter set is a good starting point for future work that can, as outlined in the discussion section of the paper, analyze model results from the full distribution of matching parameter values and for a spectrum of realistic tissue configurations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the paper, the authors use a cellular Potts model to investigate muscle regeneration. The model is an attempt to combine many contributors to muscle regeneration into one coherent framework. I believe the resulting model has the potential to be very useful in investigating the complex interplay of multiple actors contributing to muscle regeneration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript identified relevant model parameters from a long list of biological studies. This collation of a large amount of literature into one framework has the potential to be very useful to other authors. The mathematical methods used for parameterization and validation are transparent.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work (almost didactically) demonstrates how to develop, calibrate, validate and analyze a comprehensive, spatially resolved, dynamical, multicellular model. Testable model predictions of (also non-monotonic) emergent behaviors are derived and discussed. The computational model is based on a widely-used simulation platform and shared openly such that it can be further analyzed and refined by the community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the parameter estimation approach is sophisticated, this work does not address issues of structural and practical non-identifiability (Wieland et al., 2021,
DOI:10.1016/j.coisb.2021.03.005) of parameter values, given just tissue-scale summary statistics, and does not address how model predictions might change if alternative parameter combinations were used. Here, the calibrated model represents one point estimate (column &quot;Value&quot; in Suppl. Table 1) but there is specific uncertainty of each individual parameter value and such uncertainties need to be propagated (which is computationally expensive) to the model predictions for treatment scenarios.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the excellent suggestions and observations. The CaliPro parameterization technique applied puts an emphasis on finding a robust parameter space instead of a global optimum. To address structural non-identifiability, we utilized partial rank correlation coefficient with each iteration of the calibration process to ensure that the sensitivity of each parameter was relevant to model outputs. We also found that there were ranges of parameter values that would achieve passing criteria but when testing the ranges in replicate resulted in inconsistent outcomes. This led us to further narrow the parameters into a single parameter set that still had stochastic variability but did not have such large variability between replicate runs that it would be unreliable. Additional discussion on this point has been added to lines 623-628. We acknowledge that there are likely other parameter sets or model rules that would produce similar outcomes but the main purpose of the model was to utilize it to better understand the system and make new predictions, which our calibration scheme allowed us to accomplish.</p>
<p>Regarding practical non-identifiability, we acknowledge that there are some behaviors that are not captured in the model because those behaviors were not specifically captured in the calibration data. To ensure that the behaviors necessary to answer the aims of our paper were included, we used multiple different datasets and calibrated with multiple different output metrics. We believe we have identified the appropriate parameters to recapitulate the dominating mechanisms underlying muscle regeneration.
We have added additional discussion on practical non-identifiability to lines 621-623.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Suggested treatments (e.g. lines 484-486) are modeled as parameter changes of the endogenous cytokines (corresponding to genetic mutations!) whereas the administration of modified cytokines with changed parameter values would require a duplication of model components and interactions in the model such that cells interact with the superposition of endogenous and administered cytokine fields. Specifically, as the authors also aim at 'injections of exogenously delivered cytokines' (lines 578, 579) and propose altering decay rates or diffusion coefficients (Fig. 7), there needs to be a duplication of variables in the model to account for the coexistence of cytokine subtypes. One set of equations would have unaltered (endogenous) and another one have altered (exogenous or drugged) parameter values. Cells would interact with both of them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our perturbations did not include delivery of exogenously delivered cytokines and instead were focused on microenvironmental changes in cytokine diffusion and decay rates or specific cytokine concentration levels. For example, the purpose of the VEGF delivery perturbation was to test how an increase in VEGF concentrations would alter regeneration outcome metrics with the assumption that the delivered VEGF would act in the same manner as the endogenous VEGF. We have clarified the purpose of the simulations on line 410. We agree that exploring if model predictions would be altered if endogenous and exogenous were represented separately; however, we did not explore this type of scenario.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This work shows interesting emergent behavior from nonlinear cytokine interactions but the analysis does not provide insights into the underlying causes, e.g. which of the feedback loops dominates early versus late during a time course.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, analyzing the model to fully understand the time-varying interactions between the multiple feedback loops is a challenge in and of itself, and we appreciate the opportunity to elaborate on our approach to addressing this challenge. First: the crosstalk/feedback between cytokines and the temporal nature was analyzed in the heatmap (Fig. 6) and lines 474-482. Second: the sensitivity of cytokine parameters to specific outputs was included in Table 9 and full-time course sensitivity is included in Supplemental Figure 2. Further correlation analysis was also included to demonstrate how cytokine concentrations influenced specific output metrics at various timepoints (Supplemental Fig. 3). We agree that further elaboration of these findings is required; therefore, we added lines 504-509 to discuss the specific mechanisms at play with the combined cytokine interactions. We also added more discussion (lines 637-638) regarding future work that could develop more analysis methods to further investigate the complex behaviors in the model.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript identified relevant model parameters from a long list of biological studies. This collation of a large amount of literature into one framework has the potential to be very useful to other authors. The mathematical methods used for parameterization and validation are transparent.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:&gt;</p>
<p>I have a few concerns which I believe need to be addressed fully.</p>
<p>My main concerns are the following:</p>
<p>(1) The model is compared to experimental data in multiple results figures. However, the actual experiments used in these figures are not described. To me as a reviewer, that makes it impossible to judge whether appropriate data was chosen, or whether the model is a suitable descriptor of the chosen experiments. Enough detail needs to be provided so that these judgements can be made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point. We created a new table (Supplemental table 6) that describes the techniques used for each experimental measurement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Do I understand it correctly that all simulations are done using the same initial simulation geometry? Would it be possible to test the sensitivity of the paper results to this geometry? Perhaps another histological image could be chosen as the initial condition, or alternative initial conditions could be generated in silico? If changing initial conditions is an unreasonably large request, could the authors discuss this issue in the manuscript?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insightful question regarding the initial simulation geometry in our model. The initial configuration of the fibers/ECM/microvascular structures was kept consistent but the location of the necrosis was randomly placed for each simulation. Future work will include an in-depth analysis of altered histology configuration on model predictions which has been added to lines 618-621. We did a preliminary example analysis by inputting a different initial simulation geometry, which predicted similar regeneration outcomes. We have added Supplemental Figure 5 that provides the results of that example analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Cytokine knockdowns are simulated by 'adjusting the diffusion and decay parameters' (line 372). Is that the correct simulation of a knockdown? How are these knockdowns achieved experimentally? Wouldn't the correct implementation of a knockdown be that the production or secretion of the cytokine is reduced? I am not sure whether it's possible to design an experimental perturbation which affects both parameters.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate that this important question has been posed. Yes, in order to simulate the knockout conditions, the cytokine secretion was reduced/eliminated. The diffusion and decay parameters were also adjusted to ensure that the concentration within the system was reduced. Lines 391-394 were added to clarify this assumption.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The premise of the model is to identify optimal treatment strategies for muscle injury (as per the first sentence of the abstract). I am a bit surprised that the implemented experimental perturbations don't seem to address this aim. In Figure 7 of the manuscript, cytokine alterations are explored which affect muscle recovery after injury. This is great, but I don't believe the chosen alterations can be done in experimental or clinical settings. Are there drugs that affect cytokine diffusion? If not, wouldn't it be better to select perturbations that are clinically or experimentally feasible for this analysis? A strength of the model is its versatility, so it seems counterintuitive to me to not use that versatility in a way that has practical relevance. - I may well misunderstand this though, maybe the investigated parameters are indeed possible drug targets.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful feedback. The first sentence (lines 32-34) of the abstract was revised to focus on beneficial microenvironmental conditions to best reflect the purpose of the model. The clinical relevance of the cytokine modifications is included in the discussion (lines 547-558) with additional information added to lines 524-526. For example, two methods to alter diffusion experimentally are: antibodies that bind directly to the cytokine to prevent it from binding to its receptor on the cell surface and plasmins that induce the release of bound cytokines.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) A similar comment applies to Figure 5 and 6: Should I think of these results as experimentally testable predictions? Are any of the results surprising or new, for example in the sense that one would not have expected other cytokines to be affected as described in Figure 6?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the basis for these perturbations. The perturbations included in Figure 5 were designed to mimic the conditions of a published
experiment that delivered VEGF in vivo (Arsic et al. 2004, DOI:10.1016/J.YMTHE.2004.08.007). The perturbation input conditions and experimental results are included in Table 8 and Supplemental Table 6 has been added to include experimental data and method description of the perturbation. The results of this analysis provide both validation and new predictions, because some the outputs were measured in the experiments while others were not measured. The additional output metrics and timepoints that were not collected in the experiment allow for a deeper understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms leading to the changes in muscle recovery (lines 437-454). These model outputs can provide the basis for future experiments; for example, they highlight which time points would be more important to measure and even provide predicted effect sizes that could be the basis for a power analysis (lines 639-640).</p>
<p>Regarding Figure 6, the published experimental outcomes of cytokine KOs are included in Table 8. The model allowed comparison of different cytokine concentrations at various timepoints when other cytokines were removed from the system due to the KO condition. The experimental results did not provide data on the impact on other cytokine concentrations but by using the model we were able to predict temporally based feedback between cytokines (lines 474-482). These cytokine values could be collected experimentally but would be time consuming and expensive. The results of these perturbations revealed the complex nature of the relationship between cytokines and how removal of one cytokine from the system has a cascading temporal impact. Lines 533-534 have been added to incorporate this into the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In figure 4, there were differences between the experiments and the model in two of the rows. Are these differences discussed anywhere in the manuscript?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your keen observation and the opportunity to address these differences. The model did not match experimental results for CSA output in the TNF KO and antiinflammatory nanoparticle perturbation or TGF levels with the macrophage depletion. While it did align with the other experimental metrics from those studies, it is likely that there are other mechanisms at play in the experimental conditions that were not captured by simulating the downstream effects of the experimental perturbations. We have added discussion of the differences to lines 445-454.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The variation between experimental results is much higher than the variation of results in the model. For example, in Figure 3 the error bars around experimental results are an order of magnitude larger than the simulated confidence interval. Do the authors have any insights into why the model is less variable than the experimental data? Does this have to do with the chosen initial condition, i.e. do you think that the experimental variability is due to variation in the geometries of the measured samples?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful observations and questions. The lower model variability is attributed to the larger sample size of model simulations compared to experimental subjects. By running 100 simulations it narrows in the confidence interval (average 2.4 and max 3.3) compared to the experiments that typically had a sample size of less than 15. If the number of simulations had been reduced to 15 the stochasticity within the model results in a larger confidence interval (average 7.1 and max 10). There are also several possible confounding variables in the experimental protocols (i.e. variations in injury, different animal subjects for each timepoint, etc.) that are kept constant in the model simulation. We have added discussion of this point to the manuscript (lines 517519). Future work with the model will examine how variations in conditions, such as initial muscle geometry, injury, etc, alter regeneration outcomes and overall variability. This discussion has been incorporated into lines 640-643.</p>

<p>(2) The muscle regeneration field typically studies 2D cross-sections and the present model can be well compared to these other 2D models but cells as stochastic and localized sources of diffusible cytokines may yield different cytokine fields in 3D vs. 2D. I would expect more broadened and smoothened cytokine fields (from sources in neighboring cross-sections) than what the 2D model predicts based on sources just within the focus cross-section. Such relations of 2D to 3D should be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the excellent suggestions and observations. It has been reported in other Compucell3D models (Sego et al. 2017, DOI:10.1088/17585090/aa6ed4) that the convergence of diffusion solutions between 2D and 3D model configurations had similar outcomes, with the 3D simulations presenting excessive computational cost without contributing any noticeable additional accuracy. Similarly, other cell-based ABMs that incorporate diffusion mechanisms (Marino et al. 2018, DOI:10.3390/computation6040058) have found that 2D and 3D versions of the model both predict the same mechanisms and that the 2D resolution was sufficient for determining outcomes. Lines 615-618 were added to elaborate on this topic.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Since the model (and title) focuses on &quot;nonlinear&quot; cytokine interactions, what would change if cytokine decay would not be linear (as modeled here) but saturated (with nonlinear Michaelis-Menten kinetics as ligand binding and endocytosis mechanisms would call for)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising an intriguing point. The model includes a combination of cytokine decay as well as ligand binding and endocytosis mechanisms that can be saturated. For a cytokine-dependent model behavior to occur the cytokines necessary to induce that action had to reach a minimum threshold. Once that threshold was reached, that amount of the cytokine would be removed at that location to simulate ligand-receptor binding and endocytosis. These ligand binding and endocytosis mechanisms behave in a saturated way, removing a set amount when above a certain threshold or a defined ratio when under the threshold. Lines 313-315 was revised to clarify this point. There were certain concentrations of cytokines where we saw a plateau in outputs likely as a result of reaching a saturation threshold (Supplemental Fig. 3). In future work, more robust mathematical simulation of binding kinetics of cytokines (e.g., using ODEs) could be included.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Limitations of the model should be discussed together with an outlook for model refinement. For example, fiber alignment and ECM ultrastructure may require anisotropic diffusion. Many of the rate equations could be considered with saturation parameters etc. There are so many model assumptions. Please discuss which would be the most urgent model refinements and, to achieve these, which would be the most informative next experiments to perform.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your thoughtful consideration of the model's limitations and the need for a comprehensive discussion on model refinements and potential future experiments. The future direction section was expanded to discuss additional possible model refinements (lines 635-643) and additional possible experiments for model validation (lines 630-634).</p>

<p>(5) It is not clear how the single spatial arrangement that is used affects the model predictions. E.g. now the damaged area surrounds the lymphatic vessel but what if the opposite corner was damaged and the lymphatic vessel is deep inside the healthy area?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting the importance of considering different spatial arrangements in the model and its potential impact on predictions. We previously tested model perturbations that included specifying the injury surrounding the lymphatic vessel versus on the side opposite the vessel. Since this paper focuses more on cytokine dynamics, we plan to include this perturbation, along with other injury alterations, in a follow-on paper. We added more context about this in the future efforts section lines 640-643.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) It seems that not only parameter values but also the initial values of most of the model components are unknown. The parameter estimation strategy does not seem to include the initial (spatial) distributions of collagen and cytokines and other model components. Please discuss how other (reasonable) initial values or spatial arrangements will affect model predictions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your thoughtful consideration of unknown initial values/spatial arrangements and their potential influence on predictions. Initial cytokine levels prior to injury had a low relative concentration compared to levels post injury and were assumed to be negligible. Initial spatial distribution of cytokines was not defined as initial spatial inputs (except in knockout simulations) but are secreted from cells (with baseline resident cell counts defined from the literature). The distribution of cytokines is an emergent behavior that results from the cell behaviors within the model. The collagen distribution is altered in response to clearance of necrosis by the immune cells (decreased collagen with necrosis removal) and subsequent secretion of collagen by fibroblasts. The secretion of collagen from fibroblast was included in the parameter estimation sweep (Supplemental Table 1).</p>
<p>We are working on further exploring the model sensitivity to altered spatial arrangements and have added this to the future directions section (lines 618-621), as well as provided Supplemental Figure 5 to demonstrate that model outcomes are similar with altered initial spatial arrangements.</p>

<p>(7) Many details of the CC3D implementation are missing: overall lattice size, interaction neighborhood order, and &quot;temperature&quot; of the Metropolis algorithm. Are the typical adhesion energy terms used in the CPM Hamiltonian and if so, then how are these parameter values estimated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing attention to the missing details regarding the CC3D implementation in our manuscript. We have included supplemental information providing greater detail for CPM implementation (Lines 808-854). We also added two additional supplemental tables for describing the requested CC3D implementation details (Supplemental Table 4) and adhesion energy terms (Supplemental Table 5).</p>

<p>(8) Extending the model analysis of combinations of altered cytokine properties, which temporal schedules of administration would be of interest, and how could the timing of multiple interventions improve outcomes?

<p>In response to your valuable suggestion, lines 558-562 were added to discuss the potential of using the model as a tool to perturb different cytokine combinations at varying timepoints throughout regeneration. In addition, this is also included in future work in lines 636-637.</p>

<p>(9) The CPM is only weakly motivated, just one sentence on lines 142-145 which mentions diffusion in a misleading way as the CPM just provides cells with a shape and mechanical interactions. The diffusion part is a feature of the hybrid CompuCell3D framework, not the CPM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing up this distinction. We removed the statement regarding diffusion and updated lines 143-146 to focus on CPM representation of cellular behavior and interactions. We also added a reference to supplemental text that includes additional details on CPM.</p>

<p>(10) On lines 258-261 it does not become clear how the described springs can direct fibroblasts towards areas of low-density collagen ECM. Are the lambdas dependent on collagen density?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting this area for clarification. The fibroblasts form links with low collagen density ECM and then are pulled towards those areas based on a constant lambda value. The links between the fibroblast and the ECM will only be made if the collagen is below a certain threshold. We added additional clarification to lines 260-264.</p>

<p>(11) On line 281, what does the last part in &quot;Fibers...were regenerating but not fully apoptotic cells&quot; mean? Maybe rephrase this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The last of part of that line indicates that there were some fibers surrounding the main injury site that were damaged but still had healthy portions, indicating that they were impacted by the injury and are regenerating but did not become fully apoptotic like the fiber cells at the main site of injury. We rephrased this line to indicate that the nearby fibers were damaged but not fully apoptotic.</p>

<p>(12) Lines 290-293 describe interactions of cells and fields with localized structures (capillaries and lymphatic vessel). Please explain in more detail how &quot;capillary agents...transport neutrophiles and monocytes&quot; in the CPM model formalism. Are new cells added following rules? How is spatial crowding of the lattice around capillaries affecting these rules? Moreover, how can &quot;lymphatic vessel...drain the nearby cytokines and cells&quot;? How is this implemented in the CPM and how is &quot;nearby&quot; calculated? We appreciate your detailed inquiry into the interactions of cells and fields with localized structures. The neutrophils and monocytes are added to the simulation at the lattice sites above capillaries (within the cell layer Fig. 2B) and undergo chemotaxis up their respective gradients. The recruitment of the neutrophils and monocytes are randomly distributed among the healthy capillaries that do not have an immune cell at the capillary location (a modeling artifact that is a byproduct of only having one cell per lattice site). This approach helped to prevent an abundance of crowding at certain capillaries. Because immune cells in the simulation are sufficiently small, chemotactic gradients are sufficiently large, and the simulation space is sufficiently large, we do not see aggregation of recruited immune cells in the CPM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The lymphatic vessel uptakes cytokines at lattice locations corresponding to the lymphatic vessel and will remove cells located in lattice sites neighboring the lymphatic vessel. In addition, we have included a rule in our ABM to encourage cells to migrate towards the lymphatic vessel utilizing CompuCell3D External Potential Plugin. The influence of this rule is inversely proportional to the distance of the cells to the lymphatic vessel.</p>
<p>We have updated lines 294-298 and 305-309 to include the above explanation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) Tables 1-4 define migration speeds as agent rules but in the typical CPM, migration speed emerges from random displacements biased by chemotaxis and other effects (like the slope of the cytokine field). How was the speed implemented as a rule while it is typically observable in the model?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your inquiry regarding the implementation of migration speeds. To determine the lambda parameters (Table 7) for each cell type, we tested each in a simplified control simulation with a concentration gradient for the cell to move towards. We tuned the lambda parameters within this simulation until the model outputted cell velocity aligned with the literature reported cell velocity for each cell type (Tables 1-4). We have incorporated clarification on this to lines 177-180.</p>

<p>(16) Table 7 defines cell target volumes with the same value as their diameter. This enforces a strange cell shape. Should there be brackets to square the value of the cell diameter, e.g. Value=(12µm)^2 ?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The target volume parameter values were selected to reflect the relative differences in average cell diameter as reported in the literature; however, there are no parameters that directly enforce a diameter for the cells in the CPM formalism separate from the volume. We have observed that these relative cell sizes allow the ABM to effectively reproduce cell behaviors described in the literature. Single cells that are too large in the ABM would be unable to migrate far enough per time step to carry out cell behaviors, and cells that are too small in the CPM would be unstable in the simulation environment and not persist in the simulation when they should. We removed the units for the cell shape values in Table 7 since the target volume is a relative parameter and does not directly represent µm.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(17) Table 7 gives estimated diffusion constants but they appear to be too high. Please compare them to measured values in the literature, especially for MCP-1, TNF-alpha and IL-10, or relate these to their molecular mass and compare to other molecules like FGF8 (Yu et al. 2009, DOI:10.1038/nature08391).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We utilized a previously published estimation method (Filion et al. 2004,
DOI:10.1152/ajpheart.00205.2004) for estimating cytokine diffusivity within the ECM. This method incorporates the molecular masses and accounts for the combined effects of the collagen fibers and glycosaminoglycans. The paper acknowledged that the estimated value is faster than experimentally determined values, but that this was a result of the less-dense matrix composition which is more reflective of the tissue environment we are simulating in contrast to other reported measurements which were done in different environments. Using this estimation method also allowed us to more consistently define diffusion constants versus using values from the literature (which were often not recorded) that had varied experimental conditions and techniques (such as being in zebrafish embryo Yu et al. 2009, DOI:10.1038/nature08391 as opposed to muscle tissue). This also allowed for recalculation of the diffusivity throughout the simulation as the collagen density changed within the model. Lines 318-326 were updated to help clarify the estimation method.</p>

<p>(9) On line 174, the authors say &quot;We used the CC3D feature Flip2DimRatio to control the number of times the Cellular-Potts algorithm runs per mcs.&quot; What does this mean? Isn't one monte carlo timestep one iteration of the Cellular Potts model? How does this relate to physical timescales?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your attention to detail and thoughtful question regarding the statement about the use of the CC3D feature Flip2DimRatio. Lines 175-177 were revised to simplify the meaning of Flip2DimRatio. That parameter alters the number of times the Cellular-Potts algorithm is run, which is the limiting factor for cell movement. The physical timescale is kept to a 15-minute timestep but a high Flip2DimRatio allows more flexibility and stability to allow the cells to move faster in one timestep.</p>

<p>(12) Line 326: &quot;For CSA, experimental fold-change from pre-injury was compared with fold-change in model-simulated CSA&quot;. Does this step rely on the assumption that the fold change will not depend on the CSA? If so, is this something that is experimentally known, or otherwise, can it be confirmed by simulations?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify our rationale. The fold change was used as a method to normalize the model and experiment so that they could be compared on the same scale. Yes, this step relies on the assumption that fold change does not depend on pre-injury CSA. Experimentally it is difficult to determine the impact of initial fiber morphology on altered regeneration time course. This fold-change allows us to compare percent recovery which is a common metric utilized to assess muscle regeneration outcomes experimentally. Line 340-343 was revised to clarify.</p>

<p>(14) &quot;Following 8 iterations of narrowing the parameter space with CaliPro, we reached a set that had fewer passing runs than the previous iteration&quot;.

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your observation regarding the statement about narrowing the parameter space with CaliPro. We started with a wide parameter space, expecting that certain parameters would give outputs that fall outside of the comparable data. So, when the parameter space was narrowed to enrich parts that give passing output, initially the number of passing simulations increased.</p>
<p>Once we have narrowed the set of possible parameters into an ideal parameter space, further narrowing will cut out viable parameters resulting in fewer passing runs. Therefore, we stopped narrowing once any fewer simulations passed the criteria that they had previously passed with the wider parameter set.
