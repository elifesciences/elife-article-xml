<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by skeletal and brain structural malformations, cognitive impairment, altered hippocampal metabolite concentration and gene expression imbalance. These alterations were usually investigated separately, and the potential rescuing effects of green tea extracts enriched in epigallocatechin-3-gallate (GTE-EGCG) provided disparate results due to different experimental conditions. We overcame these limitations by conducting the first longitudinal controlled experiment evaluating genotype and GTE-EGCG prenatal chronic treatment effects before and after treatment discontinuation. Our findings revealed that the Ts65Dn mouse model reflected the pleiotropic nature of DS, exhibiting brachycephalic skull, ventriculomegaly, reduced bone mineral density, neurodevelopmental delay, hyperactivity, and impaired long-term memory with altered hippocampal metabolite concentration and gene expression. However, Ts65Dn mice showed milder phenotypes than previously described, suggesting a drift of the mouse model. GTE-EGCG treatment modulated most systems simultaneously but did not rescue DS phenotypes. On the contrary, the treatment exacerbated trisomic phenotypes including body weight, tibia microarchitecture, neurodevelopment, adult cognition, and metabolite concentration, not supporting the therapeutic use of a prenatal chronic treatment. Our results highlight the importance of longitudinal experiments assessing the co-modulation of multiple systems throughout development when characterizing preclinical models in complex disorders and evaluating the pleiotropic effects and general safety of pharmacological treatments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Down syndrome (DS) is a developmental disorder with structural, functional, molecular, and genetic alterations that show a dynamic onset and severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Antonarakis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">de Moraes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Grieco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Keeling et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">LaCombe &amp; Roper, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Llambrich, González-Colom, et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">McCarron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">Steingass et al., 2011</xref>). The alterations associated with DS simultaneously affect multiple systems that are likely interrelated over development, with changes in one system modulating the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Llambrich, González, et al., 2022</xref>). Many studies have provided evidence of these developmental alterations and have demonstrated the ability of dietary supplements such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) or green tea extracts enriched in EGCG (GTE-EGCG) to modulate these systems separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Catuara-Solarz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">de la Torre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">De la Torre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Goodlett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Guedj et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Llambrich, González, et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Rondal, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">Souchet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Stagni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">Starbuck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Stringer et al., 2017</xref>). However, a holistic evaluation of the simultaneous effects of trisomy and GTE-EGCG in those intertwined systems is missing. The variety in experimental setups and readouts obtained in different preclinical studies hinders the comparison and integration of results and, as a result, evidence is usually contradictory, reporting both positive and negative treatment effects. This lack of consistency can lead to biased interpretations about the etiology of the disorder and the potential effect of pharmacological treatments.</p>
<p>Much of this DS research was based on the Ts65Dn mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Davisson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Reeves et al., 1995</xref>) as it was one of the first preclinical models available for DS and has been widely used for experimental testing. These mice carry a segment with approximately 120 genes homologous to Hsa21 (starting upstream of Mrpl39 to the telomeric end of Mmu16), translocated to a small centromeric part of Mmu17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Duchon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Herault et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Reinholdt et al., 2011</xref>). Ts65Dn mice are trisomic for about two-thirds of the genes orthologous to Hsa21, but also carry genes originating from the Mmu17 that are not related with DS, including about 46 protein-coding genes, 35 nonprotein-coding genes and 35 pseudogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Muñiz Moreno et al., 2020</xref>). These genetic alterations do not fully represent Down syndrome’s aneuploidy and other mouse and rat models have been developed recently that more faithfully represent the trisomic nature of DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Kazuki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Kazuki et al., 2022</xref>). However, in this study we used the Ts65Dn mouse model because it recapitulates the main skeletal, brain, cognitive, brain metabolite, and genetic alterations associated with DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abeysekera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Aziz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">J.

Since a holistic evaluation is missing, we designed a longitudinal experimental setup to follow the simultaneous development of structural, functional, molecular, and genetic alterations in this mouse model.</p>
<p>At the structural level, people with DS show skeletal and brain alterations that progress through ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Antonarakis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">de Moraes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Fischer-Brandies et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Keeling et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">LaCombe &amp; Roper, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Pearlson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">Starbuck et al., 2021</xref>). Children with DS have a decreased buildup of bone mass and a low bone turnover rate, resulting in more osteoclast than osteoblast activity, smaller bone area, lower bone mineral density (BMD), and an increased risk of osteoporosis at adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Carfì et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Keeling et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">LaCombe &amp; Roper, 2020</xref>). Individuals with DS also present midfacial hypoplasia and flattened nasal bridge along with skull malformations resulting in a shorter, wider, and rounder skull (brachycephaly) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Blazek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">LaCombe &amp; Roper, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Richtsmeier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">Suri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c147">Thomas &amp; Roper, 2021</xref>). Previous studies have shown the potential of GTE-EGCG to modulate craniofacial and postcranial morphology, as well as the microarchitecture and bone mineral density of the long bones, showing positive, negative or no treatment effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abeysekera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">J. D. Blazek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Goodlett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Jamal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Llambrich, González-Colom, et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Llambrich, González, et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">McElyea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">Starbuck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Stringer et al., 2017</xref>). We previously detected dose-, time- and anatomical structure-dependent effects in a study using the same mouse models and the same treatment regime with two different GTE-EGCG concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Llambrich, González-Colom, et al., 2022</xref>). A dose of 100 mg/kg/day of GTE-EGCG exacerbated facial dysmorphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">Starbuck et al., 2021</xref>), modified the skeletal dysmorphologies associated with DS without rescuing the bones shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Llambrich, González-Colom, et al., 2022</xref>), and altered the integration between the skull and the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Llambrich, González, et al., 2022</xref>). However, a lower dose of 30 mg/kg/day significantly reduced the facial dysmorphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">Starbuck et al., 2021</xref>) but did not show additional rescuing effects in other skeletal traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Llambrich, González-Colom, et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In DS, the craniofacial size and shape alterations are accompanied with structural brain alterations. People with DS show a reduced overall brain volume from birth, with disproportionately smaller hippocampus and cerebellum, and larger ventricles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Aylward et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Hamner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Movsas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Patkee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Pearlson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Pinter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Rodrigues et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Smigielska-Kuzia et al., 2011</xref>). Evidence for the effects of GTE-EGCG on brain anatomy is limited. Our own previous study showed that administration of 100 mg/kg/day of GTE-EGCG altered the brain shape of Ts65Dn mice at adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Llambrich, González, et al., 2022</xref>), while another study administering green tea corresponding to 0.6 – 1 mg EGCG per day in YACtg152F7 mice showed reduced thalamic-hypothalamic volume and reduced overall brain weight and volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Guedj et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The structural brain alterations are associated with cognitive disabilities, causing functional disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Guidi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Rodrigues et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Stagni et al., 2016</xref>). People with DS show relative impairment in executive function, short-term memory, working memory, and explicit long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Dierssen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Grieco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Lott &amp; Dierssen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">McCarron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Real de Asua et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">Steingass et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c161">Zis &amp; Strydom, 2018</xref>); together with a neurodevelopmental delay in the acquisition of both gross and fine motor skills during childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Beqaj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ferreira-Vasques &amp; Lamônica, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Frank &amp; Esbensen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Malak et al., 2015</xref>). Regarding cognition, the therapeutic results of green tea extracts are also contradictory. A study administering 60 mg/kg GTE-EGCG to 3- to 4-month-old mBACtgDyrk1a and Ts65Dn mice for 4 weeks rescued working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">Souchet et al., 2015</xref>), and interventional studies in humans with DS have shown the ability of (GTE-)EGCG to improve memory recognition, working memory, inhibitory control, and adaptive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">de la Torre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">De la Torre et al., 2014</xref>). However, other studies found no effect or negative effects of (GTE-)EGCG on cognition. In children aged 6-12 years, a randomized phase Ib clinical trial administering 10 mg/kg/day of EGCG for 6 months combined with a dietary supplement did not improve cognition and functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Cieuta-Walti et al., 2022</xref>). In mice, GTE-EGCG at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day had no effect on visuospatial learning and memory, and even resulted in reduced swimming speed in the Morris water maze and increased thigmotaxic behavior in 5- to 6-month-old Ts65Dn mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Catuara-Solarz et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have shown that the cognitive functional alterations observed in DS are related with changes at a molecular level on the concentration of hippocampal metabolites, as people with DS show increased myo-inositol levels when compared to euploid population, and people with DS and dementia show reduced levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) when compared to people with DS without dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Beacher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Lamar et al., 2011</xref>). These findings warrant further investigation into the potential role of hippocampal metabolites in cognitive function, particularly given that few studies to date have investigated the effects of trisomy on the concentration of the main metabolites in the hippocampus of Ts65Dn mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Huang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Même, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Santin et al., 2014</xref>) and there is currently no evidence on the effects of (GTE-)EGCG treatment.</p>
<p>Finally, all these structural, functional and molecular alterations are the result of a complex genetic imbalance involving the triplicated genes in chromosome 21 and the interactions of many genes across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Olson et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, skeletal malformations can be associated with the dysregulation of genes such as <italic>RCAN1, SOD1, EN2, ETS2, SHH, DYRK1A, SOX9</italic> or <italic>OTX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Arron et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Billingsley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">McElyea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Roper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c147">Thomas &amp; Roper, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c156">Weisfeld-Adams et al., 2016</xref>), while cognitive impairment and altered brain development may be associated with <italic>RCAN1, SOD1, OLIG1, OLIG2, SIM2, DSCAM, DYRK1A, DSCR1, SYNJ1</italic> and <italic>KCNJ6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Hoeffer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Kazemi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Kleschevnikov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Lana-Elola et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Stagni &amp; Bartesaghi, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Stagni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c156">Weisfeld-Adams et al., 2016</xref>).

The potential of EGCG to modulate gene expression in the Ts65Dn mouse model for DS has limited evidence, with one study administering 200 mg/kg EGCG on embryonic days 7 and 8 twice daily showing decreases in <italic>Ptch</italic> and <italic>Ets2</italic> RNA expression and significant increases in <italic>Rcan1</italic> and <italic>Shh</italic> RNA expression in the first pharyngeal arch of Ts65Dn mice at embryonic day (E) 9.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">McElyea et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we conducted a multi-modal <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging study using micro computed tomography (µCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate the integrated development of craniofacial shape, BMD, brain volumes, and hippocampal metabolites in wildtype and Ts65Dn mice. Additionally, we evaluated the changes in body weight and performed a battery of neurodevelopmental and adult cognitive tests to assess cognitive function from birth to adulthood throughout development. At endpoint, we also evaluated tibia microarchitecture from <italic>ex vivo</italic> µCT scans and used RNAseq to analyze cerebellar gene expression in the same mice at eight months old (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

<p>Ts65Dn and WT littermates were treated prenatally at a concentration of 0.09 mg EGCG/mL corresponding to a dose of 30 mg/kg/day from embryonic day 9 (E9) until mice were 5 months old (5M). A battery of neurodevelopmental tests was performed daily from postnatal day (PD) 1 to PD18 to evaluate early cognitive development.

Mice body weight (BW) was recorded daily from PD1 to PD17 (BW<sub>1</sub>), and at two additional times before µCT scanning (BW<sub>2</sub> and BW<sub>3</sub>). <italic>In vivo</italic> micro-computed tomography (µCT) scans were performed four times over development to follow skeletal development: µCT<sub>1</sub> at PD3 and µCT<sub>2</sub> at PD29 in all mice; µCT<sub>3</sub> at 5M in treated mice, and 6M in untreated mice; and µCT<sub>4</sub> at 8M in all mice.

<title>Body Weight</title>
<p>First, we investigated mice body growth by monitoring body weight over development.

<p>The chronic GTE-EGCG treatment that started prenatally and was maintained until 5 months significantly reduced the body growth of TS treated mice from PD1 to PD17 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> at BW<sub>1</sub>) in comparison with WT untreated (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001), WT treated (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001), and TS untreated mice (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001).

<p>We first performed geometric morphometric analysis on the craniofacial 3D models obtained from <italic>in vivo</italic> µCT scans to investigate craniofacial shape throughout development.

<p>To obtain a global view of the genotype and treatment effects, we performed a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) combining the results of all tibia microarchitecture tests into a single analysis that maximized the differences among groups of mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).

<title>Neurodevelopment</title>
<p>We first evaluated early brain function and neurodevelopment over the first weeks after birth by performing a battery of neurodevelopmental tests from PD1 until PD18 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The LDA with the results from all neurodevelopmental tests combined showed that the treatment was the main differentiating factor among groups of mice, as Axis 1 separated treated and untreated mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Despite some overlap, Axis2 separated WT and TS mice. These results suggested mild genotype differences and treatment effects that did not rescue the trisomic phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The multivariate pairwise comparisons after one-way PERMANOVA using Mahalanobis distances (<xref rid="tbls7" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S7</xref>) detected significant differences between TS untreated and WT untreated mice (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001), and between TS treated mice and both TS untreated (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001) and WT untreated mice (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001), confirming these findings.</p>
<p>When the neurodevelopmental tests were grouped into functional domains (developmental landmarks, neuromotor tests and reflexes) (<xref rid="tbls7" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S7</xref>), the multivariate pairwise comparisons only indicated significant differences between WT untreated and TS untreated mice for the reflexes (<italic>P</italic>=0.0423). TS untreated mice tended to be delayed in most individual tests (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>), and the univariate pairwise comparison tests confirmed significant delays in the acquisition rate of the vertical climbing (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1E</xref><italic>; P</italic>=0.0256) and tactile response (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1I</xref><italic>; P</italic>=0.0064), together with the average day of acquisition of surface righting response (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1C</xref>; <italic>P</italic>=0.0320). However, we also observed that TS untreated mice tended to be anticipated in the vibrissae placing, blast response, and preyer reflex (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1 J,M,N</xref>), even though these results did not reach significance.</p>

The univariate tests indicated that treatment significantly modulated the average day of acquisition and acquisition rate of multiple neurodevelopmental tests in both WT and TS treated mice, causing either a delay or an anticipation in most tests (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>).

<p>Finally, we investigated the mothers’ behavior during 24h at PD8 and observed that, despite being trisomic, all Ts65Dn mothers performed similarly and there was no large intra-group variation for any of the behaviors analyzed, confirming that maternal care did not influence the results of the neurodevelopmental tests (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>).

<p>Then, we evaluated adult cognitive performance by means of open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM), sociability/preference for social novelty (SPSN), novel object recognition (NOR) and passive avoidance (PA) testing at two timepoints, Cog.<sub>1</sub> and Cog.<sub>2</sub>, before and after treatment discontinuation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B,C</xref>), as specified in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The LDA with the results from all tests combined showed minor overlap between groups at both Cog.<sub>1</sub> and Cog.<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B,C</xref>), with WT untreated mice occupying the negative extreme of Axis1, WT treated and TS untreated mice presenting an intermediate position, and TS treated mice falling on the positive extreme of Axis1, opposite to WT untreated mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B,C</xref>). These results suggested genotype differences between WT and TS untreated mice that were confirmed as significant by the multivariate pairwise comparisons after one-way PERMANOVA at both adult stages, Cog.<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="tbls8" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S8</xref>; <italic>P</italic>=0.0478) and Cog.<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="tbls9" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S9</xref>; <italic>P</italic>=0.0001).</p>
<p>When the cognitive tests were grouped into cognitive domains (anxiety, arousal, and memory), the multivariate pairwise comparisons only detected a significant difference between WT untreated and TS untreated mice for the arousal tests at Cog.<sub>1</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=0.0052) (Supplementary Tables S8 and S9). Indeed, TS untreated mice showed a tendency to cover longer distances at higher speed in all arousal tests when compared with WT untreated mice (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3 E-J</xref>). These differences reached significance for the distance and speed during OF, as well as for the distance and speed during NOR at Cog.<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3 E,F,I,J</xref>, top). TS untreated mice also tended to show increased exploratory and risk-taking behavior, as they usually presented a tendency of increased time spent in the center of the arena during habituation for NOR at Cog.<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3C</xref>, top), increased percentage of time spent in the open arm during EPM at Cog.<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3D</xref>, top), increased time in the center during OF at Cog.<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3A</xref>, bottom), and reduced time to enter the dark chamber during the training session of PA at Cog.<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3M</xref>, top), although these differences did not reach statistical significance.

</fig>
<p>Regarding treatment effects, the results from the LDA at Cog.<sub>1</sub> suggested that the prenatal chronic treatment induced changes in both WT and TS treated mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>) that exacerbated the differences in TS treated mice and induced cognitive changes in WT treated mice that resulted in a cognitive performance similar to TS untreated mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Even though the differences between WT treated and WT untreated mice did not reach statistical significance when all cognitive tests were considered together at Cog.<sub>1</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=0.0590), significant differences emerged when the tests were grouped into cognitive domains, as WT treated mice were significantly different than their untreated counterparts for the anxiety and arousal domains (<xref rid="tbls8" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). In the case of TS treated mice, the multivariate pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences with both WT and TS untreated mice when considering all groups together as well as for the arousal domain (<xref rid="tbls8" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S8</xref>), confirming the lack of rescuing effects. Both WT and TS treated mice showed significantly increased time in the center during NOR, and increased time in the open arm during EPM at Cog.<sub>1</sub> when compared with WT untreated mice (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3 C,D</xref>, top), indicating increased exploratory and risk-taking behavior. Similarly, both WT and TS treated mice showed increased locomotor activity, as they covered significantly more distance at more speed than WT untreated mice for the distance and speed during OF, as well as the distance and speed during NOR at Cog.<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3 E,F,I,J</xref>, top). However, in the memory tests (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3 K-N</xref>), the pairwise comparison tests revealed only a significant difference between TS untreated and TS treated mice for the preference for subject 2 (S2) at Cog.<sub>1</sub>, where treated mice had greater preference for the novel stranger (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3L</xref>, top; <italic>P</italic>=0.0137).</p>
<p>After treatment discontinuation at Cog.<sub>2</sub>, the LDA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>) presented a similar pattern as the LDA at Cog.<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B</xref>), suggesting that discontinuing the treatment for one month did not substantially change the cognitive patterns induced after chronic GTE-EGCG treatment. However, the differences between TS untreated and TS treated mice were no longer significant when evaluating all tests combined (<italic>P</italic>=0.2045), or when evaluating any cognitive domain (<xref rid="tbls9" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). Moreover, new significant differences emerged between WT treated and WT untreated mice when evaluating all tests combined and in all cognitive domains (<xref rid="tbls9" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). Nevertheless, TS treated mice remained significantly different than WT untreated mice for all tests combined and all cognitive domains (<xref rid="tbls9" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S9</xref>), confirming that the effects of treatment discontinuation did not rescue the trisomic cognitive phenotype and induced cognitive alterations in WT mice. Indeed, significant differences between WT untreated and TS treated mice remained for the percentage of time spent in the open arm during EPM at Cog.<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3D</xref>, bottom; <italic>P</italic>=0.0476), and new significant differences emerged between WT untreated mice and both WT treated and TS treated mice for the time spent in the center and in the periphery during OF (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3 A,B</xref>, bottom), indicating that treated mice still presented a more explorative and risk-taking behavior. A similar trend was observed for the arousal tests, as even though no significant differences were detected between TS treated and TS untreated mice (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3 E-J</xref>, bottom), both treated groups showed hyperactivity as the univariate pairwise comparison tests confirmed significant differences between TS treated mice and WT untreated mice for all arousal tests (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3 E-J</xref>, bottom); and significant differences were detected between WT treated and WT untreated mice for the distance and speed during SPSN and the distance and speed during NOR (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3 G-J</xref>, bottom). In the memory tests, TS treated mice were significantly different than TS untreated mice for the preference for the novel object during NOR (<italic>P</italic>=0.0046) but were not significantly different than WT untreated mice (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3K</xref>, bottom; <italic>P</italic>=0.3566), which could suggest a beneficial treatment effect. However, both WT and TS treated mice showed a reduced tendency to enter the dark chamber during the training session for PA at Cog.<sub>2,</sub> which reached significance when comparing TS treated mice with WT untreated mice (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3M</xref>, bottom; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001), indicating altered memory robustness. After training, a few TS treated mice still showed a reduced tendency to enter the dark chamber during the testing session for PA (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3N</xref>, bottom), supporting these findings.</p>

When evaluating the specific concentrations of NAA, Cr+PCr, tCho, myo-Inos and Tau, the same pattern was observed and the significant differences between WT untreated and TS untreated mice, and between TS treated and WT untreated mice disappeared (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>, bottom). However, significant differences emerged between WT untreated mice and WT treated mice for the concentration of tCho and myo-inositol (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1 C,D</xref>, bottom; <italic>P<sub>tCho</sub></italic> = 0.0479, <italic>P<sub>myo-inositol</sub></italic> = 0.0261).</p>

<title>Gene Expression</title>
<p>Finally, we investigated the effects of genotype and chronic treatment and three months of discontinuation in the cerebellar gene expression by performing RNAseq at endpoint (8M).</p>
<p>The PCA performed using the normalized expression of the 125 genes that are triplicated in the Ts65Dn mouse model and included in our dataset showed major overlap between all groups, even though TS treated mice showed a larger range of variation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). This result suggested that the differences in gene expression were minimal and that GTE-EGCG prenatal chronic treatment and three months of discontinuation did not induce major permanent effects when considering all triplicated genes. The multivariate pairwise comparison tests after one-way PERMANOVA using Euclidean distances did not detect any significant difference between groups, confirming subtle differences in the gene expression of the triplicated genes (<xref rid="tbls13" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S13</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, when analyzing the entire transcriptome, we only detected 24 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between WT untreated and TS untreated mice even when applying a loose p-adjusted value of 0.1, indicating small differences in cerebellar gene expression (Supplementary Table S14). Interestingly, we detected 12 DEGs between WT untreated and TS treated mice, and only 9 of these genes were also found to be differentially expressed between WT untreated and TS untreated mice, which could indicate mild treatment effects in TS mice (Supplementary Table S14). However, we did not detect any DEGs between TS untreated and TS treated mice, and only 5 DEGs were detected between WT untreated and WT treated mice, indicating that either the prenatal chronic GTE-EGCG treatment did not largely modulate gene expression or that the treatment had transient effects that were mostly not detected after three months of treatment discontinuation and were not rescuing the trisomic phenotype (Supplementary Table S14).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We investigated for the first time the simultaneous pleiotropic effects of trisomy and a chronic prenatal and postnatal treatment with GTE-EGCG on several organ systems and levels throughout development in the Ts65Dn mouse model for DS. Our longitudinal and holistic approach thus overcomes a main limitation of previous research, in which systems were analyzed independently at single time points using different experimental setups and delivered disparate and contradictory results that could not be generalized. Here, we followed the simultaneous development of structural, functional, molecular, and genetic systems on Ts65Dn mice; and provided comparable results of genotype and prenatal chronic GTE-EGCG treatment effects before and after treatment discontinuation.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Detailed comparison of genotype and GTE-EGCG treatment effects across studies</title>
<p>We here summarized and compared our results with previous studies by domains to discuss whether the Ts65Dn mouse model was representative of DS in the human condition, and whether GTE-EGCG treatment produced any effect that could be translated into clinical practice.</p>
<sec id="s3a1">
<title>Structural domain</title>
<p>Starting with body size, we observed that TS mice tended to weigh less than WT mice. However, as in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c145">Tallino et al., 2022</xref>), this difference did not achieve statistical significance, and contrasts with previous studies reporting significantly smaller weight of TS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Costa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Goodlett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Heinen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Jamal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Roper et al., 2006</xref>). The prenatal chronic GTE-EGCG treatment further reduced the body weight of TS treated mice from PD1 to PD17, but not at adulthood, which is consistent with some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Goodlett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c159">Xicota et al., 2020</xref>), but not with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Jamal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Noll et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, we observed that WT treated mice showed normal body weight during development, but increased weight after treatment discontinuation, suggesting a possible rebound effect after a prolonged time of treatment administration.</p>
<p>Regarding skeletal morphology, we detected craniofacial alterations that were consistent with previous findings and replicated the human condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Llambrich, González-Colom, et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Llambrich, González, et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">McElyea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">Suri et al., 2010</xref>). We also detected modulatory treatment effects on the craniofacial morphology in treated WT and TS mice at PD3, but these did not remain significant at adulthood, which was an unexpected result considering that our previous findings indicated that GTE-EGCG had modulatory effects from birth that were exacerbated later in development at PD29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Llambrich, González-Colom, et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Llambrich, González, et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Our multivariate analyses also detected global tibia microarchitecture alterations associated with genotype differences, but the univariate tests only showed a significant reduction in the length and periosteal perimeter of the proximal tibia, not showing other skeletal alterations previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abeysekera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">J.

The prenatal chronic treatment and three months of discontinuation did not modulate the trabecular bone and caused general but mild effects in the cortical bone of WT and TS mice, not replicating the modulatory effects of green tea polyphenols previously observed on bone microarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">J. D. Blazek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Goodlett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Jamal et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, the GTE-EGCG treatment modified the developmental trajectory of humerus BMD in both WT and TS treated mice with disparate effects throughout development. These results did not match our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Llambrich, González-Colom, et al., 2022</xref>) and highlight the variability of treatment responses depending on developmental timing.</p>
<p>In the brain, we detected increased ventricular volumes, which is consistent with the trend observed in our previous study at PD29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Llambrich, González, et al., 2022</xref>) and the ventriculomegaly typically observed in humans and mouse models for DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Ishihara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Movsas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Pearlson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Raveau et al., 2017</xref>). However, we also detected increased hippocampal, cerebellar, and whole brain volumes in TS untreated mice that do not match clinical reports indicating reduced brain, hippocampal and cerebellar volumes in humans with DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Aylward et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Hamner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Patkee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Pearlson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Pinter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Rodrigues et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Smigielska-Kuzia et al., 2011</xref>), and other preclinical studies that did not find brain volume differences in Ts65Dn mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aldridge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Duchon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Holtzman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Insausti et al., 1998</xref>). The prenatal chronic treatment did not have major effects, but generally increased the volume of all brain regions in TS treated mice, which is contrary to a previous study indicating that administering a green tea infusion corresponding to 0.6–1 mg EGCG per day from mating until adulthood significantly reduced the brain weight and volume in YACtg152F7 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Guedj et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Regarding cognitive function, our results indicated that TS mice showed cognitive delay during early stages of development. As suggested in clinical investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Locatelli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Olmos-Serrano et al., 2016</xref>), the cognitive alterations continued with development, and adult TS mice showed hyperactivity, impaired long-term memory, and more explorative behavior, in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Aziz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Costa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Coussons-Read &amp; Crnic, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Dierssen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Escorihuela et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Escorihuela et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Holtzman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Llambrich, González, et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Olmos-Serrano et al., 2016</xref>). Regarding treatment effects, the combined results from all tests suggested that even though the treatment could have had a positive effect reducing the anxiety of treated mice, it likely altered long-term memory and induced a more hyperactive, explorative, and risk-taking behavior. After treatment discontinuation, when the tests were repeated, all groups of mice presented less locomotor activity and explorative behavior. It is not unlikely that this reduction in activity was due to the stress and anxiety induced by the manipulation and testing during the first round of cognitive evaluation. However, TS untreated mice and both WT and TS treated mice still tended to show increased locomotor activity and explorative behavior compared with WT untreated mice, suggesting that the prenatal chronic treatment could have had permanent adverse effects after one month of discontinuation, or could have reduced the anxiety produced by the first round of testing while mice were treated. These results are in line with previous articles indicating no or negative effects of EGCG on cognition in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Cieuta-Walti et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Goodlett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c141">Stringer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Stringer et al., 2017</xref>), but are contrary to other articles showing rescuing effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Catuara-Solarz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">de la Torre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">De la Torre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">Souchet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Stagni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c160">Yin et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Molecular domain</title>
<p>Regarding hippocampal metabolite concentration, we observed differences between untreated WT and TS mice when evaluating the entire spectra using the LDA, which reflects the analysis of the whole MR spectra rather than selected metabolites, but we only detected a specific significant difference in the levels of Cr+PCr at MRS<sub>1</sub>, suggesting that the genotype produced mild general molecular differences rather than large specific disruptions in any metabolite. Our results did not reveal any difference in NAA or myo-inositol, which is consistent with a human study showing no differences in the levels of NAA in the hippocampal region of adults with DS without dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Lamar et al., 2011</xref>), but do not replicate the results from another human study indicating increased myo-inositol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Beacher et al., 2005</xref>). Other studies in humans with DS reported decreased NAA levels relative to creatine and myo-inositol in other brain regions, such as the frontal lobes and posterior cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Smigielska-Kuzia &amp; Sobaniec, 2007</xref>). Studies performed in the Ts65Dn model indicated reduced NAA levels relative to creatine in the hippocampal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Huang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Même, 2014</xref>), which is contrary to our findings, but another study indicated no differences in NAA absolute concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Santin et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, all these mouse studies indicated increased values of inositol or myo-inositol, which we did not detect in this study. These results reflect the large variability of phenotypes associated with DS depending on the developmental stage and region analyzed, as well as the disparity in experimental setups and data analyses between studies, as some studies reported the absolute metabolite concentrations while others reported their relative values normalized to creatine, which could explain the discrepancy among some of the results.</p>
<p>Regarding treatment effects, we detected significant differences in TS treated mice when analyzing the entire spectra using the LDA, but no significant treatment effects in any specific metabolite, even though TS treated mice presented increased Cr+PCr and reduced tCho levels as compared with WT untreated mice. After treatment discontinuation, these differences were no longer significant, but general differences remained in the LDA between TS treated and WT untreated mice. These results indicated that prenatal chronic GTE-EGCG treatment had mild modulating effects altering the entire hippocampal metabolite profile in TS mice.</p>

<title>Genetic domain</title>
<p>Regarding cerebellar gene expression, we did not detect large differences in the PCA that compared the expression of triplicated genes across groups of mice. Even though these genes presented an extra copy number, their expression was not significantly altered, which is consistent with previous articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aït Yahya-Graison et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Lyle et al., 2004</xref>). Surprisingly, we only detected 24 DEGs between untreated WT and TS mice across the entire genome, which is a lower number in comparison to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Aziz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Chrast et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">De Toma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c153">Vilardell et al., 2011</xref>). Contrary to previous findings indicating a transcriptome-wide deregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">De Toma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Letourneau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c153">Vilardell et al., 2011</xref>), in our study all the 24 DEGs overexpressed in TS untreated mice were mapped to the mouse chromosomes (Mmu<italic>)</italic> 16 or 17, except for <italic>Ccdc23,</italic> which mapped to Mmu4. Within these 24 DEGs we detected genes typically related with DS and cognitive disability, such as <italic>App</italic>, <italic>Dyrk1A</italic>, <italic>Dscr3</italic>, <italic>Synj1</italic>, <italic>Ttc3</italic>, <italic>Hmgn1</italic>, <italic>Brwd1</italic> and <italic>Usp16</italic>; but we did not detect other genes such as <italic>Sod1, Sim2, Dscam, Rcan1, Olig1, Olig2</italic> or <italic>Kcnj6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Aziz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Chrast et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">De Toma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Ruparelia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c153">Vilardell et al., 2011</xref>). These discrepancies with previous results could be explained by methodological reasons, as previous studies investigated other tissues, pooled data from different mouse models, contained only male mice, investigated different developmental timepoints, or used different RNA quantification techniques. In WT mice, five genes were found to be differentially expressed between WT untreated and WT treated mice, of which <italic>Hspa1b</italic> and <italic>Hspa1a</italic> mapped to Mmu17, <italic>Fosl2</italic> mapped to Mmu5, <italic>Actn1</italic> to mapped Mmu12, and <italic>Tm6sf2</italic> mapped to Mmu8; which could indicate permanent genome-wide treatment effects in a few genes in WT mice. Interestingly, only <italic>Hspa1b</italic> was found to interact with <italic>Dyrk1A</italic> from the list of DEGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Rouillard et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that GTE-EGCG may have other mechanisms of action than DYRK1A kinase activity inhibition.</p>
<p>Even though the prenatal chronic GTE-EGCG treatment used in this study was administered continuously from embryonic day 9 until adulthood, the treatment did not cause any large permanent effects in the gene expression of adult TS mice after three months of discontinuation, as we did not detect any DEG between TS untreated and TS treated mice. These results suggest that even though the treatment could have potentially modulated gene expression during a critical window for brain development in TS mice, these effects may have been reverted after treatment withdrawal.</p>

<title>The pleiotropic nature of genotype and treatment effects</title>
<p>The combination of multi- and univariate tests performed in our study allowed us to explore in a more comprehensive way the integrated effects of genotype and treatment. Overall, we detected more significant differences when performing multivariate analysis combining the results of different tests together than when we evaluated each test individually, which highlights the pleiotropic nature of DS and GTE-EGCG, as both genotype and treatment caused mild effects in multiple readouts rather than large specific effects in single variables.</p>
<p>For example, we observed that even though TS untreated mice presented mild gene expression alterations in the cerebellum, these mice still showed hyperactivity and increased cerebellar volume. Similarly, TS treated mice presented a larger cerebellum and hyperactivity when compared to WT untreated mice after treatment discontinuation, but only 12 genes were found to be differentially expressed between WT untreated and TS treated mice at that stage. These results can be interpreted as that the altered expression of a few genes was sufficient to alter the brain and cognitive phenotypes, contrary to previous reports indicating that the altered phenotype in DS was due to small contributions of multiple genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Antonarakis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Chang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Chrast et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">De Toma et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, trisomy altered the expression of genes related with hypotonia and movement impairment such as <italic>Son</italic>, <italic>Synj1</italic>, <italic>Atp5o</italic>, <italic>Jam2</italic> and <italic>Paxbp1</italic>; but TS mice still showed increased locomotor activity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we observed that even though there were no significant differences in the concentration of NAA in the hippocampal region of TS untreated mice, these mice presented altered hippocampal region metabolite spectra, increased hippocampal region volume, and altered memory robustness. Similarly, the treatment did not alter the concentration of NAA in the hippocampal region of TS treated mice, but induced general differences in hippocampal region metabolite spectra, mildly increased hippocampal region volume, and altered cognition. These results suggested that the cognitive differences induced by both the genotype and treatment were not related with the concentration of NAA in the hippocampal region but rather with general differences in hippocampal region volume and metabolite spectra.</p>

<title>The advantages of a longitudinal holistic approach</title>
<p>Single holistic and longitudinal experiments evaluating multiple systems simultaneously overcome the limitations of individual analyses and the lack of consistency across studies. The differences between study results highlighted in this study could be due to a large variety of factors, including experimental differences in the mouse model, sample composition, experimental setup, technical differences in data acquisition and analysis, as well as differences in treatment dose, timing, and route of administration. As a result, evidence from different studies is challenging to interpret, and can lead to misinterpretations about the course of the disorder and the effects of pharmacological treatments. With our approach, the differences between experimental setups could be accounted for, analyzing the simultaneous development of different systems in the same mice in a controlled experimental setup, and investigating the related effects of trisomy and treatment in multiple related systems.</p>
<p>Our results support that, overall, the Ts65Dn model reflects the multisystemic nature of DS and recapitulates many characteristics of the trisomic phenotype. As compared to WT mice, Ts65Dn mice presented a trend for reduced body weight over development together with a brachycephalic skull with facial flatness, a trend for reduced BMD in the humerus, and alterations in the tibia microarchitecture. These skeletal alterations co-occurred with cognitive delay during early stages of development, hyperactivity, impaired long-term memory, and increased explorative and risk-taking behavior at adulthood. At the molecular and genetic level, Ts65Dn mice presented alterations in the hippocampal metabolite spectra and differential gene expression in the cerebellum. However, our results also revealed phenotypes that did not match the human condition, as Ts65Dn mice showed increased hippocampal, cerebellar, ventricular, and whole brain volumes. Overall, our longitudinal analyses confirm the validity of the model for the structural, functional, molecular and genetic phenotypes associated with DS, but also support the hypothesis of genotypic and phenotypic drift within the Ts65Dn mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Shaw et al., 2020</xref>), as we generally observed a decrease in the magnitude of alterations induced by the genotype compared to previous articles including our earlier work.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment, our results confirmed that GTE-EGCG modulated most of these systems simultaneously along development. However, our holistic approach revealed that, in general, the treatment did not rescue the trisomic phenotype and even exacerbated some phenotypes over time, such as body weight, tibia microarchitecture, neurodevelopment, adult cognition, and hippocampal metabolite concentration. Although discontinuing GTE-EGCG administration reduced the treatment effects, it did not rescue the trisomic phenotype, as TS treated mice remained different from WT untreated mice in most systems. Discontinuing the GTE-EGCG treatment for three months only rescued the body weight and brain volume of a few TS mice but increased the weight of WT mice and reduced the BMD of the humerus in both WT and TS mice. Summing up, our preclinical results warn against a chronic GTE-EGCG treatment initiated prenatally and maintained until adulthood with a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day.</p>

Trisomic primers, Chr17fwd-5′-GTGGCAAGAGACTCAAATTCAAC-3′ and Chr16rev-5′-TGGCTTATTATTATCAGGGCATTT-3′; and positive control primers, IMR8545-5′-AAAGTCGCTCTGAGTTGTTAT-3′ and IMG8546-5′-GAGCGGGAGAAATGGATATG-3′ were used. The following PCR cycle conditions were used: step 1: 94°C for 2 min; step 2: 94°C for 30 s; step 3: 55°C for 45 s; step 4: 72°C for 1 min (steps 2-4 repeated for 40 cycles); step 5: 72°C for 7 min, and a 4°C hold. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel.</p>
<p>We bred a total of 13 litters. Six litters were left untreated and seven litters were treated via the drinking water with GTE-EGCG (Mega Green Tea Extract, Life Extension, USA) at a concentration of 0.09 mg EGCG/mL, as calculated based on the label concentration (45% EGCG per capsule). As EGCG crosses the placental barrier and reaches the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Chu et al., 2006</xref>), GTE-EGCG treatment started prenatally at embryonic day 9 (E9) via the drinking water of the pregnant dams. After weaning at postnatal day (PD) 21, GTE-EGCG dissolved in water at the same concentration was provided to the young mice <italic>ad libitum</italic> until 5 months (5M), when the treatment was discontinued (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The treatment was prepared freshly every day and water intake was monitored in each cage. The calculated dosage of EGCG received by an adult mouse would be approximately 30 mg/kg/day considering that, on average, early adult mice weigh 20 g and drink 6 mL of water per day according to our measurements. In developing embryos and pups before weaning, the received dosage was lower since previous studies indicate that maternal plasma concentrations of catechins are about 10 times higher than in placenta and 50–100 times higher than in the fetal brain [36,37] and EGCG in milk and plasma of PD1 to PD7 pups was detected at low concentrations [4].</p>
<p>Mice were allocated to groups according to their genotype and pharmacological intervention: WT and TS mice untreated or treated with GTE-EGCG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Investigators were blinded to genotype during animal experimentation, and to genotype and treatment during data analysis. The same mice were longitudinally used throughout the experiment. Sample sizes varied across groups and developmental stages due to uncontrollable technical issues inherent to longitudinal studies, such as scanning failure or mouse death during the experiment. The litter information containing litter number, treatment administration and sex for each mouse is described in <xref rid="tbls15" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S15</xref>.

<title>Adult cognition</title>
<p>Open Field (OF), Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), Sociability/Preference for Social Novelty (SPSN), Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and Passive Avoidance (PA) tests were performed in this order before and after treatment discontinuation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The OF test was performed in a brightly illuminated Plexiglas arena with transparent walls. Mice were placed in the left bottom corner facing the walls and were left free to explore the arena for 10 minutes. Movements were recorded using a camera and the tracking software ANY-mazeTM Video Tracking System software (Stoelting Co., IL, USA).</p>
<p>The EPM test took place on a plus shaped maze with 2 open and 2 closed arms (5 cmx30 cm) that was elevated 35 cm from the tabletop. Each mouse was placed in the left closed arm, with the snout pointing away from the crossing. After a 1-minute habituation time, the trial was initiated manually, letting the mouse spend 10 minutes in the arena. Four infrared (IR) beams connected to an activity logger recorded the arm entries of the mouse and one beam recorded the percentage of time that the mouse spent in the open arms per minute.</p>
<p>The SPSN set-up consisted of a Plexiglas box with three compartments separated with Plexiglas walls. The SPSN test involved three trials. At the first stage of habituation, the test mouse was left to explore the middle chamber for 300 seconds, while the left and right chambers were empty and visible from the middle chamber. Next, in the Social Preference stage with Subject 1 (S1), the test mouse was placed in the middle chamber for 300 seconds while one stranger mouse (STR1) was placed in either the left or right chamber, and the other chamber was left empty. Finally, in the Social Novelty stage with Subject 2 (S2) (300 s), a second stranger mouse (STR2) was placed in the previously empty chamber. The two stranger mice were C57BL/6 wildtype mice of the same sex as the test mouse and had served before as stranger mice in previous SPSN experiments. Explorative social behavior towards stranger mice was measured using ANY-mazeTM Video Tracking System software (Stoelting Co., IL, USA).</p>
<p>NOR testing started with a habituation phase where the animals were placed during 15 minutes in a dimly lit open field arena. Twenty-four hours later, the animals were reintroduced to the same arena for 10 minutes with two identical falcon tubes filled with colored liquid that were placed in opposite corners equally distant from the mouse. Exploration time involving sniffing in close proximity (&lt;2cm) was recorded by an overhead camera and tracking software. Total exploration time was set at minimally 15 seconds to ensure that object characteristics were encoded. Sixty minutes later, the animals were placed again in the arena for 10 minutes, with one object replaced by a novel object, and exploration time was recorded. Objects were randomly assigned as familiar or novel for each mouse, and the left or right position of the novel object was counterbalanced between trials. Exploration time was measured by a camera and ANY-mazeTM Video Tracking System software (Stoelting Co., IL, USA).</p>
<p>The PA experimental set-up consisted of a transparent box illuminated with an LED lamp leading to a dark box with an electrifiable grid connected to a shocker (LE 100-26, Panlab Bioseb, Spain) and a lid. After the mice were placed in the light box, the latency to enter the dark box was recorded, and a mild foot shock was delivered (0,5mA, 2s, scrambled). The next day, the trial was repeated without a shock. In case the animal remained in the light compartment, the test was stopped after 5 minutes.</p>

After MRI scanning, MR spectra were acquired from a 2.5 × 1.25 × 1.5 mm voxel placed in the hippocampal region of the brain, using a PRESS sequence with TR/TE 2000/20 ms, 320 averages, and localized shimming with no margin. Water suppression was optimized using VAPOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Griffey &amp; P. Flamig, 1990</xref>). An unsuppressed water MR spectrum was acquired before each water-suppressed 1H-MRS spectrum for quantification/referencing. Shimming was performed using FASTMAP, resulting in a final water line width at half height &lt; 20 Hz.</p>
<p>For the multivariate analysis of the spectra, the signals were truncated to retain only the region of interest between 0.0 and 4.3ppm. The msbackadj function in Matlab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Inc., 2022</xref>) was applied for baseline and offset correction. The baseline was estimated within multiple shifted windows of width 150 separation units and extracted from the original signal. The baseline corrected signals were further analyzed by segmenting it into 12 spectral regions, which were integrated and normalized to the total integral using peak integration methodology for metabolite quantification (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The two spectral regions that represent contaminations from macromolecules were excluded (number 11 and 12 in <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).

<p>The developmental trajectories of the body weight, BMD, and acquisition rate of neurodevelopment tests with categorical non-binary scores were longitudinally analyzed by fitting a mixed-effects model as implemented in GraphPad Prism 8.0, using the Geisser-Greenhouse correction and Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) fit as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Llambrich, González, et al., 2022</xref>). The acquisition rate of neurodevelopment tests with a presence/absence binary outcome was longitudinally analyzed using a log-rank test (Mantel-Haenszel approach), considering the day of appearance of the landmark or response as an event using GraphPad Prism 8.0.</p>
<p>We made five pairwise comparisons for all univariate non-longitudinal data: the body weight at adulthood, the BMD at each developmental timepoint, the variables evaluating tibia microarchitecture, the brain volume of the different regions, the average day of acquisition of the neurodevelopmental tests, the variables evaluating adult cognition, and the concentration of the hippocampal metabolites. We compared WT vs. TS untreated mice to evaluate the genotype effect (1), WT untreated vs. WT treated mice to evaluate the treatment effect in the WT background (2), TS untreated vs. TS treated mice to evaluate the treatment effect in the trisomic background (3), WT untreated vs. TS treated mice to determine whether the treatment had a rescuing effect in trisomic mice (4), and WT treated vs. TS treated mice to evaluate whether the treatment showed different effects in the WT and trisomic background (5). We determined statistical significance for each comparison using univariate statistical tests as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Llambrich, González-Colom, et al., 2022</xref>). For the BMD, P-values at each developmental stage were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg (Q = 5%) test.</p>

<title>Multivariate evaluation</title>
<p>We performed multivariate statistics in all tests with multiple variables: craniofacial shape, tibia microarchitecture, brain volumes, neurodevelopmental tests, adult cognitive tests, brain metabolite concentration and gene expression.</p>
<p>We performed a principal component analysis (PCA) for the craniofacial shape and gene expression analysis. The PCA for the craniofacial shape analysis was based on the 3D coordinates of the set of 27 landmarks recorded to capture craniofacial shape. To extract shape information from the 3D landmark configurations, we performed a Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) followed by a PCA at each stage as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Llambrich, González, et al., 2022</xref>) using MorphoJ v1.06d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Klingenberg, 2011</xref>). For the gene expression data, the PCA was based on the rlog normalized expression data of the 125 triplicated genes in the Ts65Dn mouse model according to the MGI-Mouse Genome Informatics Database that were present in our dataset and was performed using PAST v4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Hammer et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>As we aimed to maximize differences between groups, we performed a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for the tibia microarchitecture analysis, brain volumetric analysis, neurodevelopmental tests, adult cognitive tests, and hippocampal metabolite concentration analysis using the results obtained from each test. We performed an LDA for each domain considering genotype+treatment as the grouping variable using PAST v4.1. As we compared four groups of mice, the LDA created three new axes that were independent among them and explained 100% of variation across groups. In the LDA, the separation among groups was determined by Mahalanobis distances, which account for correlations between standardized variables, and allow to combine measurements with different units in the same analysis.</p>
<p>If slight or no differences were associated with DS or treatment, the mice groups overlapped in the PCA or LDA scatterplot, showing similar phenotypes. If there were differences, the different groups of mice separated from each other. PCA and LDA scatterplots were plotted with the ggpubr package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Kassambara, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">R Core Team (2019)</xref>, 2019).</p>
<p>To statistically quantify differences between WT, TS, WT treated and TS treated mice and answer the five scientific questions formulated above, we performed pairwise permutation tests with 10.000 rounds following the PCAs and LDAs. For the craniofacial shape analysis, we obtained the P-values from the permutation tests based on the Procrustes distances between the average shape of pairs of groups at each developmental stage using MorphoJ v1.06d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Klingenberg, 2011</xref>). For the gene expression analysis, we obtained the P-values from the pairwise comparisons after a one-way PERMANOVA based on Euclidean distances using PAST v4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Hammer et al., 2001</xref>). For the tibia microarchitecture tests, brain volumetric tests, neurodevelopmental tests, adult cognitive tests and hippocampal metabolite concentration tests we obtained the P-values from the pairwise comparisons after a one-way PERMANOVA based on Mahalanobis distances using PAST v4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Hammer et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, to better understand the differences between groups, we selected the variables that were testing for a certain domain and grouped them into categories for the tibia microarchitecture tests, neurodevelopmental tests and adult cognitive tests. We then repeated the multivariate pairwise permutation analysis. The categories were cortical bone strength, cortical bone size and trabecular bone for the tibia microarchitecture; developmental landmarks, neuromotor tests and reflexes for the neurodevelopmental tests; and anxiety, arousal, and memory for the adult cognitive tests.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings that examine both how Down syndrome (DS)-related physiological, behavioral, and phenotypic traits track across time, as well as how chronic treatment with green tea extracts 25 enriched in epigallocatechin-3-gallate (GTE-EGCG), administered in drinking water spanning prenatal through 5 months of age, impacts these measures in wild-type and Ts65Dn mice. However, the strength of the evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold>, due to high variability across measures, perhaps attributable to a failure to include sex as a factor for measures known to be sexually dimorphic. This study is of interest to scientists interested in Down Syndrome and its' treatment, as well as scientists who study disorders that impact multiple organ systems.</p>

<p>Using Ts65Dn - the most commonly used mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) - the goal of this study is two-pronged: 1) to conduct a thorough assessment of DS-related genotypic, physiological, behavioral, and phenotypic measures in a longitudinal manner; and 2) to measure the effects of chronic GTE-EGCG on these measures in the Ts65Dn mouse model. Corroborating results from several previous studies on Ts65Dn mice, findings of this study show confirm the Ts65Dn mouse model exhibits the suite of traits associated with DS. The findings also suggest that the mouse model might have experienced drift, given the milder phenotypes than those reported by earlier studies. Results of the GTE-EGCG treatment do not support its therapeutic use and instead show that the treatment exacerbated certain DS-related phenotypes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors performed a rigorous assessment of treatment and examined treatment and genotypic alterations at multiple time points during growth and aging. Detailed analysis shows differences in genotype during aging as well as genotype with treatment. This study is solid in the overarching methodological approach (with the exception of RNAseq, described below). The biggest strength of the study is its approach and dataset, which corroborate results from a multitude of past studies on Ts65Dn mice, albeit on adult specimens. It would be beneficial for the dataset to be made available to other researchers using a public data repository.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are several primary weaknesses, described below:</p>
<p>Sex was not considered in the analyses</p>
<p>
The number of experimental animals of each sex are not clearly represented in the paper, but are buried in supplemental tables, and the Ns for the RNAseq are unclear. No analyses were done to examine sex differences in male/female DS or WT animals with or without treatment. Body measurements will greatly vary by sex, but this was not taken into consideration during assessments. As such, there is a high amount of variability within each cohort measured for body assessments (tibia, body weight, skeletal development etc.). Supplemental table 14 had the list of each animal, but not collated by sex, genotype or treatment, making it difficult to assess the strength of each measurement.</p>
<p>Key results are not clearly depicted in the main figures</p>
<p>
Rigorous assessment of each figure and the clarity of the figure to convey the results of the analysis needs to be performed. Many of the figures do not clearly represent the findings, with authors heavily relying on supplemental figures to present details to explain results. Figure legends do not adequately describe figures; rather, they are limited to describing how the analysis is performed. For example, LDA plots in Figure 4 do not clearly convey the results of metabolite analysis.</p>
<p>
Overall, the amount of data presented here is overwhelming, making it difficult to interpret the findings. Some assessments that do not add to the overall paper need to be removed. Clarifying the text, figures and trimming the supplement to represent the data in a manner that is easily understood will improve the readability of the paper. For example, perhaps measures which are not strongly impacted by genotype could be moved to the supplement, because they are not directly relevant to the question of whether GTE-EGCG reverses the impact of trisomy on the measures.</p>
<p>Lack of clarity in the behavioral analyses</p>
<p>
Behavioral assessments are not clearly written in the methods. For example, for the novel object recognition task, it isn't clear how preference was calculated. Is this simply the percent of time spent with the novel object, or is this a relative measure (novel:familiar ratio)? This matters because if it is simply the percent of time, the relevant measure is to compare each group to 50% (the absence of a preference). The key measures for each test need to be readily distinguished from the control measures.</p>
<p>
There are also many dependent behavioral measures. For example, speed and distance are directly related to each other, but these are typically reported as control measures to help interpret the key measure, which is the anxiety-like behavior. Similarly, some behavioral tests were used to represent multiple behavioral dimensions, such as anxiety and arousal. In general, the measurements of arousal seem atypical (speed and distance are typically reported as control measures, not measures of arousal). Similarly, measures of latency during training would not typically be used as a measure of long-term memory but instead reported as a control measure to show learning occurred. LDA analysis requires independence of the measures, as well as normality. It does not appear that all of the measures fed into this analysis would have met these assumptions, but the methods also do not clearly describe which measures were actually used in the LDA.</p>
<p>Unclear value of RNAseq</p>
<p>
RNAseq was performed in cerebellum, a relatively spared region in DS pathology at an early time point in disease. Further, the expression of 125 genes triplicated in DS was shown in a PCA plot to highly overlap with WT, indicating that there are minimal differences in gene expression in these genes. If these genes are not critical for cerebellar function, perhaps this could account for the lack of differences between WT and Ts65Dn mice. If the authors are interested in performing RNAseq, it would have made more sense to perform this in hippocampus (to compare with metabolites) and to perform more stringent bioinformatic analysis than assessment by PCA of a limited subset of genes. Supplementary Table S14, which shows the differentially expressed genes, appears to be missing from the manuscript and cannot be evaluated. Additionally, the methods of the RNAseq are not sufficiently described and lack critical details. For example, what was the normalization performed, and which groups were compared to identify differentially expressed genes? It would also be worthwhile to describe how animals were identified for RNAseq-were those animals representative of their groups across other measures?</p>
