<title>Abstract</title><p>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common and progressive spinal deformity in children that exhibits striking sexual dimorphism, with girls at more than five-fold greater risk of severe disease compared to boys. Despite its medical impact, the molecular mechanisms that drive AIS are largely unknown. We previously defined a female-specific AIS genetic risk locus in an enhancer near the <italic>PAX1</italic> gene. Here we sought to define the roles of <italic>PAX1</italic> and newly-identified AIS-associated genes in the developmental mechanism of AIS. In a genetic study of 9,161 individuals with AIS and 80,731 unaffected controls, significant association was identified with a variant in <italic>COL11A1</italic> encoding collagen (α1) XI (rs3753841; NM_080629_c.4004C&gt;T; p.(Pro1335Leu); P=7.07e<sup>−11</sup>, OR=1.118). Using CRISPR mutagenesis we generated <italic>Pax1</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Pax1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>). In postnatal spines we found that Pax1 and collagen (α1) XI protein both localize within the intervertebral disc (IVD)-vertebral junction region encompassing the growth plate, with less collagen (α1) XI detected in <italic>Pax1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spines compared to wildtype. By genetic targeting we found that wildtype <italic>Col11a1</italic> expression in growth plate cells (GPCs) suppresses expression of <italic>Pax1</italic> and of <italic>Mmp3</italic>, encoding the matrix metalloproteinase 3 enzyme implicated in matrix remodeling. However, this suppression was abrogated in the presence of the AIS-associated <italic>COL11A1</italic><sup>P1335L</sup> mutant. Further, we found that either knockdown of the estrogen receptor gene <italic>Esr2</italic>, or tamoxifen treatment, significantly altered <italic>Col11a1</italic> and <italic>Mmp3</italic> expression in GPCs. These studies support a new molecular model of AIS pathogenesis wherein genetic variation and estrogen signaling increase disease susceptibility by altering a <italic>Pax1</italic>-<italic>Col11a1</italic>-<italic>Mmp3</italic> signaling axis in the growth plate.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human spinal column is a dynamic, segmented, bony and cartilaginous structure that is essential for integrating the brain and nervous system with the axial skeleton while simultaneously providing flexibility in three dimensions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common developmental disorder of the spine, typically appearing during the adolescent growth spurt. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is reported in all major ancestral groups, with a population prevalence of 1.5-3%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Children with AIS usually present with a characteristic right-thoracic major curve pattern and a compensatory lumbar curve. Major thoracolumbar and lumbar curves are less frequent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The three-dimensional nature of the deformity results in torsion in the spine that is most significant at the apex of the major curve, and changes in the structures of the vertebrae and ribs may develop as the curve worsens or progresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Children with thoracic curves, with larger curves at first presentation, and/or with greater remaining growth potential are at increased risk of progression, but this risk decreases sharply after skeletal maturity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Sex is a recognized risk factor for AIS, with girls having at least a five-fold greater risk of progressive deformity requiring treatment compared to boys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This well-documented sexual dimorphism has prompted speculation that levels of circulating endocrine hormones, particularly estrogen, are important exposures in AIS susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The genetic architecture of human AIS is complex, and underlying disease mechanisms remain uncertain. Heritability studies of Northern European<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, North American<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, and South Asian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> ancestral groups suggest that disease risk is multifactorial, caused by genetic and environmental contributions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Accordingly, population-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in multiple ancestral groups have identified several AIS-associated susceptibility loci, mostly within non-coding genomic regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In particular, multiple GWAS have implicated noncoding regions near the <italic>LBX1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, <italic>ADGRG6</italic> (also known as <italic>GPR126</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and <italic>BNC2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> genes. An association with alleles in an enhancer distal to <italic>PAX1</italic>, encoding the transcription factor paired box 1, was primarily driven by females, suggesting that it contributes to the sexual dimorphism observed in AIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Subsequent meta-analysis of combined AIS GWAS identified additional susceptibility loci. These included variants in an intron of <italic>SOX6</italic>, a transcription factor, that along with <italic>PAX1</italic>, is important in early spinal column formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, gene enrichment analyses found significant correlation of AIS-associated loci with biological pathways involving cartilage and connective tissue development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. A more recent GWAS in a Japanese population identified fourteen additional AIS loci that are candidates for further evaluation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In separate studies, genome sequencing in AIS cases and families identified enrichment of rare mutations in the <italic>COL11A2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and <italic>HSPG2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> genes, encoding components of the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). Hence variation affecting cartilage and connective tissue ECM genes is an emerging theme in the heterogeneous genetic architecture of AIS.</p>
<p>Pre-clinical animal models are essential tools for accelerating mechanistic understanding of AIS and for therapeutic testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In zebrafish, several genetic mutants with larval or later-onset spinal deformity have been described, including <italic>ptk7</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, <italic>c21orf59</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, <italic>ccdc40</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, <italic>ccdc151</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, <italic>dyx1c1</italic>, and <italic>kif6</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In mouse, conditional deletion of <italic>Adgrg6</italic> in skeletal cartilage (using <italic>Col2a1</italic>-Cre) produces a progressive scoliosis of the thoracic spine during postnatal development that is marked by herniations within the cartilaginous endplates of involved vertebrae. Progressive scoliosis, albeit to a lesser extent, was also observed when <italic>Adgrg6</italic> was deleted from committed chondrocytes (using ATC-Cre)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. These studies demonstrate that cartilage and possibly other osteochondroprogenitor cells contribute to the scoliosis phenotype in these models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Taken together, genetic and functional studies in mouse, although limited, support the hypothesis that deficiencies in biogenesis and/or homeostasis of cartilage, intervertebral disc (IVD), and dense connective tissues, undermine the maintenance of proper spinal alignment during the adolescent growth spurt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The combined contribution of reported AIS-associated variants is broadly estimated to account for less than 10% of the overall genetic risk of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. To address this knowledge gap, we sought to define novel loci associated with AIS susceptibility in genes encoding proteins of the ECM (i.e. the “matrisome”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>). Here we identify new genetic associations with AIS. Further, our functional assessments support a new disease model wherein AIS-associated genetic variation and estrogen signaling perturb a <italic>Pax1-Col11a1-Mmp3</italic> axis in cartilage GPCs.</p>

<title>Nonsynonymous variants in matrisome genes are associated with increased risk of AIS</title>
<p>The “matrisome” has been defined as “all genes encoding structural ECM components and those encoding proteins that may interact with or remodel the ECM”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Proteins comprising the global ECM as currently defined have been identified by both experimental and bio-informatic methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We assembled 1027 matrisome genes as previously identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, including 274 core-matrisome and 753 matrisome-associated genes (N=1,027 total). For the genes encoding these 1,027 proteins, we identified all nonsynonymous common variants (MAF &gt; 0.01) queried by the Illumina HumanCoreExome-24v1.0 beadchip and determined their genotypes in a discovery cohort of 1,358 cases and 12,507 controls (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). After applying multiple quality control measures (see Methods section), we retained 2,008 variants in 597 matrisome genes for association testing (<bold>Supplemental Table 1).</bold> For controls, we utilized 12,507 non-AMD GRU (non-age-related macular degeneration general research use) subjects of European ancestry downloaded from dbGaP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/</ext-link>). This sample size was estimated to provide at least 80% power to detect significant associations at the matrisome-wide level (α≤2.5e-05), for alleles with population frequency ≥.05 and OR ≥1.5 (<bold>Figure 1 – figure supplement 1a</bold>). Two nonsynonymous variants, in <italic>COL11A1</italic> (rs3753841; NM_080629_c.4004C&gt;T; p.(Pro1335Leu); odds ratio (OR)=1.236 [95% CI=1.134-1.347], P=1.17E<sup>−06</sup>) and <italic>MMP14</italic> (rs1042704; NM_004995_c.817G&gt;A; p.(Asp273Asn); OR=1.239 [95% CI=1.125-1.363], P=1.89E<sup>−05</sup>) were significantly associated with AIS (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref></bold>). Given the sexual dimorphism in AIS and our prior observation of a female-predominant disease locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, we tested the 2,008 variants separately in females (N=1,157 cases and 7,138 controls). In females, the association with rs3753841 remained statistically significant, whereas rs1042704, near <italic>MMP14</italic>, was not associated with AIS in females (<bold>Figure 1 – figure supplement 1b</bold>). Our study was not sufficiently powered to test males separately.</p>

<p>To validate these results, we sought to replicate the associations of rs3753841 and rs1042704 in four independent AIS case-control cohorts, from North America, Europe, and eastern Asia, representing multiple ethnicities (total N = 9,161 AIS cases, 80,731 healthy controls, <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Genotypes for both variants were extracted from these datasets and tested for association by meta analysis together with the discovery cohort (see Methods). Meta-analysis of all cohorts together increased the evidence for association of both variants with AIS risk (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold>). While a similar effect size was noted for rs1042704 in Japanese and Han Chinese cohorts, the results were less significant, likely due to lower minor allele frequencies (East Asian MAF = 0.02 compared to total non-Asian cohort MAF = 0.20) in these populations (<bold>Figure 1 – figure supplement 1c</bold>). Plotting recombination across both regions suggested that these signals were likely confined to blocks of linkage disequilibrium within the <italic>COL11A1</italic> and <italic>MMP14</italic> genes, respectively (<bold>Figure 1 – figure supplement 1d, e</bold>).</p>
<p>Although low-resolution structures currently available for collagen triple helices are not useful for modeling the stability change of individual mutations, we noted that the AIS-associated variant P1335L occurs at the third position of a Gly-X-Y repeat and consequently could be structurally important in promoting stability of the triple helix, particularly if it is hydroxylated. Rare dominant mutations in <italic>COL11A1,</italic> often disrupting a Gly-X-Y sequence, can cause Marshall (MRSHS) (OMIM# 154780) or Stickler syndromes (STL2) (OMIM# 604841) marked variously by facial anomalies, sensineural hearing loss, short stature, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, eye anomalies, ectodermal features, and scoliosis. Notably, our AIS cohort and particularly individuals carrying the rs3753841 risk allele were negative for co-morbidities or obvious features of Marshall or Stickler syndromes. Thus, AIS is independently associated with the <italic>COL11A1</italic><sup>P1335L</sup> predicted variant.</p>

In regions of the cartilage endplate (CEP)-vertebral bone transition, collagen α1(XI) was detected in columnar chondrocytes, particularly in the hypertrophic zone adjacent to condensing bone (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref></bold>). We also examined collagen α1(XI) expression in ribs, as these structures are also involved in the scoliotic deformity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.

<p>The expression of <italic>Col11a1,</italic> and of other ECM genes, is known to be estrogen-responsive in certain tissues, such as ovarian follicular cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Because of the suspected role of endocrine hormones in AIS, we investigated whether <italic>Col11a1</italic> expression was responsive to estrogen treatment and/or levels of estrogen receptor following siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments in cultured cartilage GPCs. We first validated that Mmp3 levels were significantly increased after <italic>Col11a1</italic> knockdown (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref></bold>). Estrogen receptor 2 (Esr2), but not estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1), was detected in mouse GPCs by qRT-PCR (data not shown). We next tested the consequences of <italic>Col11a1</italic> and <italic>Esr2</italic> siRNA-mediated knockdown on gene expression in cartilage GPCs. After <italic>Esr2</italic> knockdown, <italic>Col11a1</italic> as well as <italic>Pax1</italic> were significantly upregulated compared to scramble control, while <italic>Mmp3</italic> expression was significantly downregulated (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref></bold>). <italic>Pax1</italic> expression was also upregulated by <italic>Col11a1</italic> knockdown alone.

Simultaneous knockdown of <italic>Col11a1</italic> and <italic>Esr2</italic> expression reduced <italic>Mmp3</italic> expression to normal levels, supporting a possible interaction between <italic>Col11a1</italic> and estrogen signaling in regulating <italic>Mmp3</italic>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis has been described in the medical literature for centuries, yet its underlying etiology has remained enigmatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Given that AIS originates in children who appear to be otherwise healthy, even its tissue of origin has been difficult to discern, and long debated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The advent of powerful genotyping and sequencing methods in the last two decades has led to breakthrough discoveries of genetic loci associated with AIS, most in non-coding regions of the genome that are difficult to interpret biologically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Aggregating these results, however, provided supportive evidence that pathways of cartilage and connective tissue ECM development are relevant in AIS etiology<sup>12, 18</sup>. Here, in the largest multi-ethnic human cohort studied to date, we elected to test the hypothesis that alterations in ECM proteins themselves contribute to AIS susceptibility. This approach yielded most significant evidence for a common protein-altering variant in the <italic>COL11A1</italic> gene encoding collagen α1(XI), a minor yet critical component of cartilaginous ECM. Moreover, our studies define a <italic>COL11A1</italic>-mediated disease pathway (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold>) and point to the chondro-osseous junction of IVD and vertebrae spine as a relevant cellular compartment in AIS etiology.</p>

<p>The results of this study together with the previous observation of <italic>COL11A2</italic> rare variant enrichment in AIS supports a role for the collagen α1(XI) heterotrimer itself in its pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Collagen type XI, composed of three chains encoded by the <italic>COL11A1</italic>, <italic>COL11A2</italic>, and <italic>COL2A1</italic> genes (OMIM #s 120280,120290, 120140, respectively), is a minor component of collagen type II fibrils that are abundant in cartilage. Collagen type XI is also broadly expressed in testis, trachea, tendons, trabecular bone, skeletal muscle, placenta, lung, brain neuroepithelium, the vitreous of the eye, and intervertebral discs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. In the pericellular space, collagen α1(XI) initiates fibrillogenesis with collagen type II fibrils, maintaining regular spacing and diameter of the collagen fibrils, while organizing the pericellular surface by interaction with cartilage proteoglycans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Purified human collagen type XI, when added back to chondrocytes in <italic>in vitro</italic> culture, stimulates chondrogenesis while inhibiting hypertrophy, as measured by histologic staining, proliferation assays, and relative expression of chondrogenic early marker genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. In newborn and one-month old mice, we found that collagen α1(XI) was abundant in IVD and at the chondro-osseous junction of IVD and vertebrae, particularly concentrated in pre hypertrophic/hypertrophic chondrocytic cells. In long bone growth plates, Long et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> recently identified eight distinct cell clusters after unsupervised analysis of single cell (scRNAseq) of flow sorted hypertrophic chondrocytes from Col10a1Cre;Rosa26fs-tdTomato mice. At embryonic stage 16.5 (E16.5), <italic>Col11a1</italic> expression was highest in cells with signatures of pre-hypertrophic to hypertrophic transition, and lowest in cells with osteogenic signatures (M. Hilton, personal communication)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Taken together, these results suggest that collagen α1(XI) normally participates in maintaining growth plate cells in a hypertrophic, pre-osteogenic state, although little is known about its precise molecular function in that compartment, or in the IVD, during spinal development. Spines of <italic>Col11a1</italic>-deficient mice (<italic>cho/cho</italic>) show incompletely formed vertebral bodies, spinal curvatures, and decreased separation between vertebrae, which are themselves less mineralized than in wildtype mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Notably, common <italic>COL11A1</italic> variants also have been associated with adult lumbar disc herniation (LDH) and degeneration (LDD), as well as DXA measured bone size, spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>Pax1</italic> is a well-described marker of early spine development, where it activates a gene expression cascade starting at E12.5-13.5 in mouse development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Our data provided evidence that Pax1 regulates expression of <italic>Col11a1</italic>, as well as the AIS-associated genes <italic>Sox6</italic> and <italic>Gpr126,</italic> in E12.5 tails of both male and female mice. The reduction of <italic>Col11a1</italic> is consistent with a prior study of gene expression in flow-sorted GFP-labeled Pax1<sup>−/−</sup> embryonic IVD cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. It is likely that <italic>Col11a1</italic> expression in developing tail is directly activated by binding Sox transcription factors, as a prior genomic study using chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) in rat chondrosarcoma cells identified super enhancers near the <italic>Col11a1</italic> gene that were bound multiple times by the Sox9 and Sox6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. The <italic>Sox5/6/9</italic> trio is known to regulate many of the same genes as <italic>Pax1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, but whether it mediates the <italic>Pax1</italic> regulation of <italic>Col11a1</italic> observed in our study is unknown.</p>
<p>In mouse postnatal spines, we observed co-localization of collagen α1(XI) and Pax1 protein specifically within the cartilaginous endplate-vertebral junction region that includes the vertebral growth plate. The endplate, which is important as the site allowing diffusion of nutrients from the circulation into the avascular inner IVD, harbors subpopulations of cells expressing type II collagen presumably organized by collagen type XI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. While the endplate is continuous with the vertebral growth plate in mice, it is important to note that in humans the endplate and vertebrae become distinctly separate structures with closure of the growth plates at puberty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. This is also the site of the ring apophyses that form the insertion of the IVD into vertebrae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Lagging maturity of the ring apophysis, combined with mechanical forces across the IVD in the horizontal plane, has been proposed as an initiating factor leading to rotatory decompensation in the adolescent spine in AIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Recently, Sun et al. reported the discovery of a vertebral skeletal stem cell (vSSC) residing in the endplate and marked by expression of the genes <italic>Zic1</italic> and <italic>Pax1,</italic> along with other cell surface markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. These vSSCs also express high levels of <italic>Col11a1</italic> (M. Greenblatt, personal communication). It is interesting to consider that AIS-associated genetic variation, perhaps together with mechanical forces, could alter the differentiation trajectory of this cell niche. Altogether, extant data and our results strongly suggest that cell populations at the IVD-vertebral junction region are relevant in AIS pathogenesis. Further investigation is warranted to understand the developmental programmes of cells in this region of the spine.</p>
<p>Matrix metalloproteinase 3, also known as stromolysin, is a secreted enzyme expressed in connective tissues and in regions of endochondral ossification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. MMP3 has degradative activity toward a variety of ECM components, including proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminin, but notably not type I collagen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Additionally, in chondrocytes MMP3 also has been shown to translocate to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of connective tissue growth factor (<italic>CTGF/CCN2</italic>) by binding to an element known as transcription <underline>e</underline>nhancer <underline>d</underline>ominant in <underline>c</underline>hondrocytes (TRENDIC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Our observations of a <italic>Col11a1-Mmp3</italic> signaling axis in GPCs and CEP cells raise the possibility that <italic>Col11a1</italic> variation may have consequences for both MMP3 enzymatic activity and for <italic>MMP3</italic> mediated transcriptional programming in these cells. <italic>COL11A1</italic> missense mutations, usually altering glycine or proline in Gly-X-Y repeats in the collagen α1(XI) helical domain as with <italic>COL11A1<sup>P1335L</sup></italic>, are reported to be frequent in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and have been linked to transcriptional changes and tumor invasivenes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. The mechanisms by which GPCs or other cells sense such single amino acid changes in <italic>COL11A1</italic> and induce subsequent transcriptional responses are unknown but may involve direct interaction with integrins in the pericellular space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We found that <italic>Col11a1</italic> expression is sensitive to estrogen receptor status in GPCs, suggesting that in these cells it is responsive to estrogen signaling. Collagen α1(XI) is also a key player in organizing the pericellular space, which is critical for transmitting mechanical forces from the ECM to the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Our findings support a new model wherein environmental cues, i.e. mechanical forces and estrogen signaling, intersect with genetic variation in a <italic>Pax1</italic>-<italic>Col11a1</italic>-<italic>Mmp3</italic> signaling axis in the IVD-vertebral junction and thereby increase AIS susceptibility.</p>

Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Cat #13778030 Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) was diluted (9ul in 500ul) in Opti-MEM Medium (Cat # 31985070 Thermo Fisher MA, USA). 30 pmol siRNA was diluted in 500ul Opti-MEM medium, then added to diluted Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent. siRNA-lipid complex was added to cells after 5-minute incubation at room temperature. Cells were harvested after 72 hours.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>For Mmp3 western blotting, a total of 30 µg protein mixed with SDS-PAGE buffer was loaded on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis. For collagen α1(XI) western blotting, 50 µg protein mixed with SDS-PAGE buffer was loaded on 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Cat #77010 Thermo Fisher Waltham, MA, USA) at 100 volts for 2-3 hours. The membrane was first incubated with blocking buffer containing 5% defatted milk powder, and then exposed to 0.1 mg/mL mouse anti-rabbit Mmp3 (Cat #ab214794 Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) or anti-rabbit Col11a1 (Cat #PA5-38888 Thermo Fisher Waltham, MA, USA) overnight. The samples were then washed thoroughly with TBS buffer, followed by incubation with HRP-labeled antirabbit IgG secondary antibodies 1:5000, (Cat #32460 Thermo Fisher Waltham, MA, USA) overnight. The membranes were then washed with TBS buffer. GAPDH was detected by a rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Cat #14C10 Cell Signaling, MA, USA) and used as the internal loading control.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study analyzed a large cohort of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) patients and identified an association with a variant in COL11A1 (Pro1335Leu). Experimental testing of this potentially pathogenic variant suggests a link between Pax1, Col11a1, Mmp3, and estrogen signaling. While the connection between transcriptional regulation, the extracellular matrix, and estrogen signaling is <bold>compelling</bold>, the experimental evidence supporting this link is still <bold>incomplete</bold> and would benefit from a more direct and comprehensive approach. Strengthening the functional testing would help establish the pathogenicity of a collagen variant and the role of the proposed Pax1-Col11a1-Mmp3 signaling axis in AIS.</p>

<p>Summary: This study follows up on previous work showing a female-specific enhancer region of PAX1 is associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). This new analysis combines human GWAS analysis from multiple countries to identify a new AIS-associated coding variant in the COL11A1 gene. Two nonsynonymous variants were found to be significantly associated with AIS: MMP14 p.Asp273Asn and COL11A1 p.Pro1335Leu, the latter of which had the more robust association and remained significant when females were tested independent of males. Using a Pax1 knockout mouse they go on to find that PAX1 and Collagen XI protein are expressed in the intervertebral discs (IVDs) and robustly in the growth plate, showing that COL11A1 expression is reduced in Pax1 mutant growth plate. Moreover, other AIS-associated genes, Gpr126 and Sox6, were also reduced in Pax1 mutant mice, suggesting a common pathway is involved in AIS. The proposed implication of a Pax1-Col11a1-Mmp3 signaling axis modulated by estrogen signaling suggests a potential mechanism by which young women have more severe scoliosis than young men, as is observed in humans.</p>
<p>Strengths: This work integrates a large cohort of human genetic data from AIS patients and controls from diverse ethnic backgrounds, across the globe. This work attempts to functionally test their findings in vivo and by use of cell culture. The authors propose an interesting model which warrants in depth investigation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: There are concerns regarding the candidacy of COL11A1 p.Pro1335Leu that need to be addressed and clarified. Many of the main functional work was done in cell culture and not in vivo. Moreover, the evidence linking COL11A1 p.Pro1153Leu to AIS is indirect, making unclear whether impaired COL11A1 function can cause scoliosis in the mouse model, thus diminishing the strength of the conclusions regarding the proposed pathogenicity of COL11A1 p.Pro1335Leu.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for truly valuable advice and comments. We have made multiple corrections and revisions to the original pre-print accordingly. Here we address 2 major points.</p>
<p>1. Regarding the genetic association of the common COL11A1 variant rs3753841 (p.(Pro1335Leu)), we do not propose that it is the sole risk variant contributing to the association signal we detected and have clarified this in the manuscript. We concluded that it was worthy of functional testing for reasons described here. Although there were several common variants in the discovery GWAS within and around COL11A1, none were significantly associated with AIS and none were in linkage disequilibrium (R2&gt;0.6) with the top SNP rs3753841. We next reviewed rare (MAF&lt;=0.01) coding variants within the COL11A1 LD region of the associated SNP (rs3753841) in 625 available exomes representing 46% of the 1,358 cases from the discovery cohort. The LD block was defined using Haploview based on the 1KG_CEU population. Within the ~41 KB LD region (chr1:103365089- 103406616, GRCh37) we found three rare missense mutations in 6 unrelated individuals, Author response table 1. Two of them (NM_080629.2: c.G4093A:p.A1365T; NM_080629.2:c.G3394A:p.G1132S), from two individuals, are predicted to be deleterious based on CADD and GERP scores and are plausible AIS risk candidates. At this rate we could expect to find only 4-5 individuals with linked rare coding variants in the total cohort of 1,358 which collectively are unlikely to explain the overall association signal we detected. Of course, there also could be deep intronic variants contributing to the association that we would not detect by our methods. However, given this scenario, the relatively high predicted deleteriousness of rs3753841  (CADD= 25.7; GERP=5.75),  and its occurrence in a Gly-X-Y triplet repeat, we hypothesized that this variant itself could be a risk allele worthy of further investigation.</p>

<p>We also appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to perform a rare variant burden analysis of COL11A1. We conducted pilot gene-based analysis in 4534 European ancestry exomes including 797 of our own AIS cases and 3737 controls and tested the burden of rare variants in COL11A1.  SKATO P value was not significant (COL11A1_P=0.18) but this could due to lack of power and/or background from rare benign variants that could be screened out using the functional testing we have developed.</p>
<p>1. Regarding functional testing, by knockdown/knockout cell culture experiments, we showed for the first time that Col11a1 negatively regulates Mmp3 expression in cartilage chondrocytes, an AIS-relevant tissue. We then tested the effect of overexpressing the human wt or variant COL11A1 by lentiviral transduction in SV40-transformed chondrocyte cultures.  We deleted endogenous mouse Col11a1 by Cre recombination to remove the background of its strong suppressive effects on Mmp3 expression. We acknowledge that Col11a1 missense mutations could confer gain of function or dominant negative effects that would not be revealed in this assay. However as indicated in our original manuscript we have noted that spinal deformity is described in the cho/cho mouse, a Col11a1 loss of function mutant. We also note the recent publication by Rebello et al. showing that missense mutations in Col11a2 associated with congenital scoliosis fail to rescue a vertebral malformation phenotype in a zebrafish col11a2 KO line. Although the connection between AIS and vertebral malformations is not altogether clear, we surmise that loss of the components of collagen type XI disrupt spinal development.  in vivo experiments in vertebrate model systems are needed to fully establish the consequences and genetic mechanisms by which COL11A1 variants contribute to an AIS phenotype.</p>
