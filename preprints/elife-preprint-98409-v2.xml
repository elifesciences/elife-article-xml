<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen with a unique developmental cycle. It differentiates between two functional and morphological forms: elementary body (EB) and reticulate body (RB). The signals that trigger differentiation from one form to the other are unknown. EBs and RBs have distinctive characteristics that distinguish them, including their size, infectivity, proteome, and transcriptome. Intriguingly, they also differ in their overall redox status as EBs are oxidized and RBs are reduced. We hypothesize that alterations in redox may serve as a trigger for secondary differentiation. To test this, we examined the function of the primary antioxidant enzyme alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC), a well-known member of the peroxiredoxins family, in chlamydial growth and development. Based on our hypothesis, we predicted that altering the expression of <italic>ahpC</italic> would modulate chlamydial redox status and trigger earlier or delayed secondary differentiation. To test this, we created <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression and knockdown strains. During <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, ROS levels were elevated, and the bacteria were sensitive to a broad set of peroxide stresses. Interestingly, we observed increased expression of EB-associated genes and concurrent higher production of EBs at an earlier time in the developmental cycle, indicating earlier secondary differentiation occurs under elevated oxidation conditions. In contrast, overexpression of AhpC created a resistant phenotype against oxidizing agents and delayed secondary differentiation. Together, these results indicate that redox potential is a critical factor in developmental cycle progression. For the first time, our study provides a mechanism of chlamydial secondary differentiation dependent on redox status.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All organisms that are exposed to oxygen are necessarily subjected to oxidative stress. Specifically, the process of metabolizing substrates in the presence of oxygen can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are toxic at high enough concentrations. Thus, from bacteria to humans, systems have evolved to mitigate the accumulation of ROS. At the same time, host defense mechanisms have evolved to leverage ROS production as a means of limiting pathogen growth and survival. Not surprisingly, pathogens have co-evolved to resist these defense mechanisms. For example, many pathogens possess a variety of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalases, glutathione peroxidases, and peroxiredoxins, that help them both subvert ROS-mediated immune system assaults and mitigate metabolic ROS byproducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Staerck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wan et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Chlamydia</italic> is an obligate intracellular bacterium that has significantly reduced its genome size and content in adapting to obligate host dependence. <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases and preventable infectious blindness, lacks homologs to catalases or glutathione peroxidases but does possess a homolog of Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC). AhpC is a 2-cys peroxiredoxin and is widely conserved in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">de Oliveira et al., 2021</xref>). Peroxiredoxins can scavenge hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, and organic hydroperoxides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Parsonage et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Poole &amp; Ellis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Seaver &amp; Imlay, 2001</xref>) and act as the primary scavenger in pathogens that lack both catalase and glutathione peroxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mastronicola et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Richard et al., 2011</xref>). Several studies from other bacterial systems have shown that AhpC has a significant role in ROS and RNI scavenging, virulence, and persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cosgrove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Oh &amp; Jeon, 2014</xref>), and deletion of AhpC results in elevated level of ROS within the bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Though <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is dependent on its host for most of its energy requirements, it has some metabolic activities, such as a partial TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gerard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Iliffe-Lee &amp; McClarty, 1999</xref>), which can be a possible source of intracellular ROS, to which the bacteria must adapt. There is a paucity of knowledge on how <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> modulates oxidative stress. However, some studies explored the effects of redox changes on chlamydial growth. Boncompain et al. reported that infection of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> induced the transient production of ROS by the host cell at a moderate level for the initial few hours of infection only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Boncompain et al., 2010</xref>). Another study also found a similar observation about ROS during infection, reporting that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> requires host-derived ROS for its growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Abdul-Sater et al., 2010</xref>). However, the key mechanisms <italic>Chlamydia</italic> employs to manage ROS-mediated stress have not been characterized.</p>
<p><italic>Chlamydia</italic> undergoes a complex developmental cycle that comprises two distinct morphological forms, the elementary body (EB) and reticulate body (RB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abdelrahman &amp; Belland, 2005</xref>). The EB is the smaller (∼0.3 µm), infectious, and nondividing form capable of infecting susceptible host cells. Once internalized into a host-derived vacuole termed an inclusion, the EB differentiates into the non-infectious, larger (∼1 µm), and replicating RB - this process is known as primary differentiation and represents the early phase of the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Clifton et al., 2005</xref>). RBs replicate within the inclusion in the midcycle phase using an asymmetric, MreB-dependent polarized division process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelrahman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ouellette et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ouellette et al., 2020</xref>). In the late phase of the developmental cycle, RBs asynchronously condense into EBs, and this process is termed secondary differentiation. Despite these well-defined differences between chlamydial morphological forms, how <italic>Chlamydia</italic> mechanistically differentiates between functional forms remains unclear.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, a recent study evaluated the redox potential of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and demonstrated that RBs are reduced, whereas EBs are oxidized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This is consistent with earlier studies that revealed differences in the crosslinking of outer membrane proteins and type III secretion-related proteins in chlamydial developmental forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Betts-Hampikian &amp; Fields, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Caldwell et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Everett &amp; Hatch, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these observations indicate that, during the developmental cycle, the redox potential of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is changing. However, whether redox changes in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> directly affect developmental cycle progression is not characterized.</p>

<p>Based on the difference between redox status of EBs and RBs, we hypothesized that changing redox conditions is a critical factor in the process of differentiation from one form to the other. We named this the “redox threshold hypothesis”. In this scenario, as soon as a given RB has crossed an oxidative threshold, the activity of critical proteins is modified to trigger differentiation to the EB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We used chlamydial transformants designed to overexpress or reduce AhpC levels to explore the effects of altered redox potential in chlamydial growth and development to test this hypothesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). This study establishes the role of AhpC as an antioxidant in <italic>Chlamydia,</italic> as demonstrated by its ability to counteract different peroxide stresses when overexpressed. Overexpression of AhpC had no negative effect on bacterial replication but delayed the differentiation of RBs to EBs. In contrast, under conditions of <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, the organism was highly sensitive to oxidizing conditions. Interestingly, this change in redox potential caused earlier expression of EB-associated (late) genes and production of EBs, leading to a shift in developmental cycle progression. This earlier activation of gene expression related to secondary differentiation in <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown was also observed when developmental cycle progression was blocked by penicillin treatment. Taken together these data provide mechanistic insight into chlamydial secondary differentiation and are the first to demonstrate redox-regulated differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p>

<title>Overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> has minimal impact on chlamydial growth</title>
<p>To study the effect of AhpC on chlamydial developmental cycle progression, we first generated an <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression (OE) strain using a plasmid encoding an anhydrotetracycline (aTc) inducible <italic>ahpC</italic> (untagged) and transformed it into a <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2 strain lacking its endogenous plasmid (-pL2). The same plasmid vector backbone (i.e., encoding mCherry in place of <italic>ahpC</italic>) was used as an empty vector control (EV). HeLa cells were infected with these transformants, and, at 10 hpi, expression of the construct was induced or not. Lacking an antibody against AhpC, overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> was validated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Here, an approximate 1-log increase in transcripts of <italic>ahpC</italic> was detected at 14 and 24 hpi in the induced strain in comparison to the uninduced strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) was performed at 14 and 24 hpi to examine the organisms’ morphology and overall inclusion growth. For IFA, individual bacteria were labeled with an anti-major outer membrane protein (MOMP) antibody, and DAPI was used to stain for DNA. IFA imaging revealed that there was no observable impact on the morphology of the EV control strain under the conditions tested. In contrast, we did note that overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> increased the overall inclusion area (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). We next quantified the total number of bacteria (i.e., both RBs and EBs) by measuring genomic DNA and observed a significant increase in gDNA levels at 24 hpi in response to increased <italic>ahpC</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Although inclusions were larger in area and contained more total bacteria as assessed by gDNA levels when overexpressing <italic>ahpC</italic>, recoverable inclusion forming units (IFUs: a measure of infectious EBs) were significantly lower under these conditions at 24 hpi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). However, by 48 hpi, the difference between the induced and uninduced conditions, although still reduced, was not statistically significant. The average number of IFUs was 5.30×10<sup>7</sup> and 1.56×10<sup>9</sup> for the <italic>ahpC</italic> OE strain in the uninduced condition at 24 and 48 hpi, respectively. For the EV strain, the average number of IFUs was 7.07×10<sup>6</sup> and 1.90×10<sup>8</sup> in the uninduced condition at 24 and 48 hpi, respectively. The inclusion forming unit analysis only measures viable EBs from a population, suggesting that AhpC overexpression skews the ratio of RBs to EBs. To test this, we calculated the ratio of IFUs to gDNA at 24 hpi, which revealed that the relative number of RBs is higher (and EBs lower) as a result of overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Overall, these data support the hypothesis that overexpressing <italic>ahpC</italic> delays production of infectious EBs.</p>

<title>Overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> confers resistance to peroxides in <italic>Chlamydia</italic></title>
<p>AhpC is an important peroxiredoxin involved in oxidative damage defense. Before determining whether increased <italic>ahpC</italic> expression impacts chlamydial sensitivity to oxidizing agents, we first sought to determine the response of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> to inorganic or organic hydroperoxides such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as well as peroxynitrite (PN). To do this, we evaluated the sensitivity of HeLa cells, infected or not with the empty vector (EV) control strain, to different concentrations of oxidizing agents using a viability assay. Both uninfected and EV-infected HeLa cells tolerated up to 1 mM oxidizing agents for 30 min (Fig. S1). Next, different concentrations (lower than 1 mM) of these oxidants were tested on wild-type (WT) <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2/434/Bu (<italic>Ctr</italic> L2). HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ctr</italic> L2 and, at 16 hpi, were exposed to different concentrations of exogenous oxidizing agents for 30 min only, before washing out the oxidizing agents and replacing the media. Samples for IFU and IFA assays were then collected at 24 hpi to assess effects of the oxidizing agents on growth of <italic>Ctr</italic> L2. 62.5 µM concentration of all three inorganic and organic peroxides had no appreciable effect on IFUs, and inclusion size and morphology also remained unaffected at this sublethal concentration. The concentrations of inorganic and organic peroxides that resulted in a decrease in IFUs to ∼50% of the untreated culture were 500 µM (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and 250 µM (CHP and TBHP), respectively, with a concurrent decrease in inclusion size. 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CHP, and TBHP caused &gt;90% reduction in IFUs and small inclusions. PN at 1 mM concentration was less effective than other oxidizing agents and showed only a ∼30% decline in IFUs compared to the untreated culture (Fig. S2).</p>
<p>To further examine the antioxidant functions of AhpC, we next exploited our <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression strain to explore its capacity to protect chlamydiae from oxidizing agents. Both <italic>ahpC</italic> OE and EV strains were used to infect HeLa cells and, at 10 hpi, expression of the constructs was induced or not with 1 nM aTc. At 16 hpi, infected cells were exposed to various concentrations of exogenous oxidizing agents for 30 min. At 24 hpi, IFU and IFA samples were collected to measure chlamydial growth and assess chlamydial morphology, respectively. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, and S3, the <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression strain showed increased resistance to all oxidants tested as the mean IFUs and the size of inclusions were greater than that of the uninduced but treated control. There was no change in bacterial growth and morphology in the case of 62.5 µM concentrations of oxidizing agents, which was anticipated since we determined this was a sublethal concentration. The resistant phenotype was more evident at the higher concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CHP, and TBHP. Overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> also contributed to higher resistance against PN. Conversely, the empty vector control strain behaved as expected (i.e., like WT) in the presence of oxidizing agents, with similar results observed in the presence or absence of aTc (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>, and S3). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the chlamydial AhpC possesses antioxidant activity, as expected, and that increased <italic>ahpC</italic> expression is protective for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> in the presence of increased oxidative stress.</p>

<title>Knockdown of <italic>ahpC</italic> negatively impacts chlamydial growth</title>
<p>To further define the function(s) of AhpC in the chlamydial developmental cycle, we used a novel dCas12-based CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) strategy adapted for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> by our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ouellette et al., 2021</xref>). We generated an <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain harboring the pBOMBL12CRia with a crRNA targeting the <italic>ahpC</italic> 5’ intergenic region and overlapping the ATG start site (plasmid designated as pL12CRia(<italic>ahpC</italic>)). We used a strain carrying a pL12CRia plasmid with a crRNA with no homology to any chlamydial sequence (i.e., non-targeting [NT]) to serve as a negative control. To confirm the knockdown of <italic>ahpC</italic>, RT-qPCR was employed. Here, we infected HeLa cells with the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown (<italic>ahpC</italic> KD) or NT strains and induced dCas12 expression or not at 10 hpi using 1 nM aTc. Nucleic acid samples were harvested at 14 hpi and 24 hpi. RT-qPCR analysis of the <italic>ahpC</italic> KD revealed approximately 90% reduction of <italic>ahpC</italic> transcripts compared to the uninduced control, thus confirming the knockdown of <italic>ahpC</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In the case of the NT control, there was no effect on <italic>ahpC</italic> transcripts. IFA of these strains revealed noticeably smaller inclusions after blocking expression of <italic>ahpC</italic> as compared to the uninduced sample or the NT conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We next measured total bacterial counts using genomic DNA. Surprisingly, even though inclusions were smaller during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, we observed higher gDNA levels at 14 hpi compared to the uninduced control, followed by only a small increase from 14 to 24 hpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In contrast, the uninduced strain showed a logarithmic increase in gDNA levels during this timeframe, similar to the NT strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). To further explore the effect of reduced <italic>ahpC</italic> transcripts in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, IFU assays were performed. IFU analysis exhibited severely reduced progeny (&gt;90%) in <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown compared to its respective uninduced control at both time points assessed (24 and 48 hpi) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). In contrast, the NT strain showed less than a 50% reduction after inducing dCas12 expression at these timepoints consistent with prior observations that dCas12 expression slightly delays developmental cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hatch &amp; Ouellette, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Reuter et al., 2023</xref>). The ratio of IFUs to gDNA at 24 hpi is significantly higher for the <italic>ahpC</italic> KD, suggesting a lower number of RBs in proportion to EBs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). Taken together, these analyses indicate that reducing <italic>ahpC</italic> levels and/or activity severely reduced chlamydial growth at 24 and 48 hpi.</p>

<p>To investigate whether <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown resulted in increased ROS levels in the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), the intracellular ROS levels were measured in infected cells in <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown conditions and compared to the uninduced control condition and uninfected cells. We used the cell-permeable, fluorogenic dye CellROX Deep Red to measure ROS levels. This dye remains non-fluorescent in a reduced state and exhibits bright fluorescence once oxidized by ROS. ROS generation was measured in uninfected and <italic>ahpC</italic> KD-infected HeLa cells at 24 and 48 hpi. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown resulted in significantly higher ROS than the uninfected or infected but uninduced samples at both 24 hpi and 48 hpi time points. We also performed live-cell microscopy for visualization of ROS generation in uninfected and <italic>ahpC</italic> KD-infected HeLa cells at 24 and 40 hpi. These microscopy images revealed that <italic>ahpC</italic> KD resulted in higher ROS in comparison to the uninduced and uninfected cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and S4). Importantly, the signal was associated with chlamydial inclusions and not the host cell, thus indicating that the measurements from <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> were from the bacteria.

<title>Knockdown of <italic>ahpC</italic> sensitizes <italic>Chlamydia</italic> to oxidizing agents</title>
<p>As overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> resulted in increased resistance to oxidizing agents, we next explored whether knockdown of <italic>ahpC</italic> resulted in increased sensitivity to such agents. As described above, <italic>ahpC</italic> KD and NT strains were used to infect HeLa cells and, at 10 hpi, expression of dCas12 was induced or not with 1 nM aTc. Considering that the <italic>ahpC</italic> KD already demonstrated reduced IFUs and inclusion sizes at 24 hpi, only sublethal concentrations (62.5 µM) of exogenous oxidizing agents were applied. At 24 hpi, IFA and IFU analyses were performed to quantify the effect of the oxidants on chlamydial growth in the absence of <italic>ahpC</italic> activity. Under conditions of <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, even sublethal concentrations (62.5 µM) of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CHP, or TBHP further reduced the inclusion size, and the IFU data revealed a decrease from &gt;90% to &lt;30% in comparison to the untreated control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, and S5). Reduced expression of <italic>ahpC</italic> also affected the survival of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> against peroxynitrite. Notably, there was no significant change in the NT control strain in the uninduced and induced samples in response to oxidizing agents as assessed by IFU and IFA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>, and S5).

<title>Complementation restores the growth and resistance to low levels of peroxide stress of the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain</title>
<p>To validate that the impaired growth, altered inclusion morphology, and enhanced sensitivity to peroxides were due to the decreased level/activity of AhpC during knockdown, we generated a complemented strain to restore <italic>ahpC</italic> expression during knockdown. For the construction of the <italic>ahpC</italic> complementing plasmid, the <italic>ahpC</italic> gene was cloned and transcriptionally fused 3’ to the dCas12 in the pL12CRia(<italic>ahpC</italic>) knockdown plasmid. Here, the complementing <italic>ahpC</italic> allele is also under the control of the aTc induced P<italic>tet</italic> promoter and is co-expressed with the aTc inducible dCas12. Consequently, the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown effect is ablated, and the observed phenotypes should be restored. After inducing <italic>dCas12-ahpC</italic> expression with aTc, the resultant strain was verified by RT-qPCR. Increased transcripts for <italic>ahpC</italic> were quantified under these conditions, indicating successful complementation of the knockdown effect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Of note, the <italic>ahpC</italic> transcript levels remained elevated in comparison to the uninduced control at the 24 hpi time point. After confirming this strain, we measured genomic DNA to quantify total bacteria and performed IFA and IFU assays to examine if complementation restored the phenotypes observed during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown. These assays revealed normal inclusion morphology, gDNA levels, and EB progeny production in the complemented strain, indicating successful complementation of the knockdown phenotype (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B, C</xref>, and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Of note, a C-terminal 6xHis tagged AhpC was not capable of complementing the knockdown phenotype (data not shown), indicating a requirement for a free C-terminus in the function of AhpC in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.

<p>We next assessed whether complementation of the knockdown phenotype could also restore the resistance to low levels of peroxide stress. As in previous experiments, a sublethal concentration of oxidizing agents was added for 30’ at 16 hpi after having induced <italic>dCas12-ahpC</italic> expression at 10 hpi. Consistent with the growth parameters (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B-D</xref>), the complemented strain showed wild-type responses in these conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>, and S5). These data indicate that the enhanced susceptibility of the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain to oxidizing agents was due to the reduced levels of <italic>ahpC</italic> and not an indirect effect of knockdown.</p>
<p>We predicted that the growth defects resulting from higher production of ROS during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown could be rescued by treating the <italic>ahpC</italic> KD with ROS scavengers. To test this prediction, we utilized two characterized ROS scavengers, DMTU (<italic>N,N’-dimethylthiourea</italic>) and α-tocopherol, which scavenge H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and peroxyl radical, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hollander-Czytko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kiffin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Walch et al., 2015</xref>). First, the effect of ROS scavengers on uninfected and infected HeLa cells was investigated using a viability assay. This assay revealed that 10 mM DMTU and 100 µM α-tocopherol had no adverse effects on uninfected or EV-infected HeLa cells (data not shown). These same concentrations were tested on WT <italic>Ctr</italic> L2 infected HeLa cells in untreated and 500 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated conditions to test the potency of these scavengers to rescue growth defects associated with this concentration of oxidizing agent. Scavengers were added at 9.5 hpi and washed away at 16 hpi - the time of addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the respective samples. At 16.5 hpi, after 3 wash steps, scavengers were added again with fresh media, and, at 24 hpi, bacterial growth and morphology were assessed using IFU and IFA assays. Neither scavenger had a significant impact on chlamydial morphology or infectious progeny. In the case of peroxide (500 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) treated samples, scavengers restored IFUs from ∼50% to ∼100%, and inclusion size was also recovered (Fig. S6A and B).</p>
<p>Next, the effect of the ROS scavengers under <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown conditions was assessed. In this experiment, scavengers were added at 9.5 hpi to provide the protective effect of scavengers before reducing the activity of <italic>ahpC</italic>. At 10 hpi, knockdown was induced or not with 1 nM aTc, and, at 14 hpi, scavengers were added again. At 24 hpi, IFU and IFA samples were collected to examine bacterial growth and morphology to assess the effect of ROS scavenging on the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown phenotype. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>, both ROS scavengers had a positive impact on restoring growth of the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain; inclusions were larger, and IFUs were increased from &lt;10% to &gt;90% in the presence of scavengers in the induced samples. These data provide compelling evidence that the adverse effects of <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown are due to increased ROS accumulation in this strain.</p>

<title>Chlamydial developmental cycle progression is altered by <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown/ overexpression</title>
<p>Whereas the overexpression of AhpC delayed overall developmental progression and was consistent with our hypothesis, the results with the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain appeared to refute our hypothesis given the apparent decrease in IFUs and smaller inclusion sizes after knockdown. To investigate the effects of changes in redox potential on chlamydial developmental cycle progression, we performed a transcriptional analysis of well-characterized late-cycle genes associated with secondary differentiation (<italic>hctA</italic>, <italic>hctB</italic>, <italic>glgA</italic>, <italic>tsp,</italic> and <italic>omcB</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barry et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Belland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brickman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gehre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Newhall, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Swoboda et al., 2023</xref>). In the uninduced samples, transcript levels of all the tested late genes were higher at 24 hpi compared to 14 hpi, indicating their normal expression during the late stage of the developmental cycle. In comparison to the uninduced control, under conditions of <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, significantly higher expression of <italic>hctA</italic>, <italic>hctB</italic>, <italic>omcB, tsp,</italic> and <italic>glgA</italic> was observed at the mid-developmental cycle timepoint of 14 hpi (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). At 24 hpi, expression of these genes was comparable between the uninduced and induced conditions in the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain. We subsequently performed RNA sequencing from the uninduced and induced <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain at 14 hpi. Experimental conditions were same as described for the RT-qPCR study, and samples were processed as mentioned in materials and methods. RNA-seq results were statistically analyzed by the UNMC Bioinformatics Core facility (Table S2). We further categorized these genes based on significant difference (p&lt;0.05) and fold-change (≥1.5). Using these stringent parameters, we identified 161 up-regulated genes and 145 down-regulated genes in the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown conditions (Table S2). Here, we observed a global increase in late gene transcripts at this mid-developmental cycle timepoint (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), indicating that increased oxidation results in earlier increases in late gene transcripts. In contrast, the complementation strain showed no increase in the expression of these tested late genes at 14 hpi, and <italic>tsp</italic> and <italic>glgA</italic> transcripts were reduced (Fig. S7A).

<p>Given the increase in late gene expression during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown at an earlier time point in the developmental cycle than normal, we reasoned that the increase in oxidizing conditions might prematurely trigger secondary differentiation and EB production. However, complicating such an analysis is that fewer RBs are present to convert to EBs, which would result in overall lower IFU yields as we had measured at 24 and 48 hpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Nonetheless, to assess EB production more rigorously at earlier time points in the developmental cycle, we performed a growth curve analysis to precisely measure IFUs at two-hour intervals from 16 to 24 hpi. HeLa cells were infected, and knockdown was induced or not at 10 hpi with 1 nM aTc. At the indicated time points, IFU samples were collected and quantified. Consistent with our prediction, this experiment revealed higher IFUs (i.e., EBs) at 16 and 18 hpi during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown compared to the uninduced samples (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). This difference was statistically significant at 18 hpi. However, further EB production was stalled, with the uninduced strain continuing to produce EBs such that, by 24 hpi, there were significantly higher EB yields under these conditions (as noted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These data show that the phenotypic consequence of higher expression at 14 hpi of genes functionally related to EBs is the concomitant earlier production of EBs. These data underscore that reduced activity of <italic>ahpC</italic> causes earlier secondary differentiation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>.</p>

However, the bacteria continue to grow in size resulting in aberrantly enlarged RBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barbour et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Matsumoto &amp; Manire, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ouellette et al., 2012</xref>), in which EB-related genes are not transcribed and production of EBs is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ouellette et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Panzetta et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine this, we generated an <italic>ahpC</italic> KD strain with spectinomycin resistance (<italic>ahpC</italic> KD-spec) and validated its phenotype as being the same as the penicillin-resistant <italic>ahpC</italic> KD strain. This new strain, <italic>ahpC</italic> KD-spec, was used to infect HeLa cells, and knockdown was induced or not at 10 hpi with 1 nM aTc. At the same time, samples were treated or not with 1 unit per mL of penicillin (Pen). RNA samples were harvested at 16 and 24 hpi and processed for RT-qPCR (Fig. S8B-D). IFA controls from these different conditions demonstrated the expected phenotypes (Fig. S8A). For example, Pen treatment caused aberrantly enlarged RBs, irrespective of <italic>ahpC</italic> KD, whereas <italic>ahpC</italic> KD itself caused smaller inclusions. Similarly, <italic>ahpC</italic> KD resulted in reduced <italic>ahpC</italic> transcripts in the induced conditions irrespective of the presence of Pen (Fig. S8B). Next, we quantified transcript levels for the late genes <italic>hctA</italic> and <italic>hctB</italic> in these different conditions (Fig. S8C and D). As expected, in the uninduced and untreated condition, both transcripts had higher expression at 24 hpi, indicating their regular developmental expression during the late stage of the developmental cycle. Consistent with prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ouellette et al., 2006</xref>), levels of these genes in uninduced + Pen conditions was low. As we previously noted (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>), the transcripts of <italic>hctA</italic> and <italic>hctB</italic> are higher in the induced than uninduced samples at 16 hpi in the absence of Pen. Interestingly, in the induced + Pen condition, these genes had higher expression at 24 hpi than the uninduced + Pen control. At 16 hpi, their expression was either higher or similar between both samples (i.e., induced + Pen and uninduced + Pen). Collectively, these data support our observation that <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown activates the transcription of late-cycle genes – even under conditions where developmental cycle progression is blocked.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many bacteria use redox sensing as a mechanism to control gene expression and subsequent morphologic transitions. Typically, these organisms use a redox-sensitive transcription factor, such as OxyR to sense these changes in redox conditions and alter gene expression appropriately. For example, in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, OxyR is involved in regulation of cellular metabolism, in addition to oxidative stress defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, redox has been reported as a regulator of metabolism and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hartl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Narayanan et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the ability of bacteria to assess oxidative stress (imbalanced level of ROS) and to make physiological adjustments by altering gene expression patterns that favor their growth, and development is critical for their survival.</p>
<p>ROS generation is an inevitable condition for pathogens growing in aerobic conditions, and resistance against oxidative stress is a key survival mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fang, 2011</xref>). Hence, pathogens have evolved detoxifying proteins, such as peroxiredoxins, to eliminate ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dip et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). AhpC has been reported to have a crucial role in bacterial physiology, survival, and virulence by scavenging ROS and RNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cosgrove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Loprasert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Oh &amp; Jeon, 2014</xref>). In the process of detoxification of peroxides and peroxynitrite, AhpC is converted into an oxidized dimer, requiring alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpF or AhpD to regenerate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Koshkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Poole &amp; Ellis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> encodes AhpC (Ct603/CTL0866) but lacks any annotated homologs of AhpF or AhpD. Therefore, it remains an open question how AhpC activity is regulated. Some studies have mentioned <italic>ahpC</italic> as an iron-responsive gene in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brinkworth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pokorzynski et al., 2019</xref>), but there is no detailed investigation to date about the role of this crucial antioxidant in the growth and development of <italic>Chlamydia.</italic> Our study is the first to characterize a function of AhpC in chlamydial biology.</p>
<p>An essential aspect of the scavenging activity of AhpC for many bacterial pathogens in which it has been studied is that it works best with endogenous (i.e., low) levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. These bacteria, such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic>, encode catalases, which have high Km for hydrogen peroxide that serve a predominant role in scavenging exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cosgrove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wan et al., 2021</xref>). Catalases can detoxify H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at high levels (millimolar levels) and are crucial in responding to external H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mishra &amp; Imlay, 2012</xref>). The <italic>ahpC</italic> mutants in these bacteria become sensitive to organic peroxides but resistant to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> due to higher catalase activity as a compensatory response to the lack of AhpC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Antelmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mongkolsuk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ochsner et al., 2000</xref>). Further, simultaneous mutations in both catalase and <italic>ahpC</italic> displayed drastically enhanced sensitivity to all oxidizing agents tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cosgrove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ezraty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Seaver &amp; Imlay, 2001</xref>). <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> does not encode a catalase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boncompain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rusconi &amp; Greub, 2013</xref>), and hypersensitivity of <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown to both inorganic and organic peroxides indicates the absence of catalase and establishes that AhpC is the primary scavenger of ROS in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. Contrary to previous studies, we did not observe significant effects of PN with altered AhpC expression. One possible explanation may be our study’s concentration (1 mM) of PN. Higher concentrations of PN could not be used due to toxic effects on the host cell (data not shown). The other possibility may be the presence of some other unknown mechanism(s) to detoxify PN. For example, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> also encodes a superoxide dismutase (SOD) that may prevent the accumulation of the necessary precursors that are needed for PN production. We are currently investigating the function of the chlamydial SOD enzyme.</p>
<p>Resistance to different oxidants as a result of overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and S3) is consistent with studies in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sherman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zuo et al., 2014</xref>), signifying that AhpC is the principal defense mechanism against oxidative stress in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. During <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, the attenuated activity of AhpC severely affected the growth of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Notably, the observed morphology of inclusions during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown is strikingly similar to <italic>Chlamydia</italic> treated with a high concentration (1 mM) of oxidizing agents used (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and Fig S2), suggesting both conditions result in increased oxidative stress to the organism. This was further supported by the increased sensitivity of <italic>ahpC</italic> KD to sublethal concentrations of oxidants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and S4), consistent with previous data from other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cosgrove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Seaver &amp; Imlay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Storz et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>ahpC</italic> KD, the ROS level was dramatically higher (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and S4), similar to previous studies in other bacterial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Further, the addition of ROS scavengers to the culture medium rescued the negative phenotypes associated with <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). This strongly suggests that, in the absence of AhpC, higher amounts of reactive oxygen species accumulate in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and that the negative impact on growth during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown is due to highly oxidized conditions in the organism. Moreover, for the complete restoration of inclusion size, multiple doses of scavengers were required throughout the experiment, further emphasizing that the internal chlamydial environment is oxidized and/or susceptible to oxidation in the absence of AhpC. These findings suggest that AhpC in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is indispensable, having a functional role even more extensive than previously reported in other bacteria.</p>
<p>In further support of this observation, we noticed upregulated transcripts of late-cycle genes such as <italic>hctA</italic>, <italic>hctB</italic>, <italic>glgA, omcA, omcB</italic>, <italic>dsbA</italic>, and <italic>tsp</italic> at an earlier time (14 hpi) in the chlamydial developmental cycle as a result of reduced AhpC activity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Notably, in the developmental cycle of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic>, only RBs are present at 14 hpi, and secondary differentiation starts after 16 hpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abdelrahman &amp; Belland, 2005</xref>). Expression of most of the late-cycle genes occurs after this time in the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Belland et al., 2003</xref>). These late-cycle genes are well characterized for their association with EBs. The <italic>hctA</italic> and <italic>hctB</italic> genes encode histone-like proteins responsible for chromosomal condensation during the differentiation of RBs into EBs. The <italic>hctA</italic> gene is among the first to be transcribed in the late stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chiarelli et al., 2020</xref>). Tsp is a periplasmic protease thought to be crucial in the degradation of RB-specific periplasmic proteins during secondary differentiation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Swoboda et al., 2023</xref>). OmcA, OmcB, and DsbA are responsible for the rigid cell wall and osmotic stability of the EBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Christensen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hatch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Newhall, 1987</xref>). GlgA is key enzyme for glycogen accumulation in the inclusion lumen at late stages of the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gehre et al., 2016</xref>). One crucial point to consider is the redox status of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, 14 hpi is the time when reduced RBs predominate with virtually no oxidized EBs detectable. However, we established that <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown shifts the redox status of the bacteria towards oxidation. Hence, the earlier and significantly higher detection of transcripts for these late-cycle genes indicate earlier secondary differentiation in the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown. Importantly, <italic>ahpC</italic> complementation during knockdown restored the regular developmental expression of these late-cycle genes, further supporting that this phenotype was due to the highly oxidized conditions created by reduced AhpC activity. The conclusion of these data is that AhpC levels, and presumably activity, have a direct effect on secondary differentiation.</p>
<p>Secondary differentiation (differentiation from RBs to EBs) is an essential step for chlamydial growth and survival, but there is a dearth of information regarding the mechanisms of its regulation. EBs and RBs have significantly different proteomic repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Skipp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Skipp et al., 2016</xref>), and our group has identified critical functions for the cytoplasmic ClpXP and ClpCP and periplasmic Tsp proteases during secondary differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Swoboda et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wood et al., 2022</xref>).The <italic>tsp</italic> gene, in addition to another late-cycle gene, <italic>hctB</italic>, is transcriptionally regulated by sigma factor 28 (<sup>28</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Douglas &amp; Hatch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hatch &amp; Ouellette, 2023</xref>). Another sigma factor, <sup>54</sup> has been linked to regulation of outer membrane components, type III secretion system components, and other genes typically expressed late in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hatch &amp; Ouellette, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Soules et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to the two minor sigma factors, <sup>28</sup> and <sup>54</sup>, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> encodes one major sigma factor, <sup>66</sup>, which is transcriptionally regulated by the relative levels of RsbV1 (antagonist) and RsbW (anti-sigma factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). This Rsb system senses ATP availability and has been proposed to regulate <sup>66</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). A related study from Soules et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Soules et al., 2020</xref>) showed that TCA intermediates act as ligands for RsbU, thereby linking the Rsb system to the TCA cycle and ATP synthesis. Collectively, these data show that post-translational mechanisms drive secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. However, no definitive “switch” that triggers this step has been identified.</p>
<p>How might increasing oxidation regulate secondary differentiation? <italic>Chlamydia</italic> lacks an identifiable ortholog of OxyR so some other mechanism must be employed. We speculate that increasing ROS production from the metabolic activity of the RB will overcome the innate and stochastic activity of AhpC to detoxify ROS. This could either directly alter the activity of specific proteins or lead to the accumulation of damaged proteins that in turn triggers secondary differentiation. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. We propose a simple model to explain this (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). As secondary differentiation is asynchronous and RBs divide through an asymmetric budding mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ouellette et al., 2020</xref>), AhpC as well as proteins impacted by ROS levels are unevenly distributed between mother and daughter cell. This difference will lead some RBs to breach an oxidative threshold sooner, allowing activation of late genes and secondary differentiation earlier than other RBs. Consistent with this, the higher expression of genes functionally related to EBs and EB production during <italic>ahpC</italic> KD at an early stage of the chlamydial developmental cycle indicates earlier secondary differentiation as an outcome of diminished activity of <italic>ahpC</italic> in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. Consequently, increased late gene transcription should have the phenotypic effect of causing earlier production of EBs. Indeed, we quantified more IFUs in the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown at 16 and 18 hpi compared to the uninduced control condition. During <italic>ahpC</italic> KD, higher amounts of ROS accumulation in the bacterium create highly oxidized conditions. In contrast, <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression scavenges ROS at a greater level leading to a more reducing environment. For the AhpC overexpression strain, the expression of late-cycle genes in the induced conditions compared to the uninduced control at 24 hpi is significantly lower with reduced production of EBs. These data support our hypothesis that the developmental cycle is delayed in these conditions with a concomitant delay in achieving the oxidative threshold, thus allowing RBs to continue to divide before committing to secondary differentiation. Taken together, our data directly link oxidation state and secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Ongoing studies are focused on characterizing redox-sensitive chlamydial proteins to understand which specific factors drive the shift from RBs to EBs (or EBs to RBs) in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>.</p>

<p>Chlamydial transformations were performed using a protocol described previously, with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mueller et al., 2017</xref>). One day before transformation, 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> McCoy cells were seeded in one 6-well plate, and two wells were used per plasmid transformation. Briefly, for each well of the 6-well plate, 2 µg of sequenced verified plasmids were incubated with 2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 without plasmid (-pL2) EBs in 50 µL Tris-CaCl<sub>2</sub> (10 mM Tris, 50 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 30 min. McCoy cells were washed with 2 mL Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Gibco), and 1 mL HBSS was added back into each well. 1 mL of HBSS was added to each transformant mixture, and one well of a 6-well plate was infected using this transformation solution. Cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 15 min at room temperature followed by 15 min incubation at 37°C. HBSS was aspirated and replaced with antibiotic-free DMEM. At 8 hpi, 1 µg/mL of cycloheximide and 1 or 2 U/mL of penicillin G or 500 μg/mL spectinomycin were added to the culture media. The infection was passaged every 48 h until a population of penicillin, or spectinomycin resistant, green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> was established. The chlamydial transformants were then serially diluted to isolate clonal populations. These isolated populations were further expanded and frozen at - 80°C in a sucrose phosphate solution (2SP).

DNA-free RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using random nonamers (N9; NEB) and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA samples were diluted 10-fold with molecular biology-grade water and stored at -80°C. A total of 2.5 µL of each diluted cDNA sample was used per well of a 96-well qPCR plate. For each of three biological replicates, each sample was analyzed in triplicate on a QuantStudio 3 system (Applied Biosystems/Thermo Fisher) using the standard amplification cycle with melting curve analysis. For gDNA, one well of a 6-well plate per condition was scraped in 500 μL DPBS, split in half (i.e., 250 μL), and frozen at -80°C. Each sample was then thawed and frozen twice more for a total of three freeze/thaw cycles, and gDNA was extracted using the DNeasy DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. The isolated gDNA was quantified and diluted down to 5 ng/mL prior to use in quantitative PCR (qPCR). A total of 2.5 µL of each diluted gDNA sample was mixed with 10 µL of PowerUp SYBR green master mix in a 96-well qPCR plate and was analyzed on a QuantStudio 3 system (Applied Biosystems). Each sample from each biological replicate was tested in triplicate. For each primer set used, a standard curve of gDNA was generated against purified <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2 genomic DNA, and the cDNA levels were normalized to gDNA levels or 16S rRNA for analysis. All experiments were performed three times for three biological replicates. At the same time, morphological differences were monitored in the IFA control, with samples fixed with methanol at the time of harvesting of RNA/gDNA. Staining and imaging were performed as described above.</p>

<title>Enrichment, library preparation, and statistical analyses of RNA-sequencing samples</title>
<p>Three biological replicates were prepared and processed for RNA isolation as mentioned above. Enrichment of microbial RNA was done using MICROB<italic>Enrich</italic> and MICROB<italic>Express</italic> (Invitrogen/ThermoFisher) kits as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were aliquoted, stored at -80°C and submitted to the UNMC Genomics Core. Before library preparation, quality control (QC) was done using Nanodrop and Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical). Final libraries were quantified using Qubit DS DNA HS Assay reagents in Qubit Fluro meter (Life Technologies), and the size of the libraries was measured via Fragment Analyzer. Individual RNA-seq libraries were prepared using 400 ng of total RNA by Illumina Ribo-Zero plus Microbiome (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA) and were multiplexed and subjected to 100 bp paired read sequencing to generate &gt;20 million pairs of reads per sample using Midoutput NextSeq 300 cycle kit by the UNMC Genomics Core facility (Table S2). The original fastq format reads were trimmed by fqtrim tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/fqtrim">https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/fqtrim</ext-link>) to remove adapters, terminal unknown bases (Ns), and low quality 3’ regions (Phred score &lt; 30). The trimmed fastq files were processed by FastQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Andrews, 2010</xref>). <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> 434/Bu bacterial reference genome and annotation files were downloaded from Ensembl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bacteria.ensembl.org/Chlamydia_trachomatis_434_bu/Info/Index">http://bacteria.ensembl.org/Chlamydia_trachomatis_434_bu/Info/Index</ext-link>). Sequencing data were analyzed by the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Core (BSBC). The false discovery rate (FDR) and Bonferroni adjusted p values were provided to adjust for multiple-testing problem. Fold changes were calculated from the GLM, which corrects for differences in library size between the samples and the effects of confounding factors. The trimmed fastq files were mapped to <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> 434/Bu by CLC Genomics Workbench 23 for RNA-seq analyses.</p>

<title>Viability assay</title>
<p>Cell viability assays were performed using PrestoBlue (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher). HeLa cells were seeded in 96 well plates and were infected or not with the indicated chlamydial strains (e.g., pBOMBDC.ev). Samples were treated or not as per the experimental parameters (e.g., different concentrations of oxidizing agents or scavengers). Medium without cells was used as the blank control. At the end point, 10% PrestoBlue (v/v) was added in the wells and incubated at 37°C for 30 min while protecting the plate from light. Fluorescence was read at excitation 560 nm and emission 590 nm using an Infinite M200 Pro (Tecan). The treated values were expressed as a percentage of the untreated values, which was considered as 100%. All experiments were performed three times for three biological replicates.</p>

<title>Oxidizing agents’ susceptibility testing</title>
<p>Susceptibility of host cells and chlamydiae to different oxidizing agents was tested in HeLa cells infected with density gradient-purified <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> 434/Bu EBs or <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> transformants. For <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> transformants, expression of the construct was induced or not with 1 nM aTc at 10 hpi. At 16 hpi, different concentrations of oxidizing agents were added, and samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. These samples were washed three times with HBSS, fresh DMEM media was added in the wells, and cultures were allowed to grow until 24 hpi. At 24 hpi, inclusion forming unit assays and immunofluorescence analysis were performed as described above.</p>

<title>ROS scavenging by chemical compounds</title>
<p>The scavenging capacity of different ROS scavengers was tested using HeLa cells infected with <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> 434/Bu EBs or the <italic>ahpC</italic> KD strain. To examine the protective effect of scavengers in the absence or presence of oxidative stress, <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> 434/Bu EBs infected HeLa cells were used. In these samples, scavengers were added or not at 10 hpi in respective wells. At 16 hpi, wells were washed three times with HBSS, and fresh DMEM containing 500 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or not was added. After 30 min, wells were washed three times with HBSS and fresh DMEM containing scavengers or not was added back in the respective wells, which were incubated until 24 hpi prior to collecting samples for IFU assay and IFA analysis. The effect of these scavengers was further tested in <italic>ahpC</italic> KD. HeLa cells were infected with <italic>ahpC</italic> KD, scavengers were added or not at 9.5 hpi before induction at 10 hpi with 1 nM aTc. At 14 hpi, scavengers were added again in the respective wells, and, at 24 hpi, samples were collected for IFU assay and IFA.</p>

<p>In this <bold>valuable</bold> study, the authors propose a model wherein the bacterial redox state plays a crucial role in the differentiation of Chlamydia trachomatis into elementary and reticulate bodies. They provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence to argue that a highly oxidising environment favours the formation of elementary bodies while a reducing condition slows down development. Overall, the study <bold>convincingly</bold> demonstrates that Chlamydial redox states play a role in differentiation, an observation that may have implications for the study of other bacterial systems.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chlamydia spp. has a biphasic developmental cycle consisting of an extracellular, infectious form called an elementary body (EB) and an intracellular, replicative form known as a reticular body (RB). The structural stability of EBs is maintained by extensive cross linking of outer membrane proteins while the outer membrane proteins of RBs are in a reduced state. The overall redox state of EBs is more oxidized than RBs. The authors propose that redox state may be a controlling factor in the developmental cycle. To test this, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (ahpC) was overexpressed or knocked down to examine effects on developmental gene expression. KD of ahpC induced increased expression of EB-specific genes and accelerated EB production. Conversely, overexpression of phpC delayed differentiation to EBs. The results suggest that chlamydial redox state may play a role in differentiation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Uses modern genetic tools to explore the difficult area of temporal gene expression throughout the chlamydial developmental cycle.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The environmental signals triggering ahpC expression/activity are not determined.</p>

<p>The factors that influence the differentiation of EBs and RBs during Chlamydial development are not clearly understood. A previous study had shown a redox oscillation during the Chlamydial developmental cycle. Based on this observation, the authors hypothesize that the bacterial redox state may play a role in regulating the differentiation in Chlamydia. To test their hypothesis, they make knock-down and overexpression strains of the major ROS regulator, ahpC. They show that the knock-down of ahpC leads to a significant increase in ROS levels leading to an increase in the production of elementary bodies and overexpression leads to a decrease in EB production likely caused by a decrease in oxidation. From their observations, they present an interesting model wherein an increase in oxidation favors the production of EBs.</p>

<p>The environmental signals triggering <italic>ahpC</italic> expression/activity are not determined.</p>
<p>Thank you for your comments. Our data and those of others have shown that <italic>ahpC</italic> is expressed as a mid-developmental cycle gene (i.e., when RBs predominate in the population). This is true of most chlamydial genes, and the factors that determine developmental expression are not fully understood. As we noted in the Discussion, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> lacks AhpF/D orthologs, so it is not clear how AhpC activity is regulated. Related to determining environmental signals that trigger activity of AhpC, then this is a non-trivial issue in an obligate intracellular bacterium. Our assumption is that AhpC is constitutively active and that the increasing metabolic production of ROS eventually overcomes the innate (and stochastic) activity of AhpC to handle it, hence the threshold hypothesis. Importantly, the stochasticity is consistent with what we know about secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. We have tried to clarify these points in the Discussion.</p>

<p>The factors that influence the differentiation of EBs and RBs during Chlamydial development are not clearly understood. A previous study had shown a redox oscillation during the Chlamydial developmental cycle. Based on this observation, the authors hypothesize that the bacterial redox state may play a role in regulating the differentiation in Chlamydia. To test their hypothesis, they make knock-down and overexpression strains of the major ROS regulator, ahpC. They show that the knock-down of ahpC leads to a significant increase in ROS levels leading to an increase in the production of elementary bodies and overexpression leads to a decrease in EB production likely caused by a decrease in oxidation. From their observations, they present an interesting model wherein an increase in oxidation favors the production of EBs.</p>
<p>Major concern:</p>
<p>In the absence of proper redox potential measurements, it is not clear if what they observe is a general oxidative stress response, especially when the knock-down of <italic>ahpC</italic> leads to a significant increase in ROS levels. Direct redox potential measurement in the <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression and knock-down cells is required to support the model. This can be done using the roGFP-based measurements mentioned in the Wang et al. 2014 study cited by the authors.</p>

<p>Thank you for this suggestion. It is definitely something that we are looking to implement. However, our current vectors don’t allow for roGFP2 in combination with inducible expression of a gene of interest. We will need to completely redesign our vectors, and, in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, the validation of such new vectors together with <italic>ahpC</italic> OE or KD may literally take a year or longer.</p>
<p>In lieu of this, we used the CellRox redox reactive dye to image live chlamydiae during normal growth or <italic>ahpC</italic> KD. During <italic>ahpC</italic> KD, these organisms are clearly much brighter than the control, uninduced conditions. These data are included as new Figure 5 to go along with the data we previously reported from the plate reader measurements. These data also clearly indicate that the readings we observed are from <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and not the host cell.</p>
<p>As far as a general oxidative stress response, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> lacks any transcriptional regulators akin to OxyR. The response we’ve measured, earlier expression of genes associated with secondary differentiation, would be an odd stress response not consistent with a focused program to respond to oxidative stress. We added new RNAseq data further showing this effect of a global earlier increase in late gene transcripts.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study reports clearly on the role of the AhpC protein as an antioxidant factor in Chlamydia trachomatis and speculates on the role of AhpC as an indirect regulator of developmental transcription induced by redox stress in this differentiating obligate intracellular bacterium.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The question posed and the concluding model about redox-dependent differentiation in chlamydia is interesting and highly relevant. This work fits with other propositions in which redox changes have been reported during bacterial developmental cycles, potentially as triggers, but have not been cited (examples PMID: 2865432, PMID: 32090198, PMID: 26063575). Here, AhpC over-expression is shown to protect Chlamydia towards redox stress imposed by H2O2, CHP, TBHP, and PN, while CRISPRi-mediated depletion of AhpC curbed intracellular replication and resulted in increased ROS levels and sensitivity to oxidizing agents. Importantly, the addition of ROS scavengers mitigated the growth defect caused by AhpC depletion. These results clearly establish the role of AhpC affects the redox state and growth in Ct (with the complicated KO genetics and complementation that are very nicely done).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, with respect to the most important implication and claims of this work, the role of redox in controlling the chlamydial developmental cycle rather than simply being a correlation/passenger effect, I am less convinced about the impact of this work. First, the study is largely observational and does not resolve how this redox control of the cell cycle could be achieved, whereas in the case of _Caulobacte_r, a clear molecular link between DNA replication and redox has been proposed. How would progressive oxidation in RBs eventually trigger the secondary developmental genes to induce EB differentiation? Is there an OxyR homolog that could elicit this change and why would the oxidation stress in RBs gradually accumulate during growth despite the presence of AhpC? In other words, the role of AhpC is simply to delay or dampen the redox stress response until the trigger kicks in, again, what is the trigger? Is this caused by increasing oxidative respiration of RBs in the inclusion? But what determines the redox threshold?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. As the reviewer notes, our work clearly demonstrates that AhpC acts as an antioxidant in <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis.</italic> Further, we have shown that transcription of the late cycle genes is altered upon altered activity of AhpC, which acts as a proof of concept that redox is (one of) the key factor(s) controlling developmental cycle progression in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Our new RNAseq data indicate that a broad swath of well characterized late genes is activated, which contradicts the argument that what we’ve measured is a stress response (unless activation of late genes in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is generally a stress response (not the case based on other models of stress) – in which case we would not be able to differentiate between these effects). We hypothesize that ROS production from the metabolic activities of RBs serves as a signal to trigger secondary differentiation from RBs to EBs. How this exact threshold is determined is currently unknown as <italic>Chlamydia</italic> does not have any annotated homolog for OxyR. It is beyond the scope of the present manuscript to identify and then characterize what specific factor(s) control(s) this response. We fully anticipate that multiple factors are likely impacted by increasing oxidation, so dissecting the exact contributions of any one factor will represent (a) potential separate manuscript(s). Nonetheless, this remains an overarching goal of the lab yet remains challenging given the obligate intracellular nature of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Strategies that would work in a model system, like <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, that can be grown in axenic media are not easily implemented in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p>
<p>As we noted above in another response, <italic>ahpC</italic> is transcribed as a mid-cycle gene with a peak of transcription corresponding to the RB phase of growth. We hypothesize that the gradual accumulation of ROS from metabolic activity will eventually supercede the ability of AhpC to detoxify it. This would result in any given RB asynchronously and stochastically passing this threshold (and triggering EB formation), which is consistent with what we know about secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p>

<p>I also find the experiment with Pen treatment to have little predictive power. The fact that transcription just proceeds when division is blocked is not unprecedented. This also happens during the Caulobacter cell cycle when FtsZ is depleted for most developmental genes, except for those that are activated upon completion of the asymmetric cell division and that is dependent on the completion of compartmentalization. This is a smaller subset of developmental genes in caulobacter, but if there is a similar subset that depends on division on chlamydia and if these are affected by redox as well, then the argument about the interplay between developmental transcription and redox becomes much stronger and the link more intriguing. Another possibility to strengthen the study is to show that redox-regulated genes are under the direct control of chlamydial developmental regulators such as Euo, HctA, or others and at least show dual regulation by these inputs -perhaps the feed occurs through the same path.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comparisons to other model systems are generally of limited value with <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. All chlamydial cell division genes are mid-cycle (RB-specific) genes, just like <italic>ahpC</italic>. There is no evidence of a redox-responsive transcription factor (whether EUO, HctA, or another) that activates or represses a subset of genes in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Similarly, there is no evidence that redox directly and specifically impacts transcription of cell division genes based on our new RNAseq data. The types of experiments suggested are not easily implemented in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, but we would certainly like to be able to do them.</p>
<p>As it pertains to penicillin specifically, we and others have shown that treating chlamydiae with Pen blocks secondary differentiation (meaning late genes are not transcribed). Effectively, Pen treatment freezes the organism in an RB state with continued transcription of RB genes. What we have shown is that, even during Pen treatment (which blocks late gene transcription), <italic>ahpC</italic> KD can overcome this block, which shows that elevated oxidation is able to trigger late gene expression even when the organisms are phenotypically blocked from progressing to EBs. The comparison from our perspective to <italic>Caulobacter</italic> is of limited value.</p>

<p>This redox-transcription shortcoming is also reflected in the discussion where most are about the effects and molecular mitigation of redox stress in various systems, but there is little discussion on its link with developmental transcription in bacteria in general and chlamydia.</p>

<p>We have edited the Discussion to include a broader description of the results and included additional citations as suggested by the reviewer (PMID: 32090198, PMID: 26063575). However, we found one suggested article (PMID: 2865432) is not relevant to our study, so we didn’t cite it in our present manuscript. There may have been a typo, so feel free to provide us the correct PMID that can be cited.</p>
