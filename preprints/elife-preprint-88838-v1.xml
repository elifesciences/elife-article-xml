<title>Abstract</title><p>The basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain center of emotional expression, contributes to acoustic communication by first interpreting the meaning of social sounds in the context of the listener’s internal state, then organizing the appropriate behavioral responses. We propose that modulatory neurochemicals such as acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) provide internal-state signals to the BLA while an animal listens to social vocalizations. We tested this in a vocal playback experiment utilizing highly affective vocal sequences associated with either mating or restraint, then sampled and analyzed fluids within the BLA for a broad range of neurochemicals and observed behavioral responses of male and female mice. In male mice, playback of restraint vocalizations increased ACh release and usually decreased DA release, while playback of mating sequences evoked the opposite neurochemical release patterns. In non-estrus female mice, patterns of ACh and DA release with mating playback were similar to males. Estrus females, however, showed increased ACh, associated with vigilance, as well as increased DA, associated with reward-seeking. Across these groups, increased ACh concentration was correlated with an increase in an aversive behavior. These neurochemical release patterns and several behavioral responses depended on a single prior experience with the mating and restraint behaviors. Our results support a model in which ACh and DA provide contextual information to sound analyzing BLA neurons that modulate their output to downstream brain regions controlling behavioral responses to social vocalizations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In social interactions utilizing vocal communication signals, an animal receives and analyzes acoustic information, compares it with previous experiences, identifies the salience and valence of such information, and responds with appropriate behaviors. These integrated functions depend on brain circuits that include the amygdala, a region located within the temporal lobe that is recognized to play a role in orchestrating responses to salient sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">J. LeDoux, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">J. E. LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sah et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The basolateral amygdala (BLA) receives auditory input from thalamus and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">J. LeDoux et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Romanski &amp; LeDoux, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Shi &amp; Cassell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tsukano et al., 2019</xref>) and processes vocal and other acoustic information in a context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gadziola et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">J. M. S. Grimsley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Matsumoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wenstrup et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wiethoff et al., 2009</xref>). Contextual information may arise from inputs associated with other sensory modalities (e.g., somatic sensation or olfaction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">J. M. S. Grimsley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lanuza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">McDonald, 1998</xref>), but in other cases the contextual information is associated with an animal’s internal state. Sources of internal state cues to BLA include brain circuits involving modulatory neurochemicals (i.e., neuromodulators), known to affect the processing of sensory signals, thus shaping attention, emotion, and goal-directed behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bargmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Likhtik &amp; Johansen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schofield &amp; Hurley, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>This study investigates contextual information provided by neuromodulatory inputs to the BLA in response to vocal communication signals. Our hypothesis is that these salient vocalizations elicit distinct patterns of neuromodulator release into the BLA, by which they shape the processing of subsequent meaningful sensory information. We further hypothesize that these neuromodulatory patterns may depend on longer term processes that are critical to vocal communication: to experience with these behaviors and the accompanying vocalizations, to sex, and to estrous stage in females. To test these hypotheses, we conducted playback experiments in a mouse model to understand the behavioral and neuromodulator responses to salient vocalizations associated with very different behavioral states.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To study how vocalizations affect behaviors and release of neurochemicals within BLA, we first developed highly salient vocal stimuli associated with appetitive (mating) and aversive (restraint) behaviors of CBA/CaJ mice. From interactions between adult male and female mice that included female head-sniffing and attempted or actual mounting, we selected several sequences of vocalizations to form a 20-minute mating vocal stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gaub et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ghasemahmad, 2020</xref>). These sequences included ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) with harmonics, steps, and complex structure, mostly emitted by males, and low frequency harmonic calls (LFHs) emitted by females (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Finton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ghasemahmad, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hanson &amp; Hurley, 2012</xref>). During short periods of restraint, mice produce distinctive mid-frequency vocalizations (MFVs) that are associated with anxiety-related behaviors and increased release of the stress hormone corticosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dornellas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">J. M. S. Grimsley et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Niemczura et al., 2020a</xref>). From vocal sequences produced by restrained mice, we created a 20-minute vocal stimulus, primarily containing MFVs and fewer USV and LFH syllables (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,C</xref>).</p>

Experimental design in playback experiment. Days 1 and 2: each animal experienced restraint and mating behaviors (counterbalanced order across subjects). Day 2: a microdialysis guide tube was implanted in the brain above the BLA. Day 6: the microdialysis probe was inserted through guide tube into the BLA. Playback experiments began after several hours of habituation/equilibration. Behavioral observations and microdialysis sampling were obtained before, during, and after playback of one vocalization type. Microdialysis samples were analyzed using LC/MS method described in Materials and Methods. <bold>E.</bold> Detailed sequencing of vocal stimuli, shown here for mating playback. A 20-min period of vocal playback was formed by seven repeated stimulus blocks of 170 s. The stimulus blocks were composed of five vocal exemplars of variable length, with each exemplar followed by an equal duration of silence. Stimuli during the Stim1 and Stim 2 playback windows thus included identical blocks but in slightly altered patterns.</p></caption>

<p>We next asked whether these salient vocal stimuli, associated with very different behavioral states, could elicit distinct behaviors and patterns of neuromodulator release into the BLA. We focused on the neuromodulators acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA), since previous work suggests their interaction in emission of positive and negative vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rojas-Carvajal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Silkstone &amp; Brudzynski, 2020</xref>). Our experiments combined playback of the vocal stimuli, behavioral tracking and observations, and microdialysis of BLA extracellular fluid in freely moving mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Fluids were analyzed using a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) technique that allowed simultaneous measurement of several neurochemicals and their metabolites in the same dialysate samples, including ACh, DA and the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA (see Materials and Methods).</p>
<p>Prior to the study, male and female mouse subjects had no experience with sexual or restraint behaviors. On the first two days of the experiment, mice in an experienced group (EXP, n=31) were each exposed to 90-min sessions with mating and restraint behaviors in a counterbalanced design (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Mice were then implanted with a guide cannula for microdialysis. On the playback/sample collection day (Day 6), a microdialysis probe was inserted into the guide cannula. After a 4-hour period of mouse habitation and probe equilibration, we recorded behavioral reactions and sampled extracellular fluid from the BLA before (Pre-Stim) and during a 20 min playback period, divided into two 10-min collection/observation periods (Stim 1 and Stim 2) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). Each mouse received playback of either the mating or restraint stimuli, but not both. Data are reported only from mice with more than 75% of the microdialysis probe implanted within the BLA (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p>We first describe tests to examine whether playback of mating and restraint vocalizations results in different behavioral and neurochemical responses in male mice. We observed that two behaviors, still-and-alert and flinching, displayed pronounced increases with restraint playback that were not observed in the mating playback group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). There were also distinct, vocalization-dependent patterns of ACh and DA release into the BLA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C,D</xref>). Thus, in response to restraint vocalizations, we observed a significant increase in ACh concentration during both Stim 1 and Stim 2 playback windows. Mating vocalizations, however, resulted in decreased ACh release that was significant during the Stim 2 playback period. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). DA release displayed opposite patterns to ACh, increasing significantly during playback of mating vocalizations but showing a decreasing pattern (although nonsignificant) during playback of restraint vocal sequences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). For both ACh and DA, levels differed significantly between the mating and restraint groups during both Stim 1 and Stim 2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). In contrast, the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA showed no significant change over time following playback of either vocal stimulus, nor significant differences between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2A</xref>). These findings suggest that both behavioral responses and ACh and DA release are modulated in listening male mice by the affective content of social vocalizations. Further, some behavioral and neurochemical responses were significantly correlated, especially the percentage change of ACh concentration (Stim 1 re Pre-Stim) with the number of flinching behaviors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>

<p>As male and female mice emit different vocalizations during mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Finton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">J. M. S. Grimsley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Neunuebel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sales (née Sewell), 1972</xref>), we tested whether playback of vocal interactions associated with mating (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) results in different behavioral and neurochemical responses in listening male and female mice. Since our testing included both estrus and non-estrus females, we further examined the estrous effect on neurochemical release and behavioral reactions.</p>
<p>Playback of mating vocalizations resulted in some general and sex-based differences in behavioral responses. For instance, all groups displayed increased attending behavior (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In females, regardless of estrous stage, both rearing and still-and-alert behaviors increased relative to male mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). Other behaviors differed by estrous stage during mating playback: females in estrus displayed a strikingly higher number of flinching behaviors compared to males and non-estrus females (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Our analysis of neuromodulator responses to mating vocalization playback revealed an estrous-dependent modulation of ACh levels during playback. ACh concentration in estrus females increased significantly during both Stim 1 and Stim 2 periods, whereas ACh showed decreases in both males and non-estrus females that were significant in the Stim 2 period (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Moreover, during playback, the ACh in estrus females was significantly higher than both males and non-estrus females. DA release showed a consistent increase during mating playback across all three experimental groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Similar to male groups in restraint and mating playback, the 5-HIAA release patterns in females showed no modulation during mating vocal playback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Like male mice exposed to restraint vocalizations, estrus females showed robust and significant increases in flinching behavior in response to mating vocalizations. Both groups displayed increased ACh release. Among all mice exposed to mating playback, we observed a positive correlation between ACh concentration and the number of flinching behaviors during Stim 1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). This supports the possible involvement of ACh in shaping such behavior in both males listening to restraint calls and in estrus females listening to mating vocalizations. Note that neuromodulator release, including ACh, has been previously linked to motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wall &amp; Woolley, 2020</xref>), but the changes in ACh that we observed showed no correlations with behaviors involving motor activity such as rearing (Stim 1: n =, r=−0.02, p=.9) or locomotion (Stim 1: n=, r =−0.03, p=0.9). This suggests that the observed changes in ACh reflect the valence of these vocalizations.</p>
<p>All EXP mice used in the above experiments had undergone a single session each to experience mating and restraint conditions prior to the playback session on Day 6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Does such experience shape the release patterns of these neuromodulators in response to vocal playback? We tested male and female mice under identical vocal playback conditions as previous groups, except that they did not receive the restraint and mating experiences (INEXP groups). Since only one INEXP female was in a non-estrus stage during the playback session, our analysis of the effect of experience included only estrus females and males.</p>
<p>Several behavioral responses to vocalization playback differed between EXP and INEXP mice in a sex- or context-dependent manner. For example, only estrus females showed experience-dependent increases in flinching behaviors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) in response to mating vocal sequences. These experience effects were not observed in males in response to mating or restraint vocal playback. Males, however, showed a striking experience-dependent increase in rearing behaviors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) in response to mating vocalizations, but this pattern was not observed during restraint playback for males or mating playback in estrus females. These findings indicate that behavioral responses to salient vocalizations result from interactions between sex of the listener or context of vocal stimuli with the previous behavioral experience associated with these vocalizations.</p>

<p>A major finding is that prior experience with mating and restraint behaviors shaped patterns of ACh and DA release in response to vocal playback (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, male and female mice lacking in previous mating and restraint experiences showed no significant change in ACh or DA concentrations in response to either vocal playback type (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A,B</xref>). Further, there were no significant differences across groups during Stim 1 or Stim 2 periods. These results contrast sharply with those from all EXP groups, in which both ACh and DA release changed significantly during playback (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2C, 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E, 3F</xref>). Moreover, 5-HIAA concentrations, which were unaffected by sex, estrous stage, or playback type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2A,B</xref>), were also unaffected by experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2C</xref>). Finally, INEXP groups showed no significant correlations between concentrations of ACh with behavior in response to vocalization playback (n=22, r=0.1, p=0.6). Collectively, these data suggest that the playback vocalization type and estrous effects observed in neuromodulator release patterns and behavioral reactions are mediated by previous experience with the corresponding behaviors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Functional imaging studies in humans and mechanistic studies in other species provide substantial evidence that the amygdala participates in circuits that process vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Frühholz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Liebenthal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sander et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wenstrup et al., 2020</xref>), assess the valence of appetitive and aversive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kyriazi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">O’Neill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Pignatelli &amp; Beyeler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Smith &amp; Torregrossa, 2021b</xref>), and shape appropriate behavioral responses to these cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gründemann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Schönfeld et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zhang &amp; Li, 2018</xref>). Here, in a mouse model of acoustic communication, we showed that the motivational state of a “sender” is reflected in the acoustics of social vocalizations. We then showed that these vocalizations, related to intense experiences of restraint and mating, affect behavioral responses in listening conspecifics. Our results show that these emotionally charged vocalizations result in distinct release patterns of acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) into the BLA of male and female mice. Further, female hormonal state appears to influence ACh but not DA release into the BLA when processing mating vocalizations. Such context- or state-dependent changes were not observed in patterns of other neurochemicals (e.g., 5-HIAA). These data indicate that during analysis of affective vocalizations in the BLA, ACh and DA provide state- and context-related information that can, potentially, modulate sensory processing within the BLA and thus shape an individual’s response to these vocalizations.</p>
<p>The BLA receives strong cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aitta-aho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Carlsen et al., 1985</xref>) that contribute to ACh-dependent processing of aversive cues and fear learning in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baysinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gorka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tingley et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings support these studies by demonstrating increased ACh release in BLA in response to playback of aversive vocalizations. Although the exact mechanism by which ACh affects vocal information processing in BLA is not clear yet, the result of ACh release onto BLA neurons seems to enhance arousal during emotional processing (Likhtik &amp; Johansen, 2019a). Our results, in conjunction with previous work, suggest mechanisms by which vocalizations affect ACh release and in turn drive behavioral responses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Cholinergic modulation in the BLA is mediated via muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors on BLA pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aitta-aho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mesulam et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pidoplichko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Unal et al., 2015</xref>). During the processing of sensory information in the BLA, partially non-overlapping populations of neurons respond to cues related to positive or negative experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Paton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Smith &amp; Torregrossa, 2021a</xref>). These neurons then project to different target areas involved in appetitive or aversive behaviors—the nucleus accumbens or central nucleus of the amygdala, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<p><bold>A.</bold> Cholinergic modulation of CeA-projecting neurons during aversive vocalization cue processing in the BLA. In the presence of aversive cues, ACh released from the basal forebrain acts on m1 ACh receptors (m1AChRs) to enhance the cue-induced excitatory responses of CeA-projecting neurons. In contrast, NAc-projecting neurons are quiescent, because they do not respond to aversive cues and are inhibited by interneurons that are activated through nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs). <bold>B.</bold> Dopaminergic modulation and enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio in response to reward-associated cues (appetitive vocalizations).

In contrast, CeA-projecting neurons are not responsive to rewarding vocalizations and are inhibited by local interneurons. DA is thought to act on D1 DA receptors (D1Rs) in these local interneurons to shape a direct inhibition onto CeA-projecting neurons.

</fig>
<p>In response to an aversive cue or experience (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), released ACh affects neurons according to their activity. If projection neurons are at rest, ACh may exert an inhibitory effect by activating nicotinic ACh receptors on local GABAergic interneurons, which in turn synapse onto the quiescent pyramidal neurons. This results in GABA-A mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the pyramidal neurons. Alternately, direct activation of M1 ACh receptors on pyramidal neurons, activating inward rectifying K+ currents, may result in additional ACh-mediated inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aitta-aho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pidoplichko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Unal et al., 2015</xref>). When BLA pyramidal neurons are already active due to strong excitatory input associated with aversive cues, M1 receptor activation can result in long afterdepolarizations that produce persistent firing lasting as long as ACh is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Unal et al., 2015</xref>). Such a process may explain persistent firing observed in single neuron responses to aversive social vocalizations in bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gadziola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Peterson &amp; Wenstrup, 2012</xref>). Through this process of inhibiting quiescent neurons and enhancing activation and persistent firing in active neurons, ACh sharpens the population signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during the processing of salient, aversive signals in the BLA. These neurons, processing negative cues, likely project to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) to regulate defensive behaviors such as escape and avoidance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement, our behavioral findings show increased behaviors such as flinching correlated with increased release of ACh during processing of aversive vocalizations. Such prolonged afterdepolarizations provide the appropriate condition for associative synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Likhtik &amp; Johansen, 2019</xref>) that underlies an increase in AMPA/NMDA currents in CeA-projecting neurons during processing of aversive cues.</p>
<p>Dopaminergic innervation from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Asan, 1998</xref>) acts on BLA neurons via D1 and D2 receptors, both G-protein coupled receptors. Dopamine is important in reward processing, fear extinction, decision making, and motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Di Ciano &amp; Everitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lutas et al., 2019</xref>). We observed increased DA release in the BLA in response to mating vocalizations both for males and for females across estrous stages. Electrophysiological studies show that DA enhances sensory processing in BLA neurons by increasing the population response SNR in a process like ACh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kröner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, during processing of mating vocalizations or those related to other rewarding experiences, DA presence in the vicinity of BLA pyramidal neurons and interneurons is enhanced (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). For neurons with elevated spiking activity during processing of appetitive vocalizations or other sensory stimuli, DA acts on D2 receptors of pyramidal cells to further enhance neuronal firing and result in persistent firing of these projection neurons. Conversely, in BLA projection neurons that do not respond to such positive cues, such as CeA-projecting neurons, DA exerts a suppressive effect directly via D1 receptors and indirectly by activating inhibitory interneuron feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kröner et al., 2005</xref>). The net result of this process in response to appetitive vocalizations is an enhancement of activity in the reward-responding neurons and suppression of activity in aversive-responding neurons. This process likely depends on the increase in synaptic plasticity via enhanced AMPA/NMDA current during processing such cues in NAc-projecting neurons in the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Otani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">van Vugt et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings suggest that this may occur in the BLA in response to appetitive vocalizations.</p>
<p>As the results with males listening to restraint vocalizations demonstrate, increased ACh release is associated with processing aversive cues. How, then, should the increased ACh release in estrus females during mating vocal playback be interpreted? Previous work shows that neuromodulation of amygdalar and other forebrain activity is altered by sex hormone/receptor changes in males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Egozi et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kalinowski et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kirry et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Matsuda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mizuno et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">van Huizen et al., 1994</xref>). For instance, the cholinergic neurons that project to the BLA, originating in the basal forebrain, exhibit high expression of estrogen receptors that is influenced by a female’s hormonal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shughrue et al., 2000</xref>). During estrus, the enhanced circulating estrogen affects release of ACh and may influence neuronal networks and behavioral phenotypes in a distinct manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gibbs, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">McEwen, 1998</xref>). Thus, increased ACh release in estrus females may underlie increased attentional and risk assessment behaviors in response to vocalization playback. Combined with DA increase, it may trigger both Nac and CeA circuit activation, resulting in both reward-seeking and cautionary behaviors in estrus females.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate the strong impact of even limited experience in shaping behavioral and neuromodulatory responses associated with salient social vocalizations. In the adult mice, a single 90-min session of mating and of restraint, occurring 4-5 days prior to the playback experiment, resulted in consistent behavioral responses and consistent and enhanced ACh and DA release into BLA for both vocalization types. As previous work shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nadim &amp; Bucher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pawlak et al., 2010</xref>), neuromodulatory inputs play crucial roles in regulating experience-dependent changes in the brain. However, it remains unclear whether the experience shapes neuromodulator release, or whether neuromodulators deliver the experience-related effect into the BLA.</p>
<p>The interaction between ACh and DA is thought to shape motor responses to external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lester et al., 2010</xref>). Our results support the view that a balance of DA and ACh may regulate the proper behavioral response to appetitive and aversive auditory cues. For instance, increased reward-seeking behavior (rearing and locomotion) in EXP males during mating vocalizations playback may result from the differential release of the two neuromodulators—decreased ACh and increased DA. Further, the lack of this differential release may be the underlying cause for the lack of such responses in INEXP male mice. This supports the role of experience in tuning interactions of these two neuromodulators throughout the BLA, for shaping appropriate behaviors. Overall, the behavioral changes orchestrated by the BLA in response to emotionally salient stimuli are most likely the result of the interaction between previous emotional experiences, hormonal state, content of sensory stimuli, and sex of the listening animals.</p>

<title>Vocalization recording and analysis</title>
<p>To record vocalizations for use in playback experiments, mice were placed in an open-topped plexiglass chamber (width, 28 cm; length, 28 cm; height, 20 cm), housed within a darkened, single-walled acoustic chamber (Industrial Acoustics, New York, NY) lined with anechoic foam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">J. M. S. Grimsley et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Niemczura et al., 2020b</xref>). Acoustic signals were recorded using ultrasonic condenser microphones (CM16/CMPA, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany) connected to a multichannel amplifier and A/D converter (UltraSoundGate 416H, Avisoft Bioacoustics). The gain of each microphone was independently adjusted once per recording session to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while avoiding signal clipping. Acoustic signals were digitized at 500 kHz and 16-bit depth, monitored in real time with RECORDER software (Version 5.1, Avisoft Bioacoustics), and Fast Fourier Transformed (FFT) at a resolution of 512 Hz. A night vision camera (VideoSecu Infrared CCTV), centered 50 cm above the floor of the test box, recorded the behaviors synchronized with the vocal recordings (VideoBench software, DataWave Technologies, version 7).</p>
<p>To record mating vocalizations, ten animals (5 male-female pairs) were used in sessions that lasted for 30 minutes. A male mouse was introduced first into the test box, followed by a female mouse 5 min later. Vocalizations were recorded using two ultrasonic microphones placed 30 cm above the floor of the recording box and 13 cm apart. See below for analysis of behaviors during vocal recordings.</p>
<p>To record vocalizations during restraint, six mice (4 male, 2 female) were briefly anesthetized with isoflurane and then placed in a restraint jacket as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">J. M. S. Grimsley et al., 2016b</xref>). Vocalizations were recorded for 30 minutes while the animal was suspended in the recording box. Since these vocalizations are usually emitted at lower intensity compared to mating vocalizations, the recording microphone was positioned 2-3 cm from the snout to obtain the best SNR.</p>
<p>Vocal recordings were analyzed offline using <underline>Avisoft-SASLab Pro</underline> (version 5.2.12, Avisoft Bioacoustics) with a hamming window, 1024 Hz FFT size, and an overlap percentage of 98.43. For every syllable the channel with the higher amplitude signal was extracted using a custom-written Python code and analyzed. Since automatic syllable tagging did not allow distinguishing some syllable types such as noisy calls and mid-frequency vocalizations (MFVs) from background noise, we manually tagged the start and end of each syllable, then examined spectrograms to measure several acoustic features and classify syllable types based on Grimsley et al.

Restraint stimulus blocks included seven vocal sequences, emitted by restrained male or female mice, with durations ranging from 5.7 – 42.3 s. Across exemplars, each stimulus block associated with both mating and restraint included different sets of vocal categories (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref>).</p>
<p>Playback sequences, i.e., exemplars, were conditioned in Adobe Audition CC (2018), adjusted to a 65 dB SNR level, then normalized to 1 V peak-to-peak for the highest amplitude syllable in the sequence. This maintained relative syllable emission amplitude in the sequence. For each sequence, an equal duration of background noise (i.e., no vocal or other detected sounds) from the same recording was added at the end of that sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). A 5-ms ramp was added at the beginning and the end of the entire sequence to avoid acoustic artifacts. A MATLAB app (EqualizIR, Sharad Shanbhag; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TytoLogy/EqualizIR">https://github.com/TytoLogy/EqualizIR</ext-link>) compensated and calibrated each vocal sequence for the frequency response of the speaker system. Vocal sequences were converted to analog signals at 500 KHz and 16-bit resolution using DataWave (DataWave SciWorks, Loveland, CO), anti-alias filtered (TDT FT6-2, fc=125KHz), amplified (HCA-800II, Parasound, San Francisco, CA), and sent to the speaker (LCY, K100, Ying Tai Audio Company, Hong Kong). Each sequence was presented at peak level equivalent to 85 dB SPL.</p>

<title>Behavioral methods</title>
<p>Behaviors during both vocalization recording and playback sessions were recorded using a night vision camera (480TVL 3.6mm, VideoSecu), centered 50 cm above the floor of the test box, and SciWorks (DataWave, VideoBench version 7) for video acquisition and analysis.</p>
<sec id="s4c1">
<title>Analysis of mating behaviors during vocal recordings</title>
<p>Mating behaviors in video recordings were analyzed second-by-second and classified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gaub et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Heckman et al., 2016</xref>). All vocal sequences selected as exemplars for playback of mating vocalizations were recorded in association with the following male mating behaviors: head-sniffing, vocalizing, attempted mounting, or mounting. Vocalizations during these behaviors included chevron, stepped, and complex USVs emitted with longer durations and higher repetition rates, and more LFH calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ghasemahmad, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hanson &amp; Hurley, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c2">
<title>Experience and playback sessions</title>
<p>Prior to playback experiments, each animal underwent 90-min sessions on two consecutive days (Days 1 and 2) that provided both mating and restraint experiences to the EXP group (n = 31 animals) or no experiences of these to the INEXP group (n = 24 animals). EXP sessions were presented in a counterbalanced pattern across subjects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>After the Day 2 session, mice underwent surgery for implantation of a microdialysis guide canula (see below), then recovered for four days. On Day 6, the day of the playback experiment, male mice were randomly assigned to either restraint or mating vocal playback groups. Females were only tested with mating playback.</p>
<p>Video recording was performed simultaneously with microdialysis, beginning 10 min before vocal playback (pre-stimulus), continuing for 20 min during playback, and including another 10 min after playback ended (post-stimulus) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). From the video recording, several behaviors were analyzed in 10-second intervals.</p>

<sec id="s4c3">
<title>Analysis of behaviors during vocal playback</title>
<p>Behavioral analysis was based on previous descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bakshi &amp; Kelley, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blanchard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Füzesi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">C.

To examine the effects of vocal playback on mouse behavior, we first identified behaviors exhibited by a separate group of naïve male and female mice in the experimental arena over a 15 min period, without playback. These included rearing, self-grooming, locomotion, and still-and-alert. During vocal playback we observed three additional behaviors: flinching, attending, and stretch and attend posture (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for description).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>For analysis of behaviors during vocal playback, all videos were examined blind to the sex of the animal and the context of vocalizations. Video recordings (40 min) were analyzed manually (n=48 mice) second-by-second in 10-second intervals for the seven behaviors identified above. The number of occurrences of every behavior per 10-second block was marked. The numbers were added for every block of 2:50 min of vocal playback (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), then averaged for the Pre-Stim, Stim 1, and Stim 2 periods separately. Videos were further analyzed automatically using the video tracker within VideoBench (DataWave Technologies, version 7) for speed of locomotion, distance traveled, and time spent in the periphery and center of the test arena.</p>

<title>Procedures related to microdialysis</title>
<sec id="s4d1">
<title>Surgery</title>
<p>Mice were anaesthetized with Isoflurane (2-4%, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) and hair overlying the skull was removed using depilatory lotion. A midline incision was made, then the skin was moved laterally to expose the skull. A craniotomy (≃1 mm<sup>2</sup>) was made above the basolateral amygdala (BLA) on the left side (stereotaxic coordinates from bregma: −1.65 mm rostrocaudal, +3.43 mm mediolateral). A guide cannula (CMA-7, CMA Microdialysis, Sweden) was implanted to a depth of 2.6 mm below the cortical surface and above the left BLA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, Day 2), then secured using dental cement. After surgery, the animal received a subcutaneous injection of carprofen (4 mg/kg, s.c.) and topical anesthetic (lidocaine) and antibiotic cream (Neosporin). It was returned to its cage and placed on a heating pad until full recovery from anesthesia. The animal recovered in its home cage for four days before the playback experiment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d2">
<title>Microdialysis</title>
<p>On the day before microdialysis, the probe was conditioned in 70% methanol and artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) (CMA Microdialysis, Sweden). On playback day (Day 6), the animal was briefly anesthetized and the probe with 1 mm membrane length and 0.24 mm outer diameter (MWCO 6 kDa) was inserted into the guide cannula (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Using a spiral tubing connector (0.1 mm ID x 50 cm length) (CT-20, AMUZA Microdialysis, Japan), the inlet and outlet tubing of the probe was connected to the inlet /outlet Teflon tubing of the microdialysis lines. A swivel device for fluids (TCS-2-23, AMUZA Microdialysis, Japan), secured to a balance arm, held the tubing, and facilitated the animal’s free movement during the experiment.</p>
<p>After probe insertion, a four-hour period allowed animals to habituate and the neurochemicals to equilibrate between aCSF fluid in the probe and brain extracellular fluid (ECF). Sample collection then began, in 10-min intervals, beginning with four background samples, then two samples during playback of restraint or mating vocal sequences (total 20 minutes), then one or more samples after playback ended. To account for the dead volume of the outlet tubing, a flow rate of 1.069 µl/min was established at the syringe pump to obtain a 1 µl sample per minute. Samples collected during this time were measured for volume to assure a consistent flow rate. To prevent degradation of collected neurochemicals, the outlet tubing was passed through ice to a site outside the sound-proof booth where samples were collected on ice, then stored in a −80°C freezer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d3">
<title>Neurochemical analysis</title>
<p>Samples were analyzed using a liquid chromatography (LC) / mass spectrometry (MS) technique (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) at the Vanderbilt University Neurochemistry Core. This method allows simultaneous measurement of several neurochemicals in the same dialysate sample: acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine (DA) and its metabolites (3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and homovanillic acid (HVA)), serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)), norepinephrine (NE), gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate. Due to low recovery of NE and 5-HT from the mouse brain, we were unable to track these two neuromodulators in this experiment.</p>
<p>Before each LC/MS analysis, 5 μl of the sample was derivatized using sodium carbonate, benzoyl chloride in acetonitrile, and internal standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wong et al., 2016</xref>). LC was performed on a 2.0 × 50 mm, 1.7 μM particle Acquity BEH C18 column (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) with 1.5% aqueous formic acid as mobile phase A and acetonitrile as mobile phase B. Using a Waters Acquity Classic UPLC, samples were separated by a gradient of 98–5 % of mobile phase A over 11 min at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min with delivery to a SCIEX 6500+ Qtrap mass spectrometer (AB Sciex LLC, Framingham, MA, USA). The mass spectrometer was operated using electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode. The capillary voltage and temperature were 4KV and 350°C, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Yohn et al., 2020</xref>). Chromatograms were analyzed using MultiQuant 3.0.2 Software (AB SCIEX, Concord, Ontario, Canada).</p>

<sec id="s4d4">
<title>Verification of probe location</title>
<p>To verify placement of the microdialysis probe within the BLA, each probe was perfused with 2% dextran-fluorescein (MW 4Kda) (Sigma Aldrich Inc, Atlanta, GA) at the end of the experiment. The location of the probe was then visualized in adjacent cleared and Nissl-stained sections (e.g., <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>, inset). Sections were photographed using a SPOT RT3 camera and SPOT Advanced Plus imaging software (version 4.7) mounted on a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 fluorescence microscope. Adobe Photoshop CS3 was used to adjust brightness and contrast globally. Animals with less than 75% of the probe membrane located within the BLA were excluded from statistical analyses (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>For neurochemical analyses, the total numbers of animals used were N<sub>EXP</sub>=31 and N<sub>INEXP</sub>=21. Only mice with useable neurochemical data were further evaluated for behaviors and for correlation between behaviors and neuromodulators. This included 48 mice: (N<sub>EXP</sub>=27 and N<sub>INEXP</sub>=21). Note that some animals used in neurochemical analyses were not included in the behavioral analyses because their behavioral data were unavailable. Since only one INEXP female was in a non-estrus stage during the playback session, our analysis of the effect of experience included only estrus females and males.</p>
<p>Only the following sample collection windows were used for statistical analysis: Pre-Stim, Stim 1 (10 mins), and Stim2 (10 mins). All neurochemical data were normalized to the background level, obtained from a single pre-stimulus sample immediately preceding playback. This provided clarity in representations and did not result in different outcomes of statistical tests compared to use of three pre-stimulus samples. The fluctuation in all background samples was ≤20%. The percentage change from background level was calculated based on the formula: <italic>% change from background = (100 x stimulus sample concentration in pg)/ background sample concentration in pg.</italic> Values are represented as mean ± one standard error unless stated otherwise. Box plots indicate minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values.</p>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM, V. 26 and 27). To examine vocalizations in different stages of mating, we used a linear mixed model to analyze the changes of interval and duration (dependent variables) of vocalizations based on mating interaction intensity (fixed effect). For behavioral and neurochemical analyses in playback experiments, we initially compared the output using a linear mixed model and a generalized linear model (GLM) with a repeated measure for neurochemical data. Since both statistical methods resulted in similar findings, we chose to use the GLM for statistical comparisons of the neurochemicals and behaviors. Where Mauchly’s test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated, degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse Geisser estimates of sphericity.</p>
<p>To further clarify the differences observed between groups for every comparison in the GLM repeated measure, multivariate contrast was performed. All multiple comparisons were corrected using Bonferroni post hoc testing. 95% confidence intervals were used to compare values between timepoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Julious, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>For both microdialysis and behavioral data, we tested the hypotheses that the release of neurochemicals into the BLA and the number of behaviors is differently modulated by the vocal playback type (mating and restraint) in male mice, by estrous stage of females or sex of the animals during mating vocal playback, and by previous experience in any of these groups. The GLM model for testing these hypotheses used time as a within-subject factor, with vocalization context, sex, estrous, or the interaction of these with EXP and time as the between-subject factors. Dependent (response) variables included the normalized concentration of ACh, DA, 5-HIAA or the numbers of behaviors as previously described in the behavioral analysis section. Throughout the figures, box plots show distributions of data into first (lower) quartile, median, and third (upper) quartile. Whiskers show minimum and maximum values; the mean is marked with an “x”.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study advances our understanding of the ways in which different types of communication signals differentially affect mouse behaviors and amygdala cholinergic/dopaminergic neuromodulation. Researchers interested in the complex interaction between prior experience, sex, behavior, hormonal status, and neuromodulation should benefit from this study. Nevertheless, the data analysis is <bold>incomplete</bold> at this stage, requiring additional analysis and description, justification, and - potentially - power to support the conclusions fully. With the analytical part strengthened, this paper will be of interest to neuroscientists and ethologists.</p>

<p>The manuscript addresses a fundamental question about how different types of communication signals differentially affect brain states and neurochemistry. In addition, the manuscript highlights the various processes that modulate brain responses to communication signals, including prior experience, sex, and hormonal status. Overall, the manuscript is well-written and the research is appropriately contextualized. The authors are thoughtful about their quantitative approaches and interpretations of the data.</p>
<p>That being said, the authors need to work on justifying some of their analytical approaches (e.g., normalization of neurochemical data, dividing the experimental period into two periods (as opposed to just analyzing the entire experimental period as a whole)) and should provide a greater discussion of how their data also demonstrate dissociations between neurochemical release in the basolateral amygdala and behavior (e.g., neurochemical differences during both of the experimental periods but behavioral differences only during the first half of the experimental period). The normalization of neurochemical data seems unnecessary given the repeated-measures design of their analysis and could be problematic; by normalizing all data to the baseline data (p. 24), one artificially creates a baseline period with minimal variation (all are &quot;0&quot;; Figures 2, 3 &amp; 5) that could inflate statistical power.</p>
<p>The Introduction could benefit from a priori predictions about the differential release of specific neuromodulators based on previous literature.</p>
<p>The manuscript would also benefit from a description of space use and locomotion in response to different valence vocalizations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the current manuscript seems to provide some compelling support for how positive and negative valence vocalizations differentially affect behavior and the release of acetylcholine and dopamine in the basolateral amygdala. The research is relevant to broad fields of neuroscience and has implications for the neural circuits underlying social behavior.</p>

<p>Ghasemahmad et al. report findings on the influence of salient vocalization playback, sex, and previous experience, on mice behaviors, and on cholinergic and dopaminergic neuromodulation within the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Specifically, the authors played back mice vocalizations recorded during two behaviors of opposite valence (mating and restraint) and measured the behaviors and release of acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine (DA), and serotonin in the BLA triggered in response to those sounds.</p>
<p>Strength: The authors identified that mating and restraint sounds have a differential impact on cholinergic and dopaminergic release. In male mice, these two distinct vocalizations exert an opposite effect on the release of ACh and DA. Mating sounds elicited a decrease of Ach release and an increase of DA release. Conversely, restraint sounds induced an increase in ACh release and a trend to decrease in DA. These neurotransmission changes were different in estrus females for whom the mating vocalization resulted in an increase of both DA and ACh release.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: The behavioral analysis and results remain elusive, and although addressing interesting questions, the study contains major flaws, and the interpretations are overstating the findings.</p>

The authors made two significant and exciting discoveries. They revealed that the affective content of vocalizations modulated both behavioral responses and the release of acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) but not serotonin (5-HIAA) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of male and female mice. Moreover, the results show sex-based differences in behavioral responses to vocalizations associated with mating. The authors conclude that behavior and neurochemical responses in male and female mice are experience-dependent and are altered by vocalizations associated with restraint and mating. The findings suggest that ACh and DA release may shape behavioral responses to context-dependent vocalizations. The study has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of how neuromodulators provide internal-state signals to the BLA while an animal listens to social vocalizations; however, multiple concerns must be addressed to substantiate their conclusions.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>1. The authors normalized all neurochemical data to the background level obtained from a single pre-stimulus sample immediately preceding playback. The percentage change from the background level was calculated based on a formula, and the underlying concentrations were not reported. The authors should report the sample and background concentrations to make the results and analyses more transparent. The authors stated that NE and 5-HT had low recovery from the mouse brain and hence could not be tracked in the experiment. The authors could be more specific here by relating the concentrations to ACh, DA, and 5-HIAA included in the analyses.</p>
<p>2. For the EXP group, the authors stated that each animal underwent 90-min sessions on two consecutive days that provided mating and restraint experiences. Did the authors record mating or copulation during these experiments? If yes, what was the frequency of copulation? What other behaviors were recorded during these experiences? Did the experiment encompass other courtship behaviors along with mating experiences? Was the female mouse in estrus during the experience sessions?</p>
<p>3. For the mating playback, the authors stated that the mating stimulus blocks contained five exemplars of vocal sequences emitted during mating interactions. The authors should clarify whether the vocal sequences were emitted while animals were mating/copulating or when the male and female mice were inside the test box. If the latter was the case, it might be better to call the playback &quot;courtship playback&quot; instead of &quot;mating playback&quot;.</p>
<p>4. Since most differences that the authors reported in Figure 3 were observed in Stim 1 and not in Stim 2, it might be better to perform a temporal analysis - looking at behaviors and neurochemicals over time instead of dividing them into two 10-minute bins. The temporal analysis will provide a more accurate representation of changes in behavior and neurochemicals over time.</p>
<p>5. In Figures 2 and 3, the authors show the correlation between Flinching behavior and ACh concentration. The authors should report correlations between concentrations of all neurochemicals (not just ACh) and all behaviors recorded (not just Flinching), even if they are insignificant. The analyses performed for the stim 1 data should also be performed on the stim 2 data. Reporting these findings would benefit the field.</p>
<p>6. The mice used in the study were between p90 - p180. Although CBA/CaJ mice display normal hearing, sexual behaviors, and social behaviors for at least 1 year (Ohlemiller, Dahl, and Gagnon, JARO 11: 605-623, 2010), the age of the mice covers a range of 90 days. It would strengthen the authors' argument that the affective content of vocalizations modulated both behavioral responses and the release of acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) but not serotonin (5-HIAA) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of male and female mice if there were no correlations between the magnitude of the neural responses and age.</p>
<p>7. The authors reported neurochemical levels estimated as the animals listened to the sounds played back. What about the sustained effects of changes in neurochemicals? Are there any potential long-term effects of social vocalizations on behavior and neurochemical levels? The authors might consider discussing long-term effects.</p>
<p>8. Histology from a single recording was shown in supplementary figure 1. It would benefit the readers if additional histology was shown for all the animals, not just the colored schematics summarizing the recording probe locations. Further explanation of the track location is also needed to help the readers. Make it clear for the readers which dextran-fluorescein labeling image is associated with which track in the schematic.</p>
<p>9. The authors did not control for the sounds being played back with a speaker. This control may be necessary since the effects are more pronounced in Stim 1 than in Stim 2. Playing white noise rather than restraint or courtship vocalizations would be an excellent control. However, the authors could perform a permutation analysis and computationally break the relationship between what sound is playing and the neurochemical data. This control would allow the authors to show that the actual neurochemical levels are above or below chance.</p>
<p>10. The authors indicated that each animal's post-vocalization session was also recorded. No data in the manuscript related to the post-vocalization playback period was included. This omission was a missed opportunity to show that the neurochemical levels returned to baseline, and the results were not dependent on the normalization process described in major concern #1. The data should be included in the manuscript and analyzed. It would add further support for the model described in Figure 6.</p>
<p>11. The authors could use a predictive model, such as a binary classifier trained on the CSF sampling data, to predict the type of vocalizations played back. The predictive model could support the conclusions and provide additional support for the model in Figure 6.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful reviews. We believe that we can address these comments through revisions within the manuscript (writing/analysis) or as matters of clarification. In this preliminary response, we focus on a few aspects of the reviewer comments.</p>
<p><bold>Experimental design</bold></p>
<p>We will ensure that the rationale for our use of 10-minute analytic periods is clear. These time periods were dictated by the sampling duration required to perform accurate neurochemical analyses (and to reserve half of the sample in the event of a catastrophic failure of batch-processing samples). Since neurochemical release may display multiple temporal components (e.g., ACh) during playback stimulation, and these could differ across neurochemicals of interest, we decided to collect, analyze, and report in two periods. Our results suggest that this was appropriate, comparing values across the two stimulus periods and the pre-stimulus control. We decided not to include analyses of the post-stimulus period because this is subject to wider individual and neuromodulator-specific effects and because it weakens statistical power in addressing the core question—the change in neuromodulator release DURING vocal playback.</p>
<p>We called these periods “Stim 1” and “Stim 2”, but each used the same examplar sequences in the same order.</p>
<p>For behavioral analyses, observation periods were much shorter than 10 mins, but the main purpose of behavioral analyses was to relate to the neurochemical data. As a result, we matched the temporal features of the behavioral and neurochemical analyses. We will ensure that this is clearly described in the revision. We plan a separate report, focused exclusively on a broader set of behavioral responses to playback, that may examine behaviors at a more granular level.</p>
<p>One reviewer expressed concern that we did not utilize a “control” playback stimulus, suggesting white noise as the control. We gave extensive consideration to this in our design. We concluded, based on our previous work, that white noise is not a neutral stimulus and therefore the results would not clarify the responses to the two vocal stimuli. Instead, we opted to use experience as a type of control. This control shows very clearly that temporal patterns and across-group differences in neurochemical response disappear in the absence of experience.</p>
<p>One reviewer comments that our p90-p180 mice are “old”. This is not the case. CBA/CaJ mice display normal hearing for at least 1 year (Ohlemiller, Dahl, and Gagnon, JARO 11: 605-623, 2010) and adult sexual and social behavior throughout our observation period. They are sexually mature adults, appropriate for this study.</p>
<p><bold>Data and statistical analyses</bold></p>
<p>Two reviewers express concerns about our normalization of neurochemical data, suggesting that it diminishes statistical power or is not transparent. We note that normalization is a very common form of data transformation that does not diminish statistical power. It is particularly useful for data forms in which the absolute value of the measurement across experiments may be uninformative. Normalization is routine in microdialysis studies, because data can be affected by probe placement and factors affecting neurochemical processing. Similar to calcium imaging or many electrophysiological recordings,  the information is based on a comparison to baseline values. We will consider supplying concentration values in supplemental material.</p>
<p>Two reviewers comment on correlations we presented, with different perspectives. We will review our correlation analyses to determine if these are appropriate and what should be reported.</p>
<p>Although Reviewer 2 raises several valid issues that we will address in our response and revision, we believe that none represent “major flaws” in the study that challenge the validity of our central conclusions. In brief, we will:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>provide enhanced description of behaviors</p>
</list-item><list-item><p>clarify or modify box-plot representations of data</p>
</list-item><list-item><p>point to our methods that describe corrections for multiple comparisons</p>
</list-item><list-item><p>clarify sample size concerns</p>
</list-item><list-item><p>address questions of correlation between neurochemicals and behavior</p>
</list-item></list>
<p><bold>Factual Corrections</bold></p>
<p>Two reviewer comments and an associated editorial comment suggest that statistical power is lacking. The reviewer comments are incorrect. If the editorial suggestion is based on those comments, we challenge that as well.</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 states that normalization “creates a baseline period with minimal variation…that could inflate statistical power.” We believe that this statement is incorrect. We will justify elsewhere the rationale for using normalized neurochemical data, but the suggestion that this very common transformation alters statistical power is unwarranted.</p>
<p>Reviewer 2 states, in the 4th Recommendation for the Authors, that sample sizes are too small.  The reviewer gives examples of sample sizes of 3, but that is incorrect. In revising figures, we will ensure that sample numbers appear clearly, but the reviewer’s claim that we used sample size of 3 is not correct. The minimum sample size is 5.</p>
<p>If these reviewer comments are the bases for the editorial recommendation that the manuscript may require additional power, we believe the recommendation is based on incorrect comments.</p>
