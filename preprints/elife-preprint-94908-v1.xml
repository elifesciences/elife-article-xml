<title>Abstract</title><p>In congenital stationary night blindness type 2 (CSNB2)—a disorder involving dysfunction of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel—visual impairment is relatively mild considering that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 mediates synaptic transmission by rod and cone photoreceptors. Here, we addressed this conundrum using a Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 knockout (KO) mouse and a knock-in (KI) mouse expressing a non-conducting Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 mutant. Surprisingly, aberrant Ca<sub>v</sub>3 currents were detected in cones of the KI and KO but not wild-type mice. Cone synapses, which fail to develop in KO mice, are present but enlarged in KI mice. Moreover, light responses in cone pathways and photopic visual behavior are preserved in KI but not in KO mice. In CSNB2, we propose that Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels maintain cone synaptic output provided that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent role of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in cone synaptogenesis remains intact. Our findings reveal an unexpected form of homeostatic plasticity that relies on a non-canonical role of an ion channel.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>At the first synapse in the visual pathway, the light-dependent graded electrical signals produced in rod and cone photoreceptors gates the release of glutamate onto postsynaptic neurons. To accomplish this task, photoreceptor synapses are specialized with a ribbon organelle, which helps prime synaptic vesicles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and postsynaptic dendrites from horizontal and bipolar cells that invaginate deep within the terminal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. A variety of proteins interact with the ribbon and synaptic vesicles near release sites (i.e., active zones) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The importance of these proteins for vision is illustrated by the numerous inherited retinal diseases linked to mutations in their encoding genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>One such gene is <italic>CACNA1F</italic>, which encodes the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>v</sub>) channel expressed in retinal photoreceptors, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Among the sub-family of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.x L-type channels, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 exhibits unusually slow inactivation that is well-matched for supporting the tonic, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release of glutamate from photoreceptor synaptic terminals in darkness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. More than 200 mutations in <italic>CACNA1F</italic> cause vision disorders including congenital stationary night blindness type 2 (CSNB2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. These mutations are broadly categorized as producing a gain of function or loss of function in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. How these mutations in <italic>CACNA1F</italic> lead to the variable clinical phenotypes of CSNB2 is largely unknown. Symptoms may include strabismus, low visual acuity, and in many cases, night blindness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The latter suggests a primary defect in rod pathways, which is surprising given that knockout (KO) mice are completely blind and lack any evidence of either rod or cone synaptic responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. A major caveat is that rod and cone synapses fail to form in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Thus, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice are not suitable for studies of how <italic>CACNA1F</italic> mutations differentially affect rod and cone pathways or for efforts to uncover how the biophysical properties of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 shape photoreceptor synaptic release properties.</p>
<p>Here, we overcome this hurdle with a knock-in mouse strain (G369i KI) expressing a non-conducting mutant form of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. We show that cone ribbon synapses in G369i KI mice are largely preserved and that downstream signaling through cone pathways, although greatly impaired, can support visual function. This novel mechanism requires the ability of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein, independent of its Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance, to nucleate the assembly of cone ribbon synapses and involves an aberrant Ca<sub>v</sub>3 (T-type) conductance that appears when Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are compromised.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in cones are mediated by Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels upon Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 loss-of-function</title>
<p>A prevailing yet unsupported hypothesis regarding the relatively mild visual phenotypes in CSNB2 is that additional Ca<sub>v</sub> subtypes may compensate for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 loss of function in cones. If so, then Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>) mediated by these subtypes should be evident in cones of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO and G369i KI mice. The G369i mutation is an insertion of a glycine residue in a transmembrane domain, which prevents Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation through the channel <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Rods of G369i KI mice lack any evidence of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>, despite the normal presynaptic clustering of the mutant channel <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. To test if this might differ in G369i KI cones, we first analyzed the localization of the mutant G369i Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels in cones by immunofluorescence with antibodies against Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4, as well as cone arrestin (CAR) and CtBP2 to label cone terminals (i.e., pedicles) and ribbons, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mouse retinas, cone pedicles were shrunken and retracted into the outer nuclear layer (ONL, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) and had malformed ribbons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, cone pedicles in G369i KI mice were normally localized in the outer plexiform layer (OPL, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) and were populated by multiple ribbons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). As in WT mice, labeling for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 was clustered near elongated ribbons in cones of G369i KI mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Thus, unlike in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice, the mutant Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein is normally localized and supports the integrity of cone pedicles and ribbons in G369i KI mice.</p>

<p>We next compared patch clamp recordings of cones in retinal slices of adult WT, G369i KI, and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice under conditions designed to isolate <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In WT cones, there was a large, sustained <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> that activated around -50 mV and peaked near -20 mV, consistent with the properties of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-d</xref>). A small-amplitude <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>was detected in cones of G369i KI and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice but activated at significantly more negative voltages than in WT cones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-d</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in the G369i KI and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO cones activated around -60 mV and peaked near -35 mV. This aberrant <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> was not sustained as in WT cones but inactivated rapidly during 50-ms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) and 500-ms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>) step depolarizations. Overlay of the conductance-voltage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>) and inactivation curves (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>) revealed a sizeable window current. These features of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in G369i KI and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO cones resembled those of Ca<sub>v</sub>3 T-type channels rather than Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Although Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels were reported in patch clamp recordings of cone pedicles in WT mouse cones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, we did not observe a low voltage-activated component of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in the I-V curve from our recordings of WT mouse cone somas, which would be indicative of a Ca<sub>v</sub>3 subtype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,c</xref>). Moreover, <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in WT cones was blunted by the Ca<sub>v</sub>1 antagonist isradipine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) but not the Ca<sub>v</sub>3 antagonist, ML 218 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>; ML 218 caused a minor suppression of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in some WT cones, which could be attributed to weak activity on Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig. S1</xref>). In contrast, <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>in G369i KI cones was significantly suppressed by ML 218 but not by isradipine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). To further test for a Ca<sub>v</sub>3 contribution to <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>, we analyzed cones of ground squirrel retina, where the large amplitude of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> facilitates pharmacological analyses. Consistent with its actions on Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in WT mouse cones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) and transfected HEK293T cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig. S1</xref>), ML 218 caused an insignificant inhibition of peak <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> (-7.0 ± 20.8%, n = 6 cones) as well as a negative shift in the voltage-dependence of activation in ground squirrel cones (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig. S2</xref>). As a positive control, we confirmed that ML 218 blocked a prominent Ca<sub>v</sub>3-type current in ground squirrel type 3a OFF cone bipolar cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig. S2</xref>). Application of isradipine followed by ML 218 resulted in a time-and voltage-dependent suppression of the residual <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>, which is a hallmark of Ca<sub>v</sub>1 inhibition by dihyropyridine antagonists such as isradipine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig. S2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Finally, we also performed patch clamp recordings of cone terminals in macaque retina where there was no evidence of a Ca<sub>v</sub>3 current (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig. S3</xref>). We conclude that Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels contribute significantly to <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in cones only when Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are absent.</p>

Along with the major constituents of the ribbon, CtBP2 and RIBEYE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, presynaptic proteins such as bassoon and members of the postsynaptic signaling complex in depolarizing (ON) cone bipolar cells (GPR179, mGluR6, and TRPM1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>) were enriched near cone ribbons in G369i KI mice as in WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Compared to WT mice, the labeled structures occupied a larger volume (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b,c</xref>), albeit at a much lower density (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), which increased linearly with the volume of the pedicle in G369i KI mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e-i</xref>), perhaps as a homeostatic response to Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 loss-of-function.</p>

<p>The cone synapse is structurally complex, with the dendritic tips of two horizontal cells and an intervening ON cone bipolar cell invaginating deeply into the pedicle near the ribbon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. To test how the switch in Ca<sub>v</sub> subtypes might affect this arrangement of postsynaptic partners, we generated 3D reconstructions of cone synapses by serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). As with the enlarged synaptic contacts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), there was some evidence of structural modifications in G369i KI pedicles. Compared to WT pedicles, ribbons appeared disorganized in G369i KI pedicles which extended telodendria laterally rather than apically (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). In addition, a slightly larger fraction of synaptic sites in the G369i KI pedicle (35% vs 14% in WT) formed incorrect postsynaptic partnerships (Fig.5b-d’; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Cone signaling to a postsynaptic partner is intact in G369i KI mice</title>
<p>The preservation of cone synapses in G369i KI mice allowed the unique opportunity to test whether a Ca<sub>v</sub> subtype other than Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 could support ribbon-mediated synaptic release. To this end, we compared synaptic transmission between cones and horizontal cells (HCs, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) in retinal slices of WT and G369i KI mice. In darkness, glutamate released from cones depolarizes horizontal cells via activation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic (AMPA)/kainate receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The resulting excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) undergoes a decline in response to light stimuli that hyperpolarize cones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In WT HCs, a 1 s light pulse (λ=410 nm) inhibited the standing EPSC, which is reflected as an outward (hyperpolarizing “ON”) current (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Upon termination of the light pulse, an inward (depolarizing “OFF”) current signaled the resumption of the EPSC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Both the ON and OFF components of the EPSCs in WT HCs increased with light intensity, reflecting the impact of luminance on the presynaptic membrane potential of cones and the subsequent change in glutamate release from their terminals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). The ON and OFF components of EPSCs in G369i KI HCs were measurable, although lower in amplitude than in WT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). The EPSC in darkness and the light response were abolished by the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, DNQX, in both WT and G369i KI horizontal cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). Thus, while greatly impaired, cone synapses can transmit light information to postsynaptic partners in the retina of G369i KI mice.</p>

<title>Light responses of bipolar cells and visual behavior is spared in G369i KI but not Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice</title>
<p>While horizontal cells act as inhibitory interneurons that modulate photoreceptor output, the vertical dissemination of visual information from cones to the inner retina is relayed by glutamate to ON and OFF cone bipolar cells (CBCs) which express mGluR6 and AMPA/kainate receptors, respectively. To test whether cone synaptic transmission to CBCs is intact in G369i KI mice, we recorded electroretinograms (ERGs) under light-adapted conditions using Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice as a negative control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a-d</xref>). In these recordings, the light-induced response of photoreceptors and the postsynaptic response of ON CBCs corresponds to the a-and b-waves, respectively. Unlike in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice, the a-waves of G369i KI mice were like those in WT mice, which indicates that cones do not degenerate in this mouse strain. While reduced in amplitude, the b-wave was measurable in G369i KI mice and significantly larger than in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice at the highest light intensities (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). We also recorded flicker ERGs using 10 Hz light stimuli that can isolate cone pathways involving both ON and OFF CBCs. In WT mice, flicker responses exhibited two peaks, one at a lower irradiance (-2 log cd·s/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) and one at higher irradiance (0.5 log cd·s/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>). The peak at the lower irradiance is attributed to responses in both rod and cone pathways, and the peak at higher irradiance is attributed to responses exclusively in cone pathways (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c,d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. While significantly lower in amplitude than in WT mice, flicker responses in G369i KI mice showed a similar non-monotonic relation. Compared to Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice, G369i KI mice showed peak flicker responses that did not differ at -2 log cd·s/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, but were significantly higher at 0.5 log cd·s/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> (Fig.7d). The inverted flicker responses at higher illuminations in G369i KI mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>) were absent in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice and may result from the hyperpolarizing contribution of cone-to-OFF CBC transmission. These results suggest that cone-to-CBC signaling is intact in G369i KI mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The nervous system has remarkable abilities to adapt to pathological perturbations in neuronal activity. In the retina, ablation or degeneration of photoreceptors triggers various postsynaptic mechanisms that maintain some level of visual function in rod or cone pathways. These include remodeling of bipolar cell dendrites and their synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> as well as changes in the sensitivity of bipolar cells to photoreceptor input and inhibitory modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence for a presynaptic form of homeostatic plasticity that originates within photoreceptors. Using Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO and G369i KI mice, we identify the upregulation of a Ca<sub>v</sub>3 conductance as a common response to Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 loss-of-function in cones. However, Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels can only compensate for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 loss-of-function when cone synapse structure is maintained. Thus, our results also highlight a crucial, non-conducting role for the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein that allows cone synapses to function in the absence of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>A non-canonical role for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in regulating cone synapse assembly</title>
<p>A major finding of our study is that cone synapse formation requires the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein but not Ca<sub>v</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. As shown for rod synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, ribbons and other components of the pre-and post-synaptic complex assemble normally at cone synapses in G369i mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>,<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>,5). Ca<sub>v</sub>3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are dispensable for this process since their presence in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO cones is not accompanied by any semblance of ribbon synapses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>). An intimate relationship between Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 and ribbons is supported by the colocalization of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 and RIBEYE puncta resembling ribbon precursor spheres in the developing OPL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Moreover, light adaptation, which decreases the size of the ribbon, leads to a reduction in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 labeling in mouse retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. While evidence for the binding of RIBEYE to Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 is lacking, such an interaction could support the oligomerization of RIBEYE A and B domain within a macromolecular complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Alternatively, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 could pioneer sites of ribbon assembly perhaps by serving as a docking or nucleation site for the active zone. Regardless of the mechanism, our findings show that the formation of photoreceptor synaptic complexes does not require Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels.</p>
<p>Despite a normal molecular organization, G369i KI cone synapses were enlarged and made errors in postsynaptic partner selection. While I-V curves predict similar peak <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> amplitudes in cones of WT and G369i KI mice near the membrane potential of cones in darkness (-45 to -50 mV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, Fig.1c), the strong inactivation of Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels predicts greatly diminished Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in G369i KI pedicles. Paradoxically, reductions in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in rod photoreceptors are thought to cause illumination-dependent shrinkage of ribbons <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. However, an inverse correlation between presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and ribbon synapse size is seen in sensory hair cells in zebrafish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. The mechanism involves decreased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and increase in the redox state of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. If a similar mechanism applied in cones, Ca<sub>v</sub>3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in G369i KI cones may decay too quickly to enable mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake mechanisms that trim ribbons. The size of ribbons and the postsynaptic specialization increased linearly with pedicle volume in G369i KI but not in WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e-i</xref>), which could represent a form of homeostatic synaptic scaling as has been demonstrated at the neuromuscular junction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Similarly, the presence of some non-invaginating contacts with incorrect partner pairings in G369i KI mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) could represent a compensatory response to weakened synaptic output. Considering that only a subset of CBC subtypes re-wire correctly following partial ablation of cones in immature mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, the structurally normal cone synapses of G369i KI mice could involve contacts with CBCs that are unusually resilient to loss of presynaptic input.</p>
<p>While it is well-established that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 is the main Ca<sub>v</sub> subtype in mouse cones, Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels, in particular Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2, have been reported to be expressed in mouse cones by electrophysiology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and single cell RNA-seq studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. By pharmacological and other criteria, we found no evidence for a functional contribution of Ca<sub>v</sub>3 in our recordings of cones in WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>,<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), ground squirrels, or macaque (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp.Figs. S2</xref>,<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>). A caveat of using dihydropyridine antagonists such as isradipine to isolate the contribution of Ca<sub>v</sub>1 from other Ca<sub>v</sub> subtypes is the relatively low sensitivity of Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channels to these drugs and their strong voltage-dependence. At a holding voltage of -90 mV, isradipine at 1 μM causes only ∼80% inhibition of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 with greater block at depolarized voltages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, which agrees with our recordings of cones in WT mice (Fig.3a) and ground squirrels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3d</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig.S2</xref>). Moreover, Ca<sub>v</sub>3 blockers such as Z944 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and ML218 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig. S2</xref>) have additional activity on Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channels at micromolar concentrations including effects on current amplitude and activation voltage. Thus, currents mediated by Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 that are sensitive to Ca<sub>v</sub>3 blockers (e.g, &gt;5 µM ML218) and spared by dihydropyridines at negative voltages may be mistaken as being mediated by Ca<sub>v</sub>3. In our experiments, the biophysical properties of the isradipine-sensitive <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>in cones of WT mice and ground squirrels resembled only those of Ca<sub>v</sub>1, whereas those of the ML218-sensitive <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in cones of G369i KI mice resembled only those of Ca<sub>v</sub>3. Therefore, we favor the interpretation that Ca<sub>v</sub>3 contributes to <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in mouse cones only upon silencing of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance.</p>
<p>Consistent with the diminutive Ca<sub>v</sub>3-mediated <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>, light responses of HCs were evident but smaller in G369i KI than in WT mice. Due to their slow activation and strong inactivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels may have a reduced ability to fuel the Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomains that support fast and sustained components of release, both of which occur only at ribbon sites in cones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels may also be located further from the ribbon than Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4, thus lowering the efficiency of coupling to exocytosis. Unfortunately, it was not possible to test this with commercially available antibodies against Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2, which yielded identical patterns of immunofluorescence in the OPL of WT and Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 KO mice (data not shown). A detailed analysis of the Ca<sub>v</sub>3 subtype(s) and their subcellular localization in G369i KI cones is required to unravel the shortcomings of Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels with respect to cone synaptic release.</p>
<p>Based on extremely heterogeneous clinical presentations, CSNB2 manifests as a spectrum of visual disorders that originate from various mutations in <italic>CACNA1F</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Even though some CSNB2 mutant Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels may traffic normally to the plasma membrane, many of these mutations are expected to produce non-functional, non-conducting Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> Yet, the visual phenotypes of CSNB2 patients are not as severe as the complete blindness in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice, which lack any Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein expression and exhibit no signs of visual behavior (Fig.7e,f)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Collectively, our results suggest that G369i KI mice accurately model Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channelopathies in CSNB2 patients that are characterized by a greater impairment in rod than in cone pathways. This interpretation is supported by our findings that G369i KI mice exhibit horizontal cell responses to bright but not dim illumination (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), ERG responses under conditions of light adaptation (Fig.7a-d) but not dark-adaptation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and visual behavior under photopic but not scotopic conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). Together with the enlargement of synaptic sites, modest levels of synaptic release from cones of G369i KI mice may be sufficient to support nominal transmission of visual information through cone pathways. Furthermore, we acknowledge that G369i KI mice could also exhibit homeostatic alterations in the inner retina, which are known to support visual function when photoreceptor input is severely compromised <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Future studies of the retinal circuitry and visual behavior of G369i KI mice could identify compensatory pathways that are recruited upon Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 loss-of-function and how they might be targeted in novel therapies for CSNB2 and related disorders.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Mice between 6-8 weeks of age were anesthetized using isoflurane and euthanized by cervical dislocation. Eyes were enucleated and hemisected. The eye cups with retina were fixed on ice in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) for 30 min. Fixed eye cups were then washed three times with 0.1 M PB containing 1% glycine followed by infusion of 30% sucrose at 4°C overnight. The eye cups were orientated along their dorsal-ventral axis and frozen in a 1:1 (wt/vol) mixture of Optimal Cutting Temperature compound and 30% sucrose in a dry ice/isopentane bath. Eye cups were cryosectioned at 20 µm on a Leica CM1850 cryostat (Leica Microsystems), mounted on Superfrost plus Micro Slides (VWR), dried for 5 to 10 min at 42°C, and stored at -20°C until used. Slides with mounted cryosections were warmed to room temperature, washed with 0.1 M PB for 30 min to remove the OCT/sucrose mixture and blocked with dilution solution (DS, 0.1 M PB/10% goat serum/0.5% Triton-X100) for 15 min or overnight at room temperature. All remaining steps were carried out at room temperature. All primary antibodies and appropriate secondary antibodies were diluted in DS at concentrations specified in the Key Resources Table (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Sections were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h or overnight and then washed five times with 0.1 M PB. Sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min and then washed five times with 0.1 M PB. Trace 0.1 M PB was removed, and sections were then mounted with #1.5H coverslips (ThorLabs) using ProLong Glass Antifade Mountant with or without NucBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>

<p>For double labeling with other rabbit polyclonal antibodies, CAR antibodies were conjugated with the CF647 fluorophore (CAR-647) using the Mix-n-Stain antibody labeling kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Biotium). Sections were processed first with rabbit polyclonal Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 or EAAT2 antibodies and corresponding secondary antibodies as described above. To prevent CAR-647 from binding to any available sites on the anti-rabbit secondary antibodies previously added to the sections, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4 or EAAT2 antibodies were readded to the sections and incubated for 30 min. After washing, the sections were incubated with CAR-647 for 1 h, followed by wash steps and cover glass mounting.</p>
<p>Immunofluorescence in labeled retinal sections was visualized using an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an UPlanApo 60x oil HR objective (1.5 NA). Images were captured using the Olympus FLUOVIEW software package. Acquisition settings were optimized using a saturation mask to prevent signal saturation prior to collecting 16 -bit. All confocal images presented are maximum z-projections. Images (256 x 256 pixels) used in analyses of synaptic proteins were collected using a 30X optical zoom, 0.6 Airy disk aperture, and voxel size of 0.028 <italic>μm</italic> × 0.028 <italic>μm</italic> × 0.2 <italic>μm</italic> (<italic>X</italic> × <italic>Y</italic> × <italic>Z</italic>). Amira segmentation was used for generating 3D binary masks, and Amira 3D label analysis was used for quantification of immunofluorescent and masked images. Non-deconvolved images were used for all analyses. 3D binary masks of individual CAR-labeled pedicles were made by setting the threshold 1 standard deviation above mean fluorescence intensity of each 3D image. 3D binary masks of presynaptic labels (CtBP2, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4, and Bassoon) or postsynaptic labels (GPR179, mGluR6, and TRPM1) within or associated with the pedicle, respectively, were made by setting the threshold 3 standard deviations above the mean fluorescence intensity. To aid in presentation, high-mag images displayed in Figs.3f, 4a, and 6f were deconvolved using cellSens software (Olympus), and any immunofluorescence corresponding to rod synaptic proteins was subtracted from the image.</p>

<title>Patch clamp electrophysiology</title>
<p>Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of transfected HEK293T cells were performed 48 to 72 hrs after transfection using an EPC-10 amplifier and Patchmaster software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Patch pipette electrodes with a tip resistance between 4 and 6 MΩ were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) using a P-97 Flaming/Brown Puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). A reference Ag/AgCl wire was placed into the culture dish mounted on an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope. Recordings were performed at room temperature. A pressurized perfusion pencil multi-barrel manifold controlled with Valve Bank II (AutoMate Scientific, Inc., Berkeley, CA) was used to deliver extracellular solutions. ML218 of different concentrations (0.5, 1, 5, 25 and 100 mM) was added to the extracellular solution the day of experiments. Series resistance was compensated up to 70%, and passive membrane leak subtraction was conducted using a P/−4 protocol. Whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub>) of transfected HEK293T cells were evoked for 50 ms with incremental +5 mV steps from -80 mV to +65 mV. Current-Voltage (IV) data were fit with a single Boltzmann equation: <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> = <italic>G<sub>max</sub>(V<sub>m</sub>-V<sub>r</sub></italic>)/(1+exp[-(<italic>V<sub>m</sub>-V<sub>h</sub>))/k</italic>]), where G<sub>max</sub> is the maximal conductance, <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> is the test voltage, <italic>V<sub>r</sub></italic>is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> reversal potential, <italic>V<sub>h</sub></italic> is the membrane potential required to activate 50% of <italic>G<sub>max</sub></italic>, and k is the slope factor. Data were sampled at 100 kHz, filtered at 3 kHz, and analyzed using custom programs written in IgroPro (WaveMetrics).</p>
<p>Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of mouse cones, macaque cone terminals, and mouse horizontal cells were performed using an EPC-10 amplifier and Patchmaster software (HEKA). Patch pipette electrodes with a tip resistance between 10 and 14 MΩ for cones and 6-8 for horizontal cells were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass (1.5 mm outer diameter; 0.84 mm inner diameter; World Precision Instruments).</p>
<p>To prepare retinal slices, adult mice (6 – 8 weeks old) were anesthetized using isoflurane and euthanized by cervical dislocation. Eyes were enucleated, placed into cold Ames’ media slicing solution, and hemisected. Following removal of the vitreous, the eye cup was separated into dorsal and ventral halves using a scalpel. Ventral retina was isolated, molded into low-melt agarose and mounted in a Leica VT1200s vibratome (Leica Biosystems). Mouse retina slicing solution was continuously bubbled with 100% O<sub>2</sub> and contained the following: Ames’ Medium with L-glutamine supplemented with (in mM) 15 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, pH 7.4, osmolarity 300 mOsm/kg. Vertical (∼200 µm) or horizontal (∼160 µm) retinal slices were anchored in a recording chamber, placed onto a fixed stage, and positioned under an upright Olympus BX51WI microscope equipped with a 60X water-immersion objective (1.0 NA), and superfused with extracellular solution (flow rate of ∼1-2 ml/min) at room temperature. Slices were visualized using IR-DIC optics and an IR-2000 (Dage MTI, Michigan City, IN) or SciCam Pro (Scientifica, Uckfield, United Kingdom) CCD camera controlled by the IR-capture software package or µManager, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Drugs used in these experiments were added to the mouse extracellular solution the day of experiments at the concentration described in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. A reference Ag/AgCl pellet electrode was placed directly into the recording chamber solution. Data from whole-cell recordings with a series resistance &gt;20 MΩ were discarded.</p>

<p>Cone somas were identified based on their morphology and location (outer ONL cell layer). Cone identity was confirmed by the whole-cell capacitance (∼3-4 pF), which is larger than rod whole-cell capacitance (∼0.7-1 pF). For cone voltage ramp recordings, cones were held at - 90 mV for 200 ms followed by a ramp of +0.5 mV/ms to +40 mV. To determine voltage activation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub>, whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in cones were evoked for 50 ms with incremental +5 mV steps from -80 mV to +40 mV. The activation voltage of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> is reported as G/G<sub>max</sub>, where G is the conductance at each test voltage and G<sub>max</sub> is the maximum peak conductance for each cone. Conductance was calculated using the equation <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> = G(V<sub>m</sub>-V<sub>r</sub>), where V<sub>r</sub> is +60 mV. To determine steady state inactivation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub>, currents in cones were evoked for 500 ms with incremental +5 mV steps from -90 mV and -30 mV followed by a final step to -30 mV for 50 ms after each test voltage. The steady state inactivation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> is reported as <italic>I/I<sub>max</sub></italic>, where <italic>I</italic> is the peak current in the final voltage step to -30 mV and <italic>I<sub>max</sub></italic>is the maximum peak current for each cone. Data were sampled between 20 and 60 kHz and filtered at 3 kHz.</p>
<p>For horizontal cell light responses, horizontal slices were prepared from central mouse retina. The identity of horizontal cells was determined based on their larger soma diameter (∼15 μm) compared to bipolar cell somas (∼6 μm). During whole cell patch clamp recordings, horizontal cells were held at -70 mV. Light stimuli (1 s) at 410 nm (630 x 830 μm) were presented onto the retina (at a minimum of 5 s intervals) through the microscope’s condenser using a Polygon1000 DMD pattern illuminator (Mightex, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and a custom-built light path. Light intensity (in watts) was measured at the point on the microscope stage where the retina is placed using a power meter (Thorlabs, Newton, New Jersey, USA). Photon flux Ф<italic><sub>q</sub></italic> (photons/s) within the light stimulus area was calculated using the measured light intensities in the formula:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="570129v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where <italic>h</italic> is Planck’s constant (J*s), <italic>c</italic> is the speed of light (m/s), and λ is the wavelength (m). Light stimulus intensity was increased in Log2 steps from 4.9x10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> to 2.1x10<sup>5</sup> Ф<italic><sub>q</sub></italic>/μm<sub>2</sub>. For each light intensity step, both ON and OFF current amplitudes were measured from baseline (averaged 5 ms of current prior to light onset) to the maximum positive (after light onset) or maximum negative (after light offset) current, respectively. To confirm the identity of these horizontal cell light responses as AMPA-mediated currents, 1 s light stimuli (410 nm, 1.2x10<sub>5</sub> Ф<italic><sub>q</sub></italic>/μm<sub>2</sub>) were continuously delivered every 10 s before, during and after bath application of 20 μM DNQX.</p>
<p>For voltage clamp recordings of 13-lined ground squirrel cones, retinal slices were prepared as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. The eyecup was divided along the dorsal to ventral axis into superior, middle, and inferior parts. The dorsal area above the line of the optic nerve head was defined as superior, the central region with a width of about 5 mm just ventral to the optic nerve head was middle, and the remaining ventral area was inferior. Isradipine and ML218, alone or in combination, were applied from separate puffer pipettes whose orifices were aimed at the cone synaptic region. Recordings were made with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Signals were electronically filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at a rate of 10 kHz. Additional Gaussian filtering was added (cutoff frequency of 500 Hz). Tissue was viewed through a 63x water immersion objective on a Zeiss Axioskop FS2 microscope and superfused with extracellular solution at room temperature. Drugs and their concentrations used during these experiments are described in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Membrane potential was continuously maintained at -85 mV. During ramp stimulation, the membrane potential was depolarized to -85 to +35 mV at a rate of 1 mV/ms.</p>
<p>For rhesus macaque cone terminal recordings, a 12-year-old male was sedated with ketamine (5 mg/kg I.M.) and dexmedetomidine (0.015 mg/kg I.M.). Post-sedation, the animal received buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg I.M.), atropine (0.02 mg/kg I.M.), and maropitant citrate (1 mg/kg S.Q.). The animal was intubated and maintained with inhaled isoflurane (0.75-2.0%) and propofol (7-8 mg/kg/hr I.V.). Crystalloid fluids (5 mL/kg/hr) were administered I.V., and phenylephrine (5-10 mcg/kg/hr I.V.) was used for blood pressure support. The animal was under anesthesia for approximately 3 hours prior to perfusion. Transcardial perfusion was approached through a midline thoracotomy. Immediately prior to perfusion, 5 mL of Euthasol® (sodium pentobarbital 390 mg/mL/phenytoin sodium 50 mg/mL) was administered I.V. The descending thoracic aorta was clamped, the pericardium was opened, and the right atrium was cut. The apex of the left ventricle was sharply incised, and a large bore cannula (Yankauer suction handle, 5 mm internal diameter) was inserted through the left ventricle until it could be palpated in the ascending aorta. The cannula was clamped in place at the apex of the left ventricle. The animal was perfused with 4000 mL of cold phosphate-buffered saline at ∼500 mL/min. Eyes were removed approximately 1 hour following perfusion. Eyes were dissected, and eye cups were allowed to dark adapt for ∼30 min and stored in bicarbonate buffered Ames’ media at 32°C equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> prior to slice preparations. Vertical sections of central retina were prepared from 5 mm retina punches as described for mice.</p>

<title>Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy and 3D reconstructions</title>
<p>Eye cups were prepared from P42 WT and G369i KI littermates and fixed using 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 4 hours at room temperature followed by additional fixation overnight at 4°C. Glutaraldehyde-fixed eye cups were then washed 3 times in 0.1M cacodylate buffer. Retinas were thereafter isolated and embedded in Durcupan resin after staining, dehydration, and embedding as described previously (Della Santina et al., 2016). A Thermo Scientific VolumeScope serial block face scanning electron micrscope was used to image embedded retinas. Retinal regions comprising a 2x2 montage of 40.96 μm tiles were imaged at a resolution of 5nm/pixel and section thickness of 50 nm. Image stacks were aligned, and cone photoreceptor terminals reconstructed using TrakEM2 (NIH). Postsynaptic partners at cone ribbons were followed to the inner nuclear layer to determine their identity. Amira software was used for 3D visualization of reconstructed profiles.</p>

<title>Electroretinography</title>
<p>Retinal function was assessed using the Celeris system (Diagnosys, Inc.) paired with the Espion software (Diagnosys, Inc.). Mice were anaesthetized under red light (660 nm) via intraperitoneal (I.P.) injection with ketamine/xylazine mixture (100 mg/kg ketamine, 10 mg/kg xylazine). Tropicamide ophthalmic solution (1 %) and hypromellose lubricant eye gel (0.3 %) were administered topically to both eyes before the mouse was secured to a heated (37 °C) platform to maintain body temperature. Ag/AgCl corneal stimulators were placed on each eye. After collecting data from individual mice, atipamezole (Antisedan, 1-2 mg/kg) was I.P. injection administered to reverse the effects of the ketamine and xylazine. For photopic ERGs, eyes were light adapted using a background green light at 20 cd·s/m<sup>2</sup> for 10 min. Following light adaptation, eight different light intensity pulses (-0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.3 and 2.6 log cd·s/m<sup>2</sup>) were delivered on top of the background green light. ERG a-waves were measured from baseline to the peak of the negative potential. ERG b-waves were measured from the peak of the a-wave to the peak of the positive potential. For flickering ERGs, mice were dark adapted (&gt;12 hrs). White light pulses from -4 to 2.5 log cd·s/m<sup>2</sup> were delivered in 0.5 log unit steps at 10 Hz. Response amplitudes were measured from the trough to the peak of each response at all light intensities. Each intensity stimulus was delivered 10 times, with a 3 s interval between each stimulus, and averaged. The mean response amplitudes recorded in the right and left eye of each mouse are reported for all quantified ERG data.</p>

<title>Visible platform swim test</title>
<p>The visible platform swim test was performed as has been previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. WT, G369i KI, and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO male and female mice (6-9 weeks old) were adapted to the procedure room for at least 1 h prior to beginning the experiments. A water-filled, 4-foot diameter galvanized steel tank and a visible white platform with a diameter of 10 cm was used for the swim test. Mice were subjected to 6 swim trials per day. Assays conducted under photopic (55 lux) and scotopic conditions (0 lux) were performed on days 1 and 2, respectively. Light intensity for photopic and scotopic conditions was measured at the platform using an Extech HD450 light meter (FLIR Systems, Nashua, New Hampshire). Mice were given 90 s to find the platform before being removed. After one trial was performed on all mice, the platform was moved to one of three different locations, top left, top center, and top right in relation to the initial site of mouse placement in tank. Each trial was recorded using an infrared camera (Basler AG, Ahrensburg, Germany) and EthoVision XT16 software (Noldus Information Technology). Locating the platform was considered successful when mice contacted the platform with a head-on approach, even if mice failed to escape onto the platform. Mice were allowed to rest on the platform for 15 s at the end of each trial before being returned to a pre-warmed cage. Latency to find the platform was manually recorded and confirmed using recorded videos. Male and female mice were tested separately, and no sex differences in performance were identified post-hoc using two-way RM-ANOVA (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Male and female data were combined into a single group for each genotype. Latency to platform was calculated by averaging the final 3 trials under scotopic and photopic conditions for each mouse and compared using Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA with Dunn’s posthoc multiple comparison test.</p>

<p>Based on analyses of retinae from genetically modified mice, and from wild-type ground squirrel and macaque employing microscopic imaging, electrophysiology, and pharmacological manipulations, this <bold>useful</bold> study on the role of Cav1.4 calcium channels in cone photoreceptor cells (i) shows that the expression of a Cav1.4 variant lacking calcium conductivity supports the development of cone synapses beyond what is observed in the complete absence of Cav1.4, and (ii) indicates that the cone pathway can partially operate even without calcium flux through Cav1.4 channels, thus preserving behavioral responses under bright light. The evidence for the function of Cav1.4 protein in synapse development is <bold>convincing</bold>, and in agreement with a closely related earlier study by the same authors on rod photoreceptors, but the evidential support for the notion of a homeostatic compensation of Cav1.4 loss by Cav3 is <bold>incomplete</bold>. As congenital Cav1.4 dysfunction can cause stationary night blindness, this work relates to a wide range of neuroscience topics, from synapse biology to neuro-ophthalmology.</p>

<p>Cav1.4 calcium channels control voltage-dependent calcium influx at photoreceptor synapses, and congenital loss of Cav1.4 function causes stationary night blindness CSNB2. Based on a broad portfolio of methodological approaches - genetic mouse models, immunolabeling and microscopic imaging, serial block-face-SEM, ERGs, and electrophysiology - the authors show that cone photoreceptor synapse development is strongly perturbed in the absence of Cav1.4 protein, and that expression of a nonconducting Cav1.4 channel mitigates these perturbations. Further data indicate that Cav3 channels are present, which, according to the authors, may compensate for the loss of Cav1.4 calcium currents and thus maintain cone synaptic transmission. These data, which are in agreement with a similar study by the same authors on rod photoreceptor synapses, help to explain what functional defects exactly cause CSNB2 and why it is accompanied by only mild visual impairment.</p>
<p>The strengths of the present study are its conceptual and experimental soundness, the broad spectrum of cutting-edge methodological approaches pursued, and the convincing differential analysis of mutant phenotypes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses mainly concern the experiments and arguments leading to the authors' notion that Cav3 channels may partially compensate for the loss of Cav1.4 calcium currents in cone synapses. It is possible that the non-conducting Cav1.4 variant supports synapse development and the Cav3 channel then provides the calcium influx. However, in its current state, the study does not unequivocally assess Cav3 expression in wild-type cones, it lacks direct evidence of Cav3 expression and upregulation, e.g. via single cell transcriptomics, immunolabeling, or an elaboration on electrophysiology, and it does not test the authors' earlier idea that Cav1.4 might couple to intracellular calcium stores at photoreceptor synapses</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This paper by Maddox et al. presents the results of a study of Ca channel function in mouse cone photoreceptor synaptic terminals. It builds on earlier work by the same authors (Maddox et al. 2020 in eLife) which demonstrated that a non-conducting but voltage-sensing variant of Cav1.4 (G369i knock-in, or KI) could substitute for WT Cav1.4 to promote relatively normal rod synapse development despite an inability to support Ca2+-dependent glutamatergic transmission to postsynaptic bipolar cells. Cav1.4 knock-out (KO) rod synapses, however, were completely disorganized, indicating that the presence of Cav1.4 protein is critical for synaptic organization. Here, the authors extend their study of the G369i-KI retina to demonstrate that G369i-KI cones develop working (though disrupted and sometimes aberrant) synapses that support some visual function owing to compensatory expression of Cav3-containing Ca channels that can mediate some Ca2+-dependent transmission from cones to postsynaptic cells. This compensatory expression of a low voltage-activated Ca conductance was not noted previously (Maddox et al. 2020) in G369i-KI rods.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
In all, this is a scientifically sound study that shows obvious differences between synaptic terminal morphology and organization, macroscopic Ca currents, transmission to postsynaptic horizontal and bipolar cells (with whole-cell recording and ERG, respectively), and visually-guided behavior in experimental groups.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The major criticism that I have of the study is that it infers Ca channel molecular composition based solely on pharmacological analysis, which, as the authors note, is confounded by the cross-reactivity of many of the &quot;specific&quot; channel-type antagonists. The authors note that Cav3 mRNAs have been found in cones, but here, they do not perform any analysis to examine Cav3 transcript expression after G369i-KI nor do they examine Ca channel transcript expression in monkey or squirrel cones, which serve as controls of sorts for the G369i-KI (i.e. like WT mouse cones, cones of these other species do not seem to exhibit LVA Ca currents).</p>
<p>Secondarily, in Maddox et al. 2020, the authors raise the possibility that G369i-KI, by virtue of having a functional voltage-sensing domain-might couple to intracellular Ca2+ stores, and it seems appropriate that this possibility be considered experimentally here.</p>
<p>As a minor point: the authors might wish to note - in comparison to another retinal ribbon synapse-that Zhang et al. 2022 (in J. Neuroscience) performed a study of mouse rod bipolar cells found a number of LVA and HVA Ca conductances in addition to the typical L-type conductance mediated by Cav1-containing channels.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
This is an important study that tests the hypothesis that Cav1.4 calcium channels do more than provide a voltage-dependent influx of Ca2+ into photoreceptors. The relevant background can be divided into two tranches. First, deletion of Cav1.4 channels (Cav1.4 knock-out) disrupts rod and cone photoreceptors and their synapses in the outer plexiform layer. Second, knock-in of a non-conducting Cav1.4 channel (Cav1.4 knock-in) partially spares the organization of the outer plexiform layer and photoreceptor synapses (Maddox et al., eLife 2020), which is remarkable considering the disruption of the outer plexiform layer in the Cav1.4 knock-out. In addition, phototransduction, assessed by scotopic and phototopic electroretinography (a-wave amplitude) in the Cav1.4 knock-in retina was partially spared for rods and only slightly impaired for cones. However, the non-conducting Cav1.4 channel of the Cav1.4 knock-in failed to rescue synaptic transmission across the outer retina (electroretinography: b-wave amplitude, Maddox et al., eLife 2020). The 2020 Maddox et al. (eLife) focused more on the rod pathway, while the current work addressed the cone pathway.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
The study addresses the important question of how disruption of Cav1.4 function in both rod and cone photoreceptors leads to impairment primarily of the rod pathway for scotopic vision. This is clinically relevant as human mutations lead to stationary night blindness rather than blindness. The work relevance provides excellent single-cell electrophysiological recordings of Ca2+ currents from cones of wild-type, Cav1.4 knock-out, and Cav1.4 knock-in mice and, in addition, from ground squirrel and monkey cones. To make these recordings successfully in the various species and the compromised retinas (Cav1.4 knock-out and Cav1.4 knock-in) is very impressive. The findings clearly advance our understanding of Ca2+ channel function in cones. In addition, the study presents high-quality electron microscopy reconstructions of cones and further physiological and behavioral data related to the cone pathway.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>
The major critiques are related to the description of the Cav1.4 knock-in mouse as &quot;sparing&quot; function, which can be remedied in part by a simple rewrite, and in certain places, the data may need to be examined more critically. In particular, the authors should address features in the data presented in Figures 6 and 7 that seem to indicate that the retina of the Cav1.4 knock-in is not intact, but the interpretation given by the authors as &quot;intact&quot; is not appropriate and made without rigorous statistical testing.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Cav1.4 voltage-gated calcium channels play an important role in neurotransmission at mammalian photoreceptor synapses. Mutations in the CACNA1f gene lead to congenital stationary night blindness that particularly affects the rod pathway. Mouse Cav1.4 knockout and Cav1.4 knockin models suggest that Cav1.4 is also important for the cone pathway. Deletion of Cav1.4 in the knockout models leads to signaling malfunctions and to abundant morphological re-arrangements of the synapse suggesting that the channel not only has a role in the influx of Ca2+ but also in the morphological organization of the photoreceptor synapse. Of note, also additional Cav-channels have been previously detected in cone synapses by different groups, including L-type Cav1.3 (Wu et al., 2007; pmid; Kersten et al., 2020; pmid), and also T-type Cav3.2 (Davison et al., 2021; pmid 35803735).</p>
<p>In order to study a conductivity-independent role of Cav1.4 in the morphological organization of photoreceptor synapses, the authors generated the knockin (KI) mouse Cav1.4 G369i in a previous study (Maddox et al., eLife 2020; pmid 32940604). The Cav1.4 G369i KI channel no longer works as a Ca2+-conducting channel due to the insertion of a glycine in the pore-forming unit (Madox et al. elife 2020; pmid 32940604). In this previous study (Madox et al. elife 2020; pmid 32940604), the authors analyzed Cav1.4 G369i in rod photoreceptor synapses. In the present study, the authors analyzed cone synapses in this KI mouse.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the authors performed a comprehensive set of experimental methods including immunohistochemistry with antibodies (also with quantitative analyses), electrophysiological measurements of presynaptic Ca2+ currents from cone photoreceptors in the presence/absence of inhibitors of L-type- and T-type- calcium channels, electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), ERG recordings and visual behavior tests of the Cav G369i KI in comparison to the Cav1.4 knockout and wild-type control mice.</p>
<p>The authors found that the non-conducting Cav channel is properly localized in cone synapses and demonstrated that there are no gross morphological alterations (e.g., sprouting of postsynaptic components that are typically observed in the Cav1.4 knockout). These findings demonstrate that cone synaptogenesis relies on the presence Cav1.4 protein but not on its Ca2+ conductivity. This result, obtained at cone synapses in the present study, is similar to the previously reported results observed for rod synapses (Maddox et al., eLife 2020, pmid 32940604). No further mechanistic insights or molecular mechanisms were provided that demonstrated how the presence of the Cav channels could orchestrate the building of the cone synapse.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study has been expertly performed. A comprehensive set of experimental methods including immunohistochemistry with antibodies (also with quantitative analyses), electrophysiological measurements of presynaptic Ca2+ currents from cone photoreceptors in the presence/absence of inhibitors of L-type- and T-type- calcium channels, electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), ERG recordings and visual behavior tests of the Cav G369i KI in comparison to the Cav1.4 knockout and wild-type control mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The study has been expertly performed but remains descriptive without deciphering the underlying molecular mechanisms of the observed phenomena, including the proposed homeostatic switch of synaptic calcium channels. Furthermore, a relevant part of the data in the present paper (presence of T-type calcium channels in cone photoreceptors) has already been identified/presented by previous studies of different groups (Macosko et al., 2015; pmid 26000488; Davison et al., 2021; pmid 35803735; Williams et al., 2022; pmid 35650675). The degree of novelty of the present paper thus appears limited.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers and editor for their careful analysis of our manuscript and their appreciation of its strengths. Our plans to address the reviewers’ concerns regarding the weaknesses of the study are outlined below.</p>

<p>“Weaknesses mainly concern the experiments and arguments leading to the authors' notion that Cav3 channels may partially compensate for the loss of Cav1.4 calcium currents in cone synapses. It is possible that the non-conducting Cav1.4 variant supports synapse development and the Cav3 channel then provides the calcium influx. However, in its current state, the study does not unequivocally assess Cav3 expression in wild-type cones, it lacks direct evidence of Cav3 expression and upregulation, e.g. via single cell transcriptomics, immunolabeling, or an elaboration on electrophysiology, and it does not test the authors' earlier idea that Cav1.4 might couple to intracellular calcium stores at photoreceptor synapses.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Current transcriptomic studies indicate that Cav3 transcripts are present at extremely low levels compared to that for Cav1.4 in cones of young mice (PMID 26000488, summarized in PMID 35650675), adult mice (PMID: 36807640), macaque (PMID 30712875), and human (PMID 31075224). Thus, it was somewhat surprising that Davison et al reported the presence of low voltage activated (LVA) Cav3-like currents with amplitudes that were ~50% of that for the Cav1 current in mouse cones at -40 mV (PMID 35803735). Using similar pharmacological criteria as Davison et al, we did not find functional evidence for a LVA current in cones of wild-type (WT) mouse retina: the Ca2+ current in our recordings was suppressed by the Cav1 antagonist isradipine (Fig 3a) but minimally affected in the expected voltage range by the Cav3 antagonist ML218 (Fig 3b). In WT mouse, voltage clamp steps from -90 mV to more depolarized voltages failed to show a transient inward current at onset (Fig 2e), which is a hallmark of LVA calcium currents. In addition, by standard physiological and pharmacological critera, we could not identify LVA currents in cones of ground squirrel (Fig.3c,d) and macaque retina (Supp. Fig.S3).  Our results argue against a significant role for LVA currents in mammalian cones.</p>
<p>A problem that we discovered (as did Davison et al, their Fig.2C) was that Cav3 blockers (e.g., ML218 and Z944) have non-specific actions on the high voltage activated (HVA) Ca2+ current (presumably mediated by Cav1.4) in WT mouse cones. This is clearly shown in our Supp. figure S1a-b where ML218 causes a dose-dependent negative shift in the I-V relationship but also inhibition of current density in HEK293T cells transfected with Cav1.4. We are planning a second study to thoroughly characterize these actions of ML218 and Z944 on Cav1 channels as the results are important for understanding the actions of these drugs in cell-types with mixed populations of Cav1 and Cav3 channels.</p>
<p>A second problem is that dihydropyridines (DHP) used in both our study and that of Davison et al (e.g., isradipine, nifedipine) incompletely and slowly block Cav1 channels at negative membrane potentials (PMID: 12853422). Due to the slow kinetics of DHP block, Cav1 currents in the presence of such blockers can appear to inactivate rapidly (see Fig.6A in PMID 11487617). Thus, the Cav current recorded in the presence of DHP blockers in WT mouse cones may represent unblocked Cav1.4-mediated currents that appear rapidly inactivating, and therefore misconstrued as being mediated by Cav3 channels.</p>
<p>Given the caveats of the pharmacological approach, we agree that stronger evidence is needed to rule out a small contribution of Cav3 channels in WT mouse cones. As mentioned in our text, we have found that currently available Cav3 antibodies produce similar patterns of immunofluorescence in WT and corresponding Cav3 KO retina so analysis at the level of Cav proteins is not possible. Thus, we are planning to compare the relative expression of Cav channel genes in cones using drop-seq experiments of G369i KI and WT mouse retina. We also plan to elaborate on our electrophysiological dissection of the HVA and LVA currents.</p>
<p>Among the 3 Cav3 subtypes, Cav3.2 was the only one detected in mouse cones by Davison et al using nested RT-PCR (PMID 35803735). Thus, we obtained the Cav3.2 mouse strain from JAX (B6;129-Cacna1htm1Kcam/J) and generated a Cav3.2 KO/G369i KI double mutant mouse strain. If the Cav3 current that appears in the G369i KI cones is mediated by Cav3.2, then it should be undetectable in cones of the double mutant mice. Moreover, if these Cav3.2 channels contribute to the residual cone synaptic responses in G369i KI mice, then the double mutant mice should be deficient in this regard. We will test these predictions in patch clamp recordings and ERGs.</p>
<p>Finally, we will conduct Ca2+ imaging experiments in cone terminals of the WT vs G369i KI mice to test whether increased coupling of Cav channels to intracellular Ca2+ release may be involved in cone synaptic responses of the G369i KI mice.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>“The major criticism that I have of the study is that it infers Ca channel molecular composition based solely on pharmacological analysis, which, as the authors note, is confounded by the cross-reactivity of many of the &quot;specific&quot; channel-type antagonists. The authors note that Cav3 mRNAs have been found in cones, but here, they do not perform any analysis to examine Cav3 transcript expression after G369i-KI nor do they examine Ca channel transcript expression in monkey or squirrel cones, which serve as controls of sorts for the G369i-KI (i.e. like WT mouse cones, cones of these other species do not seem to exhibit LVA Ca currents).”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Actually, we also used non-pharmacological (i.e., electrophysiological) criteria to back up our interpretation that Cav3 channels contribute to the Cav current in cones primarily in the absence of functional Cav1.4 channels. For example, in Fig.2, we show that the Ca2+ current in G369i KI and Cav1.4 KO mice exhibit the hallmarks of the Cav3 channel (negative activation and inactivation voltages and window current, rapid inactivation), which are quite distinct from the Ca2+ currents in WT cones. In recordings of ground squirrel and macaque cones (Supp.Figs.S2-3), negative holding voltages do not unmask a LVA current according to various criteria. In addition to the transcriptomic approaches described above, we plan to elaborate on the electrophysiological evidence for the absence of a LVA current in WT mouse cones as part of the revision.</p>

<p>“Secondarily, in Maddox et al. 2020, the authors raise the possibility that G369i-KI, by virtue of having a functional voltage-sensing domain-might couple to intracellular Ca2+ stores, and it seems appropriate that this possibility be considered experimentally here.”</p>

<p>“As a minor point: the authors might wish to note - in comparison to another retinal ribbon synapse-that Zhang et al. 2022 (in J. Neuroscience) performed a study of mouse rod bipolar cells found a number of LVA and HVA Ca conductances in addition to the typical L-type conductance mediated by Cav1-containing channels.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are aware of the extensive evidence for the expression of Cav3 channels in retinal bipolar cells (PMID 11604141, 22909426, 19275782, 35896423) and our recordings of cone bipolar cells in ground squirrel confirm this (Supp. Fig.S2D). We could add reference to this work in our revision.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>“The major critiques are related to the description of the Cav1.4 knock-in mouse as &quot;sparing&quot; function, which can be remedied in part by a simple rewrite, and in certain places, the data may need to be examined more critically. In particular, the authors should address features in the data presented in Figures 6 and 7 that seem to indicate that the retina of the Cav1.4 knock-in is not intact, but the interpretation given by the authors as &quot;intact&quot; is not appropriate and made without rigorous statistical testing.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We intended to use “sparing” and “intact” to indicate that cone synapses are present and to some extent functional, in contrast to their complete absence in the Cav1.4 KO mouse. However, we recognize this may be misinterpreted as “normal”. As suggested by the reviewer, we will revise our statistical analyses and text to clarify that cone synaptic responses do indeed differ significantly in G369i KI as compared to WT mice. We feel that this will be a strong addition to the study and will emphasize the key point that Cav3 cannot fully compensate for loss of Cav1.4 with respect to cone synapse structure and function.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>“The study has been expertly performed but remains descriptive without deciphering the underlying molecular mechanisms of the observed phenomena, including the proposed homeostatic switch of synaptic calcium channels. Furthermore, a relevant part of the data in the present paper (presence of T-type calcium channels in cone photoreceptors) has already been identified/presented by previous studies of different groups (Macosko et al., 2015; pmid 26000488; Davison et al., 2021; pmid 35803735; Williams et al., 2022; pmid 35650675). The degree of novelty of the present paper thus appears limited.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree that our paper lacks novelty. As indicated by Reviewer 2, a major advance of our study is in providing a mechanism that can explain the longstanding conundrum that congenital stationary night blindness type 2 mutations that would be expected to severely compromise Cav1.4 function do not produce complete blindness. We also disagree that the presence of T-type channels in cone photoreceptors has been unequivocally demonstrated, as the non-biased transcriptomic approaches show very little Cav3 transcript expression in mouse cones (PMIDs 26000488, 35650675, 36807640), macaque cones (PMID 30712875), and human cones (PMID 31075224). Transcription may not equate to translation, particularly at low expression levels.  We also note that the one study to date that suggests a functional contribution of Cav3 channels in mouse cones (Davison et al., 2021; pmid 35803735) used a DHP to isolate the “LVA” current, which is problematic as described above. Our demonstration of minimal or undetectable Cav3-type currents in mammalian cones using physiological and pharmacological approaches, while a negative result, adds important context to the recent literature. As described in our response to the editor’s review, our planned revisions include testing whether Cav3 transcripts are upregulated in G369i KI cones and whether the Cav3.2 subtype suggested to be present in cones (PMID 35803735) contributes to Cav currents in these cells using Cav3.2 KO and Cav3.2 KO/G369i KI double mutant mice.</p>
