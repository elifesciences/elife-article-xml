<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Human fertility is suboptimal, partly due to error-prone divisions in early cleavage-stages that result in aneuploidy. Most human pre-implantation are mosaics of euploid and aneuploid cells, however, mosaic embryos with a low proportion of aneuploid cells have a similar likelihood of developing to term as fully euploid embryos. How embryos manage aneuploidy during development is poorly understood. This knowledge is crucial for improving fertility treatments and reducing developmental defects. To explore these mechanisms, we established a new mouse model of chromosome mosaicism to study the fate of aneuploid cells during pre-implantation development. We previously used the Mps1 inhibitor reversine to generate aneuploidy in embryos. Here, we found that treatment with the more specific Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146 induced chromosome segregation defects in pre-implantation embryos, similar to reversine. However, AZ3146- treated embryos showed a higher developmental potential than reversine-treated embryos. Unlike reversine-treated embryos, AZ3146-treated embryos exhibited transient upregulation of Hypoxia Inducible-Factor-1A (HIF1A) and lacked p53 upregulation. Pre-implantation embryos develop in a hypoxic environment <italic>in vivo</italic>, and hypoxia exposure <italic>in vitro</italic> reduced DNA damage in response to Mps1 inhibition and increased the proportion of euploid cells in the mosaic epiblast. Inhibiting HIF1A in mosaic embryos also decreased the proportion of aneuploid cells in mosaic embryos. Our work illuminates potential strategies to improve the developmental potential of mosaic embryos.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Humans exhibit suboptimal fertility relative to other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Palmerola et al., 2022</xref>). Only ∼30% of human conceptions progress to live birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>). Intriguingly, the first zygotic cleavage-stage divisions in human embryos are error prone, generally resulting in aneuploidy, in which cells gain or lose chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allais and FitzHarris, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Currie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Palmerola et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Pauerova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>). A high incidence of aneuploidy in the early cleavage divisions is thought to underlie low human fecundity and most developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Palmerola et al., 2022</xref>). Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) often give rise to mosaic embryos of diploid and aneuploid cells. Although it is predicted that ∼60% of pre-implantation IVF embryos exhibit diploid-aneuploid mosaicism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>), our understanding of the embryo’s ability to cope with such abnormalities is limited.</p>
<p>The incidence of aneuploidy declines at later stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shahbazi et al., 2020</xref>), but the mechanism underlying this decline is poorly understood. Human mosaic embryos can develop to term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Greco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Starostik et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, implantation of low- and medium-grade mosaic embryos, defined as having 20-30% and 30-50% aneuploid extra-embryonic trophectoderm cells in a biopsy, has been reported to be as likely to result in the birth of healthy babies as implantation of fully euploid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>). Given that some mosaic embryos are able to develop to term, it is important to uncover the mechanisms that confer their viability.</p>
<p>Mouse models of chromosome mosaicism enable analyses that are not allowed with human embryos for ethical reasons. Mouse and human pre-implantation development are very similar to each other: both undertake cleavage divisions, compaction, blastocyst cavity formation and hatching, albeit with slightly different timings in the two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mole et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). During pre-implantation development, cells on the outside of the embryo form the extra-embryonic trophectoderm (TE) whereas cells on the inside form the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM). Subsequently, cells of the ICM are segregated into the embryonic epiblast (EPI) and extra-embryonic primitive endoderm (PE). The TE will form the placenta, the PE will form the yolk sac and the EPI will form the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhu and Zernicka-Goetz, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, our group developed the first mouse model of chromosome mosaicism, based on the generation of aneuploidies induced by a drug reversine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Singla et al., 2020</xref>). Reversine is a pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor that also antagonizes the A3 adenosine receptor and inhibits mitotic kinase monopolar spindle 1 (MPS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">D’Alise et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Santaguida et al., 2010</xref>). Our analysis revealed that reversine-treated mosaic embryos are aneuploid and overexpress p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, reversine-treated cells in mosaic embryos are gradually eliminated from the EPI, particularly around the time of blastocyst implantation. As with human mosaic embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>), we found that mosaic embryos with at least 50% of euploid cells had a similar developmental potential as fully euploid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Singla et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Because reversine affects p53 and may compromise cellular fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">D’Alise et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Santaguida et al., 2010</xref>), we sought to generate a complementary aneuploid model. To this end, we used the more specific Mps1 inhibitor, AZ3146 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hewitt et al., 2010</xref>). Although AZ3146 and reversine both interfere with the spindle assembly checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hewitt et al., 2010</xref>), they bind to Mps1 in a different manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lan and Cleveland, 2010</xref>). In mouse embryos, AZ3146 treatment was shown to double the occurrence of micronuclei, a marker of chromosome segregation defects, but without negatively affecting cellular fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Vazquez-Diez et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, we used AZ3146- and reversine-treated pre-implantation mouse embryos to dissect the mechanisms underlying aneuploid cell elimination and survival.</p>

<title>AZ3146 treatment induces chromosome segregation defects in pre-implantation mouse embryos</title>
<p>To generate distinct models of aneuploidy, we treated 4- to 8-cell stage mouse embryos with AZ3146 (20 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Vazquez-Diez et al., 2019</xref>), as well as with reversine (0.5 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>) as a positive control, or DMSO (vehicle) as a negative control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We evaluated how the different Mps1 inhibitors affect chromosome segregation by detecting nuclei and kinetochores in 8-cell embryos and counted chromosomes <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Pauerova et al., 2020</xref>). Micronuclei were identified as small DAPI-stained chromosomes that were clearly distinct from the nuclei. We examined 32 DMSO-treated control embryos and observed only 22 cells with micronuclei out of a total of 256 cells (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). In contrast, we observed 82 cells with micronuclei in a total of 144 individual cells from 18 reversine-treated embryos, and 182 cells in a total of 304 individual cells from 38 AZ3146-treated embryos. Overall, a median of 12.5% of blastomeres had micronuclei in DMSO-treated 8-cell embryos, compared to 75% of blastomeres in the reversine-treated embryos and 62.5% of blastomeres in the AZ3146-treated embryos (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). We also detected non-dividing nuclei as rounded circles with distinct DAPI intensities in embryos treated with reversine and AZ3146). Specifically, we observed 28 non-dividing cells (19%) in reversine-treated embryos and 24 non-dividing cells (7.9%) in AZ3146-treated blastomeres, but none in DMSO-treated blastomeres (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). The increased frequencies of micronuclei and non-dividing cells in response to Mps1 inhibition are consistent with elevated aneuploidy and chromosomal instability (Daughtry and Chavez, 2016; Vazquez-Diez et al., 2016), as we showed previously for reversine-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

After washing, embryos were cultured to the mature blastocyst stage (E4.5) and analyzed for lineage specification.

(C) Number of cells in each lineage was quantified to evaluate the effect of drug treatment on blastocyst development. Importantly, both reversine and AZ3146-treatments reduce the number of cells in the ICM, marked by NANOG (EPI) and SOX17 (PE). Whereas the TE, marked by CDX2, is reduced only in the reversine-treated embryos. (n=28 per treatment) (***P&lt;0.0001, **P&lt;0.01, *P&lt;0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test, error bars represent s.e.m). (D) Analysis of DNA damage and DNA repair based on immunofluorescence against γH2A.X (phosphorylated form of H2A.X, white) and PARP1 (red), respectively. (E) Intensity analysis shows that reversine and AZ3146 increase DNA damage at the 8-cell stage through morula stage. Importantly, reversine appears to downregulate PARP1 expression at the 8-cell stage, which extends to morula stage embryos (***P&lt;0.0001, **P&lt;0.01, *P&lt;0.05, t-test).</p></caption>

<p>Given these distinct responses to reversine and AZ3146, we examined how these treatments impact the lineages in the blastocyst. To this end, we treated embryos with DMSO, reversine or AZ3146 from the 4- to 8-cell stage, and then washed and cultured them until the late blastocyst stage (E4.5). We assessed lineages by immunofluorescence (IF) to detect the TE marker CDX2, the EPI marker NANOG, and the PE marker SOX17. We found that all lineages segregated normally, and that blastocyst morphology was similar in all three conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We quantified the number of cells in the blastocysts and found that DMSO- treated controls had a median of 93 cells in total, whereas reversine- and AZ3146-treated embryos had a median of only 79 and 82 cells, respectively (***P&lt;0.0001, **P&lt;0.01, *P&lt;0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test, n=28 per treatment) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). DMSO-treated blastocysts contained a median of 15 EPI, 11 PE, and 67 TE cells, whereas reversine-treated blastocysts contained 12 EPI, 8 PE and 59 TE cells, and AZ3146-treated blastocysts had 11 EPI, 7 PE and 64 TE cells. These data suggest that reversine treatment compromises the development of all three lineages, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>), whereas AZ3146 mainly compromises ICM (EPI and PE) development.</p>
<p>To compare the developmental potential of blastocysts that had been treated with AZ3146 or reversine, we transferred them into opposite uterine horns of the same mouse and counted decidua, which reflect successful implantation, as well as viable embryos at E9.5. Although two (8%) reversine-treated blastocysts developed decidua, none gave rise to viable E9.5 embryos (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). In contrast, seven (30%) AZ3146- treated blastocysts developed decidua and five (21%) generated viable E9.5 embryos (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>). Thus, AZ3146-treated embryos appear to have a higher developmental potential than reversine-treated embryos.</p>
<p>Considering that cellular fitness and aneuploid stress are related to DNA damage and DNA repair, we first sought to understand if these parameters were affected in our drug treatments. We used IF to analyze the levels of the DNA repair marker PARP1 and of the DNA damage marker, phosphorylated H2A.X (γH2A.X) at the 8-cell and morula stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). We observed elevated γH2A.X levels in reversine- and AZ3146- treated 8-cell embryos compared to controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), which eventually returned to normal in AZ3146- treated blastocysts, but not in reversine-treated blastocysts (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>).</p>
<p>PARP1 was specifically enriched in the EPI lineage in normal blastocysts, as assessed by IF and re- analysis of published scRNA-seq data (Deng et al., 2014) (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>). Intriguingly, PARP1 levels were reduced at the 8-cell and morula stages in reversine-treated embryos compared to controls and to AZ3146- treated embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D-E). Moreover, late morula stage embryos treated with the PARP inhibitor Olaparib (10 µM, Hou et al., 2022; Prasad et al., 2017) developed into smaller blastocysts with only 78 total cells, reflecting a relatively low number of ICM cells, only 8 EPI and 4 PE cells (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C-E</xref>). Treatment with reversine, but not AZ3146, further reduced the number of cells in the EPI lineage of Olaparib-treated embryos (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that PARP1 is required for proper development of the ICM, and that its reduced levels after reversine treatment may negatively impact development.</p>

<title>Reversine and AZ3146 activate distinct stress response pathways in pre-implantation embryos</title>
<p>Chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy are associated with different cellular stress pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, p53 is frequently activated following DNA damage, which can limit proliferation and trigger apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abuetabh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Soto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Thompson and Compton, 2010</xref>). The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) can also be activated following DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Thompson and Compton, 2010</xref>). In aneuploid cells, p38 promotes apoptosis by inhibiting the transcription factor Hif-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Simoes-Sousa et al., 2018</xref>), which otherwise promotes cell survival, proliferation, and metabolic changes in aneuploid cells and in response to hypoxia in different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Simoes-Sousa et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate how treatment with reversine or AZ3146 affect <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>Hif1a</italic> expression in mouse embryos, we performed RT-qPCR at the morula and blastocyst stages. We normalized to <italic>Ppia</italic> (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase A) mRNA, which is a stable reference gene in diploid and polyploid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu et al., 2014</xref>). Reversine-treated embryos displayed a significant increase in <italic>p53</italic> transcript levels at the morula (7-fold) and blastocyst (1.3-fold) stages (**P&lt;0.01, *P&lt;0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), as we showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Singla et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, reversine-treated embryos showed reduced expression of <italic>Hif1a</italic> at the blastocyst stage, which would be consistent with p38 activation. In contrast, AZ3146-treated embryos did not show upregulation of <italic>p53</italic> at either the morula or blastocyst stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Moreover, AZ3146- treated embryos showed a transient increase in <italic>Hif1a</italic> mRNA levels (3-fold) at the morula stage compared to DMSO- and reversine-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), which returned to normal levels at the blastocyst stage. HIF1A protein was present in DMSO- and reversine-treated embryos, and elevated at the morula and blastocyst stages in AZ3146-treated embryos (***P&lt;0.0001, **P&lt;0.01, *P&lt;0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). HIF1A appeared to be mostly nuclear in morula, but mostly cytoplasmic in blastocysts, under all three conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that treatment with reversine, but not AZ3146, induces multiple stress pathways in pre-implantation embryos. These differences may contribute to the increased developmental potential of embryos treated with AZ3146 versus reversine.</p>

<p>A) qPCR analysis of <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>Hif1a</italic> mRNA expression at morula and blastocyst stages reveals that <italic>p53</italic> is upregulated in reversine-treated embryos and that <italic>Hif1a</italic> is upregulated in AZ3146-treated embryos at morula stages; 3 biological replicates and 2 technical replicates per experiment with each replicate having a minimum of 16 embryos (**P&lt;0.01, *P&lt;0.05, Welch’s t-test). B) Immunofluorescence against HIF1A (black) shows an increase in nuclear intensity in AZ3146-treated embryos at morula stages. At blastocyst stage, nuclear and cytoplasmic HIF1A are increased in AZ3146-treated embryos; normalization was based on DAPI staining (magenta). (C) Graphic representation of 4-cell embryos treated with DMSO and aneuploid drugs. Chemical downregulation of HIF1A was achieved by treatment with IDF-11774 immediately after wash of the aneuploid drugs. Immunofluorescence analysis of lineage specification in blastocyst cultured with the HIF1A inhibitor IDF-11774 using antibodies against CDX2 (TE), NANOG (EPI) and SOX17 (PE). Importantly, IDF-11774 appears to affect cavitation of some AZ3146-treated embryos.

<title>HIF1A activity is required for proper blastocyst formation after Mps1 inhibition</title>
<p>It was previously shown that Hif1α<sup>−/−</sup> embryos undergo developmental arrest and lethality by E11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Iyer et al., 1998</xref>). To assess the role of HIF1A in the embryo’s response to reversine and AZ3146, we used a pharmacological approach to inhibit its function. Briefly, we tested two different small molecules that have been shown to inhibit HIF1A activity, PX-478 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lee and Kim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>) and IDF-11774 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ban et al., 2017</xref>). We treated control zygotes with DMSO, PX-478 (2 µM), or IDF-11774 (20 µM) until the blastocyst stage (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). Unlike PX-478, IDF-11774 treatment did not significantly affect the total number of cells in the TE or the whole blastocyst compared to the control (***P&lt;0.0001, **P&lt;0.01, *P&lt;0.05, Mann– Whitney U-test) (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). Therefore, we used IDF-11774 to inhibit HIF1A in subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>Next, we treated embryos with DMSO, reversine, or AZ3146 from the 4- to 8-cell stage, washed them, and then inhibited HIF1A with IDF-11774 from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Inhibition of HIF1A did not abolish cavitation, but dramatically lowered the number of TE and especially PE cells in AZ3146-treated embryos compared to DMSO-treated controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and compared to AZ3146-treated embryos not exposed to IDF-11884 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Inhibition of HIF1A also lowered the number of cells in reversine-treated embryos compared to controls, but the effect was smaller (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Overall, our data suggest that elevated HIF1A activity from the 8-cell stage onwards is particularly important to promote the survival of aneuploid TE and PE cells after AZ3146 treatment.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data suggest that AZ3146 and reversine have distinct effects on the pre-implantation embryo. Compared to reversine-treated embryos, AZ3146-treated embryos appear to have increased developmental potential, lack upregulation of p53, and show transient upregulation of Hif1a. Moreover, AZ3146-treated embryos have a greater dependence on HIF1A activity to form the TE and PE.</p>

<p>First, we examined lineage specification by quantifying the cell numbers in all three lineages at the blastocyst stage. We found that DMSO-treated blastocysts cultured under hypoxia had a median of 74 cells, representing 14 EPI cells, 6 PE cells and 54 TE cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). These data suggest that, under our conditions, the cell number in the pre-implantation mouse blastocyst is reduced when cultured in hypoxia compared to normoxia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, 1C), particularly in the TE and PE. Notably, reversine and AZ3146 treatment did not further reduce cell numbers for embryos cultured under hypoxia, except for in the PE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate how hypoxia exposure affects DNA damage and repair in mouse embryos, we again performed IF for γH2A.X and PARP1 in 8-cell embryos and morula. We found that hypoxia exposure lowered the number of γH2A.X foci under all conditions, and minimized the differences between DMSO, reversine and AZ3146 treatments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>). In addition, PARP1 levels were also similar under all conditions, and relatively low in morula. Overall, these data suggest that hypoxia exposure lowers the accumulation of DNA damage under all conditions.</p>

<title>Hypoxia increases the proportion of euploid cells in the epiblast of mosaic blastocysts</title>
<p>Despite the high incidence of mosaicism in human pre-implantation embryos, the fate of aneuploid cells in mosaic embryos is incompletely understood. We previously used reversine to generate a mouse model of pre-implantation chromosome mosaicism and found that aneuploid (Reversine-treated) cells are eliminated in the EPI of mosaic embryos via apoptosis, starting from the mature blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>). Whether this response reflects reversine treatment specifically, or aneuploidy more generally, is not known. Moreover, how hypoxia versus normoxia affects the outcomes is also not clear.</p>
<p>To address these questions, we created aggregation chimeras at the 8-cell stage that contained a 1:1 ratio of AZ3146-treated and control blastomeres (DMSO/AZ3146 chimeras), which is expected to reflect low- grade mosaicism, or of AZ3146-treated and reversine-treated blastomeres (reversine/AZ3146 chimeras), which is expected to reflect medium-grade mosaicism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We cultured these chimeric embryos in normoxia and hypoxia, and followed the fate of individual blastomeres by using transgenic mouse lines with the membrane markers mTmG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>) and E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Christodoulou et al., 2019</xref>). DMSO/AZ3146 and reversine/AZ3146 blastocysts displayed proper lineage allocation, embryo morphology and cavitation in both normoxia and hypoxia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-C</xref>). In addition, DMSO/AZ3146 and reversine/AZ3146 embryos had comparable total cell numbers in their blastocysts, and blastocysts grown in hypoxia were again smaller than those grown in normoxia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-E</xref>). Intriguingly, despite having fewer total cells, DMSO/AZ3146 blastocysts had more EPI cells when they were cultured in hypoxia compared to normoxia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-E</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Hypoxia affects cell competition between diploid and aneuploid cells during pre-implantation development.</title>
<p>(A) Graphic representation of the cell competition experiments. Embryos were treated at the 4-cell stage with DMSO or Mps1 inhibitors reversine and AZ3146. After washing, 8-cell stage embryos were disaggregated, and re-aggregated to form chimeras containing a 1:1 ratio of DMSO/AZ314-treated blastomeres and reversine/DMSO-treated blastomeres. Following aggregation, chimeras were cultured to the mature blastocyst stage (E4.5) and analyzed for lineage specification. For identification of the treatment, we use transgenics lines with membrane markers. Immunofluorescence for CDX2, NANOG, and SOX17 was performed to test lineage specification and allocation during (B) normoxia and (C) hypoxia. Lineage allocation quantification was based on the above markers. Importantly, D) in normoxia, both chimeras have the same number of cells in all the lineages except the EPI. In addition, AZ3146-treated blastomeres outcompete reversine-treated blastomeres in medium-grade mosaics in the TE and the EPI. E) Under hypoxia, both chimeras have similar number of cells in all the lineages. Yet, AZ3146-blastomeres do not outcompete reversine-treated blastomeres. Quantification of the contribution of AZ3146-treated blastomeres to the chimeras showed that, (F) under normoxia, compare with DMSO-treated cells, no preferential allocation of aneuploid cells occurs in the TE. In contrast, AZ3146-treated blastomeres increased their contribution when compare with reversine-treated blastomeres, but only significantly on the EPI and the PE. (G) During hypoxia, DMSO/AZ3146 chimeras did not change their behavior. Confirming a preferential allocation of diploid cells to the EPI. In reversine/AZ3146 chimeras, AZ3146-treated blastomeres contribute similarly to reversine-blastomeres to the TE and EPI but significantly increase contribution to the EPI. These results indicate that hypoxia favors the survival of reversine-induced aneuploid cells (Experiments were repeated in triplicate, ****P&lt;0.00001, **P&lt;0.01, *P&lt;0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test, error bars represent s.e.m).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>We quantified the proportion of AZ3146 cells in each lineage for each chimera. In DMSO/AZ3146-treated blastocysts, we found that 46.75% of the TE and 42.88% of the EPI originated from AZ3146-treated blastomeres, compared to only 28.57% of the PE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). In reversine/AZ3146 chimeras, 63% of the TE and 78.4% of the EPI originated from AZ3146-treated cells, compared to only 40% of the PE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Thus, under normoxia, DMSO cells appear to outcompete AZ3146-treated cells, which in turn outcompete Reversine-treated cells in the TE and EPI. AZ3146-treated cells appeared to be at a competitive disadvantage in the PE in both contexts. Culturing DMSO/AZ3146 chimeras in hypoxia slightly increased the representation of AZ3146-treated blastomeres in the TE (49.06%) and PE (50%) but, strikingly, reduced their representation in the EPI (33.3%) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). These altered frequencies reflect a higher number of DMSO-treated cells in the EPI and a lower number in the PE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Hypoxia exposure of reversine/AZ3146 embryos lowered the contribution of AZ3146-treated blastomeres to the TE (55.94%) and EPI (50%) but not the PE (46.43%) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). We found that there was no correlation between the proportion of AZ3146-treated cells in the TE and the EPI in DMSO/AZ3146 and reversine/AZ3146 chimeras, under hypoxia or normoxia, and that hypoxia seemed to have a greater impact on the proportion of AZ3146 cells in reversine/AZ3146 chimeras (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that hypoxia has lineage-specific effects on competitions between aneuploid and euploid cells and increases the contribution of euploid cells to the EPI.</p>
<p>Blastomeres in the 4-cell stage embryo display a lineage bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Goolam et al., 2016</xref>). We considered that mosaicism generated before the 4-cell stage might influence lineage allocation. To test this possibility, we treated zygotes with reversine or AZ3146 during the first cell division. Importantly, reversine treatment at the 2-cell stage seems to strongly affect the morphology of the blastocysts (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). Consistent with this change in morphology, reversine-treatment reduced the number of cells in all lineages, particularly in the TE and PE (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). In contrast, AZ3146 treatment did not affect morphology or cell number in any of the lineages (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A-B</xref>) (n&gt;27 per treatment, ***P&lt;0.0001, **P&lt;0.01, *P&lt;0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test). To evaluate how early generation of aneuploidies in the embryos affect cell competition, we generated DMSO/AZ3146, reversine/DMSO, and AZ3146/reversine aggregation chimeras at the 2-cell stage and cultured them under normoxia until the blastocyst stage (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>). We found that all three 2-cell stage aggregation chimeras developed into blastocysts with a normal morphology and cavitation (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D</xref>). Interestingly, the reversine-treated cells were extruded from the blastocyst in 54% of the reversine/DMSO chimeras and in 33% of the AZ3146/reversine chimeras, whereas no cell extrusion was observed in the DMSO/AZ3146 chimeras. Quantification of the proportion of AZ3146-treated cells in 2-cell stage derived chimeras showed similar results as 8-cell stage derived chimeras (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5E</xref>). In DMSO/AZ3146-treated blastocysts, we found that 49.28% of the TE, 39% of the EPI and 33.33% of the PE originated from AZ3146- treated blastomeres (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5E</xref>). In reversine/AZ3146 chimeras, 68.24% of the TE, 68.83% of the EPI, and 66.67% of the PE originated from AZ3146-treated cells (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5E</xref>). In DMSO/reversine chimeras, 22.27% of the TE, 26.98% of the PE, and 31.7% of the EPI originated from reversine-treated cells. Overall, these results suggest that aneuploidy generated at different stages similarly affect the proportion of aneuploid cells in the blastocysts.</p>

<title>HIF1A inhibition reduces the frequency of aneuploid cells in DMSO/AZ3146 mosaic embryos</title>
<p>Our data suggest that hypoxia affects aneuploid-euploid cell competition in mosaic embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). To further assess the effect of HIF1A and, considering most human embryos are culture under hypoxic conditions, we decided to evaluate the effect of inhibiting HIF1A in mosaic embryos cultured in hypoxic conditions. We assembled DMSO/AZ3146 and AZ3146/reversine 8-cell stage chimeras, treated them with the HIF1A inhibitor IDF-11774 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, S6A-B), and then assessed lineage allocation in blastocysts. Treatment of DMSO/AZ3146 chimeras with IDF11774 reduced the cavitation diameter and diminished the contribution of AZ3146-treated cells to all three lineages, and DMSO-treated cells compensated for this loss in the PE and EPI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-D</xref>, <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C</xref>). Treating AZ3146/reversine chimeras with IDF11774 compromised blastocyst morphology (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E-F</xref>) and slightly increased the number of PE and EPI cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>), without altering the frequency of AZ3146-treated cells (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6D</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that HIF1A promotes the survival of AZ3146-treated cells in DMSO/AZ3146 chimeras, and suggest that inhibiting HIF1A could increase the proportion of karyotypically normal cells in mosaic embryos.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Aneuploidy is a common event during pre-implantation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allais and FitzHarris, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Currie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Palmerola et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we describe different strategies to generate aneuploidy in the early embryo. Our results suggest that: 1) the Mps1 inhibitor, AZ3146, generates aneuploid embryos with enhanced DNA repair and reduced stress responses when compared to reversine-treated embryos. 2) Lineage specific responses to aneuploidy are present during blastocyst development, as we showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Singla et al., 2020</xref>). 3) HIF1A contributes to the survival of TE and PE cells in AZ3146-treated embryos whereas PARP1 is particularly required in EPI cells in both reversine and AZ3146-treated embryos. 4) Hypoxia enhances DNA repair and affects aneuploid-euploid cell competition in mosaic embryos.</p>
<p>Reversine-treated mouse embryos upregulate the senescent markers p53 and p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Singla et al., 2020</xref>) and fail to give rise to viable embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>). Our results further indicate that reversine downregulates PARP1, as previously observed in glioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hirakata et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, reversine treatment may compromise embryo development due to a combined increase in DNA damage and decrease in DNA repair. In contrast, embryos treated with AZ3146 do not reduce PARP1 levels and have elevated HIF1A, which appears to improve survival of TE and PE cells and developmental potential.</p>
<p>DNA repair pathways are enhanced under hypoxic environments in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Marti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nakamura et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pietrzak et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, our data show that aneuploid embryos cultured in hypoxia had lower levels of DNA damage at the morula stage, in agreement with previous studies reporting lower levels of γH2A.X in mouse blastocysts recovered from the uterus and in blastocysts cultured in hypoxia compared to blastocysts cultured in normoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Houghton, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Meuter et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, recent studies suggest that hypoxia favors HIF1A’s association with PARP1 in cancer cells, increasing DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Marti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nakamura et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pietrzak et al., 2018</xref>). In the future, a deeper understanding of the regulation of DNA repair in pre-implantation stages would allow us to understand the molecular response of embryos to aneuploid stress.</p>
<p>Confined placental mosaicism is commonly observed in human pregnancies, and refers to instances where the placenta is aneuploid but the fetus is euploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">McCoy, 2017</xref>). We previously found that aneuploid TE cells have an increased cell cycle length and senescence, whereas aneuploid ICM cells have an increased frequency of apoptosis, in reversine-treated embryos. Therefore abnormal but viable TE cells could lead to confined placental mosaicism. Our results further suggest that aneuploid cells contributed mostly to the TE, followed by the EPI, are especially depleted from the PE in AZ3146-treated embryos under normoxia. Intriguingly, under hypoxia aneuploid cells were depleted from the EPI and increase in the PE. Overall our data suggest that hypoxia may affect cell competition in a lineage-specific manner in the pre-implantation embryo, supporting an increased representation of euploid cells in the EPI relative to the PE and TE.</p>
<p>Finally, our results confirm that the proportion of aneuploid cells in the EPI and TE do not correlate, consistent with aneuploid survival in the TE but elimination from the ICM. These results are not surprising considering the low aneuploidy concordance rates between TE and ICM in human mosaic aneuploid embryos (30–40%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dahdouh and Garcia-Velasco, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Since low- and medium- grade mosaic human embryos have similar developmental potential as fully euploid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Greco et al., 2015</xref>), understanding the molecular pathways involved in the responses to aneuploidy may have translational implications. Given that the extent and proportion of aneuploid cells in mosaic embryos impact survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>), we propose that a reduction in aneuploid cells in the blastocyst will favor a successful pregnancy. Here, we downregulated HIF1A as a strategy for reducing aneuploid cells number and found that treatment with IDF-11774 increased the proportion of euploid cells in mosaic embryos. In sum, our study reveals distinct environmental factors that affect the extent and proportion of aneuploid cells within mosaic embryos.</p>

<p>Mice were maintained according to national and international guidelines. Four- to six-week-old B6SJLF1/J female mice were injected with 7.5IU PMSG followed by 7.5 IU hCG 48 h later, to induce superovulation. The females were then mated with B6CBAF1/J males or were indicated, with E-cadherin GFP or mTmG transgenic males. Pre-implantation mouse embryos were recovered 24 h and 40 h after the hCG injection to obtain zygotes and 2-cell stage embryos, respectively in M2 medium (Sigma, M7167). We incubate the embryos in KSOM until 4-cell stage for the aneuploid treatment, around 53 h post hCG. When recovering zygotes, cumulus cells were removed with 0.3% hyaluronidase (Sigma, H4272) in M2. Embryos then were cultured in regular KSOM (Sigma.

<p>For determination of aneuploidy, treated 8-cell stage embryos were synchronized in metaphase by 10h treatment with 0.03 µg/mL colcemid (Cayman, 15364) diluted in KSOM. Following by 1h treatment with 10 µM Mg132 (Selleckchem, S2619) in KSOM. Finally, 1 h treatment with 5 µM dimethylenastron (MedChemExpress, HY-19944) and 10 µM Mg132 in KSOM. Synchronized embryos were then fix in 2% PFA for 20 min, permeabilized with PBST for 15 min and blocked 3h at RT before incubation with human anti-centromere protein antibody (1:300, Antibodiesinc 15-234) overnight at 4°C. Next day, three washes with PBST were performed before 2 h incubation with goat anti-Human secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 647 (1:400, Invitrogen A-21445) in blocking solution. Washes were performed three times before 20 min incubation with DAPI (1:500) and Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin (1:300, Invitrogen A12379). Washes then were performed three times before clearing overnight with AF1 plus (Citifluor, AF1/DAPI-15). Embryos were then mounted in AF1 plus micro-drops on 35 mm glass bottom. Confocal imaging was carried out using Leica SP8, 60x objective, 0.5 µM Z-step. Image files were viewed and analyzed using ImageJ and IMARIS 9.9 software.</p>

<title>Embryo transfers and post implantation recovery and biopsy</title>
<p>Embryo transfer were performed as described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bermejo-Alvarez et al., 2014</xref>). CD1 females and vasectomizes CD1 males were obtained from Charles River. Reversine and AZ3146-treated blastocyst were transfer into 2.5-days pseudopregnant CD1 females. Around 16 AZ3146-treated embryos were transfer in the right uterine horn, whereas around 16 reversine-treated embryos were transfer in the left uterine horn of the same female as control. To evaluate implantation and embryo survival potency, uterine horns were recovered 5 days after surgery. Deciduas were dissected and post implantation embryos at stage E9.5 were recovered into PBST on ice. Embryos were fixed in 4% PFA at RT for 1 h, followed by washes through PBST before imaging. Images were taken using an Olympus LS stereo microscope with a 10x objective. Uterine transfers were performed in accordance with the NIH guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the Institutional Biosafety Committee at the California Institute of Technology (CALTECH).</p>

<title>qRT-PCR</title>
<p>Around 14 to 17 morulas and blastocysts were collected for quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Total RNA from morulas was obtained using the NucleoSpin RNA Plus XS kit (Takara, 740990.10). Whereas total RNA from blastocyst was extracted using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher, KIT0204). qRT-PCR was performed using the <italic>Power</italic> SYBR Green RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems, 4389986) in a StepOne Plus Real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). The following program was used: 30 min 48 °C (reverse-transcription) followed by 10 min 95 °C followed by 45 cycles of 15 s 95 °C (denaturing) and 1 min 60 °C (annealing and extension). The ddCT method was used to determine relative levels of mRNA expression, with Ppia as an endogenous control(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu et al., 2014</xref>).

<title>Generation of chimeric embryos</title>
<p>Chimeric embryos were generated following a previous publish protocol(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eakin and Hadjantonakis, 2006</xref>). Briefly, wild-type, E-cadherin GFP or mTmG 8-cell stage embryos were transfer to micro-drops of M2 after aneuploid treatment. Zona pellucida was removed by treatment with acidic Tyrode’s solution (Sigma, T1788). The embryos were then incubated in Ca2+/Mg2+-free M2 (made in house) for 5 min and then disaggregated into individual blastomeres by gentle mouth pipetting. Low-grade mosaic chimeras were form by aggregation of four and four (1:1) of DMSO/reversine-treated blastomeres with AZ3146-treated blastomeres, respectively in KSOM. Medium-grade mosaic chimeras were form by aggregation of three DMSO-treated blastomeres, three AZ3146-treated blastomeres and two reversine-treaded blastomeres in KSOM. Culture of the chimeras were performed under normoxic and hypoxia condition in KSOM for 48 h to reach blastocyst stage.</p>

<p>(A) <italic>In situ</italic> chromosome counting of 8-cell stage embryos after drug treatments. Representative images of individual embryos in the different treatments. DNA (white) is visualized by DAPI staining and kinetochores (red) by CREST antibody. PB (polar body), MN (micronuclei). Each chromosome presents 2 CREST dots. The large number is the cell ID and the smaller number indicates the number of chromosomes, “n”. Diploid blastomeres present 40 pairs of CREST dots. Phalloidin (cyan) was used for cell segmentation. (B) Quantification of the incidence of aneuploid events, designated as those with more than 2 chromosomes (MN&gt;2chr), less than 2 chromosomes (MN&lt;2chr), without kinetochores (MN-CREST) and non-dividing nucleus (ND cell). We observed an increase in MN following reversine and AZ3146 treatment. Importantly, reversine-treated cells have a higher number of ND cells and MN-CREST staining. (n=128 cell DMSO treatment, n=152 cells AZ3146 treatment, n=72 cells reversine treatment, ****P&lt;0.00001, **P&lt;0.01, *P&lt;0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test, error bars represent s.e.m). (C) Embryo transfer experiments show higher implantation events (% decidua formation) in AZ3146-treated embryos. The left uterine horn was used for transfer of reversine-treated blastocyst and the right uterine horn for AZ3146-treated blastocyst. (D) Only AZ3146-treated blastocyst can develop post-gastrulation E9.5 fetuses (% embryo formation).</p></caption>

<p>(A) Immunofluorescence for CDX2, NANOG, and SOX17 was performed in blastocysts after zygote treatment with Mps1 inhibitors. Importantly, reversine treatment at zygote stages affects morphology of blastocyst. (B) Lineage analysis of blastocyst shows no effect in AZ3146-treated embryos. Whereas reversine treatment reduces the cell number to almost half. Ratio of cells in each lineage in the blastocyst is normalized based on DMSO treatments. (n&gt;27 per treatment) (***P&lt;0.0001, **P&lt;0.01, *P&lt;0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test, error bars represent s.e.m). (C) Aggregation chimeras at 2-cell stage were created by using transgenics lines with membrane markers: mTmG (green) and E-cadherin (white). Subsequently, (D) immunofluorescence for CDX2, NANOG, and SOX17 was performed to quantify lineage allocation. Our results show no effect on embryo morphology in our chimeras. However, reversine/DMSO (D/R) chimeras seems to have increase events of cell extrusion and reversine/AZ3146 chimeras are smaller in number of cells compare with DMSO/AZ3146 chimeras. (E) Data show the proportion of AZ3146-treated cells in DMSO/AZ3146 mosaic blastocysts (grey) and in reversine/AZ3146 mosaic blastocysts (blue), as well as the proportion of reversine-treated cells in DMSO/reversine mosaic blastocysts (red).</p></caption>

Quantification of the contribution of AZ3146-treated blastomeres to the chimeras showed that, (C) in DMSO/AZ3146 mosaics, IDF-11774 treatment reduces the proportion of AZ3146-treated blastomeres, whereas (D) in reversine/AZ3146 mosaics, IDF-11774 treatment slightly increases the proportion of AZ3146-treated blastomeres.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper developed a model of chromosome mosaicism by using a new aneuploidy-inducing drug (AZ3146), and compared this to their previous work where they used reversine, to demonstrate the fate of aneuploid cells during murine preimplantation embryo development. They found that AZ3146 acts similarly to reversine in inducing aneuploidy in embryos, but interestingly showed that the developmental potential of embryos is higher in AZ3146-treated vs. reversine-treated embryos. This difference was associated with changes in HIF1A, p53 gene regulation, DNA damage, and fate of euploid and aneuploid cells when embryos were cultured in a hypoxic environment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In the current study, the authors investigate the fate of aneuploid cells in the preimplantation murine embryo using a specific aneuploidy-inducing compound to generate embryos that were chimeras of euploid and aneuploid cells. The strength of the work is that they investigate the developmental potential and changes in gene expression profiles under normoxic and hypoxic culture conditions. Further, they also assessed how levels of DNA damage and DNA repair are altered in these culture conditions. They also assessed the allocation of aneuploid cells to the divergent cell lineages of the blastocyst stage embryo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Inconsistent/missing description for sample size, biological/technical replicates, label orientation, the appropriate number of * for each figure panel, and statistical tests used.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Sanchez-Vasquez is a very innovative approach to inducing aneuploidy and then studying the contribution of treated cells to different lineages, including post-implantation. It connects well to the authors' previous work to induce mosaic aneuploidies. The authors identify sensitivity to HIF1a loss in treated embryos with likely aneuploidy. This work is part of an important line of work with evaluates the consequences of aneuploidy in the mammalian embryo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given that this is a study on the induction of aneuploidy, it would be meaningful to assess aneuploidy immediately after induction, and then again before implantation. This is also applicable to the competition experiments on page 7/8. What is shown is the competitiveness of treated cells. Because the publication centers around aneuploidy, the inclusion of such data in the main figure at all relevant points would strengthen it. There is some evaluation of karyotypes only in the supplemental - why? It would be good not to rely on a single assay that the authors appear to not give much importance.</p>
