<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Microtubules, composed of α- and β-tubulin polymers, are essential components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. They maintain cellular shape and structural integrity and play critical roles in cell division and in intracellular vesicular transport. In <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the parasite that causes malaria, nuclear replication during the liver stage is among the fastest known in eukaryotic cells and relies heavily on microtubules for DNA segregation and cytoskeletal organization. Despite their importance, the role of microtubules in liver stage development remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated microtubule dynamics during liver stage development using a combination of cell and molecular biology techniques, expansion microscopy, and live-cell imaging. By employing antibodies specific for α-tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs), we found that the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites subpellicular microtubules (SSPM) persist during liver infection, giving rise to liver stage parasite microtubule bundles (LSPMB). These LSPMB form multimeric tubulin structures within hepatocytes and are redistributed to the hemi-spindle poles of parasite nuclei during schizogony. Deletion of the C-terminal region encompassing all known <italic>Plasmodium</italic> α-tubulin PTM sites prevented sporozoite migration from the mosquito midgut to the salivary glands, effectively blocking parasite transmission. Using <italic>Plasmodium</italic> microtubule-specific depolymerisation drugs, we found that while LSPMB are stable in sporozoites, they exhibit dynamic behavior during hepatocyte infection. Given the regulatory role of PTMs in microtubule dynamics, we generated parasite mutants by substituting and deleting key α-tubulin C-terminal residues involved in PTMs. Substitution of the polyglutamylation site with alanine and deletion of the C-terminal tyrosination/detyrosination motifs impaired parasite growth during liver infection. Together, our findings reveal extensive microtubule remodeling during liver stage development and establish α-tubulin C-terminal modifications as critical regulators of both intracellular development and parasite transmission of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites are responsible for malaria and cause yearly half a million deaths in sub-Saharan countries. Malaria continues to be a major worldwide health concern despite recent successful attempts to lower its prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The infection starts when an infected female <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito, during a blood meal, injects salivary gland sporozoites into the skin of the vertebrate host. Some of the motile sporozoites escape the host immune defence and invade blood vessels. They are carried by the blood flow to the liver, where they invade and infect hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Approximately 50% of the parasites are often killed by host cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Those that managed to establish a productive invasion form a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in which the parasite undergoes massive growth and asexual replication known as schizogony. One single parasite gives rise to thousands of daughter parasites called merozoites in 3 to 6 days depending on the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Fully developed merozoites exit the liver cells in merosome vesicles through adjacent blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The merosomes then rupture and release merozoites into the blood stream. The parasites immediately invade erythrocytes, where they undergo again asexual replication to form the blood stage merozoites. Some merozoites differentiate into sexual stages, termed gametocytes, which are ingested by female mosquitos during a blood meal. In the mosquito midgut, the gametocytes develop into microgametes and macrogametes, which fertilize and form a zygote. The later undergoes differentiation into motile ookinetes, which penetrate the gut wall, forming oocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The oocyst produces the midgut sporozoites from the sporoblasts. The sporozoites migrate to the salivary gland from day 11 post-infection in <italic>P. berghei</italic> (Frischknecht et al., 2004; Frischknecht &amp; Matuschewski, 2017; jerome P. Vanderberg, 1974; J. P. Vanderberg, 1975). During the liver stage development, the parasite relies on the fast and massive asexual replication which is essential for the transmission and pathogenesis in erythrocyte stage, representing key targets for malaria control strategies. Investigating the parasite microtubule dynamics during the rapid replication could provide important insight on the parasite biology and to develop strategies for halting the massive proliferation during the clinically asymptomatic liver stage.</p>
<p>Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments of about 25nm outer diameter, made up of usually 13 chains of protofilaments composed of globular α-tubulin and β-tubulin heterodimers. They are crucial components of the cytoskeleton and offer structural support to cells and also function as tracks for the movement of organelles, vesicles, and other cellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Microtubules are involved in important cellular activities such as cell division and the production of cilia and flagella to allow cell motility. Microtubules exhibit inherent dynamics, alternating between polymerisation (rapid growth) and spontaneous depolymerisation (shrinkage) in a process termed dynamic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The dynamics of microtubules and their interactions with other cellular structures are regulated by specific microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), which selectively bind to either the plus or minus ends of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>
<p>Tubulin is subject to seven identified post-translational modifications (PTMs), among which are acetylation of the lysine residue at position 40 in the luminally exposed part of α-tubulin, glycylation, which entails the incorporation of polyglycine side chains of variable length, phosphorylation, palmitoylation, tyrosination/ detyrosination and polyglutamylation. These modifications are extensively preserved and enabling cells to modulate microtubule characteristics, dynamics, and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Tyrosinated microtubules are often associated with microtubule stability. These stable microtubules represent a specialised subset that exhibits enhanced resistance to depolymerization, even in the presence of destabilizing agents. They play a crucial role in maintaining cellular architecture, facilitating intracellular transport, and supporting specialized cellular functions. In contrast to dynamic microtubules, which continuously undergo cycles of polymerization and depolymerization due to dynamic instability, stable microtubules persist for extended periods. They are also frequently polyglutamylated, a modification that regulates their interactions with motor proteins and other cellular components. These microtubules are predominantly localized in structures requiring sustained structural integrity, such as cilia, flagella, neuronal axons, and motile cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Glutamylation, or polyglutamylation, is a post-translational modification characterized by the addition of multiple glutamate side chains to glutamate residues on both α- and β-tubulin. This modification occurs primarily at the C-terminal tails and is catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as polyglutamylases. Polyglutamylation plays a critical role in regulating the interactions of microtubules with MAPs and motor proteins, thereby influencing microtubule dynamics and cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). The properties and functions of tubulin are largely encoded within their protein sequences, contributing to molecular diversity that influences key microtubule characteristics. This variation has been conceptualized as the “tubulin code”, a regulatory framework through which cells control microtubule diversity to achieve specific physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms by which cells establish and interpret this code remain largely unknown. Although tubulin is highly conserved across evolution, it exhibits structural and functional variations between species, cell types, and even within single cells.</p>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, tubulins are key components of the microtubule cytoskeleton, and their genetic complexity reflects the organism’s level of cellular specialization. In yeast, two distinct genes encode α-tubulin, while a single gene encodes β-tubulin. In contrast, the human genome contains nine genes encoding α-tubulin and an equal number encoding β-tubulin, reflecting a greater level of complexity and functional specialization in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genome encodes two α-tubulins (α1-tubulin and α2-tubulin) and one β-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). The α1-tubulin gene encodes a protein of 450 amino acids, while α2-tubulin encodes 453 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). The two isoforms share 94% amino acid identity. However, α2-tubulin lacks a terminal tyrosine residue, which is present in α1-tubulin. This difference suggests potential variation in post-translational modifications and functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). In <italic>P. berghei,</italic> the α1-tubulin gene is expressed across most stages of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life cycle, whereas α2-tubulin expression appears restricted to male gametocytes, gametes, and newly formed zygotes, indicating distinct functional roles for the two isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Deletion of α1-tubulin blocks sporozoite formation in oocysts and lowering α1-tubulin expression leads to less infective sporozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a significant degree of amino acid conservation between human and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> tubulins, with approximately 83.7% identity for α-tubulin and 88.5% for β-tubulin. However, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> tubulin shows greater similarity to plant tubulin than to mammalian tubulin. This raises the potential for developing compounds that selectively target parasite microtubules while sparing the host cell cytoskeleton, offering a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies on <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> blood stage schizonts have revealed that hemi-spindles lack polyglutamylation, whereas subpellicular microtubules do exhibit this post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Similarly, SPMTs appear to be stabilized by microtubule inner proteins, while spindle microtubules do not show these luminal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). These differences may reflect functional specialisation of microtubule subpopulations in different cellular structures and developmental stages.</p>
<p>The liver stage of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> exhibits one of the fastest rates of replication known among eukaryotic cells, a process likely dependent on microtubule dynamics. However, to date, no studies have investigated microtubule dynamics during the liver stage. This study was therefore designed to explore the dynamics of parasite tubulin during the asexual liver stage, using recently developed expansion microscopy protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>).</p>

<title>Expansion microscopy reveals the presence of the sporozoites subpellicular microtubules during the liver stage of infection</title>
<p>To investigate microtubule organization during the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite liver stage, HeLa cells were infected with sporozoites and fixed them at different time points using cold methanol. We then performed IFA to stain host and parasite microtubules using an α-tubulin antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The IFA revealed a marked accumulation of microtubules in proximity of the PVM (stained with anti-UIS4) from early infection (24 hours post-infection (hpi)) to the schizogony (30 to 54 hpi) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> inlets). To examine these structures in greater detail, we applied the recently developed pre-staining expansion microscopy (PS-ExM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). By expanding the cells five-fold, PS-ExM enabled visualization of a large multimeric tubulin structure within the parasite, detectable from 6 hours post-infection (hpi) to 48 hpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on observations of sporozoites prior to liver infection, we hypothesize that this structure originates from the sporozoite subpellicular microtubules (SSPM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> top panel). We refer to this structure as the liver stage parasite microtubule bundles (LSPMB). Notably, the LSPMB progressively shrank over time and was no longer detectable by the end of schizogony (54 hpi) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Using the 3D and 4D imaging software IMARIS, we quantified the LSPMB volume at various stages of liver infection. The results confirmed a consistent decrease in LSPMB size between 6 and 56 hpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>To verify that the LSPMB is not an artifact of the IFA and PS-ExM, we performed live cell imaging of infected HeLa cells. Cells were incubated with the tubulin tracker SPY650 for one hour prior to imaging. The LSPMB was clearly visible in sporozoites before invasion (Movie 1, ∼10 hpi) and persisted until late liver stage development, gradually shrinking during schizogony (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>; Movies 2–4, ∼36 hpi to 48 hpi). These live imaging results corroborate our findings from IFA and expansion microscopy, validating the presence and dynamic nature of the LSPMB during liver stage development.</p>

<title>The liver stage parasite subpellicular microtubules are dynamic</title>
<p>The SSPM has previously been described as highly stable structures, enabling sporozoite formation and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). These microtubules, similar to the corresponding microtubules in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, are resistant to conventional depolymerizing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). To investigate whether the LSPMB retain this stability during liver stage development, we treated infected HeLa cells with the microtubule-depolymerizing agents Amiprophos-methyl (AMP) and oryzalin herbicide. These compounds are known to selectively target dynamic <italic>Plasmodium</italic> microtubules without affecting mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). We first validated drug specificity and cytotoxicity by testing various concentrations on HeLa cells over one week. Neither compound affected host cell viability (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>) or disrupted host microtubules (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). However, oryzalin showed a stronger inhibitory effect on parasite growth compared to AMP (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure C</xref>) and was therefore selected for further experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Sporozoites were dissected into medium containing 10 µM or 20 µM oryzalin and then used to infect HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>), which were incubated with the same drug concentrations. At 48 hpi, the cells were fixed and analyzed by IFA and PS-ExM. To test reversibility, oryzalin was washed out at 24 hpi prior to the onset of schizogony (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). At 10 µM, oryzalin significantly impaired nuclear replication, spindle formation, and LSPMB volume when present the entire cultivation time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Partial recovery of hemi-spindles and nuclear replication was observed, suggesting that the effect of 10 µM oryzalin is reversible at this stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). However, at 20 µM, neither the hemi-spindles nor the LSPMB recovered after drug removal, indicating irreversible microtubule disruption at higher concentrations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). To investigate whether the microtubule depolymerization by oryzalin affects the parasite growth and survival during the liver stage, we measured parasite size within infected HeLa cells at 6, 24 and 48 hpi. Treatment with 10 µM oryzalin led to a significant reduction in parasite size and survival (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 F, G, H</xref>, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). We further examined merozoite formation by staining for MSP1 at 56 hpi. Parasites treated with 10 µM oryzalin failed to express MSP1, indicating a block in merozoite development and suggesting that intact microtubules are essential for DNA replication and merozoite formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Interestingly, at lower concentrations of 0.5 µM, oryzalin treatment led to an unexpected elongation of the LSPMB and hemi-spindles up to four times longer than controls suggesting that microtubule turnover is tightly regulated (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1F, G</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). In conclusion, oryzalin-mediated depolymerization confirms that both the LSPMB and the hemi-spindles are dynamic structures during the liver stage. This dynamic behaviour was further supported by live-cell imaging using the SPY650 tubulin tracker (Movie 5, 6, and 7).</p>

<p>Given the observed microtubule remodeling in response to oryzalin, we next sought to determine whether known microtubule-associated proteins, specifically those regulating plus-end dynamics, are expressed during the liver stage and might contribute to the observed plasticity. Only a limited number of motor proteins and microtubule associated proteins, such as centrin and the kinesin protein family, have been identified during the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> liver stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). The recently characterized EB1 protein, known to regulate microtubules plus-end dynamics and length, has so far been reported for being expressed during the sexual blood stage (Mauer et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Zeeshan et al., 2023). However, these studies did not assess EB1 expression during the asexual mosquito and liver stages. Given our observations of dynamic microtubule behavior and excessive polymerization following oryzalin treatment, we explored whether EB1 might be expressed during the liver stage. To this end, we generated a parasite line expressing endogenous EB1 fused to eGFP via double homologous recombination (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). As expected, EB1-eGFP was detected in sexual blood stages (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>) consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed EB1 expression in both midgut and salivary gland sporozoites (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2G</xref>). Importantly, EB1 was also detected during liver stage development, where it localized to the LSPMB and hemi-spindles (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2H–I</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings suggest that EB1 may play a broader role in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> microtubule regulation than previously recognized, potentially contributing to the dynamic remodeling of microtubules during the liver stage.</p>

<title>The liver stage parasite subpellicular microtubule carries tubulin post-translational modifications</title>
<p>Microtubule functions are often regulated by different post-translational modifications (PTMs), which influence their stability, interactions, and dynamics. To gain insight into the dynamic nature of LSPMB during the liver stage development, we examined α-tubulin PTMs using immunofluorescence (IFA) and expansion microscopy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and Movie 5, 6 and 7). To investigate whether the LSPMB is present in cell types other than HeLa cells, we infected primary hepatocytes with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites and fixed the cells at different timepoints (6, 24, 36, 48, 54 and 56 hpi). We also analyzed sporozoites isolated from mosquito salivary glands. Using antibodies specific for polyglutamylated (anti-IN105) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and tyrosinated (anti-Ty) α-tubulin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), we observed that sporozoite microtubules, including the LSPMB, are both polyglutamylated and tyrosinated. Quantitative colocalization analysis confirmed a strong overlap between LSPMB and polyglutamylated tubulin in both sporozoites and liver stage parasites (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, following hepatocyte invasion, the LSPMB lost tyrosination (i.e., became detyrosinated) while retaining polyglutamylation. This detyrosination persisted throughout liver stage development, including early and late schizogony (24–56 hpi). During this period, polyglutamylation was observed on the LSPMB and at the poles of the hemi-spindles, but not along the polymerizing hemi-spindles themselves, which eventually disappeared along with the LSPMB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Given previous findings implicating polyglutamylation in hemi-spindle pole formation in erythrocytic merozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), we investigated whether there is a structural relationship between the LSPMB and the hemi-spindle poles. Using PS-ExM and the tubulin tracker SPY650, we visualized direct connections between LSPMB filaments and hemi-spindle poles. Live cell imaging confirmed this connection between LSPMB and hemi-spindle poles, mainly during the shrinkage of the LSPMB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3 F</xref>; Movie 8, 9 and 10, Supplementary Movie 1). These observations suggest that the LSPMB may be redistributed to form or support the hemi-spindle poles during schizogony. We also stained for γ-tubulin and observed its localization at the hemi-spindle poles in both the parasite and host cell (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>), supporting the idea that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> may utilize γ-tubulin for nuclear division and microtubule assembly, as reported in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>).</p>

<p>To further define the spatial localization of the LSPMB, we used <italic>P. berghei</italic> parasites expressing the plasma membrane protein PMP1 fused to superfolder GFP (sfGFP) previously generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). ImageJ RGB profiling revealed that the LSPMB lies between the parasite plasma membrane (PM) and the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM), suggesting that the sporozoite subpellicular microtubules undergo subcellular relocalization during liver stage development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). At later stages, particularly the cytomere stage, we observed reappearance of tyrosinated tubulin near the parasite nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). During merozoite formation, this tyrosinated tubulin appeared as punctate structures within the forming merozoites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Tyrosination has previously been associated with stable microtubules involved in motility, such as those in sporozoites, flagella, and spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). The absence of tyrosination during early intracellular liver stage development when the parasite is non-motile may facilitate its transformation from a banana-shaped sporozoite to a rounded liver stage form (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). LSPMB detyrosination may contribute to microtubule dynamic instability, providing both energy and tubulin monomers for rapid growth and spindle formation during schizogony. Finally, the reappearance of tyrosinated microtubules during merozoite formation may serve to stabilize the microtubules required for merozoite motility and erythrocyte invasion.</p>

<p>Using AlphaFold predictions, we confirmed that the mutations were unlikely to affect tubulin folding (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>).

The development of mutant parasites was investigated during the mosquito, and liver stages. Significant defects emerged during mosquito stage development. The PsΔ and TyΔ mutants were able to form oocysts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 4A</xref>) and gliding sporozoites, albeit in reduced numbers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">G</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 4B</xref>; and Supplementary Movie 2, 3, 4 and 5). Quantification of salivary gland sporozoites at 18 days post-blood feeding showed that PsΔ and TyΔ mutants produced approximately half as many sporozoites as the control line (NoΔ) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We next examined sporozoite motility, which typically consists of continuous circular gliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>). PsΔ and TyΔ salivary gland sporozoites were assessed and compared to controls. While PsΔ have a similar gliding velocity compared to controls, TyΔ sporozoites displayed increased gliding velocity (2.5 µm/s vs. 1.4 µm/s) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting a regulatory role of the tyrosination motif in fine-tuning motility. To assess whether these motility phenotypes influenced infectivity, we performed in vivo infection assays with PsΔ and TyΔ. All mutant lines sporozoites were able to infect mice similarly to control parasites (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>). However, the CtΔ mutant failed to produce salivary gland sporozoites entirely (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Since CtΔ mutant parasites failed to reach the salivary glands, we analyzed hemolymph sporozoites for this line compared to the controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). These showed severely impaired motility, lacking the typical gliding pattern and exhibiting significantly reduced speed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). Given that PsΔ and TyΔ mutants produced motile salivary gland sporozoites, we infected HeLa cells with PsΔ and TyΔ mutant sporozoites and CtΔ mutant hemolymph sporozoites to assess their liver stage development and identify any downstream phenotypic effects.</p>

<title>The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> α-tubulin C-terminal mutants undergo liver stage development</title>

Interestingly, as PTM-specific antibodies continued to recognize signals in the PsΔ and TyΔ mutants, it is possible that the parasite compensates by relocating the PTM sites to adjacent residues within the C-terminal sequence.

As expected, the CtΔ hemolymph sporozoites failed to infect and to develop liver stage forms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, L, M, N</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">O</xref>). The sporozoites failed to establish productive infections with a typical PVM at all examined time points (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, M, N</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">O</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm the phenotypes, we compared our mutants with previously generated <italic>P. berghei</italic> α1-tubulin mutants described by Spreng et al. (2019), including parasites with intron deletions (intronΔ), C-terminal tyrosination deletions 540ADY (C-termΔ), and α2-tubulin exon swaps. These mutants showed similar phenotypes, including a complete absence of salivary gland sporozoites in α2-tubulin exon swap parasites, mirroring the CtΔ mutant phenotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">H</xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). These results underscore the importance of α-tubulin C-terminal PTMs in sporozoite formation and migration from the midgut to the salivary glands.</p>
<p>The failure of CtΔ parasites to generate viable sporozoites highlights the essential role of α-tubulin PTMs in sporozoite development and migration. Co-mutation of both α- and β-tubulin PTM sites may prove lethal to parasite development in the mosquito stage. Future studies should focus on identifying and characterizing the enzymes responsible for tubulin PTMs in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, and genetic knockout strategies should be pursued to further elucidate the function of these modifications.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study provides the first in-depth characterization of microtubule architecture and dynamics during the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> liver stage. Using tubulin trackers and α-tubulin antibodies, we identified two major microtubule populations: a large, multimeric subpellicular network that we termed the liver stage parasite microtubule bundles (LSPMB), and the polymerizing hemi-spindles involved in nuclear division. The LSPMB appears to originate from the SSPM and persists until late schizogony. These observations align with earlier electron microscopy studies by Meis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>) who reported the presence of subpellicular microtubules and inner membranes in liver stage parasites up to the point of mitotic spindle formation.</p>
<p>The behavior and function of microtubules are closely regulated by PTMs. We found that α1-tubulin expressed during the liver stage carries residues associated with polyglutamylation and tyrosination. Using PTM-specific antibodies, we confirmed that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites display both modifications on their subpellicular microtubules. Tyrosination, a well-known marker of stable microtubules, has been described in highly motile systems such as cilia, flagella, and spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). This is consistent with the need for high motility in sporozoites, which must traverse multiple tissue barriers during transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>).</p>
<p>Polyglutamylation, in contrast, introduces negative charges on the tubulin surface that enhance interactions with MAPs, and is commonly associated with dynamic microtubule behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). This modification has previously been linked to merozoite formation and intracellular trafficking in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> blood stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The co-occurrence of tyrosination and polyglutamylation in sporozoites likely ensures a microtubule network that is both stable and functionally interactive during mosquito stage migration.</p>
<p>Upon hepatocyte invasion, we observed a loss of tyrosination while polyglutamylation was maintained, suggesting a functional switch from stable to dynamic microtubules (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). This transition may facilitate morphological transformation from a motile, slender sporozoite into a rounded liver stage form and could also support the parasite’s rapid replication. The liver stage is one of the fastest-replicating phases in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life cycle, with replication rates among the highest observed in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>). During this phase, the parasite synthesizes proteins de novo and hijacks host cell lipids and proteins for membrane biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>). We propose that the parasite brings its SSPM into hepatocytes to be repurposed as the LSPMB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The observed microtubule disassembly over time may support tubulin turnover and safes energy for intracellular development.</p>

<caption><title>Model of the tubulin behavior during Plasmodium berghei salivary gland sporozoite and exo-erythrocytic stage.</title>
<p>The graphical abstract summarizes the key finding of this study. It illustrates the development of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites within primary hepatocytes, from invasion to the cytomere stage. α-tubulin was stained with anti-α-tubulin (magenta), nuclei with DAPI (blue), and the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) with anti-UIS4 (grey). The model highlights the evolution of sporozoite subpellicular microtubules (SSPM) into liver stage subpellicular microtubules (LSPMB), along with their associated tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs). We propose that polyglutamylated LSPMB originates from the SSPM and is recycled during liver stage development to support hemi-spindle pole formation, membrane biogenesis, and potentially other functions. Upon hepatocyte invasion, the SSPM loses tyrosination, a modification that initially confers stability and supports sporozoite motility. This detyrosination likely facilitates parasite shape transformation, increases microtubule dynamics, and enables interactions with ER structures and MAPs. Tyrosination reappears in late stages, possibly stabilizing merozoite microtubules for erythrocyte invasion. Microtubule-stabilizing drugs did not affect the SSPM but inhibited liver stage microtubule polymerization, confirming their dynamic nature. Inhibition of microtubule dynamics also prevented merozoite formation. Finally, C-terminal tubulin PTM residues were shown to be essential for salivary gland sporozoite development and successful liver stage infection.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>In addition to their structural roles, LSPMB filaments were occasionally found in contact with hemi-spindle poles, suggesting that LSPMB contribute to spindle formation during schizogony. This connection, although infrequent in fixed cells, was frequently observed during live imaging suggesting a transient connection. We also detected expression of EB1, a microtubule plus-end binding protein previously believed to be restricted to the sexual blood stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>), during mosquito and liver stages. Its localization to LSPMB and hemi-spindles suggests a broader role for EB1 in regulating microtubule dynamics throughout the parasite life cycle.</p>
<p>To directly test the function of tubulin PTMs, we generated <italic>P. berghei</italic> mutants with targeted C-terminal modifications of α1-tubulin. These included a glutamate-to-alanine substitution at a polyglutamylation site, deletion of the tyrosination motif, and complete deletion of the C-terminal tail. Despite the mutations, PTM-specific antibody staining remained detectable in the first two mutants, suggesting compensatory mechanisms such as modification of adjacent residues or of β-tubulin. The tyrosination antibody used (anti-Ty, T9028, Sigma-Aldrich) is a purified monoclonal antibody targeting C-terminal tyrosine residues on tubulins, whereas the monoclonal GT335 antibody (AG-20B-0020-C100, AdipoGen Life Sciences) recognizes the epitope formed at the branching point of polyglutamylation side chains (GEGE*EE, * marking the modification site) and detects both short and long glutamate side chains. The polyclonal antibody (AG-25B-0030-C050, AdipoGen Life Sciences) was raised against at least three glutamate residues and is thereby specific to long polyglutamylation side chains, though both antibodies may cross-react with β-tubulin or other proteins containing genetically encoded C-terminal modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>). The reduced fluorescence signal observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) in mutant parasite microtubules suggests either antibody cross-reactivity with β-tubulin or compensatory PTM relocation to adjacent α-tubulin residues. In the CtΔ mutant (lacking the entire C-terminal tail), PTM relocation is abolished, and residual signal likely stems from β-tubulin which was insufficient to sustain sporozoite motility and transmission. These possibilities warrant further investigation. Previous studies have also demonstrated partial redundancy between α1- and α2-tubulin modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). However, the complete C-terminal deletion mutant failed to produce salivary gland sporozoites and could not establish liver stage infection. These results are consistent with findings from Spreng et al. (2019), who showed that α1-tubulin mutants lacking the C-terminal region produced defective sporozoites with altered microtubule numbers and impaired motility.</p>
<p>We also observed that the LSPMB relocates during liver stage development. Using expansion microscopy on PMP1::GFP-expressing parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>), we found that the LSPMB localizes between the parasite plasma membrane and the PVM. This differs from earlier reports of SSPM positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>) but both notions are not mutually exclusive. It is possible that the LSPMB first localizes within the parasite but then re-localizes at later stages or even re-localizes dynamically. Its localization between the PM and the PVM positions it well for interaction with the host cell indicating an interaction with host cell structures such as ER tubules or host microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>). However, whether this re-localization plays a role in nutrient acquisition or host-pathogen signaling remains to be explored.</p>
<p>Finally, during late schizogony and merozoite formation, we observed the reappearance of tyrosinated tubulin. This may reflect the need for stable microtubules in newly formed merozoites, which must be competent for host cell invasion.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study reveals a previously unrecognized complexity in the microtubule biology of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> liver stages. The identification of the LSPMB as a dynamic structure regulated by tubulin PTMs and repurposed from the sporozoite cytoskeleton opens new avenues for understanding how the parasite controls its intracellular architecture. These PTMs appear critical for parasite shape, replication, and stage transition, and may represent valuable targets for therapeutic intervention. Future work should aim to identify the enzymes responsible for these modifications and explore their potential as drug targets. The behavior and function of microtubules are closely tied to their PTMs. We found that α1-tubulin expressed during the liver stage carries residues predicted to undergo polyglutamylation and tyrosination.</p>
<p>Using PTM-specific antibodies, we confirmed that sporozoite microtubules are both tyrosinated and polyglutamylated. Tyrosination is typically associated with stable microtubules and has been described in highly motile structures such as cilia and spermatozoa. This is consistent with the sporozoite’s need for high motility gliding at approximately 1.5 µm/s as it migrates from the mosquito midgut to the salivary glands and eventually traverses skin and vasculature to reach hepatocytes.</p>

<title><italic>P. berghei</italic> lines used in this study and the generation of transgenic parasites</title>
<p>The <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA parasite line was utilized for both murine and cellular infection models. To generate the α1-tubulin C-terminal mutant and eb1::eGFP parasite lines, the C-terminal coding and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) were cloned into the double homologous recombination vector pDHR, which contains the 3’UTR PbDHFR, the ef1α promoter region, the selectable markers hdhfr::yfcu, and additional 3’UTR PbDHFR sequences. The pDHR vector backbone originated from the plasmid pG362 (kindly provided by the Waters lab) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>).</p>
<p>First, the pG362 plasmid was digested with SacII and PstI to remove the AID, selectable marker, and GFP sequences. The amplified product (linker-eGFP-3’UTR PbDHFR) from the pOB277 vector was then cloned using T4 DNA ligase (NEB, M0202L). For subsequent cloning, restriction sites were added to the forward (KpnI and ApaI) and reverse (EcoRI and SmaI) primers. The plasmid was then digested with EcoRI and SmaI to clone the amplified product: ef1α promoter region-hdhfr::yfcu marker (a fusion gene of the positive selection marker human dihydrofolate reductase (hdhfr) and the negative selection marker yeast cytosine deaminase-uridyl phosphoribosyl transferase (yfcu) 3’UTR PbDHFR from the genomic DNA of the <italic>P. berghei</italic> GIMO parasites (RMgm-687) parental line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>).</p>

The linker-eGFP region of the pDHR vector was removed using ApaI and NotI restriction enzymes. The 5’UTR of the α1-tubulin gene was then subcloned into the digested pDHR using Gibson assembly. The resulting vector was digested with SmaI, and the PbHsp70 promoter and mCherry regions from RMgm-687, along with the 3’UTR of the α1-tubulin gene, were subcloned into the vector at the ApaI and SmaI restriction sites, respectively, using Gibson assembly.</p>

Mice were euthanized via CO₂ inhalation (1–2 minutes), and after securing the animal in a supine position, a midline abdominal incision was made to expose the portal vein or inferior vena cava (IVC). A peristaltic pump was pre-rinsed with 70% ethanol and HEPES buffer, then set to 50 for initial cannulation of the portal vein (or IVC) using a Teflon-coated needle. Upon successful insertion, the flow was increased to maximum (999), and the opposing vein was severed to allow perfusion with HEPES buffer for 5 minutes, during which periodic clamping (10 seconds per minute) of the cut vein was performed. The tubing was subsequently changed to a collagenase solution, and perfusion was held for 7 minutes with repeated clamping. The liver was excised, transferred to a collagenase-containing well, and mechanically dissociated using filter tips and gentle shaking with forceps. Cell suspensions were sequentially collected, pooled, and washed with William’s Medium E (WME) by centrifugation at 50g for 2 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in WME, optionally passed through a 70 µm nylon strainer, and washed twice more. The final pellet was resuspended in WME complete medium (WME supplemented with L-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, amphotericin B, insulin-transferrin, and aprotinin), and cells were counted and seeded at densities appropriate for T25 flasks, GB dishes, or 24-well plates.

Gelation was then performed by adding 5 µL each of 10% tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED; 17919, Thermo Fisher) and 10% ammonium persulfate (APS) to 90 µL of monomer solution containing 19% sodium acrylate (408220, Sigma), 10% acrylamide (A4058, Sigma), and 0.1% N, N’-methylenebisacrylamide (M1533, Sigma). A 35 µL of monomer solution was dispensed onto parafilm in a humidity chamber, and coverslips containing the anchored cells were inverted onto droplets. Following 5 minutes incubation on ice to improve gel penetration, gels were polymerized at 37°C for 30 minutes. Gel-embedded samples were transferred to denaturation buffer (200 mM SDS, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9) in 6-well plates and agitated (200 rpm) at room temperature for 15 minutes, followed by incubation in fresh buffer at 95°C for 1 hour with gentle shaking. Gel expansion was performed in autoclaved MilliQ water (50 mL) for 1 hour with optional buffer exchange. For immunostaining, gels were incubated with primary antibodies in 2% BSA for 2 hours at 37°C, washed with PBS-Tween 0.1%, then labelled with secondary antibodies plus 1 µg/mL DAPI for nuclear staining in 2% BSA for 2 hours at 37°C. Final gel expansion was conducted in MilliQ water containing 0.2% propyl gallate (02370, Sigma) to prevent photobleaching. Expanded samples were mounted on poly-D-lysine-coated (A38904, Gibco USA) glass-bottom dishes with cellular surfaces facing downward and imaged with confocal microscopy.</p>

<title>In vivo assay</title>
<p>To assess the infectivity of parasite mutant sporozoites to hepatocytes, <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes infected with different parasite mutants were allowed to feed on anesthetized naïve mice as previously described (Atchou et al., 2025). Three mice per parasite line and five mosquitoes per mouse were used. The blood stage infection progression was monitored daily via flow cytometry, starting from the day of infection until mice tested positive.</p>

<title>Oocyst size measurement</title>
<p>To quantify oocyst size, <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes were allowed to feed on anesthetized mice infected with the parasite (Rogerio et al. 2006; Hegge et al., 2009). At 7- and 11-days post-feeding, ten mosquitoes per time point were dissected, and their midguts were extracted and placed in 1× PBS. The midguts were then transferred to a 21-well microscopy slide, covered with a coverslip, and imaged using a Nikon Crest V3 confocal microscope (10× objective). The oocyst area was measured using Fiji software (ImageJ). Each experiment was performed in triplicate for every parasite line.</p>

<title>Liver stage parasite size measurement</title>
<p>To quantify the parasite size during liver stage development, HeLa cells (40,000 cells/well, triplicate) were seeded in 96-well plates and infected 24 hours later with 20,000 sporozoites per well. After a 2-hour incubation at 37°C, infected cells from each well were washed and redistributed into eight wells across two 96 well plates (4 wells/plate) to optimize cell density for imaging (Pino et al., 2017; Atchou et al., 2025; Sturm et al., 2006). Parasite development was analyzed at 6, 24, and 48 hpi using an InCell Analyzer 2000 with 10x objective. The image processing parameters such as kernel size, sensitivity, and size thresholds were optimized in InCell Developer software to distinguish individual parasites from background signals. Parasite growth was assessed based on size measurements, while survival rates were calculated as percentages relative to 6 hpi baseline counts.</p>

<title>Image processing and data analysis</title>
<p>All the live cell imaging, expansion microscopy, and IFA images in this study were acquired with Nikon W1 LIPSI and Crest V3, both in spinning disk mode.

The counts, volumes, and coefficients of the isospots or isosurfaces were retrieved in .csv files, which were then imported into GraphPad Prism for statistical analysis. All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 10.4.1 for macOS (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA). Statistical comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test (*p ≤ 0.05, p ≤ 0.01, *p ≤ 0.001). All experiments in the study were carried out in triplicate.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>valuable</bold> insights into microtubule remodeling during liver-stage Plasmodium berghei development, demonstrating that deletion of the alpha-tubulin C-terminal tail impairs parasite growth in mosquitoes and abolishes infection in HeLa cells. The work is technically ambitious, employing advanced microscopy, genetic mutants, and pharmacological approaches. However, key claims are only partially supported due to <bold>incomplete</bold> evidence linking tubulin modifications to microtubule dynamics and uncertain antibody-based PTM detection.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated microtubule distribution and their possible post-translational modifications (PTM) in Plasmodium berghei during development of the liver stage, using either hepatocytes or HeLa cells as models. They used conventional immunofluorescence assays and expansion microscopy with various antibodies recognising tubulin and, in the second part of the work, its candidate PTMs, as well as markers of Plasmodium, in addition to live imaging with a fluorescent marker for tubulin. In the third part of the study, they generated 3 mutants deprived of either the last four residues or the last 11 residues, or where a candidate polyglutamylation site was substituted by an alanine residue.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In the first part, microtubules are monitored by a combination of two approaches (IFA and live), revealing nicely the evolution of the sporozoite subpellicular microtubules (SSPM, the sporozoite is the developmental stage present in salivary glands of the mosquitoes and that infects hepatocytes) into a different structure termed liver-stage parasite microtubule bundle (LSPMB). The LSPMB shrinks during the course of parasite development and finally disappears while hemi-spindles emerge over time. Contact points between these two structures are observed frequently in live cells and occasionally in fixed cells, suggesting the intriguing possibility that tubulin might be recycled from the LSPMB to contribute to hemi-spindle formation.</p>
<p>In the second part, antibodies recognising (1) the final tyrosine found at the C-terminal tail and (2) a stretch of 3 glutamate residues in a side chain are used to monitor these candidate PTMs. Signals are positive at the SSPM, and while it remains positive for polyglutamylation, it becomes negative for the final tyrosine at the LSPM, while a positive signal emerges at hemi-spindles at later stages of development.</p>
<p>In the last part, the three mutants are fed to mosquitoes, where they show reduced development, the one lacking the alpha-tubulin tail even failing to reach the salivary glands. However, the two other mutants infect HeLa cells normally, whereas sporozoites with the C-terminal tail deletion recovered from the haemolymph did not develop in these cells.</p>
<p>The first part provides convincing evidence that microtubules are extensively remodelled during the infection of hepatocytes and HeLa cells, in agreement with the spectacular Plasmodium morphogenetic changes accompanying massive and rapid proliferation. The third part brings further confirmation that the C-terminal tail of alpha-tubulin is essential for multiple stages of parasite development, in agreement with previous work (50). Since it is the region where several post-translational modifications take place in other organisms (detyrosination, polyglutamylation, glycylation), it makes sense to propose that the essential function is related to these PTMs also in Plasmodium.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The significance of tubulin PTM relies on two antibodies whose reactivity to Plasmodium tubulins is unclear (see below). The interpretation of the literature on detyrosination and polyglutamylation is confusing in several places, meaning that the statements about the possible role of these PTMs need to be carefully revisited.</p>
<p>The authors use the term &quot;tyrosination&quot; but the alpha1-tubulin studied here possesses the final tyrosine when it is synthesised, so it is &quot;tyrosinated&quot; by default. It could potentially be removed by a tyrosine carboxypeptidase of the vasoinhibin family (VASH) as reported in other species. After removal, this tyrosine can be added again by a tubulin-tyrosine ligase (TTL) enzyme. It is therefore more appropriate to talk about detyrosination-retyrosination rather than tyrosination (this confusion is unfortunately common in the literature, see Janke &amp; Magiera, 2020).</p>
<p>The difficulty here is that there is so far no evidence that detyrosination takes place in Plasmodium. Neither VASH nor TTL could be identified in the Plasmodium genome (ref 31, something we can confirm with our unsuccessful BLAST analyses), and mass spectrometry studies of purified tubulin, albeit from blood stages, did not find evidence for detyrosination (reference 43). Western blots using an antibody against detyrosinated tubulin did not produce a positive signal, neither on purified tubulin, nor on whole parasites (43). Of course, the situation could be different in liver stages, but the question of the detyrosinating enzyme is still there. The existence of a unique Plasmodium system for detyrosination cannot be formally ruled out, but given the high degree of conservation of these PTMs and their associated enzymes, it sounds difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>The fact that the anti-tyrosinated antibody still produced a signal in the cell line where the final tyrosine is deleted raises issues about its specificity. A cross-reactivity with beta-tubulin is proposed, but the Plasmodium beta-tubulin does not carry a final tyrosine, further raising concerns about antibody specificity.</p>
<p>The interpretation of these results should therefore be considered carefully. There also seems to be some confusion in the function of detyrosination cited from the literature. It is said in line 229 that &quot;tyrosination has been associated with stable microtubules&quot; (33, 34, 50, 55). References 33 and 34 actually show that tyrosinated microtubules turn over faster in neurons or in epithelial cells, respectively, while references 50 and 55 do not study de/retyrosination. The general consensus is that tyrosinated microtubules are more dynamic (see reference 24).</p>
<p>The situation is a bit different for polyglutamylation since several candidate poly- or mono-glutamylases have been identified in the Plasmodium genome, and at least mono-glutamylation of beta-tubulin has been formally proven, still in bloodstream stages (ref 43). The authors propose that the residue E445 is the polyglutamylation site. To our knowledge, this has not been demonstrated for Plasmodium. This residue is indeed the favourite one in several organisms such as humans and trypanosomes (Eddé et al., Science 1990; Schneider et al., JCS, 1997), and it is tempting to propose it would be the same here. However, TTLLs bind the tubulin tails from their C-terminal end like a glove on a finger (Garnham et al., Cell, 2015), and the presence of two extra residues in Plasmodium tubulins would mean that the reactive glutamate might be in position E447 rather than E445. This is worth discussing.</p>
<p>
On the positive side, it is encouraging to see that signals for both anti-tyrosinated tail and poly-glutamylated side chain are going down in the various mutants, but this would need validation with a comparison for alpha-tubulin signal.</p>
<p>Line 316: polyglutamylation &quot;is commonly associated with dynamic microtubule behavior (78-80)&quot;. Actually, references 78 and 79 show the impact of this PTM on interaction with spastin, and reference 80 discusses polyglutamylation as a marker of stable microtubules in the context of cilia and flagella. The consensus is that polyglutamylated microtubules tend to be more stable (ref24).</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>The first and the third parts of this manuscript - evolution of microtubules and importance of the C-terminal tails for Plasmodium development - are convincing and well supported by data. However, the presence and role of tubulin PTM should be carefully reconsidered.</p>
<p>Plasmodium tubulins are more closely related to plant tubulins and are sensitive to inhibitors that do not affect mammalian microtubules. They therefore represent promising drug targets as several well-characterised compounds used as herbicides are available. The work produced here further defines the evolution of the microtubule network in sporozoites and liver stages, which are the initial and essential first steps of the infection. Moreover, Plasmodium has multiple specificities that make it a fascinating organism to study both for cell biology and evolution. The data reported here are elegant and will attract the attention of the community working on parasites but also on the cytoskeleton at large. It will be interesting to have the feedback of other people working on tubulin PTMs to figure out the significance of this part of the work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Atchou et al. investigates the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton in sporozoites of Plasmodium berghei, including possible functions of microtubule post-translational modifications (tyrosination and polyglutamylation) in the development of sporozoites in the liver. They also assessed the development of sporozoites in the mosquito. Using cell culture models and in vivo infections with parasites that contain tubulin mutants deficient in certain PTMs, they show that may aspects of the life cycle progression are impaired. The main conclusion is that microtubule PTMs play a major role in the differentiation processes of the parasites.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of major and minor points of criticism that relate to the interpretation of some of the data.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>(1) The first paragraph of &quot;Results&quot; almost suggests that the presence of a subpellicular MT-array in sporozoites is a new discovery. This is not the case, see e.g. the recent publication by Ferreira et al. (Nature Communications, 2023).</p>
<p>(2) Why were HeLa cells and not hepatocytes (as in Figure 3) used for measuring infection rates of the mutants in Figure 5H and 5L? As I understand, HeLa cells are not natural host cells for invading sporozoites. HeLa cells are epithelial cells derived from a cervical tumour. I am not an expert in Plasmodium biology, but is a HeLa infection an accepted surrogate model for liver stage development?</p>
<p>(3) The tubulin staining in Figures 1A and 1B is confusing and doesn't seem to make sense. Whereas in 1A the antibody nicely stains host and parasite tubulin, in 1B, only parasite tubulin is visible. If the same antibody and the same host cells have been used, HeLa cytoplasmic microtubules should be visible in 1B. In fact, they should be the predominant antigen. The same applies to Figure 2, where host microtubules are also not visible.</p>
<p>(4) In Figures 2A and B, the host nuclei appear to have very different sizes in the DMSO controls and in the drug-treated cells. For example, in the 20 µM (-) image (bottom right), the nuclei are much larger than in the DMSO (-) control (top left). If this is the case, expansion microscopy hasn't worked reproducibly, and therefore, quantification of fluorescence is problematic. The scalebar is the same for all panels.</p>
<p>(5) I don't quite follow the argument that spindles and the LSPMB are dynamic structures (e.g., lines 145, 174). That is a trivial statement for the spindle, as it is always dynamic, but beyond that, it has only been shown that the structure is sensitive to oryzalin. That says little about any &quot;natural&quot; dynamic behaviour. Any microtubule structure can be destroyed by a particular physical or chemical treatment, but that doesn't mean all structures are dynamic. It also depends on the definition of &quot;dynamic&quot; in a particular context, for example, the time scale of dynamic behaviour (changes within seconds, minutes, or hours).</p>
<p>(6) I am not sure what part in the story EB1 plays. The data are only shown in the Supplements and don't seem to be of particular relevance. EB1 is a ubiquitous protein associated with microtubule plus ends. The statement (line 192) that it &quot;may play a broader role...&quot; is unsubstantiated and cannot be based merely on the observation that it is expressed in a particular life cycle stage.</p>
<p>(7) Line 196 onwards: The antibody IN105 is better known in the field as polyE. Maybe that should be added in Materials and Methods. Also, the antibody T9028 against tyrosinated tubulin is poorly validated in the literature and rarely used. Usually, researchers in this field use the monoclonal antibody YL1/2. I am not sure why this unusual antibody was chosen in this study. In fact, has its specificity against tyrosinated α-tubulin from Plasmodium berghei ever been shown? The original antigen was human and had the sequence EGEEY. The Plasmodium sequence is YEADY and hence very different. It is stated that the LSPMB is both polyglutamylated and tyrosinated. This is unusual because polyglutamylated microtubules are usually indicative of stable microtubules, whereas tyrosinated microtubules are found on freshly polymerised and dynamic microtubules. However, a co-localisation within the same cell has not been attempted. This is, however, possible since polyE is a rabbit antibody and T9028 is a mouse antibody. I suspect that differences or gradients along the LSPMB would have been noticed. Also, in lines 207/208, it is said that tyrosination disappears after hepatocyte invasion, which is shown in Figure 3. However, in Figure 3A, quite a lot of positive signals for tyrosination are visible in the 54 and 56 hpi panels.</p>
<p>(8) In line 229, it is stated that tyrosination &quot;has previously been associated with stable microtubule in motility&quot;. This statement is not correct. In fact, none of the cited references that apparently support this statement show that this is the case. On the contrary, stable microtubules, such as flagellar axonemes, are almost completely detyrosinated. Therefore, tyrosination is a marker for dynamic microtubules, whereas detyrosinated microtubules are indicative of stable microtubules. This is an established fact, and it is odd that the authors claim the opposite.</p>
<p>(9) Line 236 onwards: Concerning the generation of tubulin mutants, I think it is necessary to demonstrate successful replacement of the wild-type allele by the mutant allele. I am sure the authors have done this by amplification and subsequent sequencing of the genomic locus using PCR primers outside the plasmid sequences. I suggest including this information, e.g., by displaying the chromatograph trace in a supplementary figure. Or are the sequences displayed in Figure S3B already derived from sequenced genomic DNA? This is not described in the Legend or in Materials and Methods. The left PCR products obtained for Figure S3 B would be a suitable template for sequencing.</p>
<p>(10) It is also important to be aware of the fact that glutamylation also occurs on β-tubulin. This signal will also be detected by polyE (IN105). Therefore, it is surprising that IN105 immunofluorescence is negative on the C-term Δ cells (Figure S3 D). Is there anything known about confirmed polyglutamylation sites on both α- and β-tubulins in Plasmodium, e.g., by MS? In Toxoplasma, both α- and β-tubulin have been shown to be polyglutamylated.</p>
<p>(11) Figure S3 is very confusing. In the legend, certain intron deletions are mentioned. How does this relate to posttranslational tubulin modifications? The corresponding section in Results (lines 288-292) is also not very helpful in understanding this.</p>
<p>(12) Figure 4E doesn't look like brightfield microscopy but like some sort of fluorescent imaging. In Figure 4C, were the control (NoΔ) cells with an integrated cassette, but no mutations, or non-transgenic cells?</p>
<p>(13) It is difficult to understand why the TyΔ and the CtΔ mutants still show quite a strong signal using the anti-tyrosination antibody. If the mutants have replaced all wild-type alleles, the signal should be completely absent, unless the antibody (see my comment above concerning T9028) cross-reacts with detyrosinated microtubules. Therefore, the quantitation in Figures 5F and 5G is actually indicative of something that shouldn't be like that. The quantitation of 5F is at odds with the microscopy image in 5D. If this image is representative, the anti-Ty staining in TyΔ is as strong as in the control NoΔ.</p>
<p>(14) The statement that the failure of CtΔ mutants to generate viable sporozoites is due to the lack of microtubule PTMs (lines 295-296) is speculative. The lack of the entire C-terminal tail could have a number of consequences, such as impaired microtubule assembly or failure to recruit and bind associated proteins. This is not necessarily linked to PTMs. Also, it has been shown in yeast that for microtubules to form properly and exquisite regulation (proteostasis) of the ratio between α- and β-tubulin is essential (Wethekam and Moore, 2023). I am not sure, but according to Materials and Methods (line 423), the gene cassettes for replacing the wild-type tubulin gene with the mutant versions contain a selectable marker gene for pyrimethamine selection. Are there qPCR data that show that expression levels of mutant α-tubulin are more or less the same as the wild-type levels?</p>
<p>(15) In the Discussion, my impression is that two recent studies, the superb Expansion Microscopy study by Bertiaux et al. (2021) and the cryo-EM study by Ferreira et al. (2023), are not sufficiently recognised (although they are cited elsewhere in the manuscript). The latter study includes a detailed description of the microtubule cytoskeleton in sporozoites. However, the present study clearly expands the knowledge about the structure of the cytoskeleton in liver stage parasites and is one of the few studies addressing the distribution and function of microtubule post-translational modifications in Plasmodium.</p>
<p>(16) I somewhat disagree with the statement of a co-occurrence of polyglutamylated and tyrosinated microtubules. I think the resolution is too low to reach that conclusion. As this is a bold claim, and would be contrary to what is known from other organisms, it would require a more rigorous validation. Given the apparent problems with the anti-Ty antibody (signal in the TyΔ mutant), one should be very cautious with this claim.</p>
<p>(17) In the Discussion (lines 311 and 377), it is again claimed that tyrosinated microtubules are &quot;a well-known marker of stable microtubules&quot;. This statement is completely incorrect, and I am surprised by this serious mistake. A few lines later, the authors say that polyglutamylated is &quot;commonly associated with dynamic microtubule behaviour&quot;. Again, this is completely incorrect and is the opposite of what is firmly established in the literature. Polyglutamylation and detyrosination are markers of stable microtubules.</p>
<p>(18) In line 339, the authors interpret the residual antibody staining after the introduction of the mutant tubulin as a compensatory mechanism. There is no evidence for this. More likely explanations are firstly the quality of the anti-Ty-antibody used (see comment above), and the fact that also β-tubulin carries C-terminal polyglutamylation sites, which haven't been investigated in this study. PTMs on β-tubulin are not compensatory, but normal PTMs, at least in all other organisms where microtubule PTMs have been investigated.</p>

<p>The difficulty here is that there is so far no evidence that detyrosination takes place in Plasmodium. Neither VASH nor TTL could be identified in the Plasmodium genome (ref 31, something we can confirm with our unsuccessful BLAST analyses), and mass spectrometry studies of purified tubulin, albeit from blood stages, did not find evidence for detyrosination (reference 43). Western blots using an antibody against detyrosinated tubulin did not produce a positive signal, neither on purified tubulin, nor on whole parasites (43). Of course, the situation could be different in liver stages, but the question of the detyrosinating enzyme is still there. The existence of a unique Plasmodium system for detyrosination cannot be formally ruled out but given the high degree of conservation of these PTMs and their associated enzymes, it sounds difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>The fact that the anti-tyrosinated antibody still produced a signal in the cell line where the final tyrosine is deleted raises issues about its specificity. A cross-reactivity with beta-tubulin is proposed, but the Plasmodium beta-tubulin does not carry a final tyrosine, further raising concerns about antibody specificity.</p>
<p>The interpretation of these results should therefore be considered carefully. There also seems to be some confusion in the function of detyrosination cited from the literature. It is said in line 229 that &quot;tyrosination has been associated with stable microtubules&quot; (33, 34, 50, 55). References 33 and 34 actually show that tyrosinated microtubules turn over faster in neurons or in epithelial cells, respectively, while references 50 and 55 do not study de/retyrosination. The general consensus is that tyrosinated microtubules are more dynamic (see reference 24).</p>
<p>The situation is a bit different for polyglutamylation since several candidate poly- or mono-glutamylases have been identified in the Plasmodium genome, and at least mono-glutamylation of beta-tubulin has been formally proven, still in bloodstream stages (ref 43). The authors propose that the residue E445 is the polyglutamylation site. To our knowledge, this has not been demonstrated for Plasmodium. This residue is indeed the favourite one in several organisms such as humans and trypanosomes (Eddé et al., Science 1990; Schneider et al., JCS, 1997), and it is tempting to propose it would be the same here. However, TTLLs bind the tubulin tails from their C-terminal end like a glove on a finger (Garnham et al., Cell, 2015), and the presence of two extra residues in Plasmodium tubulins would mean that the reactive glutamate might be in position E447 rather than E445. This is worth discussing.</p>
<p>On the positive side, it is encouraging to see that signals for both anti-tyrosinated tail and poly-glutamylated side chain are going down in the various mutants, but this would need validation with a comparison for alpha-tubulin signal.</p>
<p>Line 316: polyglutamylation &quot;is commonly associated with dynamic microtubule behavior (78-80)&quot;. Actually, references 78 and 79 show the impact of this PTM on interaction with spastin, and reference 80 discusses polyglutamylation as a marker of stable microtubules in the context of cilia and flagella. The consensus is that polyglutamylated microtubules tend to be more stable (ref24).</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>The first and the third parts of this manuscript - evolution of microtubules and importance of the C-terminal tails for Plasmodium development - are convincing and well supported by data. However, the presence and role of tubulin PTM should be carefully reconsidered.</p>
<p>Plasmodium tubulins are more closely related to plant tubulins and are sensitive to inhibitors that do not affect mammalian microtubules. They therefore represent promising drug targets as several well-characterised compounds used as herbicides are available. The work produced here further defines the evolution of the microtubule network in sporozoites and liver stages, which are the initial and essential first steps of the infection. Moreover, Plasmodium has multiple specificities that make it a fascinating organism to study both for cell biology and evolution. The data reported here are elegant and will attract the attention of the community working on parasites but also on the cytoskeleton at large. It will be interesting to have the feedback of other people working on tubulin PTMs to figure out the significance of this part of the work.</p>

<p>We thank Reviewer #2 for the thoughtful and detailed evaluation of our manuscript. We are pleased that the reviewer found our study elegant and believe it will attract the attention of the broader scientific community, both those working on parasites and those focused on cytoskeleton biology. We also acknowledge the concerns raised regarding the specificity of the antibodies used to detect tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs), as well as the interpretation of their signals and the current lack of identified detyrosination enzymes in the Plasmodium genome. We agree that these are important limitations, and we will address them thoroughly in the revised manuscript. This includes clarifying our interpretation of tyrosination versus detyrosination, adjusting our claims regarding polyglutamylation sites, and carefully revisiting the literature cited to ensure accurate contextualization of PTM function in microtubule stability.</p>
<p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s close reading and critical feedback, which will help us substantially improve the clarity, precision, and strength of our manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Atchou et al. investigates the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton in sporozoites of Plasmodium berghei, including possible functions of microtubule post-translational modifications (tyrosination and polyglutamylation) in the development of sporozoites in the liver. They also assessed the development of sporozoites in the mosquito. Using cell culture models and in vivo infections with parasites that contain tubulin mutants deficient in certain PTMs, they show that may aspects of the life cycle progression are impaired. The main conclusion is that microtubule PTMs play a major role in the differentiation processes of the parasites.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of major and minor points of criticism that relate to the interpretation of some of the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #3 for the overall positive assessment of our study and for recognizing its contribution to advancing our understanding of Plasmodium biology and malaria pathogenesis. We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive feedback, particularly regarding the interpretation of some of our data. These comments have been very helpful in guiding our revisions, and we have worked to improve both the clarity of our presentation and the precision of our interpretations in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Below, we respond in detail to each of the reviewer’s points.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>
(1) The first paragraph of &quot;Results&quot; almost suggests that the presence of a subpellicular MT-array in sporozoites is a new discovery. This is not the case, see e.g. the recent publication by Ferreira et al. (Nature Communications, 2023).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and fully agree that the subpellicular microtubule (SPM) array in sporozoites is well established, as documented in earlier work (e.g., Cyrklaff et al., 2007) and more recently by Ferreira et al. (Nat. Commun., 2023). Our intention was not to suggest that the existence of the SSPM is a novel finding. Rather, our study builds on this existing knowledge by demonstrating that these sporozoite-derived microtubules are not disassembled upon hepatocyte entry but are repurposed into a newly described structure, the liver stage parasite microtubule bundle (LSPMB). This reorganization, its persistence into liver stage development, and its dynamic role in microtubule remodeling and nuclear division are, to our knowledge, novel observations. We will revise the manuscript to make this distinction clearer in the introduction and the results section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Why were HeLa cells and not hepatocytes (as in Figure 3) used for measuring infection rates of the mutants in Figure 5H and 5L? As I understand, HeLa cells are not natural host cells for invading sporozoites. HeLa cells are epithelial cells derived from a cervical tumour. I am not an expert in Plasmodium biology, but is a HeLa infection an accepted surrogate model for liver stage development?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify our experimental model. While HeLa cells are not the natural host cells, they are a well-established and validated in vitro model for studying Plasmodium berghei liver stage development in our lab and others. In this system, the parasite completes its full development and generates infectious merozoites. Numerous studies have successfully used HeLa cells as a liver stage infection model, with key findings subsequently validated in primary hepatocytes or in vivo, confirming its utility as a representative model. We employed this cell line primarily to reduce animal usage in accordance with the 3Rs principles (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement). Importantly, to ensure the biological relevance of our discoveries in HeLa cells, we validated our key findings in primary mouse hepatocytes, as shown in Figure 3. Furthermore, we confirmed the in vivo infectivity of mutant parasite lines that produced typical salivary gland sporozoites through an in vivo infection assay, presented in Figure S4C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The tubulin staining in Figures 1A and 1B is confusing and doesn't seem to make sense. Whereas in 1A the antibody nicely stains host and parasite tubulin, in 1B, only parasite tubulin is visible. If the same antibody and the same host cells have been used, HeLa cytoplasmic microtubules should be visible in 1B. In fact, they should be the predominant antigen. The same applies to Figure 2, where host microtubules are also not visible.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this careful observation regarding the α-tubulin staining in Figures 1A and 1B. The same host cell type (HeLa) and α-tubulin antibody were indeed used in both experiments. Figure 1A shows results from conventional immunofluorescence assays, where both host and parasite microtubules are clearly stained. In contrast, Figure 1B shows the outcome of ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM), where parasite microtubules appear prominently, while host microtubules are less visible.</p>
<p>This effect appears to be a technical outcome of the U-ExM protocol, which can differentially preserve or reveal microtubule epitopes. We consistently observed stronger parasite signal across various cell types, including primary hepatocytes (Figure 3A,B). The lack of visible host microtubules in some U-ExM images does not reflect their absence, but rather reduced signal intensity relative to the parasite structures. This is not observed with all antibodies, e.g., host microtubules stain strongly with anti-tyrosinated α-tubulin (Figure 3B), likely reflecting their high tyrosination state.</p>
<p>To overcome this limitation, we employed PS-ExM and combined PS-ExM/U-ExM approaches (as described in reference 56), which allowed simultaneous high-resolution visualization of both host and parasite microtubule networks. These combined methods are now being used in follow-up studies to investigate host–parasite microtubule interactions in more detail.</p>
<p>We will clarify this point in the revised manuscript to avoid confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figures 2A and B, the host nuclei appear to have very different sizes in the DMSO controls and in the drug-treated cells. For example, in the 20 µM (-) image (bottom right), the nuclei are much larger than in the DMSO (-) control (top left). If this is the case, expansion microscopy hasn't worked reproducibly, and therefore, quantification of fluorescence is problematic. The scalebar is the same for all panels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The expansion microscopy methods used in this study have been rigorously validated for both reproducibility and isotropicity. However, as the reviewer rightly notes, host cell nuclei can vary in size due to several factors, including cell cycle stage, infection status, and the extent of parasite development, all of which can influence host nuclei morphology and size.</p>
<p>Importantly, the quantifications relevant to our conclusions were focused specifically on parasite structures. We did not rely on host nuclear size or host fluorescence intensity as a quantitative readout in this context. While we acknowledge the observed variability in host nuclear dimensions, it does not compromise the accuracy or reproducibility of the parasite specific measurements central to our study.</p>
<p>We will clarify this point in the revised figure legend and manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) I don't quite follow the argument that spindles and the LSPMB are dynamic structures (e.g., lines 145, 174). That is a trivial statement for the spindle, as it is always dynamic, but beyond that, it has only been shown that the structure is sensitive to oryzalin. That says little about any &quot;natural&quot; dynamic behaviour. Any microtubule structure can be destroyed by a particular physical or chemical treatment, but that doesn't mean all structures are dynamic. It also depends on the definition of &quot;dynamic&quot; in a particular context, for example, the time scale of dynamic behaviour (changes within seconds, minutes, or hours).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that sensitivity to chemical depolymerization alone does not necessarily indicate dynamic behavior, particularly in the absence of data on turnover kinetics or temporal changes.</p>
<p>Our interpretation was based on two observations: first, that the LSPMB, which derives from the highly stable sporozoite subpellicular microtubules (known to be drug-resistant), becomes susceptible to depolymerization during the liver stage; and second, that the LSPMB gradually shrinks over time during parasite development. These features suggested a transition toward a more dynamic state compared to its origin. However, we fully agree that “dynamic” is a context-dependent term and that direct evidence such as turnover rates or structural changes on short time scales, is required to rigorously define microtubule dynamics.</p>
<p>We will revise the manuscript to clarify our use of this term and explicitly acknowledge the need for further studies to characterize the timescale and mechanisms underlying LSPMB remodeling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) I am not sure what part in the story EB1 plays. The data are only shown in the Supplements and don't seem to be of particular relevance. EB1 is a ubiquitous protein associated with microtubule plus ends. The statement (line 192) that it &quot;may play a broader role...&quot; is unsubstantiated and cannot be based merely on the observation that it is expressed in a particular life cycle stage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that EB1 is a ubiquitous microtubule plus-end binding protein and that its presence alone does not imply a novel function. Previous studies (e.g., Maurer et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Zeeshan et al., 2023) have focused on its role during Plasmodium sexual stages, while its expression during liver and mosquito stages has not been previously documented.</p>
<p>Our data extend this knowledge by showing that EB1 is also expressed during liver stage development, particularly during the highly mitotic schizont phase. While we agree that this observation alone does not prove functional involvement, it raises the possibility of a broader role for EB1 in regulating microtubule dynamics beyond sexual stages. To avoid overinterpretation, we have presented these findings in the supplementary material and will revise the manuscript to tone down speculative statements and clearly frame this as a preliminary observation that warrants further investigation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Line 196 onwards: The antibody IN105 is better known in the field as polyE. Maybe that should be added in Materials and Methods. Also, the antibody T9028 against tyrosinated tubulin is poorly validated in the literature and rarely used. Usually, researchers in this field use the monoclonal antibody YL1/2. I am not sure why this unusual antibody was chosen in this study. In fact, has its specificity against tyrosinated α-tubulin from Plasmodium berghei ever been shown? The original antigen was human and had the sequence EGEEY. The Plasmodium sequence is YEADY and hence very different. It is stated that the LSPMB is both polyglutamylated and tyrosinated. This is unusual because polyglutamylated microtubules are usually indicative of stable microtubules, whereas tyrosinated microtubules are found on freshly polymerised and dynamic microtubules. However, a co-localisation within the same cell has not been attempted. This is, however, possible since polyE is a rabbit antibody and T9028 is a mouse antibody. I suspect that differences or gradients along the LSPMB would have been noticed. Also, in lines 207/208, it is said that tyrosination disappears after hepatocyte invasion, which is shown in Figure 3. However, in Figure 3A, quite a lot of positive signals for tyrosination are visible in the 54 and 56 hpi panels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First, we acknowledge that the IN105 antibody is more widely known as &quot;polyE&quot; in the field. We will update the Materials and Methods section accordingly to reflect this nomenclature.</p>
<p>Regarding the use of the T9028 antibody against tyrosinated α-tubulin: we agree that this monoclonal antibody is less commonly used than YL1/2, and we appreciate the reviewer drawing attention to this. The original antigen for T9028 is based on the mammalian C-terminal sequence EGEEY, which differs from the Plasmodium α1-tubulin sequence (YEADY). Like many in the field, we face the challenge that most available antibodies are raised against mammalian epitopes, and specificity in Plasmodium can vary. Nonetheless, the literature (e.g., Hirst et al., 2022; Fennell et al., 2008) has demonstrated that tyrosination occurs in Plasmodium α1-tubulin, using anti-tyrosination antibodies including YL1/2.</p>
<p>Following the reviewer’s excellent suggestion, we are currently repeating the key experiments using the YL1/2 antibody to compare staining patterns directly with those obtained using T9028. We will include these results in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Concerning the potential co-localization of polyglutamylation and tyrosination on the LSPMB: we agree that this is an interesting and testable hypothesis. In the current manuscript, Figures 3A and 3B were generated from independent experiments, and thus co-localization was not assessed. However, as the reviewer correctly notes, polyE and T9028 antibodies are raised in rabbit and mouse, respectively, making co-staining feasible. We will follow up on this experimentally and, if feasible within our revision timeline, include data in the revised version or highlight this as a future direction.</p>
<p>Finally, with regard to Figure 3 and the observation that tyrosination appears to persist at 54 and 56 hpi (Figure 3B): the reviewer is correct that tyrosination signal is still detectable at these time points. Our statement that tyrosination “disappears after hepatocyte invasion” was intended to refer to an overall decrease in signal intensity during early liver stage development, with a reappearance at later stages (e.g., cytomere formation). We will rephrase this section for greater clarity and ensure that figure annotations and legends unambiguously reflect the dynamics observed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In line 229, it is stated that tyrosination &quot;has previously been associated with stable microtubule in motility&quot;. This statement is not correct. In fact, none of the cited references that apparently support this statement show that this is the case. On the contrary, stable microtubules, such as flagellar axonemes, are almost completely detyrosinated. Therefore, tyrosination is a marker for dynamic microtubules, whereas detyrosinated microtubules are indicative of stable microtubules. This is an established fact, and it is odd that the authors claim the opposite.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree that in canonical eukaryotic systems, tyrosinated microtubules are generally markers of dynamic microtubule populations, whereas detyrosinated microtubules are typically associated with stability particularly in structures such as flagellar axonemes.</p>
<p>Our original statement will be corrected. In our study, we observed that tyrosinated microtubules are prevalent in invasive stages (sporozoites and merozoites), while detyrosinated forms become more prominent during intracellular liver stage development. This pattern is consistent with the established link between tyrosination and dynamic microtubules.</p>
<p>What is particularly intriguing in Plasmodium is the apparent cycling of tyrosination despite the absence of known tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) homologs in the genome. This suggests either a highly divergent enzyme or the involvement of host cell factors, a hypothesis supported by the reappearance of tyrosinated microtubules during liver stage schizogony (Figure 3B).</p>
<p>We will revise the relevant text and the Discussion section to reflect these mechanistic considerations more accurately and to avoid misrepresenting established principles of microtubule biology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Line 236 onwards: Concerning the generation of tubulin mutants, I think it is necessary to demonstrate successful replacement of the wild-type allele by the mutant allele. I am sure the authors have done this by amplification and subsequent sequencing of the genomic locus using PCR primers outside the plasmid sequences. I suggest including this information, e.g., by displaying the chromatograph trace in a supplementary figure. Or are the sequences displayed in Figure S3B already derived from sequenced genomic DNA? This is not described in the Legend or in Materials and Methods. The left PCR products obtained for Figure S3 B would be a suitable template for sequencing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, these data are presented in Figure 4B and the corresponding sequence data are shown in Figure S3B. We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion, which will help improve the transparency and reproducibility of our methodology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) It is also important to be aware of the fact that glutamylation also occurs on β-tubulin. This signal will also be detected by polyE (IN105). Therefore, it is surprising that IN105 immunofluorescence is negative on the C-term Δ cells (Figure S3 D). Is there anything known about confirmed polyglutamylation sites on both α- and β-tubulins in Plasmodium, e.g., by MS? In Toxoplasma, both α- and β-tubulin have been shown to be polyglutamylated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, polyglutamylation is known to occur not only on α-tubulin but also on β-tubulin in many organisms, including Toxoplasma gondii, and the polyE (IN105) antibody is expected to detect polyglutamylation on both tubulin isoforms.</p>
<p>The parasites shown in Figure S3D correspond to mutant lines originally generated by Spreng et al. (2019): the IntronΔ mutant (with deletion of introns in the Plasmodium α1-tubulin gene) and the C-termΔ mutant (with deletion of the final three C-terminal residues: ADY). As the reviewer correctly notes, this particular C-terminal deletion does not include the predicted polyglutamylation site (E445 or E447, depending on alignment), and thus should not abolish all polyglutamylation. However, in our experiments, the IN105 signal is substantially reduced in this mutant. This may suggest that structural alterations in the tubulin tail affect accessibility of the polyglutamylation epitope or influence the modification itself though we cannot exclude other possibilities, including changes in antibody recognition.</p>
<p>To date, polyglutamylation sites in Plasmodium tubulins have not been definitively confirmed by mass spectrometry. However, a recent MS-based study (reference 43) detected monoglutamylation on β-tubulin in blood stage parasites. Direct MS evidence for polyglutamylation of either α- or β-tubulin in Plasmodium liver stages is still lacking. We will clarify these points in the revised manuscript to avoid potential confusion and to highlight the need for future biochemical validation of PTM sites.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Figure S3 is very confusing. In the legend, certain intron deletions are mentioned. How does this relate to posttranslational tubulin modifications? The corresponding section in Results (lines 288-292) is also not very helpful in understanding this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The parasite lines shown in Figure S3D were originally generated by Spreng et al. (2019) and are not directly part of the main set of PTM-targeted mutants described in our study. Specifically, the IntronΔ line carries deletions in introns of the Plasmodium α1-tubulin gene, while the C-termΔ line lacks the final three C-terminal residues (ADY). These lines were included for comparative purposes to explore whether structural changes in α-tubulin could impact polyglutamylation signal, as detected by the polyE (IN105) antibody.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the figure legend and corresponding text (lines 288–292) did not adequately explain the rationale for including these control lines. We will revise both the legend and Results section to more clearly describe the origin, purpose, and relevance of these mutants to the overall study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) Figure 4E doesn't look like brightfield microscopy but like some sort of fluorescent imaging. In Figure 4C, were the control (NoΔ) cells with an integrated cassette, but no mutations, or non-transgenic cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is absolutely correct: Figure 4E shows a fluorescent image acquired using widefield microscopy and not a brightfield image. We will revise the figure legend accordingly to avoid confusion. The “BF” (brightfield) label applies only to the left panel in Figure 4C, which depicts oocysts imaged using transmitted light.</p>
<p>Regarding the controls labeled &quot;NoΔ&quot; in Figure 4C, we confirm that these parasites contain the integrated selection cassette but do not harbor any mutations in the target gene. They serve as proper integration controls, allowing us to distinguish the effects of the point mutations or deletions introduced in the experimental lines.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) It is difficult to understand why the TyΔ and the CtΔ mutants still show quite a strong signal using the anti-tyrosination antibody. If the mutants have replaced all wild-type alleles, the signal should be completely absent, unless the antibody (see my comment above concerning T9028) cross-reacts with detyrosinated microtubules. Therefore, the quantitation in Figures 5F and 5G is actually indicative of something that shouldn't be like that. The quantitation of 5F is at odds with the microscopy image in 5D. If this image is representative, the anti-Ty staining in TyΔ is as strong as in the control NoΔ.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the persistence of anti-tyrosination signal in the TyΔ and CtΔ mutant lines is unexpected, given that all wild-type alleles were replaced. This discrepancy has led us to further investigate the specificity of the T9028 antibody, as raised in the reviewer’s earlier comment. To address this concern, we are currently repeating the key experiments using the well-established YL1/2 monoclonal antibody, which is widely accepted for detecting tyrosinated α-tubulin in other systems.</p>
<p>We also acknowledge that Figure 5F shows residual tyrosination signal, and the reviewer is correct that this should not occur if the modified residues are the exclusive PTM sites. One possible explanation is that adjacent residues or even alternative tubulin isoforms may serve as substrates. While α1-tubulin is the dominant isoform in Plasmodium, low-level expression of α2-tubulin has been detected in liver stages based on transcriptomic data, and it may contribute to the observed signal.</p>
<p>Regarding the apparent discrepancy between the quantification in Figure 5F and the representative image in Figure 5D, we will revise the figure legend to clarify that image selection aimed to show detectable signal, not necessarily the average phenotype. We will also reassess and, if needed, repeat the quantification with improved image sets to ensure accuracy and consistency.</p>
<p>We will revise the manuscript to reflect these points and include a more nuanced interpretation of the residual staining in the mutant lines.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(14) The statement that the failure of CtΔ mutants to generate viable sporozoites is due to the lack of microtubule PTMs (lines 295-296) is speculative. The lack of the entire C-terminal tail could have a number of consequences, such as impaired microtubule assembly or failure to recruit and bind associated proteins. This is not necessarily linked to PTMs. Also, it has been shown in yeast that for microtubules to form properly and exquisite regulation (proteostasis) of the ratio between α- and β-tubulin is essential (Wethekam and Moore, 2023). I am not sure, but according to Materials and Methods (line 423), the gene cassettes for replacing the wild-type tubulin gene with the mutant versions contain a selectable marker gene for pyrimethamine selection. Are there qPCR data that show that expression levels of mutant α-tubulin are more or less the same as the wild-type levels?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that attributing the developmental failure of the CtΔ mutants solely to the absence of microtubule post-translational modifications (PTMs) is speculative. As the reviewer rightly points out, deletion of the entire C-terminal tail may have multiple effects, including impaired microtubule assembly, altered α/β-tubulin stoichiometry, or disruption of interactions with essential microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). These consequences may arise independently of PTMs.</p>
<p>That said, we note that PTMs particularly polyglutamylation, can modulate MAP binding by altering the surface charge of microtubules (Genova et al., 2023; Mitchell et al., 2010). Therefore, while PTM loss may be a contributing factor, we acknowledge that the phenotype likely results from a combination of mechanisms. We will revise the relevant section of the manuscript to present a more cautious and balanced interpretation.</p>
<p>Regarding the reviewer’s question on expression levels: although the replacement constructs include a pyrimethamine resistance cassette, we have not yet quantified α-tubulin transcript levels by qPCR. In the interim, the study by Spreng et al. (2019) (reference 50) on a related α1-tubulin nutations provides valuable insight. They observed no difference in mRNA levels in day 12 oocysts, yet reported fainter microtubule staining and shorter sporozoites, suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism affecting protein expression or function in later stages. Furthermore, the phenotypic spectrum across their mutant panel (Suppl. Fig. 3 D and E) implies that robust α-tubulin regulation is highly sensitive to specific sequences.</p>
<p>We acknowledge this as a current limitation in our study and will address it in the revised manuscript, noting that direct measurement of transcript levels is a key area for future investigation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(15) In the Discussion, my impression is that two recent studies, the superb Expansion Microscopy study by Bertiaux et al. (2021) and the cryo-EM study by Ferreira et al. (2023), are not sufficiently recognised (although they are cited elsewhere in the manuscript). The latter study includes a detailed description of the microtubule cytoskeleton in sporozoites. However, the present study clearly expands the knowledge about the structure of the cytoskeleton in liver stage parasites and is one of the few studies addressing the distribution and function of microtubule post-translational modifications in Plasmodium.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, our work builds upon the established knowledge from Bertiaux et al. (2021) and the cryo-EM study by Ferreira et al. (2023), as rightly mentioned by the reviewer. We agree that these foundational studies, combined with our findings, will significantly expand the understanding of Plasmodium biology and cytoskeleton dynamics across its life cycle and will open the door for further investigations. We are grateful for this suggestion and will ensure these key studies are appropriately acknowledged in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(16) I somewhat disagree with the statement of a co-occurrence of polyglutamylated and tyrosinated microtubules. I think the resolution is too low to reach that conclusion. As this is a bold claim, and would be contrary to what is known from other organisms, it would require a more rigorous validation. Given the apparent problems with the anti-Ty antibody (signal in the TyΔ mutant), one should be very cautious with this claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very important point to clarify. As mentioned previously, the initial experiments for these modifications were performed independently. It is established that sporozoite subpellicular microtubules exhibit both tyrosination and polyglutamylation. We will revise the manuscript to temper this statement and clearly indicate that the co-occurrence of these PTMs remains a hypothesis that requires more rigorous validation. As suggested, we are now conducting additional co-staining experiments using the better validated YL1/2 antibody to re-express and directly compare the distribution of both PTMs within the same cell. These follow-up experiments will help clarify whether both modifications occur simultaneously on the same microtubule structures in Plasmodium liver stages.</p>

<p>(17) In the Discussion (lines 311 and 377), it is again claimed that tyrosinated microtubules are &quot;a well-known marker of stable microtubules&quot;. This statement is completely incorrect, and I am surprised by this serious mistake. A few lines later, the authors say that polyglutamylated is &quot;commonly associated with dynamic microtubule behaviour&quot;. Again, this is completely incorrect and is the opposite of what is firmly established in the literature. Polyglutamylation and detyrosination are markers of stable microtubules.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, in canonical eukaryotic systems, tyrosinated microtubules are generally considered markers of dynamic microtubule populations, whereas detyrosinated and polyglutamylated microtubules are more commonly associated with stability.</p>
<p>We acknowledge this mistake and will revise the Discussion to correct these statements accordingly. In the context of Plasmodium, our observations suggest an unusual regulation of microtubule dynamics, which may reflect parasite-specific adaptations. For example, we observed tyrosinated α-tubulin in the stable subpellicular microtubules of sporozoites structures typically known for their exceptional stability. This atypical association implies either non-canonical roles for tyrosination or parasite-specific mechanisms for modulating microtubule properties. Additionally, the presence of both PTMs at different stages of development and on different microtubule populations suggests tightly regulated spatial and temporal modulation of microtubule function.</p>
<p>We will carefully revise the relevant sections of the manuscript to remove incorrect generalizations and ensure accurate representation of the current consensus in the field, while emphasizing the possibility of Plasmodium-specific adaptations that merit further study.</p>

<p>(18) In line 339, the authors interpret the residual antibody staining after the introduction of the mutant tubulin as a compensatory mechanism. There is no evidence for this. More likely explanations are firstly the quality of the anti-Ty-antibody used (see comment above), and the fact that also β-tubulin carries C-terminal polyglutamylation sites, which haven't been investigated in this study. PTMs on β-tubulin are not compensatory, but normal PTMs, at least in all other organisms where microtubule PTMs have been investigated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, we are currently repeating the key experiments with the [YL1/2] antibody, as suggested. Furthermore, we fully agree with the reviewer's point regarding polyglutamylation on β-tubulin. The C-terminal tail of β-tubulin does indeed contain polyglutamylation sites. As we noted in the manuscript (Lines 340-352), this aspect has not been investigated in the present study, and we acknowledge it as a valuable direction for future research. We will revise the text accordingly to avoid overinterpretation and to more accurately reflect the limitations of our current data.</p>
