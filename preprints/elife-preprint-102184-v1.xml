<title>Abstract</title><p>Striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCIN) exhibit pause responses conveying information about rewarding events, but the mechanisms underlying them remain elusive. Thalamic inputs induce a pause mediated by intrinsic mechanisms and regulated by dopamine D2 receptors, though the underlying membrane currents are unknown. Moreover, the role of D5 receptors (D5R) has not been addressed so far. We show that glutamate released by thalamic inputs in the dorsolateral striatum induces a burst in SCIN, followed by the activation of a Kv1-dependent delayed rectifier current responsible for the pause. Endogenous dopamine promotes the pause through D2R stimulation, while pharmacological stimulation of D5R suppresses it. Remarkably, the pause response is absent in parkinsonian mice rendered dyskinetic by chronic L-DOPA treatment but can be reinstated acutely by the inverse D5R agonist clozapine. Blocking the Kv1 current eliminates the pause reinstated by the D5R inverse agonist. In conclusion, the pause response is mediated by delayed rectifier Kv1 channels, which are tonically blocked in dyskinetic mice by a mechanism depending on D5R ligand-independent activity. Targeting these alterations may have therapeutic value in Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dopamine (DA), released by neurons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), and acetylcholine (ACh), mainly released by striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCIN), are the main modulators of cortico-striatal circuits. Both types of neurons are tonically active, and their activity is altered by unexpected rewards or by the sensory cues that predict those rewards. These events evoke a burst in dopaminergic neurons coincident with a pause response in SCIN. The resulting increase in DA and decrease in ACh are critical for striatal-dependent learning and decision-making through modulatory effects on striatal “medium spiny” projection neurons (MSNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cragg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Reynolds et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> recordings show that the phasic response of striatal tonically active neurons (TANs, putative SCIN) to salient events typically involves a brief burst of action potentials followed by a short pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kimura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aosaki et al., 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Apicella, 2007</xref>). The precise mechanisms underlying this response remain elusive. Evidence suggests the involvement of both dopaminergic and thalamic inputs in the generation of the pause. Neurons of the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, which send excitatory projections to the striatum, also respond to reward and salient stimuli, and the TANs pause is absent when the thalamus is locally inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Matsumoto et al., 2001</xref>). Dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) antagonists or genetic elimination of D2R from cholinergic neurons have been shown to reduce the duration of the pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Watanabe and Kimura, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kharkwal et al., 2016</xref>), implicating a direct contribution of D2R-mediated inhibition of SCIN. Additionally, e<italic>x vivo</italic> studies reveal heterogeneous responses of SCIN to stimulation of dopaminergic axons, with a more pronounced dopaminergic influence on the pause response in the dorsal versus the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>). Further evidence suggests that the pause in SCIN arises from intrinsic mechanisms activated by depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Reynolds et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wilson and Goldberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Sanchez et al., 2011</xref>). Experiments conducted in brain slices demonstrate that the pause that follows stimulation of SCIN excitatory inputs persists even after blocking GABA-A receptors, indicating the involvement of voltage (Kv) or calcium-dependent (KCa) potassium currents, with dopamine likely modulating these currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Schulz and Reynolds, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McGuirt et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of dopamine is underscored by the absence of pause in animals with chronic nigrostriatal lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aosaki et al., 1994a</xref>). While reduced D2R stimulation may explain this, genetic elimination of D2R from cholinergic neurons reduces but does not eliminate the pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kharkwal et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that additional factors are involved. SCIN also express dopamine D5 receptors (D5R), which have been recently linked to SCIN functional changes in parkinsonian animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Paz et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>However, their role in regulating phasic SCIN responses remains unaddressed, and whether alterations in D5R signaling contribute to the absence of pause in dopamine-depleted animals remains unclear.</p>
<p>Here, we report <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies showing that specific activation of intralaminar thalamostriatal inputs triggers a burst followed by a pause in SCIN. This pause requires the activation of an intrinsic delayed-rectifier current mediated by Kv1 channels, and is modulated by D2R and D5R. Furthermore, we found that the pause response is absent in parkinsonian mice with chronic L-DOPA treatment, but can be acutely reinstated by the inverse D5R agonist clozapine. Finally, the pause response reinstated by clozapine is abolished by blocking the Kv1 current, indicating that inhibition of constitutive D5R signaling releases this current from a tonic restraining effect, aligning with our prior findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Paz et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>The timing of thalamic input interacts with SCIN intrinsic mechanisms to determine the duration of the pause response</title>
<p>To induce a pause in SCIN in response to thalamic activation, we injected an AAV2-CamKII-ChR2-YFP viral vector into the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus in adult ChAT-Cre;tdTomato mice. We used these mice to facilitate the localization of SCIN in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>). Four weeks later, we sacrificed the animals and made coronal slices of the striatum for <italic>ex vivo</italic> patch clamp recordings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Histological analysis confirmed the site of AAV injection and the labeling of thalamostriatal projections (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We recorded SCIN in the cell-attached configuration and stimulated thalamic axons with 2 ms-long pulses of blue light at 20 Hz and 10 mW (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). All the experiments were performed in the presence of picrotoxin (PIC, 100 μM) in the bath. When the stimulation elicited a minimal response (1 spike), the latency of the evoked spike decreased with the time separating the stimulus from the preceding spontaneous spike (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>). Thus, a stimulus arriving after an average baseline interspike interval (ISI) has elapsed produces a shorter latency response than when the stimulus arrives shortly after the preceding spontaneous spike (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), as expected given the strong after-hyperpolarization (AHP) that follows SCIN spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Reynolds et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wilson and Goldberg, 2006</xref>). By increasing the number of pulses in the stimulation train, we obtained responses of 2 to 4 spikes (“bursts”) followed by an interruption of SCIN firing, which were abolished by application of an AMPA receptor antagonist in the bath (firing rate during stimulus/baseline firing rate: PIC=3.611; PIC+CNQX=1.343; paired t test *p=0.0409; n=5 cells from 5 animals) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Different train durations were required to evoke a given burst response across SCIN, probably relating to variability in the density of ChR2-expressing afferent fibers across experiments. To minimize the effect of this source of variability, we studied the pause duration as a function of the number of spikes in the burst evoked by thalamic stimulation. The duration of the pause response increased with the number of spikes in the burst (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), without changes in baseline ISI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), as expected if the pause depended on the recruitment of a depolarization-activated hyperpolarizing current. A pioneering <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed that the thalamic neurons presumptively driving the phasic response of SCIN show a burst followed by a pause that ends with a rebound of activity, in connection with reward-related events. This thalamic burst-pause response temporally coincides with the burst-pause response of the presumptive SCIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Matsumoto et al., 2001</xref>). This suggests that a decrease of excitatory afferent activity may be necessary for the expression of the SCIN pause. To evaluate the effect of a second volley of excitatory inputs on the SCIN pause duration, we delivered a second thalamic stimulus train 350 ms after the end of the first stimulus. We found that the second stimulus train could terminate the pause, although its effect is delayed as more spikes are recruited in the burst by the first stimulus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I-J</xref>). This is consistent with a graded recruitment of an intrinsic current that reduces the excitability of SCIN, delaying their response to the second stimulus.</p>

<title>The pause response to thalamic stimulation requires activation of Kv1 channels</title>
<p>In previous work we found that Kv delayed rectifier channels conformed by Kv1.3 and Kv1.1 subunits contribute to the sAHP current in SCIN of adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, a train of EPSPs evoked by thalamic afferents stimulation is followed by an AHP, which persists in the presence of the GABA-A receptor antagonist picrotoxin and is blocked by the Kv1.3 channel blocker margatoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>). We asked whether this Kv1 current is recruited during the SCIN pause response. Both margatoxin (MgTx) at 30 nM – but not at 3 nM – and dendrotoxin (DTx, 100 nM, a Kv1.1 and Kv1.6 channel blocker) abolished the pause response without changing the spontaneous firing rate or the burst duration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-E</xref>). SCIN have a high reserve of Kv7 channels that limit EPSP summation but do not seem to contribute to the sAHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Paz et al., 2018</xref>) or pause response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McGuirt et al., 2022</xref>) in adult mice. Consistent with these findings, the pause induced by thalamic stimulation was not reduced by the Kv7 channel blocker XE-991 (10 uM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-I</xref>). Moreover, SCIN hyperpolarizations can be amplified by the recruitment of inwardly rectifying Kir2 channels, presumptively of the Kir2.2 subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Paz et al., 2021</xref>), which could then contribute to the pause response (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). However, a low concentration of barium that preferentially blocks Kir2.2 channels (10 uM) had no effect on firing frequency, burst duration, or pause response of SCIN to thalamic stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-I</xref>).</p>

<title>Activation of D5R reduces the pause generated in response to thalamic stimulation</title>
<p>Previous <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies have shown that dopamine promotes the pause response through D2R-mediated actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aosaki et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Watanabe and Kimura, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ding et al., 2010</xref>), including inhibitory effects on Ih, which could be activated by the pause and contribute to its end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McGuirt et al., 2022</xref>). The pause shortens when D2R endogenous activation is blocked with D2-type receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aosaki et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Watanabe and Kimura, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ding et al., 2010</xref>) or D2R are genetically eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kharkwal et al., 2016</xref>), and lengthens when D2R are overexpressed in SCIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gallo et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to D2R, SCIN express D5R that increase SCIN excitability by reducing the Kv1-mediated delayed rectifier current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Paz et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2022</xref>), shown above to be involved in the pause response. To assess whether D5R modulates the pause response induced by thalamic stimulation, we tested the effect of the D1/D5 receptor selective agonist SKF81297 in our <italic>ex vivo</italic> preparation. SKF81297 suppressed the pause without changing SCIN spontaneous firing rate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-E</xref>). The effect of SKF81297 was prevented by co-application of the selective D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH23390, which had no effects by itself, ruling out tonic effects of DA through D5R (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-E</xref>). Furthermore, we found a small effect of the selective D2R antagonist sulpiride, limited to the pauses that followed 4-spike bursts, supporting a modulatory role of D2R (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-I</xref>). Previous studies suggested that synchronized SCIN bursts induce dopamine release through local effects mediated by nicotinic receptors located in dopaminergic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine also reduced the pause that followed 4-spike bursts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-I</xref>). Presumably, endogenous levels of dopamine in the slice, produced by tonic release mechanisms or phasic cholinergic activation of dopaminergic terminals, are sufficient to stimulate D2R but not D5R.</p>

<title>Reduction of Ih current does not block the pause generated in response to thalamic activation</title>
<p>To evaluate if D5R stimulation reduces the pause response through effects on Ih current, we assessed if SKF81297 effect persisted in the presence of the HCN channel blocker ZD7288 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

<title>SCIN from L-DOPA-treated parkinsonian mice show reduced pause responses to thalamic activation</title>
<p>Previous <italic>in vivo</italic> work has shown that the pause response in SCIN is absent in an animal model of Parkinson’s disease and is partially restored by acute administration of the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aosaki et al., 1994a</xref>). Chronic administration of L-DOPA to parkinsonian animals produces lasting changes in SCIN membrane excitability involving Kv1, Kir2, and likely, other currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">McKinley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Paz et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2022</xref>). Yet, whether chronic L-DOPA modifies the SCIN pause response has not been addressed before. We studied the pause response induced by thalamic afferents stimulation in SCIN from parkinsonian mice treated for 14 consecutive days with L-DOPA (12 mg/kg) or vehicle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Mice unilaterally lesioned with 6-OHDA showed extensive loss of TH-positive neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), accompanied by marked parkinsonian-like motor impairment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-E</xref>). Moreover, these mice developed dyskinesia in response to L-DOPA administration, characterized by an abnormal involuntary movements score (AIM) that worsens after day 4 of treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). In previous studies, we have shown that the Kv1 current diminishes after lesioning nigral dopaminergic neurons and further suppressed when recorded 24 hours after the end of a chronic L-DOPA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Paz et al., 2022</xref>). Cell-attached recordings performed 24 hours after the last L-DOPA challenge (OFF L-DOPA condition) showed that the pause is absent in SCIN from dyskinetic mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G-H</xref>), regardless of the burst duration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Paz et al., 2021</xref>), the spontaneous firing rate was higher in SCIN recorded from mice in the OFF L-DOPA condition compared with sham mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). In addition, inclusion of MgTx in the bath did not have any effect on pause duration, baseline firing rate and burst duration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G-J</xref>), as expected following previous findings showing a lack of effect of MgTx on membrane excitability in the same animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Paz et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Reducing D5R ligand-independent activity restores the SCIN pause response</title>
<p>In a previous study, we found that the physiological changes observed in SCIN of dyskinetic mice depend on an increase of ligand-independent activity of D5R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Paz et al., 2022</xref>). SCIN recorded in the parkinsonian OFF-L-DOPA condition show an increase of membrane excitability that mimics changes acutely induced by SKF81297 in SCIN from control mice. This hyperexcitable phenotype reverts by acute administration of drugs that reduce D5R ligand-independent activity (i.e., inverse agonists, like clozapine or flupentixol), and by acutely reducing intracellular cAMP signaling. Interestingly, the hyperexcitability of SCIN recorded in the OFF L-DOPA condition is not further enhanced by SKF81297 or MgTx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Paz et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting D5R-cAMP-Kv1 inhibitory signaling is already working at full steam in these cells. Therefore, we speculated that, if suppression of the Kv1 current in parkinsonian mice causes the lack of pause response, D1/D5 inverse agonists should reinstate the pause. The atypical antipsychotic clozapine behaves as an antagonist of D1/D5 and other dopamine receptors when an agonist is present, but has inverse agonist effects on D5R in the absence of an agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, clozapine restores the pause in SCIN from dyskinetic mice without changing the firing rate and regardless of the burst duration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-E</xref>). As clozapine is not selective for D5R, we bathed the slices with the D1/D5 selective antagonist SCH23390, and with clozapine + SCH23390, to assess the involvement of D1/D5 dopamine receptors. We found that SCH23390 had no effect per se in the SCIN response to thalamic stimulation but prevented the restoration of the pause response by clozapine (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-E</xref>). Moreover, to confirm that the pause restored by clozapine involves Kv1 channels, as is the case for naïve animals, we added clozapine and MgTx to the bath (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). MgTx occluded the pause-restoring effect of clozapine (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-E</xref>), indicating that the reduction of ligand-independent activity of D5R reinstates the Kv1 current in SCIN from OFF L-DOPA parkinsonian mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While previous studies support the role of intrinsic membrane currents in the pause response of SCIN, the specific currents involved remain debated. Theories implicating deactivation of Ih current as its primary cause were refuted by experiments demonstrating pause induction after Ih current blockade when the resulting hyperpolarization is corrected by current injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; present findings). Although Ih likely contributes to a rebound depolarization limiting pause duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McGuirt et al., 2022</xref>). Further work suggested the involvement of a slow current mediated by Kv7 channels in juvenile mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), which is developmentally downregulated and seems to not contribute significantly in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McGuirt et al., 2022</xref>; present findings), though SCIN retain a high reserve of Kv7 channels sensitive to activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Paz et al., 2018</xref>). Whether this Kv7 channel reserve is recruited under particular conditions not captured in our slice preparation remains to be determined. Previously, we found that Kv1 channels expressed by SCIN markedly modulate their excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>). Heteromeric channels constituted by Kv1.3 and Kv1.1 subunits can be blocked by the binding of a single MgTx molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hopkins, 1998</xref>). In SCIN, MgTx enhances subthreshold EPSP summation and blocks the ensuing AHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>). The present study extends these findings by showing that specific blockers of channels constituted by Kv1.3 and Kv1.1 subunits suppress the pause that follows action potential bursts induced by thalamostriatal afferents in adult mice. Although SCIN express inwardly rectifying Kir2 channels capable of amplifying hyperpolarizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Paz et al., 2021</xref>), these channels do not contribute to the pause, likely because of insufficient membrane hyperpolarization to recruit Kir currents. Finally, <italic>in vivo</italic>, SCIN spontaneous firing rate synchronizes with excitatory synaptic input fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Krok et al., 2023</xref>). The SCIN phasic response could reflect burst-pause discharge synchronization with thalamic afferents, known to exhibit a burst-pause-rebound pattern in response to reward stimuli <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Matsumoto et al., 2001</xref>). The effect of thalamic rebound activity on pause duration has not been examined before in brain slices. We observed that a second round of stimulation of thalamic afferents reduces the duration of the pause, although its impact is delayed by additional spikes in the initial SCIN burst, likely due to recruitment of a more robust Kv1 current.</p>
<p>Recent <italic>in vivo</italic> studies showed anticorrelated changes of DA and ACh striatal levels, not only during rewarded tasks but also during spontaneous behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chantranupong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Krok et al., 2023</xref>). Several studies support that dopamine positively modulates the pause response of SCIN through D2R-mediated effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Watanabe and Kimura, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kharkwal et al., 2016</xref>) and constitutive ablation of D2R from cholinergic neurons disrupts the anticorrelated DA-ACh signal during specific portions of an operant task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chantranupong et al., 2023</xref>). However, striatal ACh transients persist and even increase after blockade of striatal DA receptors or lesion of nigrostriatal neurons, while they are reduced after intrastriatal infusion of glutamate receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Krok et al., 2023</xref>). Although these findings suggest that slow variations of striatal glutamate, rather than DA, control ACh release from SCIN at the space and time scales resolved by fiber photometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Krok et al., 2023</xref>), they do not rule out a fine dopaminergic regulation of phasic SCIN responses to glutamatergic inputs, which could be embedded within broader modulations of DA and ACh levels. Our <italic>ex vivo</italic> data support that endogenous activation of D2R modulates the pause induced by thalamic afferents in SCIN. Moreover, we found that ambient DA in the slice does not modulate SCIN activity through D5R, but pharmacological stimulation of D1/D5 receptors markedly inhibited the pause response, likely through inhibitory effects of D5R on Kv1 channels. Overall, our data show that, in physiological conditions, Kv1 channels are necessary for the expression of the pause response in SCIN of adult mice, and that the pause can be modulated by D5R in addition to D2R. This D5R modulation may be relevant under conditions of phasic dopamine release producing synaptic concentrations of DA capable of activating the low affinity D5R (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>Learning deficits are believed to play a role in the development of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. A recent study demonstrates that practice worsens the performance of previously learned motor skills in parkinsonian mice, while practice combined with therapeutic doses of L-DOPA prevents skill deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cheung et al., 2023</xref>). While this learning deficit may be due to the loss of dopamine, a possible contribution of SCIN dysfunction cannot be dismissed given that, in parkinsonian monkeys, the pause response of presumptive SCIN is lost and can be partially restored with apomorphine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aosaki et al., 1994a</xref>). Our <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies provide a possible explanation for this pause response loss. We reported that the Kv1 current is diminished in parkinsonian mice and further suppressed 24 hours after the termination of a dyskinetogenic L-DOPA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Paz et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with a key role of this current in pause generation, we find that the pause that follows a burst of spikes induced by stimulation of thalamostriatal afferents is markedly diminished in this animal model. Importantly, we previously reported that suppression of the Kv1 current in dyskinetic mice is caused by tonic effects of cAMP signaling, likely due to enhanced ligand-independent activity of D5R, as inverse agonists on D5R acutely restore the Kv1 current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Paz et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we find that clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic that antagonizes DA actions on D1-type and D2-type DA receptors, but behaves as an inverse agonist of D5R in the absence of an agonist (and DA levels should be very low in slices of 6-OHDA lesioned mice), reinstates the pause response of SCIN in dyskinetic mice. Remarkably, while the Kv1.3 blocker MgTx has no effect on SCIN in dyskinetic mice, as expected given the loss of Kv1 currents in this animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Paz et al., 2022</xref>), the pause reinstated by clozapine is suppressed by MgTx. This is consistent with previous findings showing that D5R inverse agonists reinstate the Kv1 current in dyskinetic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Paz et al., 2022</xref>), and supports the key role of the Kv1 current in the pause response and in the dysfunction observed in SCIN after DA neuron lesion and L-DOPA treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Kv1 channels are essential for the pause response of SCIN and its modulation by D5R in dopamine-intact animals. We also find that D5R dysregulation of Kv1 channels may contribute to the loss of this pause response in parkinsonian animals chronically treated with L-DOPA. Previously, we showed that D5R inverse agonists normalize the spontaneous firing pattern and membrane excitability of SCIN by restoring different membrane currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Paz et al., 2022</xref>). The current findings reveal that D5R inverse agonists also restore the SCIN phasic responses to thalamic inputs, highlighting D5R ligand-independent activity as a key factor in SCIN dysregulation in the OFF L-DOPA condition.</p>

The neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine-HBr (6-OHDA; Sigma Aldrich AB) was dissolved in 0.1% ascorbate-saline at the concentration 4 µg/µl (freebase). The skull was exposed, and a small hole was drilled at the desired injection site. The following stereotaxic coordinates were used to target the left medial forebrain bundle (MFB): 1 mm posterior (from Bregma), 1.1 mm lateral and 4.8 mm ventral from dura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>). 1 µl was injected in adult mice (P90-110) at a rate of 0.5 µl/min using a 300 µm diameter cannula attached to a 25 µl Hamilton syringe controlled by a motorized pump (Bioanalytical Systems, USA). The injection cannula was left in place for six additional minutes before slowly retracting it. Littermates of lesioned mice received an injection of 0.1% ascorbate-saline in the MFB (sham group). After surgery, each mouse was daily weighted and received a subcutaneous injection of saline and an enriched diet. These cares continued until animals began to regain weight (7 to 20 days after surgery). To assess behavioral signs of parkinsonism, animals were subjected to extensive behavioral testing three weeks after 6-OHDA injection in three non-consecutive days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), during the light phase, by an investigator blind to treatment, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Escande et al., 2016</xref>.

In the &quot;cylinder test&quot;, each mouse is placed in a transparent acrylic cylinder (10 cm diameter and 14 cm high) and videotaped for five minutes. A limb use asymmetry score is computed by expressing the number of wall contacts performed with the forepaw contralateral to the lesion relative to the total number of wall contacts performed with the forepaws. Finally, motor coordination is assessed in an accelerating rotarod (from 4 to 40 rpm in five minutes; Ugo Basile, Italy).

L-DOPA and benserazide were diluted in 0.9% saline solution. Abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were rated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Keifman et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, AIMs rating started after 20 minutes of L-DOPA injection and mice were rated for 1 minute every 20 minutes during 2 hours. Each subtype of dyskinesia (oral, axial and forelimb) was scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 4 (where 0 = no dyskinesia; 1 = occasional dyskinesia displayed for &lt;50% of the observation time; 2 = sustained dyskinesia displayed for &gt;50% of the observation time; 3 = continuous dyskinesia; 4 = continuous dyskinesia not interruptible by external stimuli).</p>

<title>ChR2-EYFP adeno-associated vector injection</title>
<p>Anesthesia and surgical procedures were as indicated for the nigrostriatal lesions. A CaMKII-driven ChR2-EYFP expressing adeno-associated virus (rAAV2/CaMKII-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP-WPRE-PA) was injected in the thalamus at the following coordinates: -1.3 mm posterior from Bregma, 0.8 mm lateral and -3 mm ventral from dura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>). 0.5 μl of viral vector was delivered using a glass micropipette (World Precision Instruments) pulled with a vertical glass puller (Narishige). Experiments were performed after at least 28 postoperative days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>).</p>

<title>Patch Clamp Recordings</title>
<p>Twenty-four hours after the last L-DOPA shot, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated for brain slicing. The brain was quickly removed, chilled in ice-cold low-Ca<sup>2+</sup>/high-Mg<sup>2+</sup>ACSF, and prepared for slicing. Coronal slices (300 μm) at the level of the striatum were cut with a vibratome (Pelco T series 1000, Ted Pella) and were incubated in low-Ca2+/high-Mg2+ artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) at 34°C for 30 minutes and then at room temperature. ACSF composition was as follows (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.3NaH2PO4·H2O, 26 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 glucose. For the low-Ca<sup>2+</sup>/high-Mg<sup>2+</sup> ACSF, 0.5 mM CaCl2 and 2.5 mM MgCl2 were used. Slices were transferred to a submersion-type chamber perfused by a peristaltic pump (Ismatec, Germany) with ACSF at a constant rate of 3ml/min; temperature in the recording chamber was set at 32°C with a TC-344B temperature controller (Warner Instruments). Cells were visualized using an upright microscope (Nikon Eclipse) equipped with a 40X water-immersion objective, DIC and fluorescence optics, and an infrared camera connected to a monitor and computer. Recording electrodes were made with borosilicate glass capillaries shaped with a puller (P-97, Sutter Instruments). Dorsolateral SCINs were recorded in cell-attached configuration with patch pipettes filled with intracellular solution (in mM): 20 KCl, 120 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 3 Na2ATP, 0.3 NaGTP, 0.1 EGTA, 10 phosphocreatine and 2 MgCl2, pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH. Recordings were amplified (Axopatch-1D; Molecular Devices), sampled at 20 kHz (Digidata 1322A, Molecular Devices) and acquired on a PC running pClamp 9.2 (Molecular Devices). In all the experiments, picrotoxin (100µM) was always present in the ACSF to block GABAergic transmission. Optogenetic stimulation was generated with a 447-nm light-emitting diode (Tolket, Argentina) and delivered through an optic fiber placed &lt;300 um from the recorded cell. One to 20, 2-ms long pulses, at 20 Hz and 10 mW, were delivered 5 s after the initiation of the sweep, for 10 consecutive sweeps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). For experiments with a second pulse train, the second train was delivered 350 ms after the end of the first train. The second train contained 1-3 pulses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>).</p>

<title>Pharmacological manipulations</title>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, reagents were purchased from Sigma (Argentina). Salts were purchased from Baker (Research AG, Argentina). Drugs were prepared as stock solutions, diluted in ACSF immediately before use, and applied through the perfusion system. The following stock solvents and final concentrations were used: distilled H2O for BaCl (10µM), ZD7288 (30µM) and mecamylamine (10 µM, RBI); DMSO for CNQX (40µM, Tocris), picrotoxin (100µM), SKF81297 (2µM), SCH23390 (10µM), Sulpiride (10µM, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), XE991 (10µM) and clozapine (10µM, Rospaw Laboratory); and the manufacturer’s recommended storage buffer (0.1% BSA, 100mM NaCl, 10mM Tris pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA) for margatoxin (MgTx 3nM and 30nM, Alomone Labs) and g-Dendrotoxin (100nM, Alomone labs).</p>

<title>Acquisition and analysis of electrophysiological data</title>
<p>Data acquisition and analysis were performed with ClampFit (Molecular Devices, RRID: SCR_011323). GraphPad Prism version 8.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, RRID:SCR_002798) and custom-made MATLAB (Mathworks, RRID: SCR_001622) routines were used for data analysis.</p>
<p>For each cell, 3 to 5 recordings were made, varying the number of light pulses delivered during the stimulation train. Each recording consisted of 10 sweeps with the same stimulus. Then, the recordings were analyzed by merging all the sweeps where the stimulation elicited the same number of spikes, regardless of the stimulation protocol. Only sweeps that triggered 1 to 4 spikes in response to the light were included in the analysis. The number of spikes in the burst was determined by the number of spikes fired during the length of the stimulus plus 250 ms after the end of the stimulus. The pause was calculated as the time from the last spike of the burst triggered by the thalamostriatal input activation, and the following spike. The average baseline inter-spike-interval (ISI) was calculated taking into account all ISI collected during the five seconds preceding each stimulus. The burst duration was calculated as the time from the first to the last spike in the burst. To determine the influence of spontaneous spikes on evoked spiking, we plotted the time from the stimulus onset to the first spike in the burst (x2, for stimulations that evoked one spike) as a function of the time from the spike preceding the stimulus to the stimulus onset (x1). Each value was normalized to the average baseline ISI.</p>
<p>Each cell was recorded with only one pharmacological treatment. Most animals contributed with at least two neurons that received different drug treatments. For each experiment, control neurons were obtained from the same animals that contributed treated cells, plus a subset of cells from animals in which no cells were treated.</p>

<title>Perfusion</title>
<p>For confirmation of thalamostriatal projections to the striatum, ChAT-Cre;tdT mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.), perfused through the ascending aorta with saline solution supplemented with heparin (2 U/ml, Rivero, Argentina) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline 0.1 M, pH 7.4 (PBS). Brains were removed, post-fixed for 24 hr in the same fixative, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS and cut. Sections containing the striatum and the thalamus were preserved in PBS with 0.1% sodium azide.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>To confirm nigral dopaminergic lesions and the site of the AAV injection into the thalamus in mice used for acute slicing, tissue blocks containing thalamus and substantia nigra obtained after striatal slicing were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS and cut at 30 µm with a sliding-freezing microtome (Leica). Sections containing the substantia nigra pars compacta were preserved in PBS with 0.1% sodium azide. For TH-immunoreactivity, sections were blocked for 2 hours at room temperature (PBS containing 5% NGS and 0.3% Triton X-100), incubated overnight with primary antibodies (mouse anti-TH, Chemicon, 1:1000, RRID: AB_2201528) at 4°C, washed 3 times in 0.15% Triton X-100/PBS (PBS-T) and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor488 (Goat anti-mouse IgG, Invitrogen, 1:500, RRID: AB_138404) for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were then washed 3 times in PBS-T and one time in PBS, mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector) and coverslipped. For confirmation of the site of AAV injection, sections containing the thalamus were washed in PBS, mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector) and coverslipped.</p>

<p>The manuscript reports a <bold>valuable</bold> finding on dopamine receptor-mediated regulation, the firing of striatal cholinergic interneurons in both healthy and dyskinesia states, identifying that Kv1 channels play a key role in the burst-dependent pause. The study presents <bold>solid</bold> experimental data, and provides additional mechanistic insights into how burst activity in SCINs leads to a subsequent pause, highlighting the involvement of D1/D5 receptors. This work will be of interest to researchers studying the pathological mechanisms of Parkinson's disease.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Tubert et al presents the role of the D5 receptor in modulating the striatal cholinergic interneuron (CIN) pause response through D5R-cAMP-Kv1 inhibitory signaling. Their model elucidates the on / off switch of CIN pause, likely due to the different DA affinity between D2R and D5R. This machinery may be crucial in modulating synaptic plasticity in cortical-striatal circuits during motor learning and execution. Furthermore, the study bridges their previous finding of CIN hyperexcitability (Paz et al., Movement Disorder 2022) with the loss of pause response in LID mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study had solid findings, and the writing was logically structured and easy to follow. The experiments are well-designed, and they properly combined electrophysiology recording, optogenetics, and pharmacological treatment to dissect/rule out most, if not all, possible mechanisms in their model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is overall satisfying with only some minor concerns that need to be addressed. Manipulation of intracellular cAMP (e.g. using pharmacological analogs or inhibitors) can add additional evidence to strengthen the conclusion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Tubert C. et al. investigated the role of dopamine D5 receptors (D5R) and their downstream potassium channel, Kv1, in the striatal cholinergic neuron pause response induced by thalamic excitatory input. Using slice electrophysiological analysis combined with pharmacological approaches, the authors tested which receptors and channels contribute to the cholinergic interneuron pause response in both control and dyskinetic mice (in the L-DOPA off state). They found that activation of Kv1 was necessary for the pause response, while activation of D5R blocked the pause response in control mice. Furthermore, in the L-DOPA off-state of dyskinetic mice, the absence of the pause response was restored by the application of clozapine.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Tubert et al. investigate the mechanisms underlying the pause response in striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCINs). The authors demonstrate that optogenetic activation of thalamic axons in the striatum induces burst activity in SCINs, followed by a brief pause in firing. They show that the duration of this pause correlates with the number of elicited action potentials, suggesting a burst-dependent pause mechanism. The authors demonstrated this burst-dependent pause relied on Kv1 channels. The pause is blocked by an SKF81297 and partially by sulpiride and mecamylamine, implicating D1/D5 receptor involvement. The study also shows that the ZD7288 does not reduce the duration of the pause and that lesioning dopamine neurons abolishes this response, which can be restored by clozapine.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While this study presents an interesting mechanism for SCIN pausing after burst activity, there are several major concerns that should be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) Scope of the Mechanism:</p>
<p>It is important to clarify that the proposed mechanism may apply specifically to the pause in SCINs following burst activity. The manuscript does not provide clear evidence that this mechanism contributes to the pause response observed in behavioral animals. While the thalamus is crucial for SCIN pauses in behavioral contexts, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Activating thalamic input triggers burst activity in SCINs, leading to a subsequent pause, but this mechanism may not be generalizable across different scenarios. For instance, approximately half of TANs do not exhibit initial excitation but still pause during behavior, suggesting that the burst-dependent pause mechanism is unlikely to explain this phenomenon. Furthermore, in behavioral animals, the duration of the pause seems consistent, whereas the proposed mechanism suggests it depends on the prior burst, which is not aligned with in vivo observations. Additionally, many in vivo recordings show that the pause response is a reduction in firing rate, not complete silence, which the mechanism described here does not explain. Please address these in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) Terminology:</p>
<p>The use of &quot;pause response&quot; throughout the manuscript is misleading. The pause induced by thalamic input in brain slices is distinct from the pause observed in behavioral animals. Given the lack of a clear link between these two phenomena in the manuscript, it is essential to use more precise terminology throughout, including in the title, bullet points, and body of the manuscript.</p>
<p>(3) Kv1 Blocker Specificity:</p>
<p>It is unclear how the authors ruled out the possibility that the Kv1 blocker did not act directly on SCINs. Could there be an indirect effect contributing to the burst-dependent pause? Clarification on this point would strengthen the interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>(4) Role of D1 Receptors:</p>
<p>While it is well-established that activating thalamic input to SCINs triggers dopamine release, contributing to SCIN pausing (as shown in Figure 3), it would be helpful to assess the extent to which D1 receptors contribute to this burst-dependent pause. This could be achieved by applying the D1 agonist SKF81297 after blocking nAChRs and D2 receptors.</p>
<p>(5) Clozapine's Mechanism of Action:</p>
<p>The restoration of the burst-dependent pause by clozapine following dopamine neuron lesioning is interesting, but clozapine acts on multiple receptors beyond D1 and D5. Although it may be challenging to find a specific D5 antagonist or inverse agonist, it would be more accurate to state that clozapine restores the burst-dependent pause without conclusively attributing this effect to D5 receptors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Tubert C. et al. investigated the role of dopamine D5 receptors (D5R) and their downstream potassium channel, Kv1, in the striatal cholinergic neuron pause response induced by thalamic excitatory input. Using slice electrophysiological analysis combined with pharmacological approaches, the authors tested which receptors and channels contribute to the cholinergic interneuron pause response in both control and dyskinetic mice (in the L-DOPA off state). They found that activation of Kv1 was necessary for the pause response, while activation of D5R blocked the pause response in control mice. Furthermore, in the L-DOPA off-state of dyskinetic mice, the absence of the pause response was restored by the application of clozapine. The authors claimed that (1) the D5R-Kv1 pathway contributes to the cholinergic interneuron pause response in a phasic dopamine concentration-dependent manner, and (2) clozapine inhibits D5R in the L-DOPA off state, which restores the pause response.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches used in this study are powerful tools for testing channel properties and functions. The authors' group has well-established these methodologies and analysis pipelines. Indeed, the data presented were robust and reliable.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that further work is necessary to clarify the role of the D5R in physiological conditions. While we haven’t found effects of the D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH23390 on the pause response in control animals (Fig. 3), it is still possible that dopamine levels reach the threshold to stimulate D5R when burst firing of dopaminergic neurons contributes to dopamine release. We believe the pause response depends, among other factors, on the relative stimulation levels of SCIN D2 and D5 receptors, which is likely not an all-or-nothing phenomenon. To reduce ambiguity, we will change the labels referring to dopamine levels in Figure 6F.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, the data presented in Figure 6 are confusing. If clozapine inhibits active D5R and restores the pause response, the D5R antagonist SCH23390 should have the same effect.

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for letting us clarify this issue. Please note that the levels of endogenous dopamine 24 h after the last L-DOPA challenge in severe parkinsonian mice are expected to be very low. In the absence of an agonist, a pure D1/D5 antagonist would not exert an effect, as demonstrated with SCH23390 alone, which did not have an impact on the SCIN response to thalamic stimulation (Fig. 6). While clozapine can also act as a D1/D5 receptor antagonist, its D1/D5 effects in absence of an agonist are attributed to its inverse agonist properties (PMID: 24931197). Notably, SCH23390 prevented the effect of clozapine, allowing us to conclude that ligand-independent D1/D5 receptor-mediated mechanisms are involved in suppressing the pause response in dyskinetic mice. We will make the point clearer in the Discussion.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Tubert et al presents the role of the D5 receptor in modulating the striatal cholinergic interneuron (CIN) pause response through D5R-cAMP-Kv1 inhibitory signaling. Their model elucidates the on / off switch of CIN pause, likely due to the different DA affinity between D2R and D5R. This machinery may be crucial in modulating synaptic plasticity in cortical-striatal circuits during motor learning and execution. Furthermore, the study bridges their previous finding of CIN hyperexcitability (Paz et al., Movement Disorder 2022) with the loss of pause response in LID mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study had solid findings, and the writing was logically structured and easy to follow. The experiments are well-designed, and they properly combined electrophysiology recording, optogenetics, and pharmacological treatment to dissect/rule out most, if not all, possible mechanisms in their model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is overall satisfying with only some minor concerns that need to be addressed. Manipulation of intracellular cAMP (e.g. using pharmacological analogs or inhibitors) can add additional evidence to strengthen the conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. While we acknowledge that we are not providing direct evidence of the role of cAMP, we chose not to conduct these experiments because cAMP levels influence several intrinsic and synaptic currents beyond Kv1, significantly affecting  membrane oscillations and spontaneous firing, as shown in Paz et al. 2021. However, we are modifying the manuscript so there is no misinterpretation about our findings in the current work.</p>

<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. While the absence of an initial burst in some TANs in vivo may suggest the involvement of alternative or additional mechanisms, it does not exclude a participation of Kv1 currents. We have seen that subthreshold depolarizations induced by thalamic inputs are sufficient to produce an afterhyperpolarization (AHP) mediated by Kv1 channels (see Tubert et al., 2016, PMID: 27568555). Although such subthreshold depolarizations are not captured in current recordings from behaving animals, intracellular in vivo recordings have demonstrated an intrinsically generated AHP after subthreshold depolarization of SCIN caused by stimulation of excitatory afferents (PMID: 15525771). Additionally, when pause duration is plotted against the number of spikes elicited by thalamic input (Fig. 1G), we found that one elicited spike is followed by an interspike interval 1.4 times longer than the average spontaneous interspike interval. We acknowledge the potential involvement of additional factors, including a decrease of excitatory thalamic input coinciding with the pause, followed by a second volley of thalamic inputs (Fig. 1G-J, after observations by Matsumoto et al., 2001- PMID: 11160526), as well as the timing of elicited spikes relative to ongoing spontaneous firing (Fig. 1D-E). Dopaminergic modulation (Fig. 3) and regional differences among striatal regions (PMID: 24559678) may also contribute to the complexity of these dynamics.</p>

<p>The use of &quot;pause response&quot; throughout the manuscript is misleading. The pause induced by thalamic input in brain slices is distinct from the pause observed in behavioral animals.

<p>While we acknowledge that our study does not include in vivo evidence, we believe ex vivo preparations have been instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the responses observed in vivo. We also agree with previous ex vivo studies in using consistent terminology. However, we will clarify the ex vivo nature of our work in the abstract and bullet points for greater transparency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Kv1 Blocker Specificity:</p>
<p>It is unclear how the authors ruled out the possibility that the Kv1 blocker did not act directly on SCINs. Could there be an indirect effect contributing to the burst-dependent pause? Clarification on this point would strengthen the interpretation of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for letting us clarify this issue. In our previous work (Tubert et al., 2016) we showed that the Kv1.3 and Kv1.1 subunits are selectively expressed in SCIN throughout the striatum. Moreover, gabaergic transmission is blocked in our preparations. We are including a phrase to make it clearer in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Role of D1 Receptors:</p>
<p>While it is well-established that activating thalamic input to SCINs triggers dopamine release, contributing to SCIN pausing (as shown in Figure 3), it would be helpful to assess the extent to which D1 receptors contribute to this burst-dependent pause. This could be achieved by applying the D1 agonist SKF81297 after blocking nAChRs and D2 receptors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for letting us clarify this point. We show that blocking D2R or nAChR reduces the pause only for strong thalamic stimulation eliciting 4 SCIN spikes (Figure 3G), whereas the D1/D5 agonist SKF81297 is able to reduce the pause induced by weaker stimulation as well (Figure 3C). This may indicate that nAChR-mediated dopamine release induced by thalamic-induced bursts more efficiently activates D2R compared to D5R. We speculate that, in this context, lack of D5R activation may be necessary to keep normal levels of Kv1 currents necessary for SCIN pauses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Clozapine's Mechanism of Action:</p>
<p>The restoration of the burst-dependent pause by clozapine following dopamine neuron lesioning is interesting, but clozapine acts on multiple receptors beyond D1 and D5. Although it may be challenging to find a specific D5 antagonist or inverse agonist, it would be more accurate to state that clozapine restores the burst-dependent pause without conclusively attributing this effect to D5 receptors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful observation. We acknowledge the difficulty of targeting dopamine receptors pharmacologically due to the lack of highly selective D1/D5 inverse agonists. We used SCH23390, which is a highly selective D1/D5 receptor antagonist devoid of inverse agonist effects, to block clozapine’s ability to restore SCIN pauses (Figure 6C). This indicates that the restoration of SCIN pauses by clozapine depends on D1/D5 receptors. Furthermore, in a previous study, we demonstrated that clozapine’s effect on restoring SCIN excitability in dyskinetic mice (a phenomenon mediated by Kv1 channels in SCIN; Tubert et al., 2016) was not due to its action on serotonin receptors (Paz, Stahl et al., 2022). While our data do not rule out the potential contribution of other receptors, such as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, we believe they strongly support the role of D1/D5 receptors. To reflect this, we will add a statement discussing the potential contribution of receptors beyond D1/D5.</p>
