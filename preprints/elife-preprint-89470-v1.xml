<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>With the availability of high quality full genome polymorphism (SNPs) data, it becomes feasible to study the past demographic and selective history of populations in exquisite detail. However, such inferences still suffer from a lack of statistical resolution for recent, e.g. bottlenecks, events, and/or for populations with small nucleotide diversity. Additional heritable (epi)genetic markers, such as indels, transposable elements, microsatellites or cytosine methylation, may provide further, yet untapped, information on the recent past population history. We extend the Sequential Markovian Coalescent (SMC) framework to jointly use SNPs and other hyper-mutable markers. We are able to 1) improve the accuracy of demographic inference in recent times, 2) uncover past demographic events hidden to SNP-based inference methods, and 3) infer the hyper-mutable marker mutation rates under a finite site model. As a proof of principle, we focus on demo-graphic inference in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> using DNA methylation diversity data from 10 European natural accessions. We demonstrate that segregat-ing Single Methylated Polymorphisms (SMPs) satisfy the modelling assumptions of the SMC framework, while Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) are not suitable as their length exceeds that of the genomic distance between two recombination events. Combining SNPs and SMPs while accounting for site- and region-level epimutation processes, we provide new estimates of the glacial age bottleneck and post glacial population expansion of the European <italic>A. thaliana</italic> population. Our SMC framework readily accounts for a wide range of heritable genomic markers, thus paving the way for next generation inference of evolutionary history by combining information from several genetic and epigenetic markers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A central goal in population genetics is to reconstruct the evolutionary history of populations from patterns of genetic variation observed in the present. Relevant aspects of these histories include past demographic changes as well as signatures of selection. Inference methods based on Deep Learning (DL, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]), Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]) or Sequential Markovian Coalescent (SMC, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]) aim to infer this information directly from full genome sequencing data, which is becoming rapidly available for many (non-model) species due to decreasing costs. The SMC, in particular, offers an elegant theoretical framework that builds on the classical Wright-Fisher and the backward-in-time Kingman coalescent stochastic models (<italic>e.g.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]). Both models conceptualize Mendelian inheritance as generating the genealogy of a population (or a sample), that is, the unique history of a fragment of DNA passing from parents to offspring. When this genealogy includes the effect of recombination, it is called the Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]).</p>
<p>Under the Kingmann coalescent model, the true genealogy of a population (or sample) is defined by its topology and branch length, and contains the information on past demographic changes and life history traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>] as well as selective events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. The genealogical and the mutational processes of any heritable marker can therefore be disentangled, and the frequency of any given marker state is given by the shape of the genealogy in time (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). A central assumption about heritable genomic markers is that they are generated by two homogeneous Poisson mutation processes along the genome as well as through time. This entails that mutations in different genealogies are independent due to the effect of recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], and that there are no time periods with a large excess, or a severe lack, of mutations along a genealogy (mutations are independently distributed in time within a DNA fragment). In other words, the frequency of polymorphisms at DNA markers observed across a sample of sequences are constrained by, as well as inform on, the underlying genealogy at this locus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To clarify these assumptions, we present a schematic representation of a marker 1 (yellow in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) which fulfills both homogeneous Poisson processes in time and along the genome. We also present cases applicable to a second genomic marker 2 that violates the model assumptions, namely by not being heritable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) or not following a non-homogeneous Poisson process in the genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) or in time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>Despite the power of the SMC, well-known model violations such as variation in recombination and mutation rates along the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] or pervasive selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] can compromise the accuracy of demographic and selective inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. There are two other important issues that have received less attention in the literature. The first issue occurs when the population recombination rate (<italic>ρ</italic>) is higher than the population mutation rate (<italic>θ</italic>). In such cases, inferences can be biased if not erroneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>], because several recombination events cannot be inferred due to the lack of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs for point mutations). This problem affects many species, though interestingly not humans which have a ratio <italic>ρ/θ ≈</italic> 1. A second issue occurs when the mutational process along the genealogy is too slow be informative about sudden and strong variation in population size (<italic>i.e.</italic> population bottlenecks), such as during colonization events of novel habitats. The typical low mutation rate of 10<sup>−9</sup> up to 10<sup>−8</sup> (per base, per generation) found in most species therefore places strong limitations on SMC analysis of recent bottleneck events (up to ca. 10<sup>−4</sup> generations ago) when inference is based solely on SNP data. Indeed, bottlenecks are often either not found, or when inferred, their timing and magnitude are not well estimated (inferred smoother than in reality, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]), even when a large number of samples is used. A typical example is the large uncertainty of the timing and magnitude of the population size bottleneck during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and post-LGM expansion in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> European populations based on several studies using different accessions and SMC inference methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Nonetheless, current SMC, DL or ABC inference methods making use of full genome sequence data rely almost exclusively on SNPs for inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. There are both practical and theoretical reasons for using SNPs: They are easily detectable from short-read re-sequencing data and their mutational process is well approximated by the infinite site model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>], simplifying the inference of the underlying genealogy. However, other heritable genomic markers exists whose mutation rates can be several orders of magnitude higher than that of SNPs, and could thus be more informative about recent demographic events. These include microsatellites, insertions, deletions and transposable elements (TEs). Although those heritable markers are not necessarily neutral (such as TEs which are likely to be under weak purifying selection) they contain information on the evolutionary history of the population. Current technological limitations still impede the easy detection and estimation of allele frequencies for many of these markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. For example, identifying insertion/excision variation of transposable elements or or copy number variation of microsatellites requires a high quality reference genome and ideally long-read sequencing approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. In addition to these genomic markers, DNA cytosine methylation is emerging as a potentially useful epigenetic marker for phylogenetic inference in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. Stochastic gains and losses of DNA methylation at CG dinucleotides, in particular, arise at a rate of ca. 10<sup>−4</sup> up to 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation (that is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude faster than DNA point mutations, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]), and can be inherited across generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. These so-called spontaneous epimutations are likely neutral at the genome-wide scale ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]), and can be easily detected from bisulphite converted short read sequencing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Recent work suggests that CG methylation data can be used as a molecular clock for timing divergence between pairs of lineages over timescales ranging from years to decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>].</p>
<p>However, theoretical integration of the above-mentioned (epi)genomic markers into a population genomics and SMC inference framework is not trivial. Because of the high mutation rate, the mutational process at these (hyper-mutable) markers is reversible and more consistent with a finite site, rather than infinite site, model, which can result in extensive homoplasy (as known for microsatellite markers, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]). Indeed, classic expectations of population genetics diversity statistics, mostly build for SNPs, need to be revised for these hyper-mutable markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. Here we develop the theoretical and methodological inference framework for the inclusion of additional (potentially hyper-mutable) markers into the SMC. We showcase our model using extensive simulations as well as application to published DNA cytosine methylation data from local populations of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. We demonstrate that integration of hyper-mutable genomic markers into SMC models significantly improves the inference accuracy of past variation of population size, or can even uncover demographic events not uncovered using SNPs alone. Our proof-of-principle approach opens up novel avenues for studying population genetic processes over time-scales that have been largely inaccessible using traditional SNP-based approaches. This may prove particularly useful when exploring recent demographic changes of endangered species as a way to assess their potential for extinction in the context of biodiversity loss and global change.</p>

<title>Theoretical results with two markers underlying the SMC computations</title>
<p>We study polymorphic sites across genomes of several sampled individuals which exhibit several possible markers (DNA nucleotides, methylation, TEs, indels, microsatellites,…). We define any marker by 1) its maximum number of possible states (<italic>nb<sub>s</sub></italic>), for example nucleotide sites have four states (A, T, C and G) while a methylation site has two states (methylated or unmethylated), and 2) its mutation rate <italic>µ</italic>, <italic>i.e.</italic> the rate at which the state of a marker changes into another state per position and per generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] (for simplicity we assume an equal mutation rates between all bases known as the Jukes-Cantor model). More specifically, we are interested in two rates: the DNA mutation rate for changes in DNA nucleotides, and epimutation rate for change in methylation state. Furthermore, we assume that at each position on the genome only one type of marker can occur and be observed. We obtain as a first theoretical result the probability for a given site in the genome to be identical (<italic>P</italic> (<italic>id</italic>)) or segregating (<italic>P</italic> (<italic>seg</italic>)) (<italic>i.e.</italic> polymorphic) in a sample of size two (<italic>n</italic> = 2, two sampled chromosomes are compared):
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="535252v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
This probability is a function of the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA in text and <italic>t<sub>M</sub></italic> in <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 1</xref>, details in Supplementary Text). The probability for a mutation to occur for a given marker increases with an increased TMRCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>], but under high mutation rates the marker may not be polymorphic in the sample as mutations may be reversed (so-called homoplasy, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]). In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> we illustrate these properties by computing the probability 1 for different mutation rates. The inference of recent demographic events and bottlenecks do rely on the presence of polymorphic sites to detect recent coalescent event (TMRCA), and should be improved by using markers with high (or fast) mutation rate (<italic>e.g.</italic> hyper mutable).</p>

<p>In the following, we simulate data under different demographic scenarios using the sequence simulator program <italic>msprime</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], which generates the ARG of <italic>n</italic> sampled diploid individuals (set to <italic>n</italic> = 5 throughout this study, leading to 10 haploid genomes). This ARG contains the genealogy of a given sample at each position of the simulated chromosomes. We then process the ARG to create DNA sequences according to the model parameters and the type of marker considered. We first assume a set of genomic markers obtained for a sample size <italic>n</italic>, and mutating according an homogeneous Poisson process along the genome and in time (along the genealogy) as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. To simulate the sequence data, we define the number of marker types (any number between 1 and the sequence length) and the proportion of sites of each marker type in the sequence. Each marker is characterized by both parameters <italic>nb<sub>s</sub></italic> and <italic>µ</italic>. For simplicity, we simulate sequences with two markers, but note that the method can be easily extent to additional markers. Marker 1 represents 98% of the sequence, and has a per site mutation rate <italic>µ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 10<sup>−8</sup> mimicking nucleotide SNP markers under an infinite site model (thus considered as bi-allelic at a given DNA site, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]). By contrast, marker 2 composes the complementary 2% of the sequence length, with a per site mutation rate of <italic>µ</italic><sub>2</sub> = 10<sup>−4</sup> per generation between two possible states. Marker 2 is thus hyper-mutable compared to marker 1 and mimics methylation/epimutation sites. Note, that mutation events in Marker 1 and 2 are simulated under a finite site model.</p>
<p>We use different SMC-based methods throughout this study. These methods include: 1) MSMC2 used as a reference method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], 2) SMCtheo is an extension of the PSMC’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>] accounting for any number of heritable theoretical markers, and 3) eSMC2 which is equivalent to SMCtheo but accounting only for SNPs markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] (to avoid any bias in implementation differences between SMCtheo and MSMC2). All methods are Hidden Markov Models (HMM) derived from the Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC’) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>] and assume neutral evolution and a panmictic population. The hidden states of these methods are the coalescence time of a sample of size two at a position on the sequence. From the distribution of the hidden states along the genome, all methods can infer population size variation through time as well as the recombination rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>].</p>

<title>The inclusions of hyper-mutable genomic markers improves demographic inference</title>
<p>We assume that the mutation rate of marker 1 is <italic>µ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 10<sup>−8</sup> per generation per bp. We use this information to estimate the mutation rate of marker 2, which we vary from <italic>µ</italic><sub>2</sub> = 10<sup>−8</sup> to <italic>µ</italic><sub>2</sub> = 10<sup>−2</sup> per generation per bp. The estimation results based on simulated data under a constant population size of <italic>N</italic> = 10, 000 are displayed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We find that our approach is capable of inferring <italic>µ</italic><sub>2</sub> with high accuracy for rates up to <italic>µ</italic><sub>2</sub> = 10<sup>−4</sup>. However, when the mutation rate <italic>µ</italic><sub>2</sub> is 10<sup>−2</sup>, our approach underestimates it by a factor three, suggesting the existence of an accuracy limit. To demonstrate that information can be gained by integrating marker 2 (with <italic>µ</italic><sub>2</sub> = 10<sup>−4</sup>), we compared the ability of several inference methods to recover a recent bottleneck (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). All methods correctly infer the amplitude of population size variation. When accounting only for marker 1 (with <italic>µ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 10<sup>−8</sup>, MSMC2 and eSMC2 fail to infer accurately the sudden variation of population size. However, with the inclusion of hyper-mutable marker 2, our SMCtheo approach correctly infers the rapid change of population size of the bottleneck (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, green). It is encouraging that an accurate estimation of the demography is obtained, even when the mutation rate of marker 2 is unknown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, blue).</p>

<p>Furthermore, some species or populations might feature small effective population sizes (ca. <italic>N</italic> = 1, 000), potentially resulting in reduced genomic diversity. In such cases the inclusion of hyper-mutable markers should also improve demographic inference. We present the results of such a scenario in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, where the population size was divided by a factor 10 compared to the previous scenario in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>. We find that in the absence of the hyper-mutable marker 2, no approach can correctly infer the variation of population size. From the shape of the inferred demography, methods using only marker 1 do not suggest the existence of a bottleneck followed by recovery (the &quot;U-shaped&quot; demographic scenario is not apparent with the orange and red lines, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Yet, when integrating both markers, the population size can be recovered, even if the mutation rate of marker 2 is not <italic>a priori</italic> known. In both <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, we assume that the marker 2 occurs at a frequency of 2% in the genome. This percentage may be unrealistically high depending on the marker and the species. To test the impact of reducing marker 2 frequency, we repeat the simulations shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, but set its frequency to as low as 0.1% (a 20-fold reduction). We find that the inclusion of the hyper-mutable marker 2 continues to improve inference accuracy in very recent times, albeit less pronounced than in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> (see Supplementary Figure 1). This suggests that a very small proportion of hyper-mutable genomic sites is sufficient to significantly improve the accuracy of inferences.</p>
<p>All full genome inference methods, especially SMC approaches, display lower accuracy when the population recombination rate (<italic>ρ</italic> = 4<italic>Nr</italic>) is larger than the population mutation rate of marker 1 (<italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 4<italic>Nµ</italic><sub>1</sub>). We simulate sequence data under a bottleneck scenario slightly more ancient than in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and assume that <italic>ρ/θ</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>r/µ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 10 and <italic>ρ/θ</italic><sub>2</sub> = <italic>r/µ</italic><sub>2</sub> = 10<sup>−3</sup>. Our results show that by integrating the genomic marker 2 which mutation rate is larger than the recombination rate, estimates of the recombination rate as well as past population size variation are substantially improved (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Indeed, analyzing only marker 1, eSMC2 and MSMC2 fail to infer the sudden variation of population size, overestimate the population size in recent times (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). By integrating the hyper-mutable marker 2, our SMCtheo approach correctly infers the strength and time of the bottleneck when <italic>µ</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>µ</italic><sub>2</sub> are known (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, green line), while the timing of the bottleneck is slightly shifted in the past when <italic>µ</italic><sub>2</sub> is unknown and estimated by our method (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, blue line). Using only marker 1, the estimates of the recombination rate are inaccurate (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> under various demographic scenarios in Supplementary Figure S2). We further improve the accuracy of estimation by optimizing the likelihood (LH) to estimate the recombination rate and demography compared to the classically used Baum-Welch (BW) algorithm (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Our results demonstrate that SNPs are limiting and insufficient for accurate inferences in recent times and that the inclusion of an additional marker with mutation rate higher than the recombination rate generates significant improvements in demographic inference.

<title>Integrating DNA methylation improves the accuracy of inference</title>
<sec id="s2c1">
<title>Definition of the theoretical model for DNA methylation</title>
<p>Following the previously encouraging results of demographic inference with SNPs and an hyper-mutable marker under the specific assumptions of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, we develop a specific SMCm method to jointly analyse SNPs and cytosine methylation as an epigenetic hyper-mutable marker. Since our SMCm stems from the eSMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] it corrects for the effect of self-fertilization when appliying to <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. We focus here on methylation located in CG contexts within genic regions as these are more likely to evolve neutrally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. The methylation of individual CG dinucleotides produces a biallelic heritable marker with a finite number of (epi)mutable sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In a sample of several sequences from a population, variation in the methylation status of individual CGs is known as single methylation polymorphism (SMP, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) which could be used for demographic and divergence inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. However, CG methylation sites can also be organized in spatial clusters (of similar state) due to region level epimutation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Region level epimutations can have different epimutation rates than individual CG sites. Population-level variation in the methylation status of these clusters is known as differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Furthermore, when integrating SMP and DMR epimutational processes (<italic>i.e.</italic> what we here call region level epimutation), the methylation status of CG sites is therefore affected by the superposition of both processes. Therefore the simulation and modeling of epimutational processes of SMPs is more complex than in our previous model as we need to account for the effect of region methylation as well as for methylation and demethylation epimutation rates to be different and asymmetrical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>

<graphic xlink:href="535252v2_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To make our simulations realistic, we use the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome sequence as a starting point, and focus on CG dinucleotides within genic regions. To that end, we selected random 1kb regions within genes and choose only those CG sites that are clearly methylated or unmethylated in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> natural populations based on whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) mesaurements from the 1001G project (SI text). Our simulator for CG methylation is build in a similar way as the one described above but the epimutation rates are allowed to be asymmetric with the per-site methylation rate (<italic>µ<sub>SM</sub></italic>) and demythylation (<italic>µ<sub>SU</sub></italic>). Region-level epimutations are also implemented, setting the region length to either 1kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] or 150 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. The region level methylation and demethylation rates are defined as <italic>µ<sub>RM</sub></italic> and <italic>µ<sub>RU</sub></italic>, respectively. We assume that site-level and region-level epimutation processes are independent. Making this assumption explicit later allow us to test if it is violated in comparisons with actual data. Our simulator also assumes that DNA mutations and epimutations are independent of one another. That is, for simplicity we ignore the fact that methylated cytosines are more likely to transition to thyamines as a result of spontaneous deamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. We also ignore the possibility that new DNA mutations could act as CG methylation quantitative trait loci and affect CG methylation patterns in both cis and trans. Such events are extremely rare, and we therefore think that the above assumptions hold reasonably well over short evolutionary time-scales. As the goal is to apply our approach to <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, we simulate sequence data for a sample size <italic>n</italic> = 10 (but considering <italic>A. thaliana</italic> haploid) from a population displaying 90% selfing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] under a recent severe population bottleneck demographic scenario. We simulate data assuming previously estimates of the rates of recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], DNA mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], and site- and region-level methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>As guidance for future analyses of demographic inference using SNPs and DNA methylation data, the theoretical and empirical analysis of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> methylomes consist of the following five steps: 1) assessing the relevance of region-level methylation (DMRs) for inference, 2) inference of site and region epimutation rates, 3) comparing statistics for the SNPs, SMPs and DMRs distributions, 4) demographic inference using SNPs with SMPs or DMRS, and 5) demographic inference using SNPs with SMPs and DMRs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c2">
<title>Step 1: assessing the relevance of region-level methylation (DMRs) for inference</title>
<p>We determine our ability to detect the existence of spatial correlations between epimutations. That is, we asked if site-specific epimutations can lead to region-level methylation status changes. We assess this across a range of epimutation rates assuming two sequences of 100 Mb (<italic>r</italic> = <italic>µ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 10<sup>−8</sup> per generation per bp) under a constant population size fixed to <italic>N</italic> = 10, 000 (results in Supplementary Table 1). If site-specific epimutations are independently distributed, the probability of a given site to be in a certain (methylated or unmethylated) state should be independent from the state of nearby sites (knowing the epimutation rate per site). Conversely, if there is a region effect on epimutation (DMRs), two consecutive sites along the genome would exhibit a positive correlation in their methylated states. We therefore calculate from the per-site (de)methylation rates <italic>µ<sub>SM</sub></italic> and <italic>µ<sub>SD</sub></italic> the probability that two successive cytosine positions are identical in their methylation assuming they are independent. This probability can be compared to the one observed (here simulated) methylation data so that we obtain a statistical test for the existence of a positive correlation in the methylation status of nearby sites, interpreted as region-level epimutation process (p-value = 0.05) according to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. If the test is non-significant, we validate the existence of a region effect for methylation/demethylation affecting neighbouring cytosines. We find that when region epimutation rates are higher than (or similar to) site-level epimutation rates, namely <italic>µ<sub>RM</sub></italic> <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="535252v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> <italic>µ<sub>SM</sub></italic> and <italic>µ<sub>RU</sub></italic> <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="535252v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> <italic>µ<sub>SU</sub></italic>), the existence of regions of consecutive cytosines is detected with high accuracy. However, when site-level epimutation rates are higher (<italic>µ<sub>SU</sub> &gt; µ<sub>RU</sub></italic> and <italic>µ<sub>SM</sub> &gt; µ<sub>RM</sub></italic>) than region-level epimutation rates, region-level changes cannot be readily detected (Supplementary Table 1). When methylated regions are detected, we can further determine their length using a specifically developed Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using all pairs of genomes (similarly to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]). While the length of the methylated region is pre-determined in our simulations (1kb or 150bp) but site-level epimutation occur which can change the distribution of methylation states in that region and across individuals, thus DMR regions can vary in length along the genome and between pairs of chromosomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c3">
<title>Step 2: inference of site- and region-level epimutation rates</title>
<p>As the epimutation rates of most plant species remain unknown, we assess the accuracy of SMCm to infer epimutation rates at the site- and region-level directly from simulated data. We first assume that either only site- or only region epimutations can occur, and infer their respective rates (see Supplementary Table 2 and 3). Our SMCm approach can accurately recover these rates except when these are higher than 10<sup>−4</sup>. Next, we assess the accuracy of our approach to simultaneously infer site- and region-level epimutation rates assuming that region and site epimutation rates are equal (Supplementary Table 4). Similar to our previous observation, we find that when the epimutation rates are very high (<italic>e.g.</italic> close to 10<sup>−2</sup>), accuracy is lost compared to slower epimutation rates. Nonetheless, our average estimated rates are off from the true value by less than an factor 10. Hence, under our model assumptions, we are able to recover the correct order of magnitude for site- and region-level methylation and demethylation rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c4">
<title>Step 3: distribution of statistics for SNPs, SMPs and DMRs</title>
<p>To gain insights on the distribution of epimutations under the assumptions described in the introduction, we look at key statistics from our simulations: the distribution of distance between two recombination events versus the distribution of the length of estimated DMR regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), and the LD decay for SMPs (in genic regions) and SNPs (in all contexts) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). In our simulations DMRs regions have a maximum fixed size, but their length depends on the interaction between the region- and site-level epimutation rates. As mentioned in step 1, the methylated/demethylated regions are detected using the binomial test and their length estimated by the HMM. Therefore, while variation exist for the length of these regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), there are shorter than the span of genealogies along the genome, which are defined by the frequency of recombination events along the genome (<italic>r</italic> = 3.5 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−8</sup> as in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>). There is is virtually no linkage disequilibrium (LD) between epimutations due to the high epimutation rate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), while the LD between SNPs can range over few kbp (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, as observed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]). Note however, that the region methylation process in itself does not generate LD because this measure can only be computed if SMPs are present in frequency higher than 2<italic>/n</italic> in the sample, <italic>i.e.</italic> there is no LD measure defined for monomorphic methylated/unmethylated regions. In other words, our simulator generates SNPs, SMPs and DMRs which fulfil the three key assumptions of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. We note that by using a constant population size <italic>N</italic> = 10, 000, the LD decay for SNPs is higher than in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> data which exhibit an effective population size of ca. <italic>N</italic> = 250, 000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] and past changes in size.</p>

<title>Step 4: demographic inference based on SNPs with SMPs or DMRs</title>
<p>We test the usefulness of either SMPs or DMRS for demographic inference.

We perform inference of past demographic history under different amount of potentially methylated sites with and without <italic>a priori</italic> knowing the methylation/demythylation rates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>). When the site epimutation rates are <italic>a priori</italic> known, the sharp decrease of population size can be accurately detected. When epimutation rates are unknown, the shape of the past demographic history is also well inferred except for a scaling issue (a shift along the x- and y-axes similar to that in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). When we vary the amount of potentially methylated sites (2%, 10% and 20%) our inference results remain largely unchanged. This suggests that having methylation measurements for as low as 2% of all CG sites being epimutable in the genome is entirely sufficient to improved SNP-based demographic inference (eSMC2 in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>The amount of sequence data used in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref> is fairly large compared to real datasets (10 haploid genomes of length 100 Mb). We therefore ran the SMCm and eSMC2 on sequence data simulated under the same scenario but with a reduced sequence length of 10 Mb (<italic>n</italic> = 5 diploid, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, only 3 repetitions are presented for visibility). In this case, we found that inference is significantly affected when using only SNPs (eSMC2 in blue), as we are unable to correctly recover the demographic scenario. However, incorporating SMPs with known site-level epimutations into the model leads to substantial inference improvements (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>).</p>
<p>We then simulate data under the same demographic scenario, but assume only region level epimutations (DMRs, <italic>µ<sub>SM</sub></italic> = <italic>µ<sub>SU</sub></italic> = 0). The results for DMR region sizes 1kb and 150bp are displayed in Supplementary Figure 4 and 5, respectively. As in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, we observed a gain of accuracy in inference when region-level epimutation rates are known, while the length of the region (1kb or 150bp) does not seem to affect the result. However, no significant gain of information is observed when integrating DMR data with unknown epimutation rates (Supplementary Figure 4 and 5). In summary, CG methylation SMPs and to a lesser extend DMRs, can be used jointly with SNPs to improve demographic inference.</p>

<sec id="s2c6">
<title>Step 5: demographic inference based on SNPs with SMPs and DMRs</title>
<p>Since site- and region-level methylation processes occur in real data, we run SMCm on simulated data under the same demographic scenario, but now using both site (SMPs) and region (DMRs) epimutations and accountig for both mutation processes. Inference results are displayed in Supplementary Figure 6. When epimutation rates are <italic>a priori</italic> known (in our simulations the rates are fixed and thus known), we find the counter-intuitive result that integrating epimutations decreases the accuracy of inference (compared to SMPs alone, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). However, when the epimutation rates are set to be inferred by SMCm, integrating SMP and DMR data slightly restores the accuracy of inference (Supplementary Figure 6). Finally, we assess the inference accuracy when using SNPs and SMPs but ignoring in SMCm the region methylation effect (DMRs), even though this latter process takes place (Supplementary Figure 7). Interestingly, the inference accuracy decreases compared to the previous results (Supplementary Figure 4-6). While the sudden variation of population is somehow recovered, the estimates of the time and magnitude of size change are not well recovered in recent time.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that our SMCm exhibits an improved statistical power for demographic inference using SNPs and SMPs while accounting for site and region-level methylation processes under the assumptions of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. We show that 1) using SMPs we can unveil past demographic events hidden by limitations in SNPs, 2) the correct demography can be uncovered irrespective of knowing <italic>a priori</italic> the epimutation rates, 3) ignoring site or region-level processes can decrease the accuracy of inference, and 4) knowing the epimutation rates may improve the estimate of demography compared to simultaneously estimating them with SMCm.</p>

<title>Step 1: assessing the strength of region-level methylation process in <italic>A. thaliana</italic></title>
<p>We apply our inference model to genome and methylome data from 10 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants from a German local population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. We start by assessing the strength of a region effect on the distribution of methylated CG sites along the genome. As expected from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], for all 10 individual full methylomes we reject the hypothesis of a binomial distribution of methylated and unmethylated sites along the genomes, suggesting the existence of region effect methylation (yielding DMRs) meaning that CG are more likely to be methylated if in a highly methylated region, and conversely for unmethylated CG. This is consistent with the autocorrelations in mCG found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. As a first measure of methylated region length, we test the independence between two annotated CG methylation given a minimum genomic distance between them (within one genome). We observe an average p-value smaller than 0.05 for distances up to 2,000bp but then the p-value rapidly increases (&gt;0.4) (Supplementary Figure 8). As a second measure, our HMM (based on pairs of genomes) yields a DMR average length of 222 bp (distribution in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>We conclude that the minimum distance for epimutations to be independent along a genome is over 2kb and spans larger distance than the typically proposed DMR size (ca. 150 bp in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] and 222bp in our analysis) and can therefore cover the size of a gene (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]). The simulations and data from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> indicate that the epimutation processes that produces DMRs at the population level in plants cannot simply results from the cumulative action of single-site epimutations. This insights is consistent with recent analyses of epimutational processes in gene bodies, which seems to indicate that the autocorrelation in CG methylation is a function of cooperative methylation maintenance and the distribution of histone modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>

<title>Step 3: distribution statistics for SNPs, SMPs and DMRs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic></title>
<p>Since our SMC model assumes that DNA, SMP and DMR polymorphisms are determined by the underlying population/sample genealogy, DMR which span long genomic regions may spread across multiple genealogies and thus violates our assumptions. We thus further investigate the potential discrepancies between the data and our model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). We infer the DMR sizes from all 10 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions using our ad hoc HMM, and measure the bp distance between a change in the expected hidden state (<italic>i.e.</italic> coalescent time) along the genome, which we interpret as recombination events (called the genomic span of a genealogy). The resulting distributions are found in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>. We observe that both distributions have a similar shape but DMRs are on average twice as large as the inferred genomic genealogy span: average length of 222 bp (DMR) vs 137 bp (genealogy) and median length of 134 bp (DMR) vs 62 bp (genealogy). This means that on average DMRs are larger than the average distance between two recombination events, thus violating the homogeneous distribution of epimutations along the genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>To further unveil potential non-homogeneity of the distribution of epimutations, we assess the decay of LD of mutations (SNPs) and epimutations (SMPs) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>) confirming the results in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. We find the LD between SMPs in the data to be high (and higher than LD between SNPs) for distance smaller than 100 bp (red line in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). The LD decay of SMPs is much faster than for SNPs (no linkage disequilibrium between epimutations for distances &gt; 100bp), likely stemming from 1) epimutation rates being much higher than the DNA mutation rate, and 2) the high per site recombination rate in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Moreover, the LD between SMPs at distance smaller than 100bp in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> being much higher compared to our simulations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), we suggest that additional local mechanisms of epimutation processes may not be accounted for in our model of the region-level methylation process.</p>

<title>Step 4: demographic inference for <italic>A. thaliana</italic> based only on SNPs and SMPs</title>
<p>Finally, we apply the SMCm approach to data from the German accessions of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. When using SNP data only, the demographic results are similar to those previously found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> purple lines), with no strong evidence for an expansion post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. We then sub-sample and analyze segregating SMPs, which exhibit both methylated and unmethylated states in our sample (as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]). Here we ignore DMRs and account only for SMPs. When we use as input the methylation and demethylation rates that have been inferred experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>], a mild bottleneck post-LGM is followed by recent expansion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> blue lines). By contrast, letting our SMCm estimate the epimutations rates, we find in recent times a somehow similar but stronger demographic change post-LGM. We find a strong bottleneck event occurring between ca. 5,000 and 10,000 generations ago followed by an expansion until today (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> green lines). The inferred site epimutation rates are 10,000 faster than the DNA mutation rate (Supplementary Table 5) which is close to the expected order of magnitude from experimental measures with and without DMR effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Both estimates thus yield a post-LGM bottleneck followed by a recent population expansion.</p>

<p>These results indicate that the inclusion of DNA methylation data can aid in the accurate reconstruction of the evolutionary history of populations, particularly in the recent past where SNPs reach their resolution limit. This is made possible by the fact that the DNA methylation status at CG dinucleotide undergoes stochastic changes at rates that are several orders of magnitude higher than the DNA mutation rate, and can be inherited across generations similar to DNA mutations.</p>

<title>Step 5: demographic inference correcting for DMRs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic></title>
<p>To assess the robustness of our inference results, we run SMCm using all cytosines (CG) sites with an annotated methylation status (segregating or not) while accounting or not for DMRs (Supplementary Figure 9). We fix epimutation rates to the empirically estimated values, and confirm the estimates from <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>.

When the region-level methylation process is taken into account (orange lines in Supplementary Figure 9), the inferred demography is similar to that of the <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> (green lines). In the case where we infer the epimutation rates (sites and region) the demographic history inference is not improved compared to that estimated using SNPs only (Supplementary Figure 9, green and red lines) while the inferred epimutation rates are smaller than expected (Supplementary Table 5 and 6), but the ratio of site to region epimutation rates is consistent with empirical estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Current approaches analyzing whole genome sequences rely on statistics derived from the distribution of ancestral recombination graphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. In this study we present a new SMC method that combines SNP data with other types of genomic (TEs, microsatallites) and epigenomic (DNA methylation) markers. We focus mainly on the inclusion of genomic markers whose mutation rates exceed the DNA point mutation rate, as such (hyper-mutable) markers can provide increased temporal resolution in the recent evolutionary past of populations, and aid in the identification of demographic changes (<italic>e.g.</italic> population bottlenecks). We demonstrate that by integrating multiple heritable genomic markers, the ARG can be more accurately recovered (outperforming any other methods given the amount of data used in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]). Our simulations demonstrate that if the SNP mutation rate is known, the mutation rate of other markers can be recovered. Moreover, our method accounts for the finite site problem that arises at reversible (hyper-mutable) markers and/or where effective population size is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Because SMC model inferences are based on a Baum-Welch algorithm, the accuracy of the method depends on the HMM’s capacity to correctly recover the true hidden states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. The simulator and SMC methods presented here therefore pave the way for a rigorous statistical framework to test if a common ARG can explain the observed diversity patterns under the model hypotheses laid out in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. We find that comparisons of LD for different markers along the genome is a useful way to assess violations of our model assumptions.</p>
<p>As proof of principle, we apply our approach on data originating from whole genome and methylome data of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> natural accessions (focusing on CG context in genic regions, as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]). Indeed, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> presents the largest genetic and epigenetic data-set of high quality. Additionally the methylation states in CG context has been proven mainly heritable and is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. We first investigate the distribution of epimuations along the genomes. Our modelbased approach provides strong evidence that DMRs cannot simply emerge from site-level epimutations that arise according to a Poisson processes along genome. Instead, stochastic changes in region-level methylation states must be the outcome of spontaneous methylation and demethylation events that operate at both the site- and region-level. Our epimutation model cannot fully describe the observed diversity of epimutations along the genome, meaning that the epimutation processes may indeed be more complex than expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. We observe non-independence between annotated methylation sites spanning genomic regions larger than the span of the underlying genealogy (determined by recombination events) which no model can currently describe. Additionally, we find high LD between SMPs over short distances which does not appear in our simulations (simulation performed under the current measures of epimutation rates). Thus, methylation probably violate the assumptions of a Poisson process distribution along the genome and in time, in line with recent functional studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. We thus further caution against conclusions on the role of natural (purifying) selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] or its absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] based on population epigenomic data due to the above mentioned assumptions violation. We suggest a possible way forward for modeling epimutations would be to use an Ising model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>] to account for the heterogeneous methylation process along the genome. However, our preliminary work indicates that this model generates nonhomogeneous mutation process in space (<italic>i.e</italic> along the genome) and time which violate our current SMC assumptions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the distance of LD decay for SMPs matches quite well the estimated distance between recombination events (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). In addition to our theoretical results in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, this observation reinforces the usefulness of using SMPs (or any hyper-mutable marker) to improve estimates of the recombination rate along the genome in species where the per site DNA mutation rate (<italic>µ</italic>) is smaller than the per site recombination rate (<italic>r</italic>) as in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we find that a restricted focus on segregating SMPs meets our model assumptions reasonably well, and thus provides a promising way forward. Using these segregating SMPs, we recover a past demographic bottleneck followed by an expansion which could fit the post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) colonization of Europe, a hypothesized scenario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] which could not be clearly identified using SNPs only from European (relic and non-relic) accessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Currently strong evidence from inference methods are lacking ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]). Indeed, beyond the limits of using SNPs only, current results are limited by theoretical frameworks unable to simultaneously account (and disentangle) for extensive background selection (due to very high selfing), population structure and variation in molecular rates (<italic>e.g.</italic> mutation rates, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]), which are all known to be present in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Those various forces are notoriously known to bias inference results when non-accounted for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], and may explain the variance in our demographic estimates. We suggest that simultaneously accounting for multiple heritable markers can help disentangle between different evolutionary forces, such as between selection and variation in mutation rate: selection has a local effect on the population genealogy, while the mutation rate variation would only locally affect that given marker but not the genealogy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. The absence of conflicting demography inferred from SNPs and from methylation confirms at the time scale of thousands of generations, CG methylation sites are mainly heritable and can be modeled using population genetics theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] and used to estimate divergence between lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. In other words fast ecological local adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] and response to stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>] may likely not be prominent forces endlessly reshaping CG methylation patterns (non-heritability in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>With the release of new sequencing technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], long and accurate reads are becoming accessible, leading to the availability of high quality reference genomes for model and non-model species alike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Additionally, the quality of resequencing (population sample) genome data and their annotations is enhanced so that additional markers such as transposable elements, insertion, deletion or microsatellites can be called with increasing confidence. These accurate genomes will provide access to new classes of genomic markers that span the entire mutational spectrum. We therefore suspect in the near future an improvement in our understanding of the heritability of many markers besides SNPs. Adding other genomic markers besides SNPs will improve full genome approaches, which are currently limited by the observed nucleotide diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. We predict that our results pave the way to improve the inference of 1) biological traits or recombination rate through time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>], 2) multiple merger events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], and 3) recombination and mutation rate maps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Our method also should help to dissect the effect of evolutionary forces on genomic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], and to improve the simultaneous detection, quantification and dating of selection events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Hence, there is no doubt that extending our work, by simultaneously integrating diverse types of genomic markers into other theoretical framework (<italic>e.g.</italic> ABC approaches), likely represents the future of population genomics, especially to study species for which many thousands of samples cannot be obtained. We believe our approach helps to develop more general classes of models capable of leveraging information from any type and amount of diversity observed in sequencing data, and thus to challenge our current understanding of genome evolution.</p>

<title>Simulating two genomic markers</title>
<p>The sequence is written as a sequence of markers with a given state.

<p>To simulate sequence of theoretical marker we start by simulating an ARG which is then split in a series of genealogies (<italic>i.e.</italic> a sequence of coalescent trees) along the chromosome and create an ancestral sequence (based on equilibrium probability of marker states). Mutation events (nucleotides or epimutations for methylable cytosine) are then added when going along the sequence, <italic>i.e.</italic> along the series of genealogies. The ancestral sequence is thus modified by mutation event assuming a finite site model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>] conditioned to the branch length and topology of the genealogies. Each leaf of the genealogy is one of the <italic>n</italic> sample. Our model has thus two important features: 1) markers are independent from one another, and 2) a given marker has a polymorphism distribution between samples (frequencies of alleles) determined by one given genealogy. The simulator can be found in the latest version of eSMC2 R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TPPSellinger/eSMC2">https://github.com/TPPSellinger/eSMC2</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Simulating methylome data</title>
<p>We now focus on methylation data located at cytosine in CG context within genic regions. Only, CG sites in those regions are considered &quot;methylable&quot;, and CG sites outside those defined genic regions do not have a methylation status and are considered &quot;unmethylable&quot;. We vary the percentage of CG site with methylation state annotated from 2 to 20% of the sequence length. The simulator can in principle simulate epimutations in different methylation context and different rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. We simulate epimutations as described above but with asymmetric rates: the methylation rate per site is <italic>µ<sub>SM</sub></italic> = 3.5 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−4</sup>, and the demethylation rate per site is <italic>µ<sub>SM</sub></italic> = 1.5 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. For simplicity and computational tractability, we assume that when an epimutation occurs, it occurs on both DNA strands which then present the same information. In other words, for a haploid individual, a cytosine site can only be methylated or unmethylated (as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]). For region level epimutations, the region length is either 1kbp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] or 150 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. The region level methylation and demethylation rates are set to <italic>µ<sub>RM</sub></italic> = 2 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−4</sup> and <italic>µ<sub>RU</sub></italic> = 10<sup>−3</sup> respectively (similar to rates measured in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]). In addition to this, unlike for theoretical marker described above, mutations, site and region epimutations can occur at the same position of the sequence.</p>
<p>To simulate methylation data, we start with an ancestral sequence of random nucleotide and then randomly select regions in which CG sites have their methylation state annotated (representing the genic regions). Cytosine in CG context in those regions are either methylated or unmethylated (noted as M or U). Cytosine in other context or regions are considered as unmethylabe (and noted as C). The ancestral methylation state is then randomly attributed according to the equilibrium probabilities. Our simulator then introduces DNA mutations, site- and region-epimutations in a similar way as described above.</p>

<title>eSMC2 and MSMC2</title>
<p>SMC methods based on the PSMC’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], such as eSMC2 and MSMC2, focus on the coalescent events between two individuals (<italic>i.e.</italic> two haploid genomes or one diploid genome). The algorithm moves along the sequence and estimates the coalescence time at each position by assessing whether the two sequences are similar or different at each position. If the two sequences are different, this indicates a mutation took place in the genealogy of the sample. The intuition being that the absence of mutations (<italic>i.e.</italic> the two sequences are identical) is likely due to a recent common ancestor between the sequences, and the presence of several mutations likely reflects that the most recent common ancestor of the two sequences is distant in the past. In the event of recombination, there is a break in the current genealogy and the coalescence time consequently takes a new value according to the model parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. A detailed description of the algorithm can be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s4c3">
<title>SMCtheo based on several genomic markers</title>
<p>Our SMCtheo approach is equivalent to PSMC’ but take as input a sequence of several genomic markers. The algorithm goes along a pair of haploid genomes and checks at each position which marker is observed and then if both states of the marker are identical or not. The approach is identical to the one described above, except that the probability of both sequences to be identical at one site depends on the mutation rate of the marker at this site (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). While the mutation rates for many heritable genomic markers are unknown, there is an increasing amount of measures of the DNA (SNP) mutation rate for many species. Our SMCtheo approach is able to leverage the information from the distribution of one theoretical marker (<italic>e.g.</italic> mutations for SNPs) to infer the mutation rate of the other marker 2 (assuming both mutation rates to be symmetrical). If more than 1% of sites are polymorphic in a sequence we use the finite site assumption. If not, then from the diversity observed, the different mutation rates can be recovered by simply comparing Waterson’s theta (<italic>θ<sub>W</sub></italic>) between the reference marker (<italic>i.e.</italic> with known rate) and the marker with the unknown rates. For example, if the diversity (<italic>θ<sub>W</sub></italic>) at marker 2 is smaller by a factor ten than the reference marker 1 (and no marker violates the infinite site hypothesis), the mutation rate of marker 2 is inferred to be ten times smaller (corrected by the number of possible states). However, if the marker 2 violates the infinite site hypothesis, a Baum-Welch algorithm is run to infer the most likely mutation rates under the SMC to overcome this issue (the Baum-Welch algorithm description can be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c4">
<title>SMCm</title>
<p>When integrating epimutations, the number of possible observations increases compare to eSMC2. As in eSMC2, if the two nucleotides (DNA mutation) at one position are identical at a non methylable site, we indicate this as 0. If the two nucleotides are different, it is indicated as 1 (<italic>i.e.</italic> a DNA mutation occurred). When assuming site-level epimutation only, three possible observations are possible at a given methylable posisiton: 1) if the two cytosines from the two chromosomes are unmethylated, it is indicated as a 2, 2) if the two cytosines are methylated, it is indicated as a 3, and 3) if at a position a cytosine is methylated and the other one unmethylated, it is indicated as a 4. Depending on the mutation, methylation and, demethylation rates, different frequencies of these states are possible in the sample of sequences, which provide information on the emission rate in the SMC method. When both site- and region-level methylation processes occur, the methylation state is conditioned by the region level methylation state (increasing the number of possible observation to 9)</p>
<p>To choose the appropriate settings for SMCm (<italic>i.e.</italic> if there are region level epimutations), we test if the methylation state are distributed independently from one another along one genome. In absence of region methylation effect, the probability at each site (position) to be methylated or unmethylated should be independent from the previous position (or any other position). Conversely, if there is a region effect on epimutation, two consecutive sites along one genome would exhibit a positive correlation in their methylated states (and across pairs of sequences). We therefore calculate the probability that two successive positions with an annotated methylation state would be identical under a binomial distribution of methylation along a given genome. We then compare theoretical expectations to the observed data and build the statistical test based on a binomial distribution of probabilities. If existence of region level epimutation is detected, the regions level methylation states are recovered through a hidden markov model (HMM) similarly to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. The complete description of the mathematical models and probabilities are in the supplementary material Text S1.</p>
<p>We postulate that the epimutation rates remain unknown in most species, while the DNA mutation rate may be known (or approximated based on a closely related species). Hence, we develop an approach based on the SMC capable of leveraging information from the distribution of DNA mutations to infer the epimutation rates (similar to what is described above). Our approach first tests if epimutations violates or not the infinite site assumptions. If less than 1% of sites with their methymation state annotated are polymorphic in a sequence we use the infinite site assumption: the site and region level epimutation rates can be recovered straight-forwardly from the observed diversity (<italic>θ<sub>W</sub></italic>, see above). Otherwise, a Baum-Welch algorithm is run to infer the most likely epimutation rates (site rate for SMP, and region rates for DMRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>].</p>

<title>Sequence data of Arabidopsis thaliana</title>
<p>We download genome and methylome data of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> from the 1001 genome project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. We select 10 individuals from the German accessions respectively corresponding to the accession numbers: 9783, 9794, 9808, 9809, 9810, 9811, 9812, 9816, 9813, 9814. We only keep methylome data in CG context and in genic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. The genic regions are based on the current reference genome TAIR 10.1. The SNPs and epimutations are called according to previously published pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. As in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], we assume <italic>A. thaliana</italic> data to be haploid due to high homozygosity (caused by high selfing rate). The resulting files are available on GitHub at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TPPSellinger">https://github.com/TPPSellinger</ext-link>. To perform analysis we chose <italic>µ</italic> = 6.95 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−9</sup> per generation per bp as the DNA mutation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] and <italic>r</italic> = 3.6 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−8</sup> as the recombination rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] per generation per bp. In order to have the most realistic model, we assume that the methylome of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> undergoes both region (RMM) and site (SMM) level epimutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. When fixed, we respectively set the site methylation and demethylation rate to <italic>µ<sub>SM</sub></italic> = 3.48 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−4</sup> and <italic>µ<sub>SU</sub></italic> = 1.47 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−3</sup> per generation per bp according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. We additionally set the region level methylation and demethylation rate to <italic>µ<sub>RM</sub></italic> = 1.6 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−4</sup> and <italic>µ<sub>RU</sub></italic> = 9.5 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−4</sup> per generation per bp according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Because we do not account for the effect of variable mutation or recombination rate along the genome, we cut the five chromosome of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> into eight smaller scaffolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. By doing this we remove centromeric regions and limit the effect the variation of mutation and recombination rate along the genome. The selected regions and the SNP density (from the German accessions) are represented in Supplementary Figures 11 to 15.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study advances existing approaches for demographic inference by incorporating rapidly mutating markers such as switches in methylation state. The authors provide a <bold>solid</bold> comparison of their approach to existing methods, although the work would benefit from some additional consideration of the challenges in the empirical use of methylation data. The work will be of broad interest to population geneticists, both in terms of the novel approach and the statistical inference proposed.</p>

<p>The authors developed an extension to the pairwise sequentially Markov coalecent model that allows to simultaneously analyze multiple types of polymorphism data. In this paper, they focus on SNPs and DNA methylation data. Since methylation markers mutate at a much faster rate than SNPs, this potentially gives the method better power to infer size history in the recent past. Additionally, they explored a model where there are both local and regional epimutational processes.</p>
<p>Integrating additional types of heritable markers into SMC is a nice idea which I like in principle. However, a major caveat to this approach seems to be a strong dependence on knowing the epimutation rate. In Fig. 6 it is seen that, when the epimutation rate is known, inferences do indeed look better; but this is not necessarily true when the rate is not known. A roughly similar pattern emerges in Supp. Figs. 4-7; in general, results when the rates have to be estimated don't seem that much better than when focusing on SNPs alone. This carries over to the real data analysis too: the interpretation in Fig. 7 appears to hinge on whether the rates are known or estimated, and the estimated rates differ by a large amount from earlier published ones.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting research direction, and I think the method may hold more promise as we get more and better epigenetic data, and in particular better knowledge of the epigenetic mutational process. At the same time, I would be careful about placing too much emphasis on new findings that emerge solely by switching to SNP+SMP analysis.</p>

<p>A limitation in using SNPs to understand recent histories of genomes is their low mutation frequency. Tellier et al. explore the possibility of adding hypermutable markers to SNP based methods for better resolution over short time frames. In particular, they hypothesize that epimutations (CG methylation and demethylation) could provide a useful marker for this purpose. Individual CGs in Arabidopsis tends to be either close to 100% methylated or close to 0%, and are inherited stably enough across generations that they can be treated as genetic markers. Small regions containing multiple CGs can also be treated as genetic markers based on their cumulative methylation level. In this manuscript, Tellier et al develop computational methods to use CG methylation as a hypermutable genetic marker and test them on theoretical and real data sets. They do this both for individual CGs and small regions. My review is limited to the simple question of whether using CG methylation for this purpose makes sense at a conceptual level, not at the level of evaluating specific details of the methods. I have a small concern in that it is not clear that CG methylation measurements are nearly as binary in other plants and other eukaryotes as they are in Arabidopsis. However, I see no reason why the concept of this work is not conceptually sound. Especially in the future as new sequencing technologies provide both base calling and methylating calling capabilities, using CG methylation in addition to SNPs could become a useful and feasible tool for population genetics in situations where SNPs are insufficient.</p>

<p>I very much like this approach and the idea of incorporating hypervariable markers. The method is intriguing, and the ability to e.g. estimate recombination rates, the size of DMRs, etc. is a really nice plus. I am not able to comment on the details of the statistical inference, but from what I can evaluate it seems sound and reasonable. This is an exciting new avenue for thinking about inference from genomic data. I have a few concerns about the presentation and then also questions about the use of empirical methylation data sets.</p>
<p>I think a more detailed description of demographic accuracy is warranted. For example, in L245 MSMC2 identifies the bottleneck (albeit smoothed) and only slightly overestimates recent size. In the same analysis the authors' approach with unknown mu infers a nonexistent population increase by an order of magnitude that is not mentioned.</p>
<p>Similarly, it seems problematic that (L556) the approach requiring estimation of site and region parameters (as would presumably be needed in most empirical systems like endangered nonmodel species mentioned in the introduction) does no better than using only SNPs. Overall, I think a more objective and perhaps quantitative comparison of approaches is warranted.</p>
<p>The authors simulate methylated markers at 2% (and in some places up to 20%). In many plant genomes a large proportion of cytosines are methylated (e.g. 70% in maize: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8496265/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8496265/</ext-link>). I don't know what % of these may be polymorphic, but this leads to an order of magnitude more methylated cytosines than there are SNPs. Couldn't this mean that any appreciable error in estimating methylation threatens to be of a similar order of magnitude to the SNP data? I would welcome the authors' thoughts here.</p>
<p>A few points of discussion about the biology of methylation might be worth including. For example, methylation can differ among cell types or cells within a tissue, yet sequencing approaches evaluate a pool of cells. This results in a reasonable fraction of sites having methylation rates not clearly 0 or 1. How does this variation affect the method? Similarly, while the authors cite literature about the stable inheritance of methylation, a sentence or so more about the time scale over which this occurs would be helpful. Finally, in some species methylated cytosines have mutation rates an order of magnitude higher than other nucleotides. The authors mention they assume independence, but how would violation of this assumption affect their inference?</p>
