<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The fact that objects without proper support will fall to the ground is not only a natural phenomenon, but also common sense in mind. Previous studies suggest that humans may infer objects’ stability through a world model that performs mental simulations with <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of gravity acting upon the objects. Here we measured participants’ sensitivity to gravity’s direction, the most critical parameter of gravity in stability inference, to investigate how the world model works. We found that the world model was not a faithful replica of Newton’s law of gravity but rather encoded gravity’s direction as a Gaussian distribution, with the vertical direction as the maximum likelihood. The world model with this stochastic feature fit nicely with participants’ subjective sense of objects’ stability and explained the illusion that taller objects are perceived as more likely to fall. Furthermore, a computational model with reinforcement learning revealed that the stochastic feature likely originated from agent-environment interaction, and computer simulations illustrated the ecological advantage of the stochastic over deterministic representation of gravity’s direction in balancing accuracy and speed for efficient stability inference. In summary, the stochastic world model on gravity provides an example of how <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of the physical world is implemented in the brain that helps humans operate flexibly in open-ended environments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>About two thousand years ago, Confucius warned his disciples that a wise man should not stand next to a collapsing wall. We, wise or not, can easily judge whether a wall is stable or collapsing in a fraction of a second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kubricht et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">McCloskey, 1983</xref>). This astonishing performance is unlikely to have been achieved by previous visual experience alone. Taking a stack consisting of ten blocks as an example (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we can quickly report its stability with a satisfactory accuracy of 70% on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bear et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), but the universal cardinality of possible configurations is at least 3.72×10<sup>19</sup> (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>), which is much larger than the total number of sand grains on Earth (est. 7.5×10<sup>18</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blatner, 2013</xref>). Contrary to this intuition, four-month-old infants, who have a little visual experience of the physical world, expect a box to fall if it loses contact with a support platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baillargeon, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">2004</xref>). Our minds may therefore have devised a mechanism that differs from the widely used discriminative approach in artificial neural networks, which relies on the extensive visual experience of objects and feedback about their stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bear et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, both behavioral and neuroimaging studies have suggested that humans possess <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of Newton’s law of physics in the mind. For example, infants as young as seven months expect a downward moving object to accelerate and an upward moving object to decelerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Friedman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kim &amp; Spelke, 1999</xref>), and adults can estimate the remaining time to catch a moving ball (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">McIntyre et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zago &amp; Lacquaniti, 2005</xref>) even in the absence of visual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lacquaniti &amp; Maioli, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zago et al., 2009</xref>). Further fMRI studies have revealed the parieto-insular vestibular cortex in the brain as the neural basis for gravity-based stability inference, suggesting that this knowledge is encapsulated as a cognitive module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Indovina et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pramod et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, our brain is proposed as a set of generative machines that actively predict future events of the ever-changing physical world through mental simulation with <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge acting upon the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hegarty, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Huang &amp; Rao, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tenenbaum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ullman et al., 2017</xref>). For this reason, the generative machine is also called the world model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Land, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tenenbaum et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, the idea of the world model has become popular to explain the predictive nature of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Friston et al., 2021</xref>) and to improve the generality and robustness of the artificial neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Matsuo et al., 2022</xref>). However, how <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge is implemented in the world model remains to be determined. A widely adopted but not rigorously tested assumption is that the world model in the brain is a faithful replica of the physical laws of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lake et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). For example, the direction of gravity encoded in the world model, which is the most critical parameter for stability inference, is assumed to be straightly downward, the same as the direction of gravity in the physical world. Alternatively, there is a consensus that the brain actively correlates, integrates, and comprehends the data from sensory organs (e.g., electromagnetic waves from the eyes) and adds meaning to them (i.e., color). Therefore, the representation of the world in the brain may not be the same as reality. Here, we investigated these two alternative hypotheses for the construction of the world model in the brain by examining how gravity’s direction was represented in the world model when participants judged the stability of objects.</p>
<p>To do this, we measured participants’ sensitivity to gravity’s direction in a stability inference task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>) and found that gravity’s direction was encoded in a Gaussian distribution, with the vertical direction as the maximum likelihood. This stochastic parameter was then built into the world model to simulate the displacement of blocks in a stack under the force of gravity, and the simulation result fits nicely with participants’ judgment of stacks’ stability and explained the daily illusion that taller objects are perceived as more like to fall. A computational model with a reinforcement learning algorithm was devised to reveal its origin through interactions with the physical world. Finally, we explored the ecological advantage of the stochastic feature of the world model.</p>

<title>The direction of gravity in the world model</title>
<p>The direction of gravity is perpendicular to the ground surface. Here, we first tested humans’ sensitivity to gravity’s direction to investigate how faithfully our gravity is represented in the world model compared to gravity in the physical world. To do this, we used Pybullet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Coumans &amp; Bai, 2016</xref>), a forward physics simulator, to manipulate gravity’s direction. Then, we asked the participants to judge whether the collapse trajectories of unstable stacks were normal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>, Supplementary Movie S1). The direction of simulated gravity was measured by a parameter pair (<italic>θ</italic>, <italic>φ</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>), which determines the deviation of the direction of simulated gravity from the direction of gravity in the physical world. Specifically, <italic>θ</italic> is the vertical component of the direction that affects the degree of collapse, and <italic>φ</italic> is the horizontal component that determines the orientation of collapse. We collected participants’ judgment of the normality of collapse trajectories while varying <italic>θ</italic> from 0 to 45° and <italic>φ</italic> from 0° to 360° across the force space, and the normality ratio of the judgment for each angle pair was used to index participants’ sensitivity to gravity’s direction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). As expected, when <italic>θ</italic> is equal to 0 (i.e., the direction of the simulated gravity is the direction of the natural gravity), the participants were likely to report that the collapse trajectory was normal (accuracy: 91.0%, STD: 8.0%). Then, the critical question is how participants’ subjective sense about the normality of collapse trajectories changes as a function of <italic>θ</italic>. If our world model on gravity is a faithful replica of the physical reality, we should expect the immediate detection of abnormality when <italic>θ</italic> is away from 0.</p>

</fig>
<p>Contrary to this intuition, the subjective sense of the abnormality was not immediately apparent as <italic>θ</italic> moved away from 0; instead, the rate of reporting normality of collapse trajectories decreased gradually as a function of <italic>θ</italic>, which was the best fit by a Gaussian function with <italic>σ</italic> = 19.9 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> left). That is, the participants were 50.9% confident in reporting a normal collapse trajectory when the vertical offset of <italic>θ</italic> was 19.9°. In addition, accuracy in detecting the abnormality was not affected by <italic>φ</italic> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>), consistent with the uniformly distributed gravitational field in the physical world. This pattern was observed for all participants tested, with <italic>σ</italic> varying from 11.1 to 37.1 (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, the world model on gravity is unlikely to be a faithful replica of the physical world; instead, it encodes gravity’s direction as a Gaussian distribution with the vertical direction as the maximum likelihood (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref> right).</p>
<p>To further test whether the world model on gravity, once established, is encapsulated from visual experience and task context, we inverted the virtual environment upside down with gravity’s direction pointing upward, and then asked the same group of participants to judge whether collapse trajectories were normal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1e</xref>, see Supplementary Movie S2). We found that the normality ratio also decreased gradually as a function of <italic>θ</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, <italic>σ</italic> = 17.2; Extended Data <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> for each participant), which was not significantly different from that in the environment with gravity pointing downward. Indeed, each participant’s <italic>σ</italic> in the upright condition was in high agreement with the <italic>σ</italic> in the upside-down condition (r = 0.91, p &lt; 0.01). That is, the visual experience and task context apparently did not cognitively penetrate humans’ world model on gravity, suggesting that it is likely encapsulated as a cognitive module.</p>
<p>How does the stochastic gravity’s direction in the world model affect our inference on objects’ stability? To answer this question, we recruited an independent group of participants to estimate the stability of 60 stacks of different configurations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>), half of which were stable. During the experiment, the participants were required to judge how stable each stack was on a 0-7 scale without feedback, which was used to index their subjective sense about stacks’ stability. Two world models were constructed for comparison. One world model was equipped with a vertically downward direction of gravity without any stochastic variance. This deterministic model is intended to simulate how the stacks fell in the real world, and is therefore called a natural gravity simulator (NGS) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref> top). The other model is the same as the NGS, except that the deterministic direction of gravity in the NGS was replaced by the stochastic direction obtained from the previous psychophysical experiment. This model is thus called the mental gravity simulator (MGS, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref> top). Both models were used to quantify the degree of stability by measuring the proportion of unmoved blocks after the collapse, where the proportion of unmoved blocks after the simulation was used to estimate the stability of the stacks.</p>

</fig>
<p>NGS-estimated stability was significantly correlated with participants’ subjective sense (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref> bottom; r = 0.70, p &lt; 0.01), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>). However, the participants were more inclined to judge stacks as more likely to collapse, as the dots in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref> are more concentrated on the lower side of the diagonal line. This phenomenon is referred to as the inference bias, which was indexed as the difference in stability estimates between the participants and the NGS (inference bias = −0.31, p &lt; 0.01) (see Methods). In other words, the participants were unlikely to infer stacks’ stability from simulations with a deterministic direction of gravity pointing vertically downward. In contrast, the MGS randomly sampled pairs of (<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>) from the Gaussian distribution as gravity’s directions 100 times, and the estimated stability of a stack was the averaged stability of simulations with different angle pairs. Aside from a similar magnitude of the correlation in the stability estimates between the participants and the MGS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref> bottom; r = 0.75, p &lt; 0.01), the MGS, unlike the NGS, perfectly captured participants’ judgment of stability because the points were evenly distributed along the diagonal line (inference bias = 0.04, p &gt; 0.05; see <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref> for the agreement when the MGS was implemented with different Gaussian functions). In other words, the magnitude of the correlation coefficients is not the only indicator to evaluate the model’s fitness. In short, the world model that represents gravity’s direction as a Gaussian distribution around the vertical direction properly explains our tendency to judge stacks as more prone to collapse.</p>
<p>The stochastic world model illustrated by the MGS that led to participants’ inference bias may explain the daily illusion that we perceive taller objects to be more unstable than shorter ones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d</xref> left). An intuitive explanation from physics is that a tall object has a higher center of gravity, and thus an external perturbation makes it more likely to collapse. Our stochastic world model, on the other hand, provides an alternative explanation without introducing external perturbations, simply because deviations from gravity’s veridical direction are likely to accumulate with the height of the objects. To test this conjecture, we constructed a set of stacks with different heights, and estimated the degree of stacks’ stability with the MGS and the NGS, respectively. Because the MGS was considered to be the world model implemented in the brain, the inference bias here was calculated as the difference in stability estimates between the MGS and the NGS, with negative values indicating a tendency to judge a stable stack as an unstable one. Consistent with the inference bias found in humans, the MGS found stacks of all heights to be more prone to collapse (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d</xref> right; inference bias &lt; 0, p &lt; 0.01 for all heights). Critically, the bias increased monotonically with increasing height, consistent with the illusion that taller objects are considered more prone to collapse (see <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref> for the inference bias when the MGS was equipped with different levels of deviation). In short, the stochastic world model on gravity provides a more concise explanation for the daily illusion that taller objects are perceived as more likely to collapse, without assuming external perturbations.</p>

<title>The origin of the stochastic feature of the world model</title>
<p>A deterministic model that combines gravity’s veridical direction with external perturbations, such as an external force or perceptual uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lake et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Smith &amp; Vul, 2013</xref>), is theoretically equivalent to our stochastic model that represents gravity’s direction in a Gaussian distribution; therefore, it also fits well with humans’ inference on stability by fine-tuning the parameters of external perturbations. Although both the cognitive impenetrability and the self-consistency without resorting to an external perturbation found in our study favor the stochastic model over the deterministic one, more direct evidence comes from the origin of the stochastic feature of the world model.</p>
<p>Because our intelligence emerges and evolves under the constraints of the physical world, the stochastic feature may emerge as a biological agent interacts with the environment, where the mismatches between external feedback from the environment and internal expectations from the world model are in turn used to fine-tune the world model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Friston et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">MacKay, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Matsuo et al., 2022</xref>). To simulate this process, here we designed a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to model this interactive process to illustrate how the world model on gravity evolves (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). Specifically, an agent perceived a stack in the environment, which was then acted upon by a simulated gravity with direction parameters (i.e., <italic>θ</italic> and <italic>φ</italic>) sampled from a spherical direction space. The initial probabilities for the sampling directions were identical (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>, left). The final state of the stack served as the agent’s expectation under the effect of the simulated gravity. The mismatch between the expectation and the observed final state of the stack under the natural gravity was used to update the sampling probability of the direction space, with a larger discrepancy leading to a larger decrease in probabilities through RL. Within this RL framework, we constructed 100,000 stacks of 2 to 15 blocks to train the world model on gravity. As the training progressed, the probabilities of the direction space gradually converged downward (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>, middle; see <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref> for the training trajectory). Although gravity’s direction in the environment was vertical, the distribution of updated probabilities in the direction space was gradational (<italic>σ</italic> = 21.6; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>, right), which is close to gravity’s direction represented in the world model derived from the psychophysics experiment on human participants. Therefore, the world model representing gravity’s direction in a Gaussian distribution can emerge automatically as the agent interacts with the environment, without the need for any external perturbation.</p>

<p>To further illustrate the idea that the environment constrains the form of intelligence, we systematically manipulated the appearance of the physical world while holding the natural gravity constant. Specifically, we constructed 14 worlds, each containing stacks of the same number of blocks, but with different configurations. The number of blocks ranged from 2 to 15. We trained the world model on gravity under the same RL framework for each world, and found that all world models represented gravity’s direction in a Gaussian distribution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref> left; see <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref> for all world models). However, the width of the distribution, indexed by the parameter of <italic>σ</italic>, decreased monotonically as the number of blocks increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref> right). This phenomenon was shown because in general stacks containing more blocks were more likely to be affected by forces whose directions were not perpendicular to the ground surface, which provided more information about gravity, and thus resulted in a more accurate representation of gravity’s direction in the world model. In short, the world model on gravity resonates with not only the physical law governing the environment, but also the specific regularities of the environment the agent encountered.</p>

<title>The ecological advantage of the stochastic world model</title>
<p>When passing a cliff face, we have to be constantly aware of the stability of the rocks on the cliff. The ideal response would be both accurate and fast, but accuracy and speed are often difficult to achieve simultaneously. Here we investigated how the world model on gravity balances these two factors with its stochastic feature. To answer this question, we used a linear classifier (i.e., logistic regression) to model humans’ decision-making behavior at different stages of the mental simulation. Specifically, we collected all the position coordinates of a stack’s blocks at different stages of the simulation. The position difference between the intermediate states of the stack and the initial state provides information about the stability of the stack. For example, a stable stack should have no difference in the positions of the component blocks at all simulation stages, and an unstable stack should have a gradually increasing position difference. If the linear classifier detected the difference in positions sufficient for the classification at any stage, it classified the stack as unstable, otherwise stable (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>). The classification accuracy gradually increased as the simulation progressed until it reached the asymptote.</p>

</fig>
<p>As expected, for the NGS (i.e., the world model with the deterministic direction of gravity), the accuracy at the plateau was close to 100% (95.3% on average, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref> top red box), significantly higher than that for the MGS (80.1% on average, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref> top blue box) (t = 19.59, p&lt;0.001), simply because of the stochastic feature of gravity’s direction. However, the MGS reached the plateau of decision accuracy much faster than the NGS (response time, indexed by the ratio between the time to reach the plateau and the time to reach the final stage: 27.1% vs. 75.2%, t = 15.58, p &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref> middle). The same pattern was also observed with different variances of the Gaussian distribution (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). That is, the stochastic world model prioritized speed over accuracy, echoing the basic principle of survival: fleeing potential danger as quickly as possible, rather than making a perfect decision with a dreadful delay. In addition, by integrating the prediction accuracy and the response time as a measure of efficiency, we found that the stochastic world model provided a better balance between accuracy and speed, with an efficiency significantly higher than that provided by the NGS (3.49 vs. 1.32, t = 9.12, p &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref> bottom).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if time permits, multiple simulations with the MGS can significantly reduce the variance introduced by the stochastic representation of gravity’s direction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c</xref>). To explore whether humans adopted this strategy of performing multiple simulations before making a decision, we ran simulations with the MGS at different numbers of times and then matched them with humans’ performance. We found that the variance of humans’ inference on stability best matched that of the MGS after three simulations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d</xref>; see <xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref> for the model-behavior correspondence under different numbers of simulations). Therefore, humans are likely to run simulations a limited number of times to infer stacks’ stability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated how the physical law of gravity is embodied in the brain as a world model that guides inferences on objects’ stability. A series of psychophysics experiments showed that the world model on gravity is not a faithful replica of the physical world, but rather a stochastic model that captures the essence of the vertically downward direction of gravity as the maximum likelihood of a Gaussian distribution. The stochastic feature of the world model not only fits humans’ stability inference behavior better than the deterministic model, but also provides new insight into the daily illusion that taller objects are perceived as more likely to collapse. We further illustrated how the stochastic feature evolved through interactions with the environment using reinforcement learning, and well-balanced accuracy and speed to produce a unique ecological advantage for our survival in the physical world.</p>
<p>About 300 years ago, the philosopher Immanuel Kant proposed the intuition of space and time as <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge in the mind for us to understand the physical world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kant, 1781</xref>), but only until recently have researchers investigated how the intuition is implemented in the brain as intuitive physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kubricht et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">McCloskey, 1983</xref>). In the Noisy Newtonian Framework, intuitive physics is depicted as a combination of Newtonian physics and uncertainty generated by noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kubricht et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sanborn et al., 2013</xref>). The introduction of uncertainty helps to reconcile the misconception occurring under unfavorable conditions, such as unfamiliar events or static scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kaiser et al., 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kim &amp; Spelke, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">McCloskey, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Smith &amp; Vul, 2013</xref>), which was once thought to support Aristotelian physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">DiSessa, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Halloun &amp; Hestenes, 1985</xref>). The noise in previous studies was thought to originate from sources such as perceptual uncertainty or external perturbations of forces, rather than from the intuitive physical engine itself, which is thought to be a deterministic system. Our study extends these deterministic models by showing a stochastic world model that the noise instead came from the representation of gravity’s direction under Gaussian distribution. The inherent stochastic feature of gravity’s direction did not need to rely on external noise to explain the illusory instability of taller objects. In addition, it was also confirmed by the cognitive impenetrability of the Gaussian distribution of gravity’s direction when gravity’s direction in the physical world was reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pylyshyn, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>With a reinforcement learning framework, we further demonstrated a possible origin of the stochastic feature of the world model through interactions with the physical world. In contrast to summarizing statistical patterns from the experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bear et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), this framework was designed to simulate how an agent constructed the world model on gravity through agent-environment interactions. Specifically, a world model with undifferentiated directions of gravity generated a prediction on the stability of an object, and the mismatches between the prediction and the observation of the object from the physical world were used to fine-tune the distribution of the directions in the world model. This process is similar to how humans update their internal knowledge by comparing simulated expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hegarty, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ullman et al., 2017</xref>) with actual observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baillargeon, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kotovsky &amp; Baillargeon, 2000</xref>). After several generations of error minimization, a Gaussian distribution of gravity’s direction with the vertically downward direction as the maximum likelihood was similar to that observed in the human world model. Interestingly, when the physical worlds that the agent interacted with changed their appearance with stacks of different heights, the world models maintained their general patterns, but the stochastic representation of gravity’s direction changed accordingly. This finding not only demonstrates the robustness of the active inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hegarty, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ullman et al., 2017</xref>), which efficiently encodes critical features under different physical worlds, but also resonates with the idea that intelligence develops under the constraints of the physical world. Taken together, the finding from the RL framework implies that the world model on gravity in humans may also be constructed in the same way, possibly through the mechanism of the predictive coding in a generative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Friston, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Huang &amp; Rao, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Our world model on gravity provides an example of the world model theory that emphasizes the predictive nature of generative neural networks implemented with <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of the physical world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Friston et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Land, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Matsuo et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast to traditional discriminative neural networks that learn statistical patterns for stability from gigantic amounts of labeled stacks, generative models equipped with the physics laws governing the physical world rely much less on experience. Importantly, the stochastic feature of the model further enhances the efficiency by balancing accuracy and speed, which improves our chances of better survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 1997</xref>) and adaptation to novel environments (e.g., astronauts in outer space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wang et al., 2022</xref>)). Indeed, the close link between human cognition and the physical world through interaction may shed light on the development of a new generation of AI with human-like intelligence that can work flexibly in open-ended environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Marcus, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Creating stacks with different configurations</title>
<p>We designed a block-stacking procedure in a physical simulation platform (PyBullet) to generate stacks with different configurations. All stacks used in this study were generated using this procedure with the same parameters listed below.</p>
<p>The block-stacking procedure includes three steps (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>): (1) defining the designated area, (2) stacking blocks, and (3) fine-tuning block positions. The first step is to designate a restricted place area. All blocks of a stack were required to place within the designated area. The designated area controls the aggregation level of blocks, with a small area clustering blocks closer than a large area. The designated area is determined by two horizontal parameters <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>, which separately represent the size of the area in two horizontal directions. Therefore, when the block number is fixed, a smaller area in general constructs a higher stack. After designating the area, in step two we stacked blocks in random horizontal positions within the area one by one. If no block was positioned under a new block, the new block would be directly placed on the ground; otherwise, it would stack on the positioned block. The horizontal position of each block was independently sampled from a uniform distribution, with lower and upper bounds being -<italic>x</italic> and +<italic>x</italic>, or -<italic>y</italic> and +<italic>y</italic> separately (<italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> were all independently sampled from a uniform distribution <italic>U</italic>(0.2, 2.0)). The first two steps allow us to generate a large number of configurations within the designated area, which is the only restriction of the block-stacking procedure. To better control the physical stability of each stack, in step three we fine-tuned blocks in the stack by adjusting overlaps between every neighboring one, which was randomly sampled from a uniform distribution <italic>U</italic>(0.2, 0.8). Smaller overlap between neighboring blocks is more likely to construct unstable stacks, whereas more extensive overlap results in more stable stacks. The overlap of neighboring blocks without contact is set to 0. Note that the overlap between neighboring blocks is not the only factor determining a stack’s stability, and step three is used to generate stacks without consuming too many computational resources.</p>
<p>The size of each block has a 3D aspect ratio of 3:1:1 (length: width: height), with an arbitrary unit of 1.2:0.4:0.4. This constitutes three types of blocks (length, width, or height is 1.2, respectively, see <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Each block of a stack was randomly selected as one of the three types of blocks. The mass of each block is set to 0.2 kg, and the friction coefficients and the coefficients of restitution between blocks are set to 1 and 0, respectively.</p>

<title>Estimating the stability of a stack</title>
<p>The stability of a stack was obtained by a rigid-body forward simulation under the natural gravity environment (i.e., natural gravity simulator, NGS). The direction of the natural gravity points downward (i.e., <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="522364v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>), and all blocks of a stack are affected by the same gravity. Gravity is the only factor for changing the state of each block, and no external force is added during the simulation. Within each simulation, we recorded 500 simulation stages. In each stage, the center position of each block was collected to measure the stability of the stack. If the position of any block does not change during the simulation, the stack is considered stable, otherwise unstable. We formulate the stack’s state according to the below criteria:

<title>Measuring participants’ sensitivity to gravity’s direction</title>
<p>We decomposed gravity’s direction into three independent components (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>).

<p>Where g is the magnitude of gravity (g = 9.8), which was fixed in this study. <italic>θ</italic> represents the vertical component, <italic>φ</italic> represents the horizontal component, and x, y, and z are three mutually perpendicular axes. The direction of the gravity was determined by the angle pair (<italic>θ</italic>, <italic>φ</italic>), where <italic>θ</italic> affects the extent of the collapse, and <italic>φ</italic> affects the orientation of the collapse. When <italic>θ</italic> is 0, gravity’s direction is vertical.</p>
<p>We performed a psychophysics experiment to measure humans’ sensitivity to gravity’s direction. In this experiment, 10 participants (5 female, age range: 21-28) from Tsinghua University were recruited to finish four runs of the behavioral experiment, which measured their ability to detect the abnormality of stacks’ collapse trajectories. The experiment was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Tsinghua University, and informed consent was obtained from all participants before the experiment.</p>
<p>The collapse trajectory of a stack was solely determined by gravity with different directions, where larger values of <italic>θ</italic> and <italic>φ</italic> made the trajectories more abnormal. A pilot experiment showed that almost all <italic>θ</italic><sub>s</sub> greater than 45 degrees made the collapse trajectory abnormal to most participants, and therefore in the experiment, <italic>θ</italic> ranges from 0 to 45 degrees with a step of 3 degrees. <italic>φ</italic> ranges from 0 to 360 degrees with a step of 24 degrees. Therefore, <italic>θ</italic> and <italic>φ</italic> consists of 16 values, respectively, which were randomly combined into 96 pairs of (<italic>θ</italic>, <italic>φ</italic>) with each value repeating 6 times in each run. In a trial, an unstable stack was constructed, and then the camera rotated one circle to show the 3D configuration of the stack to participants (Supplementary Movie S1). The configuration was randomly selected from a dataset with more than 2,000 unstable stacks, which was generated with the block-stacking procedure before the experiment. Each stack in the database was constructed with 10 blocks, and the color of each block was randomly rendered. There was a 1-sec delay after the rotation, during which the participants were instructed to infer the collapse trajectory based on the configuration. Then, simulated gravity with a direction determined by an angle pair (<italic>θ</italic>, <italic>φ</italic>) was applied to the stack, and the stack started to collapse. If the collapse trajectory met participants’ expectations, they were instructed to choose ‘Normal,’ otherwise ‘Abnormal’. Once the judgment was made, the subsequent trial started immediately. Each trial lasts about 10 seconds, taking 16 minutes for a run.</p>
<p>In addition, to test if participants’ sensitivity to gravity’s direction is encapsulated from visual experience and task context, we flipped gravity’s direction upside down by inverting the camera’s view, and the rest procedure remained the same.</p>
<p>To calculate participants’ sensitivity to gravity’s direction, we converted their behavioral judgment into normality ratio, which is the percentage that a trajectory was judged as normal, which was calculated as below:

Because the angle pairs tested were a subset of all possible angle pairs, we used the average ratio along <italic>φ</italic> as the ratio of angle pairs untested (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) to acquire each participant’s tuning curve. Finally, we calculated participants’ sensitivity by fitting their normality ratios at different <italic>θ</italic> to a Gaussian distribution.

<title>Measuring participants’ ability on stability inference</title>
<p>Another group of 11 participants (5 female, age range: 21-32) from Tsinghua University completed a behavioral experiment for judging the stability of 60 stacks. The experiment was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Tsinghua University, and informed consent was obtained from all participants before the experiment. One male participant (age: 25) was excluded from further analyses because his judgment showed an extremely weak correlation with the actual stability of stacks (r<sub>s</sub> &lt; 0.30 for all experimental runs), as compared to the rest of the participants.</p>
<p>The stacks contained 26 unstable and 34 stable stacks, which were randomly interleaved in each run. The participants were instructed to judge stacks’ stability on an 8-point Likert scale, with 0 referring to ‘definitely unstable’ and 7 to ‘definitely stable.’ There was no feedback after each judgment. The participants completed six runs, within which the same group of stacks was presented but the sequence, blocks’ colors, and camera’s perspective were all randomized. After the experiment, only two participants reported that they suspected a few stacks were repeated in different runs, but they could not locate the stacks they suspected. Besides, their behavioral performance was not significantly different from other participants.</p>
<p>Participants’ stability judgment was rescaled to 0 and 1 to match the scale of the stacks’ stability. The participants’ inference bias (IB) was indexed as the difference in stability judgment between the participants and the NGS, shown as

The distribution was the average of two distributions acquired from the real world (i.e., gravity’s direction is downward) and the inverted world (the direction is upward), with angles having larger normality ratios more likely being sampled. We then applied the simulated gravity with these sampled directions to the stack, and used the averaged stability with these directions as the stability of the stack estimated by the MGS. Similar to the IB between the participants and the NGS, the IB between the MGS and NGS was calculated as

<p>Stacks of different heights were created to investigate whether the stochastic world model on gravity results in the illusion that tall objects are considered less stable than short ones. The height of a stack was correlated with the size of the designated area, with a smaller area size corresponding to taller stacks. Therefore, we designated several square areas with different sizes. The side length of the squares ranged from 0.2 to 2.0, with an increase of 0.1. For each square, we used the block-stacking procedure to generate 100 stable and 100 unstable stacks consisting of 10 blocks. The height of each stack was the height of the highest block.</p>

<title>Investigating the origin of the stochastic world model on gravity</title>
<p>A reinforcement learning (RL) framework was used to simulate the development of the stochastic nature of the world model on gravity.

We optimized the sampling probability of gravity’s direction by comparing the estimated stability (i.e., expectation) with the actual stability (i.e., observation) as a Q value, with a higher Q value suggesting that the sampled gravity’s direction more likely mismatched the actual gravity’s direction.

<title>Evaluating the ecological advantage of the model</title>
<p>To investigate how the world model on gravity balances response accuracy and speed, we trained a linear classifier (i.e., logistic regression) to model humans’ decision-making process at different simulation stages. During the simulation, the same stack was separately simulated using the NGS and MGS, and we collected the position coordinates of all blocks at each stage. Differences in the positions of the blocks between the intermediate stage and the initial stage provided information about the stability of a stack, with more displaced blocks suggesting the lower stack’s stability. As the simulation proceeded, differences in position gradually accumulated for unstable stacks, otherwise unchanged for stable stacks. The linear classifier was trained to judge whether a stack is stable with differences in position as inputs.</p>
<p>We used the block-stacking procedure to create stacks consisting of 2 to 10 blocks, and estimated their stabilities with the NGS for simulation in 500 stages. For each block number, there were 100 stable and 100 unstable stacks to train the linear classifier, and its prediction accuracy was measured with another group of 100 stable and 100 unstable stacks at every simulation stage.</p>
<p>The difference in positions of each block between the intermediate and initial stages was used as the input of the linear classifier. Specifically, we collected all vertex positions of a block during the simulation to acquire the difference in position, which included 8 coordinate points for each block in each stage. We did not collect the central position as previously used in the stability estimation, simply because it did not provide information on the shape and size of the block. We separately performed the simulation using the MGS and NGS, calculated the difference in position between the intermediate stage and the initial stage, and then flattened the difference to generate 24 position features for each block (i.e., eight positions per block in three-dimensional space). Therefore, for a 10-block stack as an example, there were 240 position features were prepared as the input of the linear classifier.</p>
<p>Prediction accuracy at each stage was estimated by evaluating whether a stack tested was stable with the MGS or with the NGS. The highest accuracy in the whole simulation stages was used as the prediction accuracy. Accordingly, the first simulation stage to reach the maximum accuracy provided information on response speed: reaching the maximum accuracy with a smaller number of stages indicates the classifier model accomplishes stability inference in a shorter amount of time (i.e., quick response). Therefore, we measured the response speed by estimating the steps to reach the accuracy plateau.

Higher values indicate longer response time (i.e., slower response). Finally, the efficiency of the stability inference, which is the balance between accuracy and speed, by dividing the prediction accuracy by the response time.

<p>a) Illustration of the block-stacking procedure to create stacks in different configurations. A configuration was constructed by placing multiple blocks within a designated area.

Note that in small areas, the height of stacks was taller. d) The lower bound of configurations’ possible number showed an exponential relation with the number of blocks in a stack. The procedure can create at least 3.72 × 10<sup>19</sup> configurations for stacks consisting of 10 blocks. See the appendix for the estimation.</p></caption>

<title>Estimate the lower bound of the possible number of configurations</title>
<p>A configuration is a structure composed of several contact blocks. To simplify the computation of estimating the number of possible configurations, here we constrained the shape of blocks and the position where the blocks were placed.</p>
<p><italic><bold>The shape constraint</bold>: the blocks used to form a configuration are all uniform rectangular blocks with the same aspect ratio.</italic></p>
<p><italic><bold>The position constraint</bold>: only one block is allowed to be placed on the same layer of the configuration</italic>.</p>
<p>Thus, the problem is then simplified to estimate the possible number of configurations when only one rectangular block with the aspect ratio of <italic>α</italic>: <italic>β</italic>: <italic>γ</italic> (i.e., <bold>the shape constraint</bold>) is allowed to place in one layer (i.e., <bold>the position constraint</bold>). Note that the constraints significantly reduce the number of estimated configurations.</p>
<p>We illustrated our solution by starting with a simple case: the aspect ratio of blocks is <italic>α</italic>: <italic>α</italic>: <italic>α</italic>.</p>

<title>The condition when the aspect ratio of blocks is <italic>α</italic>: <italic>α</italic>: <italic>α</italic></title>
<p>The block with the aspect ratio of <italic>α</italic>: <italic>α</italic>: <italic>α</italic> is a cube (Appendix <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). The side length of the cube is defined as <italic>α</italic>. Consider a configuration with two stacking blocks, the upper block needs to be placed in a 3<italic>α</italic> × 3<italic>α</italic> area to ensure contact with the bottom block (Appendix <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). To estimate the possible number of this simple situation, we defined a visual acuity <italic>υ</italic>, which is the minimum resolution to distinguish two stacks (i.e., j.n.d.). Note that <italic>υ</italic> is a small value and here we set it as <italic>υ</italic> = 0.01 to match the minimal position difference for stability estimation in the simulation platform (please see Methods). Therefore, the possible number of the configuration containing two cubic blocks is

<p>Where <italic>N</italic><sub>C2</sub> indicates the possible number of configurations containing two cubic blocks.</p>
<p>We further consider the situation with more cubic blocks. For a stack that contains three cubic blocks, it can be viewed as placing a cubic block on a two-block stack (Appendix <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). Therefore, the total possible number of configurations is the multiplication of two two-block configurations, which is formulated as

<p>This paper presents a set of experiments designed to test whether gravity in people's intuitive physics engine is implemented as a simple deterministic representation of gravity or as a Gaussian distribution. The work shows experimentally that the probabilistic representation of gravity does a better job at capturing both human judgments, including biases in stability inferences. The work further shows that Gaussian representations of gravity can evolve in a simple agent-environment reinforcement learning problem setup.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The paper approaches the problem from three different angles in an impressive way. The first is through a direct comparison of human judgments against model predictions. The second is through an analysis of whether the model correctly predicts cognitive illusions. The third is through a computational exploration of how these representations emerge in a reinforcement-learning setup. The idea of approaching the same problem from multiple independent angles, and seeking confirming evidence is laudable.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are two differences between the &quot;natural gravity&quot; account and the &quot;mental gravity&quot; account. The first difference lies in the implementation of gravity. The second, however, is simply that the mental gravity model is integrating more uncertainty into the simulator. In my understanding, adding small amounts of noise to computational models will often increase their fit to human judgments (with softmaxing perhaps being the most common example of this). While counter-intuitive, this is because 'noiseless' models have perfect representations of the stimuli, which is an unrealistic assumption. In the case of intuitive physics, people might have noisy perceptual representations of exactly how flat the table is, the exact location of each block, what small disturbances might be happening in the environment, and so on. The absence of these sources of uncertainty in deterministic models can make them perform in a non-human-like manner.</p>
<p>While all the data presented in the paper is consistent with the possibility that people have a stochastic representation of gravity. It is possible that people have uncertainty over what unobservable forces a block tower might be under (e.g., wind, bumps to the table, etc). Therefore, even if you have a firm belief that gravity goes down, you may want to add noise in your simulations to account for the fact that, in the real world, gravity is almost never the only force acting on an object that has started to move. While the paper acknowledges that such an account would be mathematically equivalent, it does not acknowledge that this raises the question of whether people actually have stochastic representations of gravity.</p>
<p>This alternative account could be particularly important because I believe it might be a more accurate representation of what people believe. I may be wrong, but I believe that it is common to emphasize the probabilistic nature of the models and the importance of implementing forces as distributions (e.g., the concept of 'noisy newtons').</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Through a set of experiments and model simulations, the authors tested whether the commonly assumed world model of gravity was a faithful replica of the physical world. They found that participants did not model gravity as a single, fixed vector for gravity but instead as a distribution of possible vectors. Surprisingly, the width of this distribution was quite large (~20 degrees). While previous accounts had suggested that this uncertainty was due to perceptual noise or an inferred external perturbation, the authors suggest that this uncertainty simply arises from a noisy distribution of the representation of gravity's direction. A reinforcement learning model with an initial uniform distribution for gravity's direction ultimately converged to a precision in the same order as the human participants, which lends support to the authors' conclusion and suggests that this distribution is learned through experience. What's more, further simulations suggest that representing gravity with such a wide distribution may balance speed and accuracy, providing a potentially normative explanation for the world model with gravity as a distribution.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors present surprising findings in a relatively straightforward way in a now classic experimental task. They provide a normative explanation based on a resource-rational framework for why people may have a stochastic world model instead of a deterministic world model.</p>

Support for gravity being represented as a Gaussian distribution (stochastic world model), as opposed to perceptual uncertainty or (inferred) external perturbations, is from an RL model simulation. It would be more convincing if the authors could experimentally demonstrate that potential external perturbations did not affect the distribution of gravity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Previous studies suggest that humans may infer objects' stability through a world model that performs mental simulations with a priori knowledge of gravity acting upon objects. In this study, the authors test two alternative hypotheses about the nature of this a priori knowledge. According to the Natural Gravity assumption, the direction of gravity encoded in this world model is straight downwards as in the physical world. According to the alternative Mental Gravity assumption, that gravity direction is encoded in a Gaussian distribution, with the vertical direction as the maximum likelihood. They present two experiments and computer simulations as evidence in support of the Mental Gravity assumption. Their conclusion is that when the brain is tasked to determine the stability of a given structure it runs a mental simulation, termed Mental Gravity Simulation, which averages the estimated temporal evolutions of that structure arising from different gravity directions sampled from a Gaussian distribution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
In spite of the fact that the Mental Gravity Simulation (MGS) seems to predict the data of the two experiments, it is an untenable hypothesis. I give the main reason for this conclusion by illustrating a simple thought experiment. Suppose you ask subjects to determine whether a single block (like those used in the simulations) is about to fall. We can think of blocks of varying heights. No matter how tall a block is, if it is standing on a horizontal surface it will not fall until some external perturbation disturbs its equilibrium. I am confident that most human observers would predict this outcome as well. However, the MSG simulation would not produce this outcome. Instead, it would predict a non-zero probability of the block to tip over. A gravitational field that is not perpendicular to the base has the equivalent effect of a horizontal force applied on the block at the height corresponding to the vertical position of the center of gravity. Depending on the friction determined by the contact between the base of the block and the surface where it stands there is a critical height where any horizontal force being applied would cause the block to fall while pivoting about one of the edges at the base (the one opposite to where the force has been applied). This critical height depends on both the size of the base and the friction coefficient. For short objects this critical height is larger than the height of the object, so that object would not fall. But for taller blocks, this is not the case. Indeed, the taller the block the smaller the deviation from a vertical gravitational field is needed for a fall to be expected. The discrepancy between this prediction and the most likely outcome of the simple experiment I have just outlined makes the MSG model implausible. Note also that a gravitational field that is not perpendicular to the ground surface is equivalent to the force field experienced by the block while standing on an inclined plane. For small friction values, the block is expected to slide down the incline, therefore another prediction of this MSG model is that when we observe an object on a surface exerting negligible friction (think of a puck on ice) we should expect that object to spontaneously move. But of course, we don't, as we do not expect tall objects that are standing to suddenly fall if left unperturbed. In summary, a stochastic world model cannot explain these simple observations.</p>
<p>The question remains as to how we can interpret the empirical data from the two experiments and their agreement with the predictions of the stochastic world model if we assume that the brain has internalized a vertical gravitational field. First, we need to look more closely at the questions posed to the subjects in the two experiments. In the first experiment, subjects are asked about how &quot;normal&quot; a fall of a block construction looks. Subjects seem to accept 50% of the time a fall is normal when the gravitational field is about 20 deg away from the vertical direction. The authors conclude that according to the brain, such an unusual gravitational field is possible. However, there are alternative explanations for these findings that do not require a perceptual error in the estimation of the direction of gravity. There are several aspects of the scene that may be misjudged by the observer. First, the 3D interpretation of the scene and the 3D motion of the objects can be inaccurate. Indeed, the simulation of a normal fall uploaded by the authors seems to show objects falling in a much weaker gravitational field than the one on Earth since the blocks seem to fall in &quot;slow motion&quot;. This is probably because the perceived height of the structure is much smaller than the simulated height. In general, there are even more severe biases affecting the perception of 3D structures that depend on many factors, for instance, the viewpoint. Second, the distribution of weight among the objects and the friction coefficients acting between the surfaces are also unknown parameters. In other words, there are several parameters that depend on the viewing conditions and material composition of the blocks that are unknown and need to be estimated. The authors assume that these parameters are derived accurately and only that assumption allows them to attribute the observed biases to an error in the estimate of the gravitational field. Of course, if the direction of gravity is the only parameter allowed to vary freely then it is no surprise that it explains the results. Instead, a simulation with a titled angle of gravity may give rise to a display that is interpreted as rendering a vertical gravitational field while other parameters are misperceived. Moreover, there is an additional factor that is intentionally dismissed by the authors that is a possible cause of the fall of a stack of cubes: an external force. Stacks that are initially standing should not fall all of a sudden unless some unwanted force is applied to the construction. For instance, a sudden gust of wind would create a force field on a stack that is equivalent to that produced by a tilted gravitational field. Such an explanation would easily apply to the findings of the second experiment. In that experiment subjects are explicitly asked if a stack of blocks looks &quot;stable&quot;. This is an ambiguous question because the stability of a structure is always judged by imagining what would happen to the structure if an external perturbation is applied. The right question should be: &quot;do you think this structure would fall if unperturbed&quot;. However, if stability is judged in the face of possible external perturbations then a tall structure would certainly be judged as less stable than a short structure occupying the same ground area. This is what the authors find. What they consider as a bias (tall structures are perceived as less stable than short structures) is instead a wrong interpretation of the mental process that determines stability. If subjects are asked the question &quot;Is it going to fall?&quot; then tall stacks of sound structure would be judged as stable as short stacks, just more precarious.</p>
<p>The RL model used as a proof of concept for how the brain may build a stochastic prior for the direction of gravity is based on very strong and unverified assumptions. The first assumption is that the brain already knows about the force of gravity, but it lacks knowledge of the direction of this force of gravity. The second assumption is that before learning the brain knows the effect of a gravitational field on a stack of blocks. How can the brain simulate the effect of a non-vertical gravitational field on a structure if it has never observed such an event? The third assumption is that from the visual input, the brain is able to figure out the exact 3D coordinates of the blocks. This has been proven to be untrue in a large number of studies. Given these assumptions and the fact that the only parameters the RL model modifies through learning specify the direction of gravity, I am not surprised that the model produces the desired results.</p>
<p>Finally, the argument that the MGS is more efficient than the NGS model is based on an incorrect analysis of the results of the simulation. It is true that 80% accuracy is reached faster by the MGS model than the 95% accuracy level is reached by the NGS model. But the question is: how fast does the NGS model reach 80% accuracy (before reaching the plateau)?</p>

<p>We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for the reviewers’ scholarly and insightful reviews of our manuscript. The constructive comments and thought-provoking experimental proposals have been invaluable not only in improving the quality of this study but also in shaping the direction of future research. In revision, all comments will be addressed point-by-point, and the manuscript will be revised thoroughly. Here in this reply, we focus on the most critical issue regarding the source of noises during stability inference.</p>
<p>When faced a stack of objects, individuals are more likely to assess taller stacks of objects as being more unstable compared to shorter ones (Fig. 2b &amp; 2d). This bias persists even when comparing single objects of different heights that share the same contact area with the supporting surface. Known as “stability inference bias,” this phenomenon challenges deterministic models with a single, fixed vector for the representation of gravity’s direction (i.e., directly downward). To reconcile this bias with deterministic models, previous studies (e.g., Allen et al., 2020; Battaglia et al., 2013; Kubricht et al., 2017) have incorporated external noises such as perceptual uncertainty and external force perturbations to increase their fit to human performance, also pointed out by Reviewer 1.</p>
<p>In this study, we introduced an alternative perspective through a stochastic model in which variability is instead embedded in the representation of gravity’s direction. In this framework, gravity’s direction is not a fixed vector but a distribution of possible vectors, with the vertical direction serving as the maximum likelihood. While the distinction between deterministic and stochastic models is conceptually clear, mathematically they are equivalent. In addition, our stochastic model does not negate the role of external noises in stability inference, because gravity is seldom the sole force acting upon a moving object in the physical world, as pointed out by Reviewer 1. Together, these two factors make it challenging to ascribe the source of variability to either external or internal noises (Smith &amp; Vul, 2013). This is the major concern raised by all three reviewers.</p>
<p>To distinguish between the deterministic and stochastic models, we designed a series of experiments aimed at demonstrating that internal noises, rather than external noises such as perceptual uncertainty or external force perturbations, influences our inference about object stability. However, the supporting evidence was dispersed and at times implicit throughout the manuscript. In revision, we will thoroughly clarify the ambiguities. In this reply, we will consolidate and present the evidence comprehensively.</p>
<p><bold>1.    The examination of external noises.</bold></p>
<p>1.1 External Force Perturbations. Deterministic models suggests that during object stability inference, individuals implicitly assume the presence of external forces (e.g., wind) that could destabilize stacks. While this assumption aligns with the omnipresence of such forces in natural settings, it overlooks a crucial variable: the directionality of these external forces. In psychological studies, individual differences are commonly observed, and the perceived force direction is not an exception. That is, some may assume that it comes from the left, while others from the right. In essence, if external forces were to play a significant role in stability inference, one would expect the perceived force directions to exhibit non-uniform distributions (i.e., anisotropy) in the horizontal plane within individuals and to show substantial variability between individuals.</p>
<p>Contrary to this expectation, our study revealed a different pattern. In the study, we specifically measured the distribution of 𝜑, the horizontal component reflecting the direction of object collapse. Our results indicated that all participants exhibited a uniform distribution of gravity’s directions in the horizontal plane (Fig. 1d right; Extended Data Fig. 2 and 3). This uniformity suggests that if external forces were a key determinant in stability inference, participants would have to assume a varying direction of external force in each trial—an assumption we consider unlikely. Instead, our RL model simulation suggests that the isotropy of 𝜑 arises from agent-environment interactions, notably in the absence of external forces (Extended Data Fig. 6).</p>
<p>In summary, the uniform distribution of horizontal direction component, 𝜑, observed in all participants, challenges the argument for the dominant role of external forces in stability inference. We are sorry that this aspect was not explicitly emphasized in the original text, and in revision we will explain why external forces are unlikely to substantially shape our perception of object stability.</p>
<p>1.2 Perceptual uncertainty. To assess the impact of perceptual uncertainty on stability inference, we examined whether the representation of gravity’s direction is cognitive impenetrable. Specifically, we posited that if noises are external (i.e., perceptual uncertainty), the inference bias should be modulated by task context; in contrast, if noises are internal, the stochastic representation of gravity’s direction will be encapsulated from the context. To test this idea, we inverted the virtual environment, making gravity appear to point upward (also see a similar idea by Reviewer 3). In this unfamiliar context, which diverges dramatically from daily experiences, one would expect heightened perceptual uncertainty, which according to deterministic models would result in a larger inference bias – manifested as an increased width of the distribution (𝜎) of gravity’s direction. Contrary to this prediction, we observed that the width of the distribution remained unchanged (Fig. 1d and 1f). Furthermore, there was a high correlation (r = 0.91) between widths in the upright and inverted conditions across participants (Extended Data Fig. 2 and 3).</p>
<p>In summary, this finding suggests that the manipulation of perceptual uncertainty is unable to cognitively penetrate the representation of gravity’s direction, casting doubt on its dominant role in stability inference. We are sorry that in the original text, we did not clarify the rationale for employing the approach of cognitive impenetrability. In revision, this will be clarified.</p>
<p><bold>2.    The origin of intrinsic noises in stability inference.</bold></p>
<p>In deterministic models, either external force perturbations or perceptual uncertainty is often assumed but rarely empirically tested. Indeed, these external noises are introduced primarily to account for observed biases in stability inference. In this study, we explicitly examined the possible origin of the intrinsic noises embedded in the representation of gravity’s direction. Without assumed perceptual uncertainty and external perturbation of forces, the RL model simulation showed that the distribution could evolve naturally based mainly on the agent’s experience, as it used the mismatch between the expectation and the observed state of the stack under natural gravity to update its representation of gravity’s direction (Fig. 3a). Importantly, the width of the distribution for the agent was comparable to that of human participants as measured in the psychophysics experiments (Fig. 3b). Therefore, the experience alone may be sufficient to generate stochastic representation of gravity’s direction, obviating the need for external noises.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings underscore the limitations of the combination of deterministic models and external noises in accounting for stability inference, and suggest that intrinsic noises embedded in the representation of gravity play a pivotal role in shaping our stability inference of the physical world.</p>
<p><bold>3. Thought experiments.</bold></p>
<p>Although the evidence shown above may provide valuable insights, our study does not definitively settle the debate between deterministic models and our proposed stochastic model. Specifically, our study only preliminarily investigates two sources of external noise, perceptual uncertainty and external force perturbations, leaving many other factors such as object mass and surface friction, unexplored (for studies on these factors, please see Hamrick et al., 2016). As such, the reviewers have proposed a series of thought experiments that warrant further investigation. Below, we enumerate some of them, followed by ours.</p>
<p>3.1 Experiment 1. Reviewer 3 proposed a thought experiment in which participants assess stability of a single block of varying heights. The reviewer argues that a block, regardless of its height, will remain stable on a horizontal surface unless externally disturbed. This assertion is perfectly true in the physical realm. However, in the cognitive domain, both deterministic models and our stochastic model predict differently. Take an extreme example of a standing needle: while it would remain upright in the physical world without external disturbances, both deterministic and stochastic models, which account for mental inference of physical events, will predict a likelihood of it falling, aligning with our subjective feelings. This is because in both models, noises are considered in the intuitive physics engine. In deterministic models, external force perturbations, as well as perceptual uncertainty, are assumed to be omnipresent noises in probabilistic reasoning. In our stochastic model, noises are embedded in the representation of gravity’s direction. Therefore, although this thought experiment, along with other thought experiments on object mass, surface friction (proposed by Reviewer 3), and falling trajectories behind an occlude (proposed by Reviewer 1), is insightful, but it cannot serve to differentiate deterministic and stochastic models.
3.2 Experiment 2. Reviewer 2 suggested constructing a wall on one side of the virtual scene to make it improbable that participants would infer an external force perturbation emanating from that direction. In this setting, deterministic models would predict a non-uniform distribution of the horizontal component, 𝜑, skewed away from the wall. In contrast, according to our stochastic model, the distribution of 𝜑 would remain unaffected, maintaining the uniform distribution observed in previous experiments. Extending this logic, another test scenario could contrast an indoor scene with an outdoor scene. In a confined and static indoor environment, the likelihood of external force perturbations should be much lower than in a dynamic, open outdoor setting. Here, deterministic models would predict an increase in the width of the distribution, 𝜎, in the outdoor environment, whereas our model would anticipate no such change. The underlying rationale for these experiments parallels that of our previous setup (figure 1e), where we inverted the virtual environment and reversed the direction of gravity. Indeed, they all aim to assess the extent to which manipulations of external factors can cognitively penetrate the representation of gravity’s direction.</p>
<p>3.3 Experiment 3: A noteworthy insight derived from our RL model simulation relates to variations in the number of blocks within the virtual worlds. Deterministic models would predict an enlarged bias in stability inference as the number of blocks increased, which is attributed to elevated levels of perceptual uncertainty and an expanded area susceptible to external force perturbations. However, the results from our RL model simulation contradict this prediction, revealing that an augmented number of blocks instead led to a narrowing of the width of the distribution. This decrease in width can be ascribed to richer information provided by a larger number of blocks for refining its representation of gravity’s direction. In line with this rationale, we propose a new experiment from the perspective of ecological psychology, which emphasizes that cognitive processes are shaped by our interactions with the environment. Specifically, we hypothesize that individuals raised in mountainous terrains may exhibit more accurate representations of gravity’s direction than those raised in flat terrains. This proposed experiment could not only help resolving the ongoing debate between two models to some extent, but also advocate future studies on intuitive physics within a more ecologically valid framework.</p>
<p>To conclude, both deterministic and stochastic models align closely with Bayesian principles, where stability inference is conceptualized as probabilistic reasoning. Nevertheless, the divergence between them is no trivial, as it hinges on distinct philosophical assumptions about the relationship between the inner mind and the external world. Deterministic models propose that the mind serves as a faithful reflection of the world; therefore, gravity’s direction is represented as a single, fixed vector directly downward, the same as that in the world. In these models, uncertainty for probabilistic reasoning emanates from factors external to the module of the intuitive physics engine. In contrast, our stochastic model underscores the notion that the mind is an active inference machine, continually reinterpreting inputs from outside world; therefore, the mind gains increased adaptability, allowing for a more nuanced accounting of uncertainty in the world – factors often crucial for survival. Such active inference necessitates flexible representations; accordingly, within the model of intuitive physics engine, variations are embedded into the representation of gravity’s direction. While resolving this philosophical debate is beyond the capacity of the present study, we contend that the field of intuitive physics offers a valuable lens through which to pry open the complex interplay between the mind and the world we live in.</p>
