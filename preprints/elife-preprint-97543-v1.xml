<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In contrast to mammalian cells, bacterial cells lack mRNA polyadenylated tails, presenting a hurdle in isolating mRNA amidst the prevalent rRNA during single-cell RNA-seq. This study introduces a novel method, Ribosomal RNA-derived cDNA Depletion (RiboD), seamlessly integrated into the PETRI-seq technique, yielding RiboD-PETRI. This innovative approach offers a cost-effective, equipment-free, and high-throughput solution for bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing. By efficiently eliminating rRNA reads and substantially enhancing mRNA detection rates (up to 92%), our method enables precise exploration of bacterial population heterogeneity. Applying RiboD-PETRI to investigate biofilm heterogeneity, distinctive subpopulations marked by unique genes within biofilms were successfully identified. Notably, Pdel, a marker for the cell-surface attachment subpopulation, was observed to elevate cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) levels, promoting persister cell formation. Thus, we address a persistent challenge in bacterial single-cell RNA-seq regarding rRNA abundance, exemplifying the utility of this method in exploring biofilm heterogeneity. These findings advance our understanding of biofilm biology and offer insights for targeted therapeutic strategies against persistent bacterial infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biofilms, comprising approximately 80% of chronic and recurrent microbial infections in the human body, contain bacterial cells existing in a diverse array of physiological states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. This diversity in states reflects a division of labor within the biofilm, contributing to increased resistance to various stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. However, the study of biofilms faces significant limitations, primarily stemming from challenges in investigating heterogeneity within a bacterial population. Single-cell RNA-seq emerges as a promising avenue for addressing this <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Expending on established protocols for cell fixation and permeabilization which facilitate in-cell barcoding while avoiding cell lysis, combinatorial barcoding-based bacterial scRNA-seq techniques, such as Prokaryotic Expression profiling by Tagging RNA in situ and sequencing (PETRI-seq) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and Microbial Split-Pool Ligation Transcriptomics (microSPLiT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, have been developed. Nevertheless, these methods encounter challenges in terms of low transcript recovery rates due to overwhelmingly abundant rRNA, restricting the comprehensive analysis of within-population heterogeneity. In comparison to mammalian cells, the absence of mRNA polyadenylated tails in bacteria necessitates an alternative approach for isolating mRNA (~5%) from the significantly more abundant rRNA (~95%). Here, by integrating a Ribosomal RNA derived cDNA Depletion protocol (RiboD) into a PETRI-seq, we developed RiboD-PETRI-seq that efficiently eliminates rRNA reads, thereby significantly improving mRNA detection rates and enabling exploration of within-population heterogeneity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In the RiboD protocol, we designed a set of probe primers that spans all regions of the bacterial rRNA sequence. The 3’-end of the probes is specifically complementary to the rRNA-derived cDNA, while the 5’- end complements a biotin-labeled universal primer. Following template switching and RNaseH treatment on the barcoded cDNA from lysed cells to eliminate hybridized RNA, the library of probe primers and biotin-labeled universal primers is introduced to facilitate adequate hybridization. Pre-treated Streptavidin magnetic beads are then added to eliminate the hybridized rRNA-derived cDNA. The mRNA-derived cDNA remains in the supernatant and is collected for subsequent library construction and sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The Multiplet frequency of this method is 1.16% – 3.35%, demonstrating the ability of RiboD-PETRI to capture transcriptomes of single cells (SI)7.</p>

<p>To assess the performance of RiboD-PETRI, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of rRNA depletion efficiency across gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species. The results highlight a substantial enhancement in rRNA-derived cDNA depletion, with mRNA ratio increases from 8.2% to 81% for <italic>E. coli</italic> from exponential phase, from 10% to 92% for <italic>S. aureus f</italic>rom stationary phase, and from 3.9% to 54% for <italic>C. crescentus</italic> from exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). With equivalent sequencing depth, RiboD-PETRI demonstrates a significantly enhanced Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) counts detection rate compared PETRI-seq alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>), indicating the number of detected mRNA per cell increased prominently. Notably, this enhancement was achieved while maintaining mRNA profiles consistent with non-depleted samples (r = 0.93; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>) and show a significant correlation with profiles from the traditional bulk RNA-seq method (r = 0.84; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>We subsequently investigated the transcriptome coverage of RiboD-PETRI across different bacterial species. For exponential phase <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, we sequenced a library with 60,000 cells, recovering approximately 30,004 cells (50% recovery), each with ≥15 UMIs. Analysis revealed 99.86% gene expression collectively and an average of 128.8 UMIs per single cell. Top 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 high-quality cells showed averages of 462, 259, and 193 detected UMIs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>). For stationary phase <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells, we sequenced a library with 30,000 cells, recovering approximately 9,982 cells (33.3% recovery), each with ≥15 UMIs. Analysis showed 99.96% gene expression collectively, and at the single-cell level, an average of 153.8 UMIs. Top 1,000, 5,000, and 8,000 high-quality cells exhibited averages of 273, 122, and 94 detected UMIs, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A</xref>). In the exponential phase of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells, a library with 30,000 cells was sequenced, recovering approximately13,897 cells (46.3% recovery), each with &gt;15 UMIs. Analysis showed 99.64% gene expression collectively, and at the singlecell level, an average of 439.7 UMIs. Top 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 high-quality cells demonstrated averages of 2190, 662, and 225 detected UMIs, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs1">Fig. S1F</xref>). This performance surpassed other reported bacterial scRNA-seq methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Considering that this large library was sequenced with 1,508 reads per cell for <italic>E. coli,</italic> 2,372 for <italic>S. aureus,</italic> and 8,790 for <italic>C. crescentus,</italic> it is anticipated that a higher number of UMIs per cell will be detected with increased sequencing depth.</p>
<p>Our results affirm RiboD-PETRI’s reliability in capturing the bacterial single-cell transcriptome, providing ample coverage and sensitivity for various species. We investigated its ability to consistently identify within-population heterogeneity across different bacterial species and growth conditions. In the exponential phase of <italic>E. coli,</italic> we recovered 1,464 cells and identified three major subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref>), with 17 cells (1.2%) in a unique subpopulation characterized by pentose and glucuronate interconversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1H, I</xref>). For stationary phase <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells, we recovered 9,386 cells and found six major subpopulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs1">Fig. S1D</xref>), with 437 cells (4.7%) in a distinct subpopulation named cluster 4. In the stationary phase of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells, we recovered 5728 cells and identified four major subpopulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs1">Fig. S1I</xref>), with 603 cells (10.5%) in a unique subpopulation named cluster 3. These findings highlight RiboD-PETRI’s consistent ability to unveil within-population heterogeneity, crucial for understanding bacterial population complexity.</p>
<p>We next focused on exploring biological heterogeneity of a biofilm at the early stage of development by utilizing the static biofilm system14. <italic>E. coli c</italic>ells were cultured in microtiter dishes overnight, adhered cells were fixed for RiboD-PETRI processing in duplicate experiments, each consisting of 1621 or 3999 cells. No significant batch effect was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs2">Fig. S2C, H</xref>). Replicate 1 was sequenced 1,563 reads per cell, while replicate 2 with 2,034 reads per cell, yielding an average of 283/239 UMIs per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Unsupervised clustering analysis identified four major subpopulations in each replicate, with a consistently identified rare subpopulation (2.6%/2.1%) as cluster 2, driven by cell envelope genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B, D</xref>). Marker genes for this cluster included <italic>yffO, lptE, rdgB, pdel, sstT, fixA, yjjG, rlml , yncD, accC</italic>and <italic>yaiA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C, E, F</xref>). PdeI, identified among marker genes, was predicted as a phosphodiesterase enzyme hydrolyzing c-di-GMP, a vital bacterial second messenger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G, H</xref>). To validate this, we created a Pdel-BFP fusion construct under the native pdeI promoter, integrated with a ratiometric c-di-GMP sensing system in <italic>E. coli.</italic> Confocal microscopy revealed PdeI as a membrane protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2I</xref>). Single-cell level monitoring showed cell-to-cell variability in c-di-GMP levels and PdeI expression, with a positive correlation observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2J</xref>). PdeI upregulated c-di-GMP synthesis rather than degradation, confirmed by both microscopy and HPLC LC-MS/MS, which showed an approximately elevenfold increase in c-di-GMP concentration in the PdeI overexpression strain compared to the control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2K</xref>).</p>

<p>Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed that PdeI-positive cells, exhibiting elevated c-di-GMP levels, were predominantly located at the bottom of the static biofilm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2L</xref>), corresponding to the region of cell-surface attachment. To investigate the association of the PdeI-high cluster with bacterial persistence in the early stage of biofilm development, PdeI-high cells were isolated by fluorescence- activated cell sorting (FACS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2M, N</xref>) and subjected to an ampicillin antibiotic killing assay to determine their persister frequency. Results show that the PdeI-high population produced a significant higher ratio of persister cells (~7.3%) compared to that of the whole biofilm population (~0.6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2O</xref>). Time-lapse imaging during the antibiotic killing process consistently revealed that persisters mainly originated from PdeI-GFP positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2P</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="v1">Movie S1</xref>). PdeI-GFP positive cells, displaying dormancy, survived ampicillin treatment for 6 hours without growth or division. Upon antibiotic removal and replacement with fresh growth medium, the PdeI-GFP positive persister cells resumed activity, elongating, dividing, and forming new microcolonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2P</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="v1">Movie S1</xref>). These findings suggest that c-di-GMP,a molecule whose intracellular levels are upregulated by PdeI, plays a significant role in generating a persister subpopulation during the early stages of biofilm development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In conclusion, we report an improved approach, called RiboD-PETRI, which offers a cost-effective ($0.0049 per cell in RiboD-PETRI, and $0.056 per cell in PETRI-seq), equipment-free, and high-throughput solution for bacterial scRNA-seq. By integrating a probe hybridization-based rRNA derived cDNA depletion protocol, our method efficiently removes rRNA reads and significantly enhances mRNA detection rates. This improvement enables us to explore and analyze within-population heterogeneity. One important advantage of RiboD is the depletion process takes place at the cDNA level, following cell pooling and lysis. Consequently, RiboD only requires customization in the library preparation step. By implementing RiboD, we effectively reduce the necessary sequencing depth and overall sequencing costs, making it an attractive option for cost-conscious researchers. Beyond serving as a proof of principle, our study exemplifies the application of RiboD-PETRI to investigate the heterogeneity within biofilms, specifically delving into the early stages of biofilm development. This showcases the versatility and efficacy of RiboD-PETRI in exploring complex biological systems. The ability to uncover hidden variations within bacterial populations, as demonstrated in our biofilm analysis, underlines the potential impact of RiboDPETRI on advancing our understanding of microbial behavior and population dynamics.</p>

<title>Strains construction</title>
<p>The construction of recombinant plasmids was performed using the 2 × MultiF Seamless Assembly Mix (ABclonal, RK21020). To label the Pdel gene, pdel, along with its native promoter, was fused with either gfp or bfp and cloned into the pBAD backbone. For gene overexpression, the target genes of interest were cloned into either a p15A ori plasmid or a pUC ori plasmid, under the control of the Arabinose-induction system. For the c-di-GMP sensor (Snapgene: #182291), the plasmid origin was replaced with the p15A ori.</p>

<title>Single-Cell Analysis</title>
<p>The sequencing data underwent processing into matrices using scripts and a pipeline as previously described7 in Python 2.7.15, with some modifications (the detailed original code and all the data were deposited in the GEO repository). After the count tables were made, subsequent analysis of single-cell data was conducted using Seurat package (version 4.3.0; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://satijalab.org/seurat/">http://satijalab.org/seurat/</ext-link>) in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). Since there are two replicates of <italic>E coli</italic> static biofilm, these two datas need to be merged into one SeuratObject and removed batch effects. However, the samples for exponential period <italic>E. coli, S. aureus</italic> and <italic>C. crescentus</italic> only had one sample, so they did not need this process. At the beginning of doing the scRNA-seq analysis, we screened the datas of all samples. For preprocessing of <italic>E coli</italic> static biofilm data, cells were filtered with UMI per cell more than 100 and less than 2000 for replicate 1 and replicate 2 to obtain 1621 and 3999 cells, respectively. For exponential period <italic>E coli</italic> data. The data was screened for cells with UMIs greater than 200 and less than 5000 to obtain 1464 cells. The screening criteria of <italic>S. aureus</italic> were cells with UMIs greater than 15 and less than 1000 and genes greater than 30 (1000&gt;UMIs&gt;15, gene counts&gt;30). The screening criteria of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> were cells with UMIs greater than 200 and less than 5000 and gene counts greater than 30 (5000&gt;UMIs&gt;200, gene counts&gt;30). After screening, all the datas were normalized using a scale factor of 10000 through a global-scaling normalization method called “LogNormalize”. Highly variable features were then identified, returning 500 features per dataset. Then we combine the data of the two replicates of <italic>E coli</italic> static biofilm into a single SeuratObject by FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions. Then all the datas underwent scaling using the ScaleData function, followed by dimension reduction through principal component analysis. After principal component analysis, we removed batch effect by RunHarmony of the two replicates of <italic>E coli</italic> static biofilm datas. Then a graph-based clustering approach was employed in all datas to identify clusters of gene expression programs using the Louvain algorithm (Seurat 4.3.0). The dims we choosed were 6. And the resolution was 0.3 for <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> or 0.4 for <italic>E coli</italic> datas. Marker genes for each cluster were computed using the Wilcoxon Ranksum test. Specifically, marker genes for each cluster were initially obtained using the FindMarkers function of Seurat.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Yan and colleagues introduce a modification to the previously published PETRI-seq bacterial single-cell protocol to include a ribosomal depletion step based on a DNA probe set that selectively hybridizes with ribosome-derived (rRNA) cDNA fragments. They show that their modification of the PETRI-seq protocol increases the fraction of informative non-rRNA reads from ~4-10% to 54-92%. The authors apply their protocol to investigating heterogeneity in a biofilm model of E. coli, and convincingly show how their technology can detect minority subpopulations within a complex community.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The method the authors propose is a straightforward and inexpensive modification of an established split-pool single-cell RNA-seq protocol that greatly increases its utility, and should be of interest to a wide community working in the field of bacterial single-cell RNA-seq.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is written in a very compressed style and many technical details of the evaluations conducted are unclear and processed data has not been made available for evaluation, limiting the ability of the reader to independently judge the merits of the method.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work introduces a new method of depleting the ribosomal reads from the single-cell RNA sequencing library prepared with one of the prokaryotic scRNA-seq techniques, PETRI-seq. The advance is very useful since it allows broader access to the technology by lowering the cost of sequencing. It also allows more transcript recovery with fewer sequencing reads. The authors demonstrate the utility and performance of the method for three different model species and find a subpopulation of cells in the E.coli biofilm that express a protein, PdeI, which causes elevated c-di-GMP levels. These cells were shown to be in a state that promotes persister formation in response to ampicillin treatment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The introduced rRNA depletion method is highly efficient, with the depletion for E.coli resulting in over 90% of reads containing mRNA. The method is ready to use with existing PETRI-seq libraries which is a large advantage, given that no other rRNA depletion methods were published for split-pool bacterial scRNA-seq methods. Therefore, the value of the method for the field is high. There is also evidence that a small number of cells at the bottom of a static biofilm express PdeI which is causing the elevated c-di-GMP levels that are associated with persister formation. Given that PdeI is a phosphodiesterase, which is supposed to promote hydrolysis of c-di-GMP, this finding is unexpected.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>With the descriptions and writing of the manuscript, it is hard to place the findings about the PdeI into existing context (i.e. it is well known that c-di-GMP is involved in biofilm development and is heterogeneously distributed in several species' biofilms; it is also known that E.coli diesterases regulate this second messenger, i.e. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/jb.00604-15">https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/jb.00604-15</ext-link>).</p>
<p>
There is also no explanation for the apparently contradictory upregulation of c-di-GMP in cells expressing higher PdeI levels. Perhaps the examination of the rest of the genes in cluster 2 of the biofilm sample could be useful to explain the observed association.</p>

<p>Thank you for your thoughtful and constructive review of our manuscript. We are pleased that the reviewer recognizes the value and efficiency of our rRNA depletion method for PETRI-seq, as well as its potential impact on the field. We would like to address the points raised by the reviewer and provide additional context and clarification regarding the function of PdeI in c-di-GMP regulation.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that c-di-GMP’s role in biofilm development and its heterogeneous distribution in bacterial biofilms are well studied. We appreciate the reviewer's observation regarding the seemingly contradictory relationship between increased PdeI expression and elevated c-di-GMP levels. This is indeed an intriguing finding that warrants further explanation.</p>
<p>PdeI was predicted to be a phosphodiesterase responsible for c-di-GMP degradation. This prediction is based on sequence analysis where PdeI contains an intact EAL domain known for degrading c-di-GMP. However, it is noteworthy that PdeI also contains a divergent GGDEF domain, which is typically associated with c-di-GMP synthesis. This dual-domain architecture suggests a potential for complex regulatory roles. As reported, the knockout of the major phosphodiesterase PdeH in <italic>E. coli</italic> leads to the accumulation of c-di-GMP. Further, a point mutation on PdeI's divergent GGDEF domain (G412S) in this PdeH knockout strain resulted in decreased c-di-GMP levels, implying that the wild-type GGDEF domain in PdeI has a role in maintaining or increasing c-di-GMP levels in the cell. Additionally, PdeI contains a CHASE (cyclases/histidine kinase-associated sensory) domain. Combined with our experimental results demonstrating that PdeI is a membrane-associated protein, we predict that PdeI functions as a sensor that integrates environmental signals with c-di-GMP production under complex regulatory mechanisms. The experimental evidence, along with domain analysis, suggests that PdeI could contribute to c-di-GMP synthesis, rebutting the notion that it solely functions as a phosphodiesterase. Furthermore, our single-cell experiments showed a positive correlation between PdeI expression levels and c-di-GMP levels (Fig. 2J). HPLC LC-MS/MS analysis further confirmed that PdeI overexpression (induced by arabinose) upregulated c-di-GMP levels (Fig. 2K). Importantly, in our HPLC LC-MS/MS analysis, we compared the PdeI overexpression strain with the wild-type MG1655 strain, thereby excluding the influence of other genes in cluster 2. In summary, while PdeI is predicted to be a phosphodiesterase based on its sequence and the presence of an EAL domain, the additional presence of a divergent GGDEF domain and experimental evidence suggests that PdeI has a function in upregulating c-di-GMP levels. These findings support the hypothesis that PdeI may have both synthetic and regulatory roles in c-di-GMP metabolism.</p>
