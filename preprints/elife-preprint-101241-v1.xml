<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Bacterial regional demonstration after global dissemination is an essential pathway for selecting distinct finesses. However, the stepwise evolution of the resistome during the transition to endemicity remains unaddressed. Using the most comprehensive whole-genome sequencing dataset of <italic>Salmonella</italic> enterica serovar Gallinarum (<italic>S</italic>. Gallinarum) collected from 16 countries over the past century, we first elucidated the pathogen’s population structure. Subsequently, we revealed the international transmission and evolutionary history of <italic>S</italic>. Gallinarum to recent endemicity through phylogenetic analysis conducted within a spatiotemporal Bayesian framework. Our findings indicate that the independent acquisition of the resistome via the mobilome, primarily through plasmids, transposons, and prophages, shapes a unique antimicrobial resistance profile. By utilizing the pipeline we developed to investigate the frequency of horizontal resistome transfer, we identified a significantly higher rate of cross-region dissemination compared to localized propagation, highlighting the key role of the resistome in driving the transition and evolutionary history of <italic>S</italic>. Gallinarum. Collectively, this study elucidates resistome adaptation in the endemic transition of a single pathogen, providing valuable insights for targeted policy interventions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The acquisition of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by pathogens is well-established as one of the most serious threats of the 21st century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). It is estimated that over 10 million people could die per year due to AMR by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), collectively known as the resistome, play a pivotal role in AMR development, progression, and amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Pathogens typically acquire resistome through mobilomes, like plasmids, via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). From an evolutionary perspective, the dynamic change in the resistome is crucial for enhancing pathogen fitness and enabling it to colonize new ecological niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Key factors contributing to resistome alterations include targeted human interventions, climate change, and geographical selection forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Understanding the evolutionary trajectory of the AMR and related reservoirs is necessary, as disease management strategies will differ substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). However, knowledge regarding the overall profile of pathogen regional adaptation related to the stepwise dynamics of the resistome remains limited.</p>
<p>Before recent advancements in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technology, little was understood about resistome diversity that affects pathogen endemicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Traditional typing methods generally exhibit low resolution, making monitoring and quantitatively comparing horizontal ARG transfer events challenging. The scarcity of appropriate models also poses a limitation. <italic>Salmonella</italic>, a pathogen with strong geographical-related characteristics, has more than 90% serovars, frequently categorized as geo-serotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Among a few thousand geo-serotypes, <italic>Salmonella</italic> enterica serovar Gallinarum (<italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum) is an avian-specific agent, leading to horrific mortality rates that remain a disproportionate burden to the poultry industry in low- and middle-income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). As once a globally prevalent pathogen in the 20th century, <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum was listed by the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) and gradually became an endemic pathogen with sporadic outbreaks following the implementation of eradication programs in most high-income countries, making it a perfect model for study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>Nowadays, antimicrobial therapy is still used against <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The overuse or misuse of antimicrobials has led to increased epidemiological escalation of <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum, with a regionally higher risk of AMR, especially for sulfonamides, penicillin, and tetracyclines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). To fill the gaps in understanding the evolution of <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum under regional-associated AMR pressures and its adaptation to endemicity, we collected the most comprehensive set of 580 <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum isolates, covering the period from 1920 to 2023. Using WGS dataset we investigated: 1) the population structure and geographical transmission history of <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum at a single base level; 2) the dynamic resistome and mobilome changes that are associated with <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum transition to an endemic variant; and 3) horizontal resistome transfer frequency and pattern between distinct regions.</p>

<title>Global distribution of <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum links with distinct sublineages</title>
<p>To understand the global geographic distribution and genetic relationship of <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum, we assembled the most comprehensive <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum WGS dataset (n=580). The core genome SNPs (cgSNPs) were obtained by using the fully sequenced genome of <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum R51 as a reference. Recombination regions in the genome were eliminated, and through hierarchical Bayesian analysis of cgSNPs, it was confirmed that <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum divides into three biovars: bvSP (n=528/580, 91.03%), bvSG (n=50/580, 8.6%), and bvSD (n=2/580, 0.34%). An association was identified between the biovar type of <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum and its global geographic distribution. Most bvSP isolates were from Asia (436/528), with fewer occurrences in Europe (54/528), South America (12/528), and North America (5/528). In bvSG, South America (18/50, 36%) is the primary source of isolates, followed by North America (9/50, 18%), Europe (9/50, 18%), Africa (7/50, 14%), and Asia (3/50, 6%) (S1 Fig).</p>
<p>From a lineage perspective, bvSP can be further classified into five lineages: L1 (10/528), L2a (45/528), L2b (163/528), L3b (141/528), and L3c (169/528). Importantly, L3a, previously considered distinct, has been revealed as a sub-lineage of L3b. The predominant lineage types vary across different continents. Regarding predominant bvSP sources, Asia stands out, with L3c, L3b, and L2b being the main lineage types. On the other hand, L3c and L2a are more widespread in Europe and America, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). Notably, all bvSP isolates from Asia were exclusively found in China, which can be manually divided into three distinct regions (southern, eastern, and northern). Our findings indicate significant variations in bvSP across various regions from geo-temporal aspects. Prevalence was highest in the eastern region (233/436), with lower incidences in the northern (137/436) and southern regions (65/436). Interestingly, the predominant bvSP lineage type also varied. In eastern and southern China, L2b and L3b emerged as the predominant lineage types, while in northern China, L3b and L3c held nearly equivalent positions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>An analysis of the temporal prevalence of bvSP in China revealed a gradual replacement pattern of the lineages. Before the 2000s, the predominant lineage type was L3c. Then, from the 2000s to the 2010s, L3c and L1 were continually replaced by L3b, with L2b becoming the predominant lineage after the 2010s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). However, the replacement pattern varied among different regions. Specifically, the same pattern was observed in eastern China, but for northern and southern China, only replacements from L3c to L2b and L1 to L3b were observed (S2 Fig). These findings might indicate accelerated localized adaptation of bvSP.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Genomics portrait bvSP historic transmission</title>
<p>Considering the historical pandemic status of bvSP, we then investigated its global geographic transmission routes to understand its evolution into an endemic pathogen. L2b and L3c were selected as the dominant global lineage types, and a Bayesian model with a relaxed molecular clock was used to infer the evolutionary dynamics and historical transmission routes using the BEAST software (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The temporal structure was verified (S3 Fig), and our findings show that L2b emerged in China earlier than L3c, with potential spread from China to Europe as early as around the year 1800. Then, a long period of L2b spread internationally between South America and Europe was observed between 1800 and 1980. Notably, the L2b exhibited a return transmission from Europe to China around 1980, coinciding with the normalization of China-EU relations, as well as the timing of increased economic cooperation between China and Europe. In contrast, the historical transmission route for the L3c branch is more distinct, with L3c introduced to Europe from China around 1890 and reintroduced to China around 1910 (S4 Fig).</p>

<title>Endemic isolates further support localized dissemination pattern of bvSP</title>
<p>To investigate the dissemination pattern of bvSP in China, we obtained forty-five newly isolated bvSP from 734 samples (6.1% overall isolation rate) collected from diseased chickens at two farms in Yueqing and Taishun, Zhejiang Province. Those bvSP can be classified into two dominant sequence types (STs): ST3717 and ST92. Isolates from Yueqing were all identified as ST3717, while most Taishun isolates were characterized as ST92. Only the E404 isolate was identified as ST2151 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). Interestingly, a lineage-preferential distribution was also observed, with bvSP isolated from Taishun belonging to L3c and those from Yueqing belonging to L2b. To further understand the genetic relationship among isolates in the two regions, we calculated cgSNPs distances between isolates. Isolates with cgSNP distances less than 100 were determined as the threshold to be involved in the same transmission event. Interestingly, genetic clustering revealed that isolates from the same farm exhibited a significantly close genetic correlation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). No historical transmission events of bvSP were found between Taishun and Yueqing.</p>

<p>(a) The phylogenetic tree, constructed using cgSNPs, categorizes the 45 bvSP strains into two distinct lineages (L3c and L2b). The left side of the heatmap displays information on isolation regions, ST types, and sampling times, with various colours indicating different categories as specified on the left side of the heatmap. The right section of the heatmap presents a detailed matrix showing plasmids, ARGs, and cgSNP distances. The presence of a plasmid or ARGs in an isolate is denoted by gray shading, while absence is indicated by light white. In terms of cgSNP distances, darker circles signify a higher probability of transmission between isolate pairs. (b) The average cgSNP distance between bvSP from Taishun and Yueqing. E404 led to an increase in the mean cgSNP distance of bvSP from Taishun. (c) Invasiveness index of bvSP in Taishun and Yueqing. The results show a higher invasiveness index for bvSP isolated from Taishun, indicating that bvSP isolated from Taishun might have greater invasive capabilities among vulnerable hens.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="605275v1_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Other genetic characteristics also exhibited a similar pattern. The ARG and plasmid profile disclosed that <italic>IncFII(S)</italic> and <italic>ColpVC</italic> plasmids exhibited the highest carriage percentages (100%) among the 45 bvSP isolates. The <italic>IncX1</italic> plasmid was exclusively identified in the E404 isolate. Furthermore, E404 harboured two distinctive resistance genes, <italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM-1B</sub> and <italic>sul2</italic>, in contrast to the absence of ARGs in the remaining bvSP isolates. We also estimated the invasiveness index to assess the invasiveness of isolated bvSP and showed that bvSP from the same farm had comparable invasive abilities. However, isolates from Taishun demonstrated a higher invasive ability than those from Yueqing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we simulated potential transmission events between the bvSP strains isolated from Zhejiang Province and those from other provinces of China. As a result, the transmission events showed a strong geographic-preferential distribution. The number of transmission events decreased quickly with increasing distance, which provides additional support for bvSP in China belonging to a highly localized pathogen (S5 Fig).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Mobilome and resistome distinct lineage-preferential distribution in a regional manner</title>
<p>The mobilome drives partitions of the resistome and plays a pivotal role in shaping the ecological niches of bacteria. Therefore, a quantitative evaluation of the resistome and mobilome is necessary to enhance the understanding of the localized distribution of bvSP. For <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum, a total of 13 classes of ARGs, which can be further classified into six categories, were identified. The results revealed that bvSP exhibited a significantly greater resistome than bvSG and bvSD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>). Among them, <italic>sul2</italic> (196/528, 37.1%) has the highest prevalence, followed by <italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM-1B</sub> (183/528, 34.7%) and <italic>tet(A)</italic> (104/528, 19.7%). Moreover, the resistome also demonstrated a lineage-preferential distribution. We observed that L3b is more inclined to carry <italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM-1B</sub> and <italic>sul2</italic> than other lineages, whereas <italic>tet(A)</italic> exclusively exists within L3. The diversity of resistome carried by L3 may elevate the risk of multi-drug resistance (MDR). Notably, AMR risks vary among different regions of China, with the highest risk observed in southern China, followed by the northern and eastern regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>tet(A)</italic>, <italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM-1B</sub>, and <italic>sul2</italic> were predominant resistome types prevalent across all regions of China. Meanwhile, <italic>aadA5</italic> was typically more commonly found in southern China (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref>).</p>

<p>Four categories of the mobilome—prophage, plasmid, transposon, and integron—were characterized, revealing strong lineage-specific patterns (S6a Fig).

Interestingly, <italic>Salmon_SJ46, Gifsy_2</italic>, <italic>Escher_500465_2,</italic> and <italic>Shigel_SfIV</italic> were consistently observed across all bvSP lineages and were found to be duplicated on the chromosome.

<p>The diversity of transposons and integrons is comparatively lower in bvSP. Specifically, we identified seven types of transposons and four types of integrons. Transposons were found to be more abundant, comprising a total of 255 in 528 bvSP.

Interestingly, L3b is more likely to carry <italic>Tn801</italic> and <italic>Tn1721</italic> transposons than other lineages. In contrast, a total of 42 integrons were identified among the 528 bvSP, all of which belong to class I: <italic>In498</italic> (n=22), <italic>In1440</italic> (n=14), <italic>In473</italic> (n=4), and <italic>In282</italic> (n=2). The integrons also exhibited a lineage-preferential distribution, predominantly carried by L3c. From a geographic distribution perspective, bvSP from northern and southern China carried the most extensive mobilome, followed by those from eastern China.

<title>Plasmids and transposons guide resistome geo-temporal dissemination</title>
<p>Variations in regional antimicrobial use result in an uneven distribution of AMR risks. The mobilome is considered the primary reservoir for spreading resistome, and a consistent trend between the resistome and the mobilome has been observed across different lineages, from L1-L3c. We observed an overall gradual rise in the resistome quantity carried by bvSP across various lineages, correlating with the total mobilome content (S8 Fig). In more detail, both the resistome and mobilome exhibited a steady decline until the 1980s, followed by a consistent increase from the 1980s to the 2010s. However, after the 2010s, a subsequent decrease was identified. Consequently, we further investigated the interplay between mobilome and resistome in bvSP.</p>
<p>In bvSP, the predominant resistome is carried by the mobilome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>). Specifically, regarding <italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM_1B</sub>, <italic>tet(A)</italic>, and <italic>sul1</italic>, which are highly prevalent among bvSP, we found most <italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM_1B</sub> were carried by the transposon <italic>Tn801</italic> and <italic>Tn1721</italic>, the plasmid <italic>IncX1</italic>, and the prophage SJ46. Additionally, <italic>tet(A)</italic> was primarily associated with the transposon <italic>Tn1721</italic> and the plasmid IncX1. Integrons also facilitated the dissemination of the resistome. For instance, <italic>In498</italic> and <italic>In1440</italic> facilitate the dissemination of <italic>sul1</italic>, leading to quinolone resistance. Our results indicate that plasmids and transposons serve as the predominant reservoirs for the resistome in bvSP, with prophages and integrons following closely behind (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the primary reservoir for the resistome shows regional variations. In the southern and northern regions of China, the primary reservoirs for <italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM_1B</sub> are <italic>Tn801</italic>, <italic>Tn1721</italic>, <italic>IncX1</italic>, and prophage SJ46. However, <italic>Tn1721</italic> was less frequently found in bvSP, which carries <italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM-1B</sub> from the eastern region. Similarly, the reservoir for <italic>tet(A)</italic> exhibits greater diversity in the east region but less diversity in the southern region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c-e</xref>).</p>

<title>Horizontal transfer of resistome occurs widely in localized bvSP</title>
<p>Horizontal transfer of the resistome facilitates the acquisition of AMR among bacteria. Subsequently, we further investigated the HGT frequency of each ARG carried by bvSP isolated from China and explored the HGT frequency of resistome between various regions. Horizontal transfer of ARGs is defined as sequences with perfect identity (100% identity and 100% coverage) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Our findings indicate that horizontal transfer of the ARGs is widespread among Chinese isolates of bvSP. Specifically, 60% of the ARGs exhibited an HGT frequency of 100%, indicating that these ARGs had undergone horizontal transfer at least once (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>).

<p>However, different regions generally exhibited non-uniform resistome HGT frequency. Overall, bvSP from the southern region of China exhibited the highest HGT frequency (HGT frequency=97%). The HGT frequencies for bvSP within the eastern and northern regions of China are lower, at 91% and 90%, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). For specifically ARG type, we found <italic>tet(A)</italic> is more prone to horizontal transfer in the southern region, and this proportion was considerably lower in the eastern region. Interestingly, certain ARGs such as <italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM-116</sub> only undergo horizontal transfer within a single region of eastern China (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). Notably, as a localized transmission pathogen, resistome carried by bvSP exhibited a strong risk of cross-regional transmission, especially from northern region to southern region (HGT frequency=95%) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Over the past decades, the emergence of AMR has garnered significant attention from both public health agencies and the poultry industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Region-associated pressures shaped the dissemination patterns of bacterial pathogens, transitioning from pandemic to endemic, and led to dynamic changes in the resistome. Here, utilizing <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum as a prototype for an endemic pathogen that once spread globally, and assembling the most comprehensive <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum WGS database, we have discovered that region-associated pressures can influence the AMR risks of <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum within lineage- and region-specific patterns. These pressures might also influence lineage-distinct evolutionary structures and transmission histories of <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum.</p>
<p>The biovar types of <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum have been well-defined as bvSP, bvSG, and bvSD historically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Among these, bvSP can be further subdivided into five lineages (L1, L2a, L2b, L3b, and L3c) using hierarchical Bayesian analysis. Different sublineages exhibited preferential geographic distribution, with L2b and L3c of bvSP being predominant global lineage types. The historical geographical transmission was verified using a spatiotemporal Bayesian framework. The result shows that both lineages were initially spread from China to Europe in the early 19th century, which correlates strongly with the European hen fever event in the mid-19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Subsequently, the practice of breeding Asian chickens gradually spread from Europe to South America, leading to the bvSP prevalence in the United States. Considering the economic losses caused by bvSP, the United States, Europe, and other major countries implemented eradication programs in the mid-19th century, thus eliminating the risk of pullorum disease. However, with the strengthening of China-EU relations in the 1980s, a transmission of L2b from Europe to China was observed. Implementing similar measures is challenging due to China’s vast geographical area and various economic factors, resulting in bvSP becoming an endemic pathogen, mainly in China.</p>
<p>Additionally, forty-five bvSP was isolated from Taishun and Yueqing, to explore the transmission pattern of bvSP in China. The cgSNP distances between bvSP isolates from Taishun and Yueqing, showed significant diversity, with cgSNP distances of less than 100 isolate pairs observed exclusively within a single region. The transmission history of 45 global bvSP isolates revealed that most transmission events occurred within a single region. Additionally, the number of transmission events decreased rapidly with increasing distance, confirming that bvSP in China belongs to a highly localized pathogen.</p>
<p>Humanity appeared powerless against epidemics until the advent of antimicrobials, which are still the primary agents used to combat <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). As a manifestation of localization-related forces, the emergence of AMR allows pathogens to acquire additional fitness benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Our findings further indicate that the mobilome facilitates the acquisition of AMR among bvSP, mainly through plasmids and transposons, such as <italic>IncX1</italic>, <italic>IncQ1</italic>, and <italic>IncN</italic> type plasmids, as well as <italic>Tn801</italic>, <italic>Tn6205</italic>, and <italic>Tn721</italic> type transposons. A survey conducted in China between 1962 and 2010 documented the association of class 1 integrons with AMR among bvSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Our study further demonstrates that <italic>In498</italic>, <italic>In1440</italic>, <italic>In473</italic>, and <italic>In282</italic>, all belonging to class 1 integrons, play a significant role in carrying ARGs associated with sulfonamides, and trimethoprim. However, compared to other <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), the level of resistome in bvSP remains lower.</p>
<p>Considering lineage prospects, recently emerged lineages present a higher risk of AMR, with a lineage-specific distribution of resistome. In L2b and L3b, the most prevalent groups of ARGs include <italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM-1b</sub> and <italic>sul2</italic>. L3c, which exhibits the highest resistome richness with <italic>sul1</italic>, <italic>tet(A)</italic>, <italic>aadA5</italic>, and <italic>dfrA17</italic>, has a higher likelihood of MDR. However, the transmission routes of resistome showed a high degree of consistency across continents. Globally, a small proportion of resistome carriers belonging to L2b and L3c were observed in the Americas and Europe, while isolates from Asia exhibited a notable rise in resistome carriage. Therefore, we speculate that the mobilome in bvSP may have been acquired locally in Asia, possibly due to increased antimicrobial usage and an intensive industrialized poultry farming pattern within the regional poultry industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The L3b, being a local Asian lineage and more prone to acquiring additional resistome locally, provided further support.</p>
<p>In China, the endemic region of Asia, an unexpected rising trend has been observed from the 1970s to the 2020s. However, the risk of AMR varies among distinct regions. Overall, the average number of ARGs carried by bvSP isolated from eastern China was the lowest, while it was higher among bvSP isolated from northern and southern China. This variation may be influenced by differences in the economy, climate, or farming practices among different regions. Interestingly, the widespread horizontal transfer of the resistome across regions seems to indicate that the resistome has a different mode of transmission compared to its host. Specifically, as a localized pathogen, our results show a low frequency of cross-regional transmission of bvSP (as shown in S5 Fig), but up to 90% of ARGs are transmitted cross-regionally. This risk has not been previously observed in <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum, suggesting that potential intermediate hosts may play a key role.</p>
<p>However, the current study has some limitations. Firstly, despite assembling the most comprehensive WGS database for <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum from public and laboratory sources, there are still biases in the examined collection. The majority (438/580) of <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum samples were collected from China, possibly since the WGS is a technology that only became widely available in the 21st century. This makes it impractical to sequence it on a large scale in the 20th century, when <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum caused a global pandemic. So, we suspect that human intervention in the development of this epidemic is the main driving force behind the fact that most of the strains in the data set originated in China. Secondly, in silico analysis relies heavily on sophisticated, continuously updated databases. Although we utilized the most up-to-date databases, the exact prevalence of MGEs and ARGs may be underestimated. Nevertheless, by using the most extensive global WGS data from <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum, we elucidate a dynamic resistome evolution framework in a single bacterial pathogen from pandemic to endemic, which is hallmarked by a gradual increase in antimicrobial resistance risks and a stepwise resistome adaptation. The insights gained in this study will be helpful in further prevention and surveillance of the AMR risks of localized pathogens.</p>

<title>Determination of the potential MGE carried ARG and horizontal ARG transfer frequency</title>
<p>We have devised a pipeline to discern the coexistence of MGEs and ARGs. For plasmids and prophages, only ARGs situated within MGE regions are deemed MGE-carried. Regarding transposons and integrons, the search region was expanded to 5 kilobases upstream and downstream of ARGs, accounting for potential splicing errors. In this study, HGT events involving ARGs were defined as instances where ARGs exhibited perfect identity (100% coverage and 100% identity). In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), horizontal transfer of ARGs was identified based on gene regions with 100% coverage and over 99% identity. We believe that these stricter criteria in our pipeline more accurately reflect the transfer of ARGs within the <italic>S.</italic> Gallinarum population. HGT frequency was utilized to evaluate the extent of horizontal transfer of ARGs as follows:

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The investigators in this study analyzed the dataset assembly from 540 Salmonella isolates, and those from 45 recent isolates from Zhejiang University of China. The analysis and comparison of the resistome and mobilome of these isolates identified a significantly higher rate of cross-region dissemination compared to localized propagation. This study highlights the key role of the resistome in driving the transition and evolutionary history of S. Gallinarum.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The isolates included in this study were from 16 countries in the past century (1920 to 2023). While the study uses S. Gallinarun as the prototype, the conclusion from this work will likely apply to other Salmonella serotypes and other pathogens.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the isolates came from 16 countries, most strains in this study were originally from China.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors sequence 45 new samples of S. Gallinarum, a commensal Salmonella found in chickens, which can sometimes cause disease. They combine these sequences with around 500 from public databases, determine the population structure of the pathogen, and coarse relationships of lineages with geography. The authors further investigate known anti-microbial genes found in these genomes, how they associate with each other, whether they have been horizontally transferred, and date the emergence of clades.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) It doesn't seem that much is known about this serovar, so publicly available new sequences from a high-burden region are a valuable addition to the literature.</p>
<p>(2) Combining these sequences with publicly available sequences is a good way to better contextualise any findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are many issues with the genomic analysis that undermine the conclusions, the major ones I identified being:</p>
<p>(1) Recombination removal using gubbins was not presented fully anywhere. In this diversity of species, it is usually impossible to remove recombination in this way. A phylogeny with genetic scale and the gubbins results is needed. Critically, results on timing the emergence (fig2) depend on this, and cannot be trusted given the data presented.</p>
<p>(2) The use of BEAST was also only briefly presented, but is the basis of a major conclusion of the paper. Plot S3 (root-to-tip regression) is unconvincing as a basis of this data fitting a molecular clock model. We would need more information on this analysis, including convergence and credible intervals.</p>
<p>(3) Using a distance of 100 SNPs for a transmission is completely arbitrary. This would at least need to be justified in terms of the evolutionary rate and serial interval.</p>
<p>(4) The HGT definition is non-standard, and phylogeny (vertical inheritance) is not controlled for.</p>
<p>
The cited method:</p>
<p>
'In this study, potentially recently transferred ARGs were defined as those with perfect identity (more than 99% nucleotide identity and 100% coverage) in distinct plasmids in distinct host bacteria using BLASTn (E-value {less than or equal to}10−5)'</p>
<p>
This clearly does not apply here, as the application of distinct hosts and plasmids cannot be used. Subsequent analysis using this method is likely invalid, and some of it (e.g. Figure 6c) is statistically very poor.</p>
<p>(5) Associations between lineages, resistome, mobilome, etc do not control for the effect of genetic background/phylogeny. So e.g. the claim 'the resistome also demonstrated a lineage-preferential distribution' is not well-supported.</p>
<p>(6) The invasiveness index is not well described, and the difference in means is not biologically convincing as although it appears significant, it is very small.</p>
<p>(7) 'In more detail, both the resistome and mobilome exhibited a steady decline until the 1980s, followed by a consistent increase from the 1980s to the 2010s. However, after the 2010s, a subsequent decrease was identified.'</p>
<p>
Where is the data/plot to support this? Is it a significant change? Is this due to sampling or phylogenetics?</p>
<p>(8) It is not clear what the burden of disease this pathogen causes in the population, or how significant it is to agricultural policy. The article claims to 'provide valuable insights for targeted policy interventions.', but no such interventions are described.</p>
<p>(9) The abstract mentions stepwise evolution as a main aim, but no results refer to this.</p>
<p>(10) The authors attribute changes in population dynamics to normalisation in China-EU relations and hen fever. However, even if the date is correct, this is not a strongly supported causal claim, as many other reasons are also possible (for example other industrial processes which may have changed during this period).</p>
<p>(11) No acknowledgment of potential undersampling outside of China is made, for example, 'Notably, all bvSP isolates from Asia were exclusively found in China, which can be manually divided into three distinct regions (southern, eastern, and northern).'. Perhaps we just haven't looked in other places?</p>
<p>(12) Many of the conclusions are highly speculative and not supported by the data.</p>
<p>(13) The figures are not always the best presentation of the data:</p>
<p>
a. Stacked bar plots in Figure 1 are hard to interpret, the total numbers need to be shown. Panel C conveys little information.</p>
<p>
b. Figure 4B: stacked bars are hard to read and do not show totals.</p>
<p>
c. Figure 5 has no obvious interpretation or significance.</p>
<p>In summary, the quality of analysis is poor and likely flawed (although there is not always enough information on methods present to confidently assess this or provide recommendations for how it might be improved). So, the stated conclusions are not supported.</p>
