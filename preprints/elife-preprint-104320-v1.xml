<title>Abstract</title><p>Therapies targeting mutated RAS, the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers, could benefit millions of patients. Recently approved RAS inhibitors represent a breakthrough, but are limited to a specific KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutation and prone to resistance. Synthetic gene circuits offer a promising alternative by sensing and integrating cancer-specific biomolecular inputs, including mutated RAS, to selectively express therapeutic proteins in cancer cells. A key challenge for these circuits is achieving high cancer selectivity to prevent toxicity in healthy cells. To address this challenge, we present a novel approach combining multiple RAS sensors into RAS-targeting gene circuits, which allowed us to express an output protein in cells with mutated RAS with unprecedented selectivity. We implemented a modular design strategy and modelled the impact of individual circuit components on output expression. This enabled cell-line specific adaptation of the circuits to optimize selectivity and fine-tune expression. We further demonstrate the targeting capabilities of the circuits by employing them in different RAS-driven cancer cells. This work highlights the potential of synthetic gene circuits as a novel therapeutic strategy for RAS-driven cancers, advancing the application of synthetic biology in oncology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>RAS (Rat sacroma) mutations are the most common oncogenic alterations in human cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, accounting for 19% of all cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The RAS gene family consists of HRAS, KRAS and NRAS, with KRAS being the most frequently mutated isoform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Considered &quot;undruggable&quot; for many years, recent approval of several KRASG12C inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> has demonstrated the efficacy of targeting RAS in cancer treatment. However, these therapies are limited to cancers with KRASG12C mutations, which narrows the target range and makes the inhibitors susceptible to resistance development due to the emergence of other RAS mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Additional RAS-targeting strategies have encompassed protein engineering, RAS silencing, and artificial promoters. Synthetic proteins and endogenous RAS effectors (proteins that interact with active RAS and transduce its signaling) were engineered to bind<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, inhibit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, or degrade RAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Additionally, miRNAs modulated by oncogenic RAS were identified as potential drug targets<sup>10</sup> and siRNA against KRAS was used to target RAS-driven cancers in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Artificial promoters or synthetic transcription factor response elements responsive for transcription factors downstream of RAS were developed to interrogate RAS signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and target cancer cells with RAS mutations by expressing a toxin-antitoxin system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Gene circuits that logically integrate multiple biomolecular inputs are an emergent modality that allows discriminating between malignant and healthy cells and selectively eliciting a therapeutic response only in target cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Logic gene circuit-based therapeutic prototypes already demonstrated efficacy and safety in animal tumor models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Some of the previously-explored approaches for sensing and targeting RAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> are potentially compatible with the logic gene circuit paradigm. Two circuits have already been shown to build upon, or directly sense, RAS signaling. Gao and colleagues demonstrated a split protease approach to sense over-activation of proteins upstream of RAS. By fusing one domain of a protease to HRAS and the other domain to a RAS binding domain (RBD) of rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma type C (CRAF), they created a sensor for overexpressed mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or son of sevenless 1 (Sos-1) in HEK293 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Vlahos and colleagues adapted this approach to directly sense RAS activation by fusing either part of a split protease to an RBD domain, enabling RAS-dependent interleukin-12 secretion in HEK293T cells overexpressing KRASG12V.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> Further advancing synthetic circuits for therapeutic applications against RAS-driven cancer requires achieving high selectivity for mutated RAS and robust function in heterogeneous cancer cells. High selectivity is required to achieve strong output expression in cancer cells while minimizing off-target effects and toxicity in healthy cells with wild-type RAS. In addition, eventual translatability of these approaches to the clinic requires improved robustness in the face of tumor heterogeneity.</p>
<p>In this study, we address these challenges by developing a set of versatile RAS sensors and RAS-dependent transcription factor response elements to create synthetic gene circuits that use RAS activation as input. By combining these direct and indirect RAS sensors in an AND-gate configuration, we develop RAS-targeting circuits with high dynamic range and high selectivity towards cells with mutant RAS. The modular design allows fine-tuning the circuits to specific target and off-target cells and balancing their activation strength versus leakiness. Finally, we demonstrate that our new RAS-targeting circuits function as cancer cell classifiers, selectively expressing an output protein in a wide range of cancer cell lines with RAS-overactivating mutations while maintaining minimal output in cell lines with wild-type RAS.</p>

<title>Design of a synthetic RAS sensor</title>
<p>The endogenous RAS signaling pathway is initiated by the binding of cytoplasmic effector proteins to activated RAS-GTP. The effectors sense RAS-GTP dimerization and propagate the signal downstream through a phosphorylation cascade. Post-activation, GTPase-activating proteins, such as neurofibromin 1 (NF-1), facilitate the hydrolysis of RAS-bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signaling. Cancer-associated mutations in RAS render it insensitive to this hydrolysis, resulting in constitutively active RAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> that drives uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor growth.</p>
<p>Inspired by the natural function of CRAF, a key effector of RAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we designed a sensor that exploits the selective binding to RAS-GTP of CRAF’s RBDCRD (<bold>R</bold>AS-<bold>b</bold>inding <bold>d</bold>omain/<bold>c</bold>ysteine <bold>r</bold>ich <bold>d</bold>omain) domain. In our sensor, we fuse the RBDCRD domain to engineered truncated and mutated NarX variants originally derived from the bacterial two-component system, namely NarX<sup>379–598</sup>H399Q and NarX<sup>379–598</sup>N509A (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). We showed previously that these NarX variants are able to transphosphorylate in mammalian cells, but only upon forced dimerization via fused protein domains. Therefore, NarX variants can functionally replace CRAF’s own dimerization domain when fused to RBDCRD, while enabling orthogonal signaling in mammalian cells via a humanized NarL response regulator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We call these chimeric constructs “RBDCRD-NarX fusions”.</p>

<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Design of the binding component of the RAS sensor. Inspired by natural RAF (left), the RAS-binding component of the sensor (right) comprises RAS binding domain (RBDCRD), a linker, and a NarX-derived transphosphorylation domain. (<bold>b</bold>) Schematic of the RAS sensor composition and mechanism of action. The sensor’s genetic payload is encoded on four plasmids. Two plasmids express the RAS-binding components: RBDCRD fused, respectively, to NarX<sup>N509A</sup> or NarX<sup>H399Q</sup>. The third plasmid expresses NarL, and the fourth plasmid encodes the output protein (mCerulean) under the control of a NarL response element (NarL-RE) in front of a minimal promoter (TATA). Upon RAS activation, the RBDCRD domain of the RAS-binding components bind to RAS-GTP. This binding leads to a forced dimerization of the NarX domains and a transphosphorylation of NarX<sup>N509A</sup>, in turn phorsphorylating NarL. Phosphorylated NarL binds its response element on the output plasmid, inducing the expression of the output protein. (<bold>c</bold>) Sensor activation by mutated RAS.

<p>We surmised that the RAS sensor would function as follows: activation of RAS (whether endogenous or mutation-driven) would elevate RAS-GTP levels, which would in turn bind the RBDCRD domain of the RBDCRD-NarX fusion. Resulting dimerization of RBDCRD would lead to a forced dimerization of the fused NarX, leading to NarX<sup>H399Q</sup> transphosphorylating NarX<sup>N509A</sup>, in turn phosphorylating NarL. Phosphorylated NarL would bind to its response element on the NarL-responsive promoter and induce the expression of an output protein, here mCerulean (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). In order to test these assumptions, we constructed the necessary components including the two complementary RBDCRD-NarX fusions, the humanized NarL and the NarL-reponsive promoter coupled to mCerulean. Initially, we chose HEK293 cells as a test system. To emulate the presence of mutant RAS we transfected HEK293 cells with a plasmid expressing KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, and to emulate high levels of wild-type RAS we transfected them with a plasmid-encoded wild type KRAS (KRAS<sup>WT</sup>). (Note that HEK293 cells express low endogenous levels of wild-type KRAS, HRAS and NRAS.) In the first set of tests, delivery of all the sensor components to HEK293 cells using transient transfection showed significantly higher output expression in cells expressing KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> than in cells transfected with KRAS<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In HEK293 cells transformed with the mutant KRAS, sensor response increased upon increase in the dose of the sensor-encoding plasmids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Further, sensor function depended on RAS binding, because mutations in the RAS binding domain (RBD) and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) strongly decreased output expression. Interestingly, while the RBD<sup>R89L</sup> mutant still exhibited dose-dependent leakiness, the CRD<sup>C168xref&gt;S</sup> and the double RBD<sup>R89L</sup>CRD<sup>C168xref&gt;S</sup> mutant reduced output expression to background levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). In agreement with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and with our observation that the sensor employing RBDCRD instead of RBD alone shows increased downstream signaling (Supplementary Fig. 1), this result confirms that both RBD and CRD domains are involved in RAS binding and sensor activation.</p>
<p>We then characterized sensor response to increasing input levels. As expected, increased levels of mutant KRAS drove higher output expression, whereas wild-type KRAS resulted in some sensor activation but at much higher expression levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Finally, we measured the RAS-GTP protein levels in HEK293 cells using a RAS-pulldown ELISA assay and were able to directly correlate higher RAS-GTP levels with higher output expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Collectively, this dataset provides evidence that the RAS sensor is directly activated by RAS-GTP, and therefore it can selectively sense mutant RAS because the hallmark of this mutant is highly increased RAS-GTP level. Nonetheless, wild-type RAS also binds GTP, which explains sensor response in HEK293 cells that overexpress wild-type RAS and contain relatively high levels of RAS-GTP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Mechanism of Action</title>
<p>To recapitulate, our design anticipates that the function of the RAS sensor requires the following steps: delivery and expression of the RAS sensor components; RAS-GTP binding of RBDCRD-NarX fusion proteins via their RBDCRD domain, resulting in forced dimerization of the NarX domains and transphosphorylation; NarL phosphorylation; and NarL-mediated output expression. To quantify the effect of RAS activation on these steps, we manipulated the RAS-GTP levels in HEK293 cells in a variety of ways: (i) we overexpressed wild-type KRAS to show the effect of high non-mutant KRAS concentration on downstream sensor response and quantify sensor activation in the presence of RAS-GTP associated with wild-type KRAS; (ii) we overexpressed mutant KRAS in order to measure sensor response to saturating levels of the intended mutant KRAS input; (iii) we overexpressed NF1, an endogenous GTPase-activating protein that deactivates residual endogenous wild-type RAS in HEK293 cells and allows to quantify non-specific sensor response in the absence of RAS-GTP; and (iv) we expressed Sos-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates RAS by generating high levels of RAS-GTP, to quantify the upper bound on sensor output.</p>
<p>In order to quantify signal propagation along this cascade, we generated a number of reporter constructs. To quantify the expression of the RBDCRD-NarX fusion, we further fused this component to SYFP2 and measured YFP fluorescence in HEK293 cells with various RAS-GTP levels. We observed that overexpression of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> or overactivation of endogenous RAS with Sos-1 resulted in YFP increase and thus elevated expression of the RBDCRD-NarX fusion, compared to cells with baseline RAS-GTP. Conversely, inactivation of endogenous RAS with NF1 resulted in a lower YFP/RBDCRD-NarX expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Second, we used the same construct to visualize RAS binding of the RBDCRD-NarX. Because RAS is a membrane protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we expected the binding of RBDCRD-NarX to KRAS-GTP to result in YFP accumulation at the membrane. Indeed, RAS-GTP increase by overexpressing KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> or via Sos-1 led to higher membrane-to-total-signal ratio, compared to cells with endogenous RAS-GTP levels or with NF1-deactivated RAS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Third, we examined the dimerization of the RAS sensor by fusing the two parts of a split mVenus to RBDCRD-NarX proteins and measuring the signal from reconstituted mVenus. Again, RAS activation increased the signal from dimerized RBDCRD-NarX-mVenus, while RAS deactivation decreased it (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Last, we investigated the effect of RAS-GTP levels on mCerulean sensor output of the complete RAS sensor. We observed the expected trend whereas the magnitude of the effect was amplified compared to the effects of individual sensing step, suggesting signal amplification in the synthetic sensing pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>

<p>Effect of differential RAS activation on the steps considered necessary for RAS Sensor activation.

In the control condition the cells are transfected with a non-coding plasmid, here it represents the endogenous RAS activation.

</fig>
<p>While the dependency of RAS binding, dimerization, and output expression of the sensor on RAS-GTP levels was expected, we did not expect that the expression of the RBDCRD-NarX fusion itself (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) would be RAS-GTP dependent. Possible explanations could include the presence of transcription factor binding sites activated by RAS signaling in the elongation factor 1a (EF1a) promoter driving the expression of RBDCRD-NarX, or RAS-dependent non-specific activation of protein synthesis. EF1a promoter sequence contains potential binding sites of CREB, c-Myc, SRF, AP1 and Elk-4 (Supplementary Fig. 2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, reports that (over-)activated RAS or MAPK signaling can increase protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, suggesting that both mechanisms may be involved. Whatever the cause, the fact that functional binding of RBDCRD to RAS is required for sensor activation and output generation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>), and the much stronger increase in sensor output (Fig.2d) compared to the increase in RBDCRD-NarX levels (Fig.2a), suggests that this effect is only a minor contributor to overall sensor response.</p>

<title>Optimization of activation efficiency and sensor tunability</title>
<p>The RAS sensor is activated by RAS-GTP and therefore by both wild-type and mutant RAS. Cells with mutant RAS have higher RAS-GTP and higher sensor activation than cells with wild-type RAS. Nevertheless, residual sensor activation in healthy cells with wild-type RAS may cause toxicity in a clinical implementation of the sensor. Therefore, we aimed to further improve the RAS sensor’s ability to discriminate between wild-type and mutant RAS and optimized the transfer function between RAS-GTP input and mCerulean output. Structural predictions with AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> revealed that longer linkers between the sensor’s RBDCRD and NarX-derived domains could bring the NarX domains into closer proximity, potentially improving dimerization and transphosphorylation efficiency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Our measurements showed that up to a certain size, longer and/or more rigid linkers indeed increased output expression, but not the dynamic range between KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and KRAS<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>

<p>We also explored alternative natural and synthetic RAS binding domains. Among the tested binding domains, the Ras association domain (RA) of the natural RAS effector Rassf5, the RAS association domain 2 (RA2) of the phospholipase C epsilon (PLCe)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, and the synthetic RAS binder K55<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> showed a slightly higher or similar dynamic range. To better understand how different binding domains affect RAS-specific activation, we deactivated endogenous RAS<sup>WT</sup> in HEK293 using NF-1. RBDCRD was the only binding domain that showed a pronounced decrease in output expression in cells with NF1 compared to cells with KRAS<sup>WT</sup>, indicating low RAS-unspecific activation for RBDCRD but also its activation in cells with KRAS<sup>WT</sup>. The other binding domains showed one of two responses: (1) already very low activation in cells with KRAS<sup>WT</sup> which was not further decreased in cells with NF1, for example in RA(Rassf5) and K55; (2) background activation in cells with NF-1 indicating RAS-unspecific activation, for example in RA2(PLCe) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
<p>Fusing stronger transactivation domains to NarL markedly increased output expression of the RAS sensor without changing its dynamic range. Specifically, we replaced the initial VP48 with either F.L.T., a fusion of three partial transactivation domains, FoxoTAD (Forkhead-Box-Protein-O3<sup>604–664</sup>), LMSTEN (MYB<sup>251–330</sup>), and TA1 (RelA<sup>521–331</sup>) or with RelA<sup>342–551</sup> with all its transactivation domains (Schweingruber et al. in preparation). In cells co-transfected with NF1, the sensor with NarL-F.L.T. exhibited low output expression similar to the initial sensor variant with NarL-VP48. In contrast, the sensor with NarL-RelA had high background in cells with NF1 suggesting RAS-unspecific activation when using RelA as a transactivation domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Overall, the testing of alternative sensor parts did not increase the dynamic range between KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and KRAS<sup>WT</sup> but it showed that the RAS sensor was modular. Different linkers, binding domains, and transactivation domains could be used to construct the sensor and tune the absolute strength of output expression without affecting the dynamic range.</p>

<title>Multi-input RAS-targeting circuits with improved selectivity for KRAS<sup>G12D</sup></title>
<p>Mutations in signaling proteins, such as RAS, often lead to increased activation of downstream transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that using transcription factors from the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) downstream of RAS as inputs could add an additional layer of selectivity to RAS-targeting circuits.

</fig>
<p>As an initial step, we designed synthetic response elements with binding sites for transcription factors shown to be activated by mutated RAS, including Elk-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, c-Fos &amp; c-Jun<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, c-Myc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and SRF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. For each response element, multiple binding sites of MAPK transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, minimal promoters from genes downstream of RAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, or sequences from existing RAS-responsive promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> were encoded upstream of a low leakage minimal promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref> &amp; Supplementary Fig. 3).</p>
<p>To assess the functionality of the response elements, we cloned the response elements directly upstream of a fluorescent mScarlet protein and transfected them into HEK293 cells. The minimal promoter of c-fos (pFos)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, the polyomavirus enhancer domain (PY2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and the serum response element (SRE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> were the response elements exhibiting the highest dynamic range between cells with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and cells with KRAS<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). The response elements demonstrated a similar dependency on KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and KRAS<sup>WT</sup> to the one observed with the binding-based RAS sensor in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>. All three response elements contain binding sites for Ets-like 1 protein (elk-1). However, the Elk response element consisting of only elk binding sites showed low mScarlet expression and low dynamic range. To better understand this apparent contradiction, we further investigated the Elk response element. Overexpressing elk-1 with the Elk response reporter increased the mScarlet expression, indicating that endogenous elk-1 levels are not high enough for efficient activation of the Elk response element. With overexpressed elk-1, we observed high selectivity for cells with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and low RAS-independent background activation in cells overexpressing NF-1 (Supplementary Fig. 4). A RAS titration provided more evidence for the RAS dependence of the Elk response element (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Superior performance of pFos, SRE, and PY2 response elements demonstrate that inclusion of additional transcription factor binding sites can amplify transcriptional sensor response, potentially due to synergy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Consistent with this and previous reports that the combination of AP-1 and elk-1 binding sites is critical for maximal RAS responsiveness in the polyomavirus enhancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, we found that combining elk-1 with additional transcription factors allows the design of efficient RAS-dependent response elements.</p>
<p>Finally, we combined these MAPK response elements with the RAS sensor using AND-gate logic, by using the response elements to regulate the expression of binding-triggered RBDCRD-NarX sensor. The resulting RAS-sensing circuits showed improved selectivity for KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> with the best performer exhibiting an 81-fold dynamic range between KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and KRAS<sup>WT</sup> compared to the 8-fold dynamic range of the binding-based RAS sensor alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>).</p>

<title>Modularity allows to create RAS sensor circuits with high dynamic range</title>
<p>As shown above, RAS-sensing circuits can utilize a variety of MAPK response elements, RAS binding domains, linkers, and transactivator domains. To further optimize the transfer function between the input and the output and improve the discrimination between cells with mutant and wild-type RAS, we performed a screening campaign to examine the effect of different combinations of circuit components on the dynamic range. In this screen we tested combinations of various building blocks: RBDCRD, K55, and RA(Rassf5) as binding domains fused to the NarX; VP48 or F.L.T as transactivation domain of NarL; and pFos, PY2 and SRE as MAPK response elements. The response elements regulated the expression of either the NarX fusion proteins only, or of the NarL protein only, while the other part was constitutively driven by EF1a. For the EF1a-driven RBDCRD-NarX proteins we tested two versions with either a 6x flexible or a 3x rigid linker. This set resulted in a total of 222 unique conditions, over two experimental batches. Almost thirty conditions resulted in high dynamic ranges of &gt;100-fold, with the highest circuit variants using the combination of PY2, RBDCRD, and F.L.T.

<p>We found that PY2 was the most prevalent response element among the high-performing hits, followed by pFos, while SRE only occurred in three hits. The prevalence of the transactivation domain varied depending on whether the NarX or the NarL proteins were regulated by a MAPK response element. While F.L.T. was more abundant among the hits where NarL was regulated by the response elements, VP48 dominated in the circuits where the response elements regulated the NarX fusion proteins. The K55 and RBDCRD binding domains were found in an equal number of hits (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). However, we observed that circuits with F.L.T. as the transactivation domain performed best with RBDCRD as the binding domain, while there was no significant difference between RBDCRD and K55 for circuits with VP48 (Supplementary Fig. 5).</p>
<p>To further improve our understanding of the effect of different building blocks, we fitted a linear regression model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>) and compared it with the experimental data (Supplementary Fig. 6-7). This revealed that the effect of the MAPK response elements depended on which sensor components they regulated. Expression of NarL-F.L.T. under the control of MAPK response elements strongly increased the output expression in cells with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, while, except for the SRE_NarL-F.L.T. circuit, the activation in cells with KRAS<sup>WT</sup> remained low. In contrast, MAPK control of NarL-VP48 decreased the output in KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and even more so in KRAS<sup>WT</sup> cells. Expression of the NarX fusion proteins increased the circuit activation in cells with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, but also in cells with KRAS<sup>WT</sup>. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, &amp; Supplementary Fig. 6a-f).</p>
<p>In this campaign, we focused on circuits where only NarL or only the NarX proteins were regulated by the response elements. Next, we also implemented the regulation of all circuit components by PY2. The PY2_NarX &amp; NarL-F.L.T. circuit led to the highest output in cells with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, with only marginally higher activation with KRAS<sup>WT</sup> than PY2_NarX_F.L.T. or PY2_NarL-F.L.T. and still lower than the RAS_Sensor_F.L.T. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">e</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, the tests revealed that the RAS-targeting circuits are composable, with various combinations of parts leading to circuits with high dynamic ranges that diverge in their transfer functions and their activation thresholds. The availability of different circuit parts thus allowed to adapt the input-output behavior of the circuits and increased the distinction between cells with mutated and cells with wild-type RAS.</p>

<title>RAS sensor circuits detect endogenous RAS mutations in cancer cells</title>
<p>To evaluate the response of the RAS sensor circuits to endogenous RAS activation in cancer cell line, we transfected the EF1a-driven, binding-triggered RAS sensor into wild-type HCT-116 cells, a colon cancer cell line harboring a KRAS<sup>G13D</sup> mutation (HCT-116<sup>WT</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. To have a comparable off-target cell line without mutated RAS, we also transfected a commercially available KRAS knock-out HCT-116 cell line (HCT-116<sup>k.o.</sup>).</p>
<p>The RAS sensor was functional in HCT-116 cells and responded to endogenous levels of RAS activation with higher activation in HCT-116 cells with KRAS<sup>G13D</sup> than in the knock-out cells. Further, loss-of-function mutations in RBDCRD decreased activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). However, the dynamic range was only 3-fold. Therefore, we leveraged the modularity of the circuit design to improve selectivity for target HCT-116 cells. We found that the amplified AND-gate circuits with PY2 response element, F.L.T transactivation domain, and RBDCRD as a RAS-binding domain, were most effective in distinguishing HCT-116<sup>WT</sup> from HCT-116<sup>k.o.</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b-d</xref>). In contrast to what we saw in HEK293 overexpressing RAS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>), the “AND-gate” RAS-targeting circuits do not generate higher output than the EF1a-driven, binding-triggered RAS sensor in HCT-116. Instead, the improved dynamic range results from decreased leakiness in HCT-116<sup>k.o.</sup>. Only with a 3x rigid linker in RBDCRD-NarX fusion did the PY2_NarL-F.L.T circuit show higher output expression compared to the EF1a-driven, binding-triggered RAS sensor. However, while the circuit with the 3x rigid linker still showed a dynamic range of 18-fold it had a decreased dynamic range compared to the same circuit with the 6x flexible linker (57-fold) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>). Taken together, this dataset demonstrates that the RAS-targeting circuits are functional in cancer cells and are able to respond to endogenous levels of mutated RAS. While there are differences between the model systems, we can leverage the availability of multiple circuit parts to adapt the circuits to specific target and off-target cells to improve selectivity.</p>

<title>RAS circuits can generate selective output in RAS-driven cancer cells</title>
<p>To specifically target RAS-driven cancer, the RAS-targeting circuits need to show selective output expression in cancer cells with mutations over-activating RAS (RAS<sup>MUT</sup>), while maintaining minimal expression in cells without such mutations (RAS<sup>WT</sup>). Testing the most promising RAS-targeting circuits in twelve cancer cell lines showed that all circuits exhibited significantly higher output expression in RAS<sup>MUT</sup> cells. The PY2_NarX&amp;NarL-F.L.T. circuit had the highest response rate among the RAS<sup>MUT</sup> cells but displayed slightly increased background activation in RAS<sup>WT</sup> cells. This was particularly notable in HT-29, a cell line harboring a BRAF mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> and thus representing a RAS<sup>WT</sup> cell line but with an over-activated MAPK pathway. HT-29 did not show an elevated background in any of the other circuits, indicating a clean AND-gate behavior between the RAS Sensor and the MAPK response element for the circuits that express only NarL-F.L.T. with the response elements (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, regulating NarL-F.L.T. through different response elements altered the specific RAS<sup>MUT</sup> cells in which the RAS circuits showed output expression. This allowed us to identify for each RAS<sup>MUT</sup> cell line, a RAS circuit with higher activation in these cells than in all RAS<sup>WT</sup> cell lines, demonstrating that the response elements allow to adapt the RAS circuits to the targeted cancer cell type (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref> &amp; Supplementary Fig. 8). The output expression of the RAS circuits correlated with the direct expression of a fluorescent protein via the MAPK response elements, although not perfectly. This indicates that the response elements are important for the differential activation between the cell lines but are not the only factor (Supplementary Fig. 9). In summary, these results demonstrate that the RAS-targeting circuits are functional RAS<sup>MUT</sup> cell classifiers with a broad target range that can be adapted using different MAPK response elements.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we report the design of synthetic gene circuits to target RAS-driven cancers. We developed a set of RAS sensors with interchangeable parts that can be combined to flexibly design RAS-sensing circuits. Using our modular design, we created and characterized gene circuits advancing RAS-targeting circuits on two key performance criteria: selectivity for mutated RAS, and adaptability to different target and off-target cell lines.</p>
<p>To date the only existing synthetic gene circuit that directly targets RAS had a 2-fold dynamic range between HEK cells overexpressing KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> and KRAS<sup>WT</sup> and a 4-fold dynamic range when compared to HEK cells with endogenous RAS levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Our design of RAS-targeting circuit greatly improves specificity for mutant RAS. This is critical given that RAS circuits sense activated RAS-GTP, which is highly overactivated in cancers with RAS mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> but also present in healthy cells with wild-type RAS. Since this could lead to on-target, off-tumor effects, RAS-targeting circuits are designed to sense the different activation dynamics and activation levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> resulting from the constitutive overactivation of RAS in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. To achieve high dynamic range between cells with mutated and cell with wild-type RAS, we optimized the transfer function governing the relationship between the RAS-GTP input and sensor output. To this end, we combined binding-triggered RAS sensors and RAS-dependent MAPK transcription factor sensors into a coherent type 1 feed-forward AND-gate. In this design, MAPK sensors enhance the RAS-dependent increase in expression of the binding-triggered RAS sensor components. Thus, cells with wild-type RAS have lower levels of the RAS sensor components than cells with mutant RAS, leading to suppression of RAS-dependent leakage of output production by the binding-triggered RAS sensor. This network motif was shown to delay the onset of output expression but not the output shutdown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. This dynamic behavior, termed sign-sensitive delay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, acts as a noise repressor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and persistence detector <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, which could further explain why this design improves the sensing of constitutively active mutant RAS while minimizing output expression from the more transient activation of wild-type RAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Integrating multiple RAS dependent sensors into the circuit design resulted in a strongly enhanced distinction between cells overexpressing mutant or wildtype RAS and a more than 100-fold higher dynamic range than previous circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Validation in cancer cell lines demonstrated that the RAS-targeting can selectively express an output in cancer cells with diverse RAS mutations. The RAS circuits were activated by a variety of mutations, such as KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, KRAS<sup>G12S</sup>, KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> and KRAS<sup>G13D</sup>, but also in K562 cells with a BCR-ABL fusion gene that constitutively activates RAS through Sos-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. A broad targeting range is advantageous because tumors exhibit high intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity of RAS mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. RAS heterogeneity is a limiting factor in current KRAS inhibitors because of its limited target range to only specific tumors with G12C mutations and resistance development due to escape variants with different RAS mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The broad target range of the RAS-targeting circuits enabled us to identify a circuit for each mutant RAS cell line that was more active in those cells than in all wild-type RAS cell lines. However, the heterogeneous cancer cell lines showed variable dynamic ranges, showing the need for adaptation of the circuits to the target cells.</p>
<p>Additional input sensors may allow to further enhance the RAS-targeting circuits. Beyond the direct RAS sensors and the MAPK response elements, adding other RAS-dependent sensors, such as ERK sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> or RAS-dysregulated miRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> in an AND-gate configuration could further improve specificity. Alternatively, an OR-gate configuration could reduce the risk of resistance development. Off-target effects could be minimized by including NOT-gates with inputs associated with healthy cells, such as existing p53 sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> or new sensors specific for healthy cells with high RAS activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In the context of cancer therapies, synthetic gene circuits can express a variety of therapeutic proteins as output, such as proapoptotic proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, enzymes that convert a prodrug into a cytotoxic drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, immunotherapeutic proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, or even combination therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Exchanging the output protein can be achieved by changing the coding sequence on the output plasmid. However, it may also require adaptation of the expression strength to optimize the killing of cancer cells while minimizing toxicity. Selection of the components used in our RAS circuits tunes the expression strength which may allow for dosing of the therapeutic output proteins. Potent molecules, such as interleukin-12, will require stringent expression with low leakiness to prevent systemic toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, while less toxic molecules could benefit from stronger expression. We envision that the modularity of our system will allow to tailor the expression profile to the therapeutic output.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides the foundation for the design of RAS-targeting circuits. Our results confirm the feasibility of developing synthetic gene circuits that selectively target RAS-mutated cancer cells and encourage the use of their versatility to adapt the circuits to future challenges during clinical translation. Together, this highlights the potential of RAS-targeting circuits as a new therapeutic strategy that could reshape therapies against RAS-driven cancer.</p>

<sec id="s4a">
<title>Plasmid Construction</title>
<p>Plasmids were cloned using standard cloning techniques, such as Gibson, GoldenGate assembly, or restriction enzyme cloning. DNA fragments were ordered from TWIST Biosciences or Genewiz (Azenta Life Sciences). Enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs and Thermo Fischer Scientific. The sequences of all used plasmids are listed in Supplementary Table 1 and the sequences of the individual RAS circuit parts in Supplementary Table 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>All cell lines used were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in the medium suggested by the provider with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution. Cells were passaged before reaching confluency 1-3 times per week, depending on experimental plans. Details on the individual cell lines, such as provider, medium, and splitting ratios are listed in Supplementary Table 3.</p>

<title>Transfections</title>
<p>The transfections for the RAS-GTP pulldown experiment in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f and the</xref> confocal microscopy experiment in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> were performed in 6-well plates, the transfection for the microscopy experiment in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, and the cell line screening in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref> in 24-well plates, and all other experiments were performed in 96-well plates. The difference in plate size was accounted for by scaling the amount of transfected DNA to the number of seeded cells. The cells were seeded 24h before transfection in 100 µL of medium (500 µL for 24-well; 2.5 mL for 6 well plates). Endotoxin-free (ZR DNA Prep Kit, Zymo Research, cat.no. D4201 &amp; D4212) plasmids were mixed according to the experimental layout (Supplementary Tables 4 &amp; 5), Opti-MEM<sup>TM</sup> (Thermo Fischer Scientific) was added to reach a volume of 30 µL (50 µL in 24-well plates; 500 µL in 6-well plates). Transfection reagents were mixed with Opti-MEM<sup>TM</sup> to reach a volume of 20 µL (50 µL in 24-well plates; 500 µL in 6-well plates). After incubation for at least 5 minutes, the mixture was added to the DNA samples, gently vortexed, spun down, and then incubated at room temperature for at least 20 minutes before addition to the cells. The seeding and transfection conditions for each cell line are shown in Supplementary Table 6 for the cell line screening in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref> and in Supplementary Table 7 for all other experiments. To minimize the effect of differential evaporation in 96-well plates, only the inner 60 wells were used for samples, while the outer wells were filled with PBS.</p>
<p>For the experiments comparing different cell lines (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> &amp; Supplementary Fig. 8, 9 &amp; 13), the DNA amount was optimized to achieve more similar transfection efficiencies, as listed in Supplementary Tables 6-7. In the cancer cell line screening, we adjusted the DNA amount to 1.5x for cell lines with low transfection efficiencies (&lt;20%), 1x DNA for cell lines with moderate efficiency (20-50%), and 0.5x DNA for cell lines with high efficiency (&gt;50%).</p>

<title>Structure Prediction</title>
<p>The protein structure of the RBDCRD-linker-NarX fusion proteins was predicted with AlphaFold2 from the amino acid sequence using the Latch Console platform (LatchBio). Using PyMOL (Version 2.5.4, Schrödinger, LLC.), we aligned the NMR-derived structure of two KRAS-RBDCRD dimers tethered to a nanodisc (worldwide Protein Data Bank, PDB accession code: 6PTS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>) with the NMR structure of a KRAS4B-GTP homodimer on a lipid bilayer nanodisc (PDB accession code: 6W4E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>). The predicted structure of two RBDCRD-linker-NarX proteins was then aligned to each of the RBDCRD structures. The flexible parts of the RBDCRD and the linkers were rotated, to bring the two NarX domains into proximity.</p>

<title>Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
<p>Microscopy pictures were taken 36-48 h after transfection using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon Intensilight C-HGFI fiber illuminator, Semrock filter cubes (IDEX Health &amp; Science), a 10x objective, and a Hamamatsu C10600 ORCA-R2 digital camera. Excitation filters, dichroic mirrors, emission filters, and exposure times are summarized in Supplementary Table 8. The Look-up table (LUT) values were adjusted for ideal contrast and kept constant within an experiment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f">
<title>Flow Cytometry</title>
<p>Cells were prepared for flow cytometry analysis by removing the medium and adding 70-100 µL of Accuatase (Gibco, Thermo Fischer Scientific, cat.no. #A1110501). The cells were incubated for 15-30 min at room temperature and then kept on ice before measurement using a BD LSRFortessa<sup>TM</sup> with a high-throughput screening device. To avoid potential cell damage and minimize time on ice, the plates were prepared consecutively, right before analysis. Excitation wavelengths, longpass filters, and emission bandpass filters were optimized to reduce crosstalk between different fluorophores and are summarized in Supplementary Table 9. When working with 24-well plates, after removing the medium, 150-200 µL of Accutase was used to detach the cells. After 15-30 minutes of incubation, the cells were detached by gentle pipetting, and the complete cell suspension was transferred to a 96-well plate for analysis using the HTS device.</p>

<title>RAS-GTP Pulldown ELISA</title>
<p>RAS-GTP levels were measured using a Ras Activation ELISA assay kit (Merck Millipore cat.no. #17-497) according to the manual. HEK293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected as described in the ‘Transfection’ section. Cells were lysed using 250 µL of the provided lysis buffer with added Halt<sup>TM</sup> Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat.no. #89900). Samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. An aliquot was used to quantify the protein amount in the cell lysates using a Pierce<sup>TM</sup> BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat.no #23227). The next day, 100 µg of each sample was used for the ELISA. The anti-RAS antibody (Merck Millipore cat.no. #17-497; part no.2006992) was provided in the ELISA kit. Chemiluminescence was measured using a Tecan Spark Multimode Microplate Reader and measured 20 min after the addition of the substrate with an integration time of 1 s.</p>

<title>Confocal Microscopy for Quantification of Membrane Binding</title>
<p>Cells were seeded in a 24-well plate and transfected as described in the ‘Transfections’ section. After 36 h we detached the cells using 0.25% trypsin and re-seeded 30’000 cells in 200 µL medium into an 8-well glass-bottom plate to have sparsely distributed cells suitable for membrane detection and image analysis. The cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 to reattach. After 4 h, we stained the membrane of the cells with the CellBrite Steady 685 Membrane Staining Kit (20 µL of 1:100 dilution; Biotium cat.no. #30109-T) and the nuclei with 5 µL NucBlue Live Cell Stain (Thermo Fischer Scientific, cat.no. R37605). The wells were imaged using a Falcon SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) with a 20x objective. SYFP2 was measured using an excitation laser at 524 nm and 540-600 nm bandpass filter, NucBlue was measured using the 405 nm laser and 415-460 nm bandpass filter, CellBrite was measured using a 670 nm excitation laser and a 750-800 nm bandpass filter.</p>

<sec id="s4i">
<title>Image analysis for Quantification of Membrane Binding</title>
<p>Confocal images were analyzed with Python v3.10 using the Scikit-Image v0.19.2, SciPy v1.8.1, NumPy v1.22.4, Pandas v1.4.2, OpenCV v4.5.0 and custom packages built upon these libraries. Cells were segmented based on the membrane (CellBrite Steady 685) and nuclear (NucBlue) signals. The nuclear signals were used to assign the membrane signal to the individual cell. First, each nucleus was identified as a single cell. Second, the membrane signal was assigned to the nearest nucleus and used to create a mask for the membrane of each cell. Third, the membrane masks were post-processed to exclude non-closed objects, such as cell debris or cells with incomplete membrane staining as well as cells with more than one nucleus per cell. Fourth, the membrane masks were filled to additionally obtain the full cell masks. Fifth, for signal analysis, the total fluorescence in the SYFP2 channel was calculated for both the membrane and the full cell mask of each cell. Finally, the ratio between the membrane and the total cell signal was calculated for each cell. We used untransfected cells stained with NucBlue and CellBright steady 685 to assess background fluorescence. For the analysis, we included all transfected cells with total cell fluorescence above this background.</p>

<title>Regression Model</title>
<p>The effect of different circuit parts on the output expression in HEK<sup>G12D</sup>, HEK<sup>WT</sup> as well as on the dynamic range (HEK<sup>G12D</sup>/HEK<sup>WT</sup>) was modeled using a Gaussian generalized linear model in R Studio v2023.06.0+421. Because the datasets were skewed toward low values, resulting in a loss of model accuracy at low values (Supplementary Fig. 10), a log transformation of all values was performed before running the models. Linearity and homoscedasticity assumptions were assessed using residual plots (Supplementary Fig. 11a-f). The goodness of fit was evaluated by comparing the fitted and measured values and calculating Pearson (R<sup>2</sup>) and Spearman correlations using the cor() function in R Studio (Supplementary Fig. 11g-i). For the selection of the independent variables, we tested three models assuming different interactions between the response elements and the parts they express. (Supplementary Table 10). The model with the best correlation (Model 3) was selected to analyze the effect of the different circuit parts in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>. In addition to the primary variables of interest, we considered potential covariates such as experimental batch, transfection efficiency, and amount of NarX and NarL plasmids. While the experimental batch did not affect the correlation of the model, transfection efficiency and plasmid amounts were included in the regression to ensure the robustness of the model.</p>

<title>Analysis of Flow cytometry data</title>
<p>Flow cytometry data analysis was performed using FlowJo software v10.8.0 (BD Life Sciences). The gating strategy is shown in (Supplementary Fig. 12a-d). When multiple cell lines with different transfection efficiencies were used, the cells were binned using the expression of the mCherry transfection control to include only cells with high transfection levels &gt; 10<sup>3</sup> (Supplementary Fig. 12d-e). We further validated that there was no direct correlation between transfection efficiency and normalized output in our experimental data (Supplementary Fig. 10). Absolute units (AU) of fluorescence were calculated by multiplying the number of positive cells (frequency of parent) with the mean expression of the fluorophore:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="622942v1_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Relative units (RU) of fluorescence were calculated by dividing the AU of the fluorophore of interest by the AU of the transfection control:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="622942v1_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
For the dynamic range, the fold change between the target cell line (HEK<sup>G12D</sup> or HCT-116<sup>WT</sup>; ON-state) and off-target cell line (HEK<sup>G12D</sup> or HCT-116<sup>WT</sup>; OFF-state) was calculated. The error bars were calculated using error propagation rules:

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>In experiments comparing two groups, unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests were used to assess significance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> &amp; 6f and Supplementary Fig. 7d-I &amp; 13a). When comparing three or more groups, an ordinary one-way ANOVA was used followed by a Dunnett’s multiple comparison test when all groups were compared with a control column (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 5 &amp; 7a-c) or a Tukey’s test when all columns were compared (Supplementary Fig. 6). Significance in the regression model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>) was tested using a Wald test. Data was considered statistically significant at a p-value below 0.05. The number of replicates is provided in the figure captions. Each replicate was taken from a distinct sample. Apart from the large screening experiments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), data is representative of at least two experiments.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Senn and colleagues presents a comprehensive study on the developing synthetic gene circuits targeting mutant RAS-expressing cells. This study aims to exploit these RAS-targeting circuits as cancer cell classifiers, enabling the selective expression of an output protein in correlation with RAS activity. The system is based on the bacterial two-component system NarX/NarL. A RAS-binding domain, the RBDCRD domain of the RAS effector protein CRAF, is fused to the histidine kinase domain, which carries an inactivating amino acid exchange either in its ATP-binding site (N509A) or in its phosphorylation site (H399Q). Dimerization or nanocluster formation of RAS-GTP reconstitutes an active histidine kinase sensor dimer that phosphorylates the response regulator NarL. The phosphorylated DNA-binding protein NarL, fused to the transcription activator domain VP48, binds its responsive element and induces the expression of the output protein. In comparison to mutated RAS, the effect of the RAS activator SOS-1 and the RAS inhibitor NF1 on the sensing ability as well as the tunability of the RAS sensor were examined. A RAS targeting circuit with an AND gate was designed by expressing the RAS sensor proteins under the control of defined MAPK response elements, resulting in a large increase in the dynamic range between mutant and wild-type RAS. Finally, the RAS targeting circuits were evaluated in detail in a set of twelve cancer cell lines expressing endogenous levels of mutant or wild-type RAS or oncogenes affecting RAS signaling upstream or downstream.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This proof-of-concept study convincingly demonstrates the potential of synthetic gene circuits to target oncogenic RAS in tumor cell lines and to function, at least in part, as an RAS mutant cell classifier.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The use of an appropriate &quot;therapeutic gene&quot; might revert the oncogenic properties of RAS mutant cell lines. However, a therapeutic strategy based on this four-plasmid-based system might be difficult to implement in RAS-driven solid cancers.</p>

<p>The manuscript describes an interesting approach towards designing genetic circuits to sense different RAS mutants in the context of cancer therapeutics. The authors created sensors for mutant RAS and incorporated feed-forward control that leverages endogenous RAS/MAPK signaling pathways in order to dramatically increase the circuits' dynamic range. The modularity of the system is explored through the individual screening of several RAS binding domains, transmembrane domains, and MAPK response elements, and the author further extensively screened different combinations of circuit components. This is an impressive synthetic biology demonstration that took it all the way to cancer cell lines. However, given the sole demonstrated output in the form of fluorescent proteins, the authors' claims related to therapeutic implications require additional empirical evidence or, otherwise, expository revision.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>&quot;These therapies are limited to cancers with KRASG12C mutations&quot; is technically accurate. However, in this fast-moving field, there are examples such as MRTX1133 which holds the promise to target the very G12D mutation that is the focus of this paper. There are broader efforts too. It would help the readers better appreciate the background if the authors could update the intro to reflect the most recent landscape of RAS-targeting drugs.</p>
<p>Only KRASG12D was used as a model in the design and optimization work of the genetic circuits. Other mutations should be quite experimentally feasible and comparisons of the circuits' performances across different KRAS mutations would allow for stronger claims on the circuits' generalizability. Particularly, the cancer cell line used for circuit validation harbored a KRASG13D mutation. While the data presented do indeed support the circuit's &quot;generalizability,&quot; the model systems would not have been consistent in the current set of data presented.</p>
<p>In Figure 2a, the text claims that &quot;inactivation of endogenous RAS with NF1 resulted in a lower YFP/RBDCRD-NarX expression,&quot; but Figure 2a does not show a statistically significant reduction in expression of SYFP (measured by &quot;membrane-to-total signal ratio [RU]).</p>
<p>The therapeutic index of the authors' systems would be better characterized by a functional payload, other than florescent proteins, that for example induce cell death, immune responses, etc.</p>
<p>Regarding data presented in &quot;Mechanism of action&quot; (Figure 2), the observations are interesting and consistent across different fluorescent reporters. However, with regard to interpretations of the underlying molecular mechanisms, it is not clear whether the different output levels in 2b, 2c, and 2d are due to the pathway as described by the authors or simply from varied expression levels of RBDCRD-NarX itself (2a) that is nonlinearly amplified by the rest of the circuit. From a practical standpoint, this caveat is not critical with respect to the signal-to-noise ratios in later parts of the paper. From a mechanistic interpretation standpoint, claims made forth in this section are not clearly substantiated. Some additional controls would be nice. For example, if the authors express NarXs that constitutively dimerize on the membrane, what would the RasG12D-responsiveness look like? Does RasG12D alter the input-output curve of NarL-RE? How would Figure 4f compare to a NaxR constitutively dimerized control that only relies on transcriptional amplification of the Ras-dependent promoters? It's also possible that these Ras could affect protein production at the post-transcriptional or even post-translational levels, which were not adequately considered.</p>
<p>The text claims that &quot;in contrast to what we saw in HEK293 overexpressing RAS (Figure 5d), the &quot;AND-gate&quot; RAS-targeting circuits do not generate higher output than the EF1a-driven, binding-triggered RAS sensor in HCT-116. Instead, the improved dynamic range results from decreased leakiness in HCT- 116k.o.&quot; Comparing the experiment from Figure 5d, which looks at activation in KRASG12D and KRASWT, to the experiments in Figure 6b-d, which looks at activation in HCT-116WT and HCT-116KO is misleading. In Fig 5d., cells are transfected with KRASG12D and KRASWT to emulate high levels of mutant RAS and high levels of wild-type RAS. In Figures 6b-d, HCT-116WT has endogenous levels of mutant RAS, while the KCT-116KO is a knock-out cell line, and does not have mutant or WT RAS. Therefore, the improved dynamic range or &quot;decreased leakiness in HCT-116KO&quot; in comparison to Figure 5d. is more comparable to the NF1 condition from Figure 2, which deactivates endogenous RAS. While this may not be feasible, the most accurate comparison would have been an HCT-116KO line with KRASWT stably integrated.</p>
<p>We couldn't locate the citation or discussion of Figure 4d in the text. Conversely, based on the text description, Figure 6g would contain exciting results. But we couldn't find Figure 6g anywhere ... unless it was a typo and the authors meant Figure 6f, in which case the cool results in Figure S8 could use more elaboration in the main text.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mutations that result in consistent RAS activation constitute a major driver of cancer. Therefore, RAS is a favorable target for cancer therapy. However, since normal RAS activity is essential for the function of normal cells, a mechanism that differentiates aberrant RAS activity from normal one is required to avoid severe adverse effects. To this end, the authors designed and optimized a synthetic gene circuit that is induced by active RAS-GTP. The circuit components, such as RAS-GTP sensors, dimerization domains, and linkers. To enhance the circuit selectivity and dynamic range, the authors designed a synthetic promoter comprised of MAPK-responsive elements to regulate the expression of the RAS sensors, thus generating a feed-forward loop regulating the circuit components. Circuit outputs with respect to circuit design modification were characterized in standard model cell lines using basal RAS activity, active RAS mutants, and RAS inactivation.</p>
<p>This approach is interesting. The design is novel and could be implemented for other RAS-mediated applications. The data support the claims, and while this circuit may require further optimization for clinical application, it is an interesting proof of concept for targeting aberrant RAS activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Novel circuit design, through optimization and characterization of the circuit components, solid data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This manuscript could significantly benefit from testing the circuit performance in more realistic cell lines, such as patient-derived cells driven by RAS mutations, as well as in corresponding non-cancer cell lines with normal RAS activity. Furthermore, testing with therapeutic output proteins in vitro, and especially in vivo, would significantly strengthen the findings and claims.</p>
