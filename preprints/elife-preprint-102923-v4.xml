<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Short-term facilitation of recurrent excitatory synapses within the cortical network has been proposed to support persistent activity during working memory tasks, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We characterized short-term plasticity at the local excitatory synapses in layer 2/3 of the rat medial prefrontal cortex and studied its presynaptic mechanisms. Low-frequency stimulation induced slowly developing facilitation, whereas high-frequency stimulation initially induced strong depression followed by rapid facilitation. This non-monotonic delayed facilitation after a brief depression resulted from a high vesicular fusion probability and slow activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent vesicle replenishment, which led to the overfilling of release sites beyond their basal occupancy. Pharmacological and gene knockdown (KD) experiments revealed that the facilitation was mediated by phospholipase C/diacylglycerol signaling and synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7). Notably, Syt7 KD abolished facilitation and slowed the refilling rate of vesicles with high fusion probability. Furthermore, Syt7 deficiency in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons impaired the acquisition of trace fear memory and reduced c-Fos activity. In conclusion, Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Syt7-dependent overfilling of release sites mediates synaptic facilitation at layer 2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses and contributes to temporal associative learning.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We re-wrote some part in the revised manuscript (line 285) as follows:
'Recent morphological and functional studies revealed that elevation of [Ca2+]o induces an increase in the number of TS or docked vesicles to a similar extent as our observation (Kusick et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2025), raising a possibility that an increase in pocc is responsible for the 1.23-fold increase in EPSC at high [Ca2+]o. A slight but significant reduction in PPR was observed under high [Ca2+]ₒ too. An increase in pocc is thought to be associated with that in the baseline vesicle refilling rate. While PPR is always reduced by an increase in pv, the effects of refilling rate to PPR is complicated. For example, PPR can be reduced by both a decrease (Figure 2-figure supplement 1) and an increase (Lin et al., 2025) in the refilling rate induced by EGTA-AM and PDBu, respectively. Thus, the slight reduction in PPR is not contradictory to the possible contribution of pocc to the high [Ca2+]o effects.'

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Synapses in the mammalian central nervous system undergo activity-dependent modulation of synaptic weight during repetitive stimulation, known as short-term synaptic plasticity (STP). STP is mediated by presynaptic mechanisms that regulate the release probability (p<sub>r</sub>), size of the readily releasable pool (RRP), and kinetics of vesicle replenishment of RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jackman and Regehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). Short-term depression has been observed at synapses with a high baseline p<sub>r</sub>, primarily because of the rapid depletion of releasable vesicles during high-frequency stimulation (HFS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, vesicle depletion is less pronounced at synapses with a low baseline p<sub>r</sub>, and cumulative increases in p<sub>r</sub> during HFS are considered to mediate short-term facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Rozov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pan and Zucker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aldahabi et al., 2024</xref>). Central synapses exhibit a wide spectrum of STP depending on different combinations of presynaptic factors mediating short-term depression and facilitation.</p>
<p>Previously, facilitation was modeled as an increase in p<sub>r</sub> after an action potential (AP) and its slow decay during the inter-spike interval (ISI), resulting in a cumulative increase in p<sub>r</sub> during HFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Markram et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dittman et al., 2000</xref>). Recent studies have suggested that the number of docking (or release) sites in an active zone is limited and only partially occupied by releasable vesicles in the resting states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pulido and Marty, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Malagon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, p<sub>r</sub> is determined by the vesicular fusion probability (p<sub>v</sub>) and release site occupancy (p<sub>occ</sub>). However, distinguishing the individual contributions of p<sub>v</sub> and p<sub>occ</sub> to p<sub>r</sub> is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Silva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Neher, 2024</xref>). It is also unclear whether facilitation is mediated by activity-dependent increases in the p<sub>v</sub>, p<sub>occ</sub>, or both.</p>
<p>Two recent models for vesicle priming and release view the ‘priming’ as a two-step reversible process that leads to a release-ready state. The release-ready vesicles could be vesicles in a tightly docked state (TS) or those occupying specialized docking sites (DS), and are supplied from vesicles in a loosely docked state (LS) or those occupying a distinct replacement sites (RS), which are called LS/TS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aldahabi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Neher, 2024</xref>) and RS/DS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Silva et al., 2021</xref>), respectively. Common to both models is the assumption that release-ready vesicles constitute only a fraction of all docked vesicles under resting conditions and that this fraction is up- and down-regulated by synaptic activity.</p>
<p>Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) was recently found to play a crucial role in facilitation at different types of central synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jackman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Martinetti et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to its role in facilitation, Syt7 accelerates refilling of the RRP after depletion and mediates asynchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jackman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tawfik et al., 2021</xref>). Syt7-dependent synaptic facilitation is interpreted as an activity-dependent increase in p<sub>v</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Turecek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jackman and Regehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Turecek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Norman et al., 2023</xref>). However, it is unclear whether Syt7 contributes to facilitation through a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increase in p<sub>occ</sub> (i.e., overfilling). Overfilling has been proposed as a mechanism supporting facilitation at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kobbersmed et al., 2020</xref>), yet whether this process also occurs at the mammalian central synapses mediated by Syt7 has not been studied.</p>
<p>Each of layer 2/3 (L2/3) and layer 5 (L5) of neocortex displays intralaminar excitatory synapses between pyramidal cells comprising a recurrent network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Holmgren et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Thomson and Lamy, 2007</xref>). Short-term facilitation at recurrent excitatory synapses in a cortical network may play a crucial role in maintaining working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mongillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hansel and Mato, 2013</xref>). Although L2/3 pyramidal cells (PCs) represent task-relevant information during a delay period in working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ozdemir et al., 2020</xref>), most studies on local excitatory recurrent synapses in the neocortex have focused on L5 exhibiting short-term depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Reyes and Sakmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hempel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yoon et al., 2020</xref>). Further, the synaptic properties of excitatory synapses in L2/3 remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>In the present study, we found that HFS of local excitatory synapses in L2/3 of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) induced initial strong depression followed by delayed facilitation, whereas low-frequency stimulation induced slow monotonous facilitation. This unique form of STP could be explained by 1) high p<sub>v</sub> of RRP vesicles at rest and throughout a train stimulation; 2) the low resting vesicular occupancy of RRP and its activity-dependent increase. These conditions led to delayed facilitation through progressive overfilling of release sites during HFS with high p<sub>v</sub> vesicles beyond the resting occupancy. Syt7 knockdown (KD) in L2/3 PCs completely abolished these synaptic enhancements by inhibiting the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increase in release site occupancy. Finally, behavioral tests for trace fear conditioning showed that Syt7 KD impaired the acquisition of trace fear memory and reduced c-Fos expression in the mPFC. Collectively, these results support that Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Syt7-dependent overfilling of release sites mediates synaptic facilitation at L2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses and contributes to temporal associative learning.</p>

<title>Frequency dependence of STP at local excitatory synapses in L2/3 of the prelimbic cortex</title>
<p>We examined STP profiles at recurrent excitatory synapses between L2/3 PCs and at synapses from L2/3-PCs to fast-spiking interneurons (FSINs) in the prelimbic area of the rat mPFC. The PCs and FSINs were identified based on their distinct intrinsic properties and morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To stimulate presynaptic PCs, L2/3 PCs were transfected with a plasmid encoding oChIEF using <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation (IUE; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lee et al., 2024</xref>).

<p>Given that IUE transfected approximately 10-20% of L2/3 PCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), we made a whole-cell patch on a non-transfected L2/3 PC or an FSIN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To stimulate a minimal number of excitatory axon fibers, EPSCs were evoked using minimal optical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>; 470 nm, 3-4 μm in radius and 3-5 ms in duration). EPSCs evoked by minimal stimulation were examined to determine the uniformity of the kinetic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B-C</xref>). Moreover, we reassessed the kinetics of EPSCs during trains <italic>post hoc</italic> to ensure uniformity. EPSCs were evoked by 20-pulse trains at 4 different frequencies (5, 10, 20, and 40 Hz) to cover the range of firing rates of PCs observed <italic>in vivo</italic> during working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baeg et al., 2003</xref>). Excitatory synapses from PCs onto both other PCs and FSINs (PC–PC and PC–FSIN) showed strong (∼2-fold enhancement) and lasting (several seconds) short-term facilitation at 20 Hz and lower frequencies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>). The PC-PC synapses exhibited stronger facilitation than did the PC-FSIN synapses.</p>
<p>Steady-state EPSCs at the PC-PC synapses were not significantly different from 5 to 20 Hz (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Frequency invariance at the PC-PC synapses suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent synaptic facilitation may counteract vesicle depletion in a frequency-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Turecek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Despite facilitation at all frequencies, the paired pulse ratio (PPR) rapidly decreased as the ISI decreased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref><italic>, I</italic>). At 40 Hz stimulation, both PC-PC and PC-FSIN synapses initially underwent strong depression then followed by facilitation in a few stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dd, Ed</xref>). Such delayed facilitation after paired pulse depression (PPD) has not been previously observed in central synapses except for a slight increase in EPSC at the cerebellar synapses under artificially depolarized conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pulido and Marty, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>We confirmed that optically evoked EPSCs were strictly dependent on AP generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>), suggesting that EPSCs are evoked by optical stimulation of presynaptic axon fibers rather than by direct depolarization of presynaptic boutons. Additionally, dual patch-clamp techniques showed that the STP of optically evoked EPSCs did not differ from the electrically evoked STP of EPSCs at the PC-FSIN synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Finally, we confirmed that AMPA receptor (AMPAR) desensitization was not responsible for PPD at 40 Hz, ruling out the possible effects of postsynaptic factors on STP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>), and that AMPAR saturation was not significant during facilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Delayed facilitation results from slow activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent vesicle replenishment at a constantly high vesicular fusion probability</title>
<p>The strong PPD at 40 Hz suggests a high vesicular fusion probability (p<sub>v</sub>) and likely tight coupling of the releasable vesicles to a Ca<sup>2+</sup> source. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of EGTA, a slow calcium chelator, on synaptic transmission at the PC-PC synapses. The baseline EPSC amplitude (EPSC<sub>1</sub>) was not affected by incubation of the slice in the bath solution containing 50 μM EGTA-AM for longer than 20 min, supporting tight coupling. Moreover, the PPR was decreased to 0.19, and subsequent facilitation slowed but was still distinct (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>). These findings indicate that the initial p<sub>v</sub> should be higher than 0.81 considering vesicle recruitment during ISI. The effects of EGTA-AM were confirmed in the same cell by measuring the baseline EPSC and PPR before and after applying EGTA-AM to the bath. EPSC<sub>1</sub> remained unchanged, while PPR was reduced by half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2.1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The plot of the rate constant for the increase in EPSCs (denoted as <bold>k</bold><sub>STF</sub>, the rate constant for the development of short-term facilitation) as a function of the stimulation frequency (<italic>f<sub>stim</sub></italic>) revealed a linear relationship (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). <bold>k</bold><sub>STF</sub> in the presence of EGTA-AM was distinctly below this relationship, supporting the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent acceleration of facilitation. <bold>k</bold><sub>STF</sub> was also accelerated when the stimulation frequency was increased from 5 Hz to 40 Hz (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; 1.27 ± 0.18/s to 24.27 ± 3.44/s). Notably, the second 40-Hz train stimulation led to strong PPD, followed by accelerated facilitation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>). The strong PPD suggests that the vesicular fusion probability kept high during the 5-Hz stimulation, arguing against the possibility for an increase in p<sub>v</sub>. Both two-step sequential priming models, LS/TS and RS/DS models, are suitable to interpret our data and we will refer to the different populations of vesicles as TS and LS vesicles, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Taschenberger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Neher, 2024</xref>). Within this framework, vesicles are released from TS with high p<sub>v</sub> both in the resting state and during facilitation, and the delayed facilitation is seen as a result of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent progressive increase in the occupancy of TS vesicles on docking sites.</p>

<title>Release sites have low baseline occupancy and these are increased during facilitation and post-tetanic augmentation</title>
<p>Given that p<sub>v</sub> was greater than 0.8, the two-fold increase in EPSC during 20 pulse train stimulations could not be explained by an increase in p<sub>v</sub>. Recent studies have shown that vesicle release sites (N) are limited in number and are partially occupied at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pulido and Marty, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Malagon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Under such a high p<sub>v</sub>, two-fold synaptic facilitation should be attributed to an increase in p<sub>occ</sub>. The vesicle replenishment rate is accelerated during HFS in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hosoi et al., 2007</xref>). This may lead to the overfilling of release sites beyond their basal vesicular occupancy, which in turn may increase EPSC under high p<sub>v</sub>. To test this hypothesis, we determined the quantal parameters at the L2/3 local excitatory synapses. We first measured the quantal size from asynchronous release events after replacing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with Sr<sup>2+</sup>, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yoon et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). The mean and coefficient of variance of the quantal sizes were 24 pA and 0.25 at PC-PC synapses, respectively, and were 30 pA and 0.31 at PC-FSIN synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we performed a variance-mean (V-M) analysis of phasic EPSCs at excitatory synapses during train stimulation at 5 Hz and 40 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Scheuss et al., 2002</xref>). Applying multiple-probability fluctuation analysis (MPFA) using intra-site quantal variability of 0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Valera et al., 2012</xref>), the V-M plot was best fitted by the number of release sites (N) of 5.3 and the quantal size (q) of 25 pA at the PC-PC synapses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The p<sub>r</sub> for EPSC<sub>1</sub> was calculated as 0.32.

<p>The p<sub>r</sub> estimate was clearly smaller than the possible minimum value for p<sub>v</sub> (0.81) estimated from the PPR data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Given that p<sub>r</sub> is a product of p<sub>occ</sub> and p<sub>v</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Neher, 2024</xref>), a p<sub>r</sub> smaller than p<sub>v</sub> indicates the partial occupancy of release sites in the resting state. If synaptic facilitation were mediated by the recruitment of new release sites, it would be accompanied by an increase in the variance of augmented EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Valera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kobbersmed et al., 2020</xref>). However, the augmented EPSCs during facilitation followed the same parabola in the V-M plot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Therefore, facilitation appears to be mediated by the progressive overfilling of a finite number of release sites beyond the basal occupancy. In the next section, we show that p<sub>v</sub> is close to unity based on high double failure rate upon paired pulse stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and little effect of extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) elevation on baseline EPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Assuming this, the baseline p<sub>r</sub> at the first pulse estimated from the fitted parabolic curve can be largely regarded as a baseline p<sub>occ</sub> (c.a. 30%), and the two-fold increase in EPSCs during facilitation can be attributed to an increase of up to 60% in p<sub>occ</sub>.</p>
<p>We investigated the time course of recovery from facilitation and post-tetanic augmentation (PTA) by applying dual-train stimulations (30 pulses at 40 Hz) separated by different inter-burst intervals (IBIs; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>). The initial EPSCs in the second train were enhanced by more than twofold, and followed by a strong PPD, suggesting that fusion probability stays high in the IBIs and thus synaptic transmission is carried by TS vesicles. The decay time course of PTA was characterized by two phases (initially fast and later slow; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), which may reflect a two-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup> decay or two distinct recovery processes that occur sequentially. The variance of potentiated EPSCs measured at IBIs of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 s was not different from that of EPSCs at the peak of facilitation (filled circles, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Given that the same RRP mediates both facilitation and augmentation and that post-tetanic EPSCs is carried by TS vesicles similar to the baseline EPSCs, this plot suggests that PTA, similar to short-term facilitation, is mediated by an increase in the TS vesicle occupancy.</p>

<title>High double failure rate and little effect of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> elevation on baseline EPSC amplitudes suggest that vesicular fusion probability is close to one</title>
<p>The vesicle dynamics of STP has been explained using a simple refilling model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hosoi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>). This model assumes that the vesicles are reversibly docked to a limited number of release sites (N) with forward and reverse rate constants (denoted as k<sub>1</sub> and b<sub>1</sub>, respectively). Under the framework of the simple refilling model (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>), the rate constant for the refilling of the RRP after depletion by the first pulse is the sum of the baseline k<sub>1</sub> and b<sub>1</sub>. This is estimated as 23/s from the plot of PPR as a function of ISIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). From the baseline occupancy of 0.3 and p<sub>occ</sub> = k<sub>1</sub> / (k<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>), we estimated k<sub>1</sub> to be 6.9/s.</p>
<p>When paired APs were applied with an ISI of 20 ms, the failure rate at 1<sup>st</sup> pulse, P(F<sub>1</sub>), was 10.6%, and the probability of two consecutive failures, P(F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>), was 6.2% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). From the equation P(F<sub>1</sub>) = (1 – p<sub>r</sub>)<sup>N</sup>, p<sub>r</sub> was calculated as 0.312 when N = 6, comparable to p<sub>r</sub> (= 0.32) estimated from the V-M analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We calculated P(F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>) under the framework of a simple refilling model, with p<sub>v</sub> and k<sub>1</sub> set as free parameters and other parameters set according to the following relationships: P(F<sub>1</sub>) = (1 – p<sub>r</sub>)<sup>N</sup>, p<sub>r</sub> = p<sub>v</sub> · p<sub>occ</sub>, and p<sub>occ</sub> = k<sub>1</sub> / (k<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>). The calculated values for P(F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>) and their difference from the observed value (6.2%) are shown in the plane of k<sub>1</sub> <italic>vs</italic>. p<sub>v</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>. Given that k<sub>1</sub> was greater than 5/s, the difference between the calculated and observed values of P(F<sub>1</sub>,F<sub>2</sub>) was minimal when p<sub>v</sub> = 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>To find optimal values for k<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>v</sub> that best explain observed probabilities shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2Ac</xref>, a cost function was implemented as the sum of squared errors between observed and predicted probability values for the four combinations of success and failure of 1st and 2nd EPSCs as described in <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>. The minimum of the cost function (5.63 x 10<sup>-5</sup>) was found at k<sub>1</sub> = 5.21/s and p<sub>v</sub> = 0.999, which predicted P<sub>11</sub> = 41.5%, P<sub>10</sub> = 47.9%, P<sub>01</sub> = 4.93%, and P<sub>00</sub> = 5.67% (subscript 1 and 0 denote success and failure, respectively).</p>
<p>To further validate that baseline p<sub>v</sub> is near to unity, we examined EPSC changes following elevation of [Ca²⁺]ₒ from 1.3 to 2.5 mM. According to the fourth-power relationship between synaptic responses and [Ca²⁺]ₒ (<xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 3</xref> in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dodge Jr and Rahamimoff, 1967</xref>)), a 3.24-fold increase in the EPSC amplitude was expected. However, the EPSC amplitude increased only 1.23-fold in average, a change that was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This small response suggests that p<sub>v</sub> is already saturated at rest, limiting the dynamic range for further enhancement through increased calcium influx. Recent morphological and functional studies revealed that elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> induces an increase in the number of TS or docked vesicles to a similar extent as our observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kusick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lin et al., 2025</xref>), raising a possibility that an increase in p<sub>occ</sub> is responsible for the 1.23-fold increase in EPSC at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. A slight but significant reduction in PPR was observed under high [Ca²⁺]ₒ too. An increase in p<sub>occ</sub> is thought to be associated with that in the baseline vesicle refilling rate. While PPR is always reduced by an increase in p<sub>v</sub>, the effects of refilling rate to PPR is complicated. For example, PPR can be reduced by both a decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2.1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and an increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lin et al., 2025</xref>) in the refilling rate induced by EGTA-AM and PDBu, respectively. Thus, the slight reduction in PPR is not contradictory to the possible contribution of p<sub>occ</sub> to the high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> effects.</p>

<title>Pharmacological manipulations reveal specific molecular identities underlying vesicle loading processes</title>
<p>Our results suggest that the baseline occupancy of TS vesicles is low and that the activity-dependent progressive overfilling of docking sites with TS vesicles is responsible for short-term facilitation and augmentation. To elucidate the specific molecular link between synaptic enhancement and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent overfilling, we examined the effects of several drugs known to affect vesicle dynamics. We first examined the roles of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol (DAG) by applying 5 µM U73122, a PLC inhibitor, or 20 µM 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), a DAG analog. The STP at 40 Hz and PTA at 0.5-s interval were examined before and after applying each drug to the bath. For both drugs, the facilitation and augmentation were reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>). U73122 did not affect the basal EPSC amplitude (EPSC<sub>1</sub>) but resulted in a stronger PPD, slower facilitation, and lower augmentation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). These effects of U73122 suggest the involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced PLC activation in progressive overfilling. In contrast, OAG increased EPSC<sub>1</sub> while maintaining a pronounced PPD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating an increase in the TS vesicle pool size. Meanwhile, OAG slowed <bold>k</bold><sub>STF</sub> and reduced augmentation, indicating occlusion of activity-dependent synaptic facilitation. Phorbol esters and DAG are thought to accelerate priming through Munc13 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Taschenberger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aldahabi et al., 2022</xref>); they also shorten the bridges that interlink docked vesicles with the active zone (AZ) membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Papantoniou et al., 2023</xref>). Collectively, these suggest that PLC- and DAG-mediated signaling play a role in the overfilling of docking sites underlying short-term facilitation and augmentation.</p>

<p>Although the acceleration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent vesicle refilling supports rapid facilitation at 40 Hz, the later part of the delayed facilitation underwent a slight depression, which was more pronounced during the second burst (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Sustained synaptic transmission is limited by the spatial availability of docking sites because it is undermined by accumulation of exocytic remainings in the presynaptic AZ during HFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Neher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Haucke et al., 2011</xref>). To verify this, we examined the effects of dynasore (100 µM), a specific inhibitor of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Macia et al., 2006</xref>). The treatment with dynasore did not influence EPSC<sub>1</sub> or the early phase of facilitation, but it exacerbated depression during the later phase and attenuated PTA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that late synaptic transmission during the 40-Hz train is limited by site clearance.</p>
<p>Given the involvement of actin polymerization in the multiple steps of vesicle docking and recycling, we examined the effects of 20 µM latrunculin B (LatB), an inhibitor of actin polymerization. The effects of LatB were complicated: (1) EPSC<sub>1</sub> was decreased, whereas PPR was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Da</xref>) and (2) facilitation and augmentation were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Db</xref>). The latter effect may result from defects in vesicle replenishment rates, either through the impaired physical movement of vesicles or disrupted site clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sakaba and Neher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hallermann and Silver, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miki et al., 2016</xref>), as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent vesicle refilling mediates facilitation and augmentation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Meanwhile, the former effect might be attributed to a shift in equilibrium in the priming states towards a loosely docked state (LS) at rest. It is unknown whether actin affects vesicular fusogenicity in neurons, although it facilitates multiple steps of vesicle fusion by enhancing membrane tension in neuroendocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Wu and Chan, 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Short-term facilitation at both types of local excitatory synapses in L2/3 is abolished by Syt7 knockdown</title>
<p>We examined whether Syt7 mediates facilitation at the PC-PC and PC-FSIN synapses in L2/3 of the mPFC. To this end, oChIEF and shRNA against Syt7 (shSyt7) were co-expressed in L2/3 PCs using IUE. Syt7 KD resulted in a complete loss of facilitation at all tested stimulation frequencies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref>). Short-term depression and paired-pulse depression were more pronounced as the stimulation frequency increased, and the frequency invariance of steady-state EPSC was abolished, implying little contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent vesicle recruitment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-F</xref>). The lack of facilitation could not be attributed to the failure of APs in presynaptic axons, as optical stimulation elicited reliable APs in Syt7 KD PCs during the 40-Hz train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Syt7 KD had little effect on the basal properties, including the peak amplitude, rise/decay time, and time-to-peak, of single AP-induced EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D-E</xref>).

<p>To examine whether Syt7 KD had any nonautonomous effects on postsynaptic cells, we measured the quantal size (q) from asynchronous events in the presence of Sr<sup>2+</sup> and found that the mean quantal size remained unaltered at Syt7 KD synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This indicated that Syt7 did not influence postsynaptic parameters, including the density and kinetic properties of AMPARs. To test the specificity of shSyt7, we examined whether co-expression of the shRNA-resistant form of Syt7 restored synaptic facilitation in both excitatory synapse types. Presynaptic overexpression of shRNA-resistant Syt7 under the CAG promoter rescued the effect of shRNA at both PC-PC and PC-FSIN synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5.2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

<title>TS vesicle recovery following depletion is accelerated by Syt7</title>
<p>Syt7 is recognized not only for its crucial role in facilitation, but also for mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent replenishment of releasable vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tawfik et al., 2021</xref>). Given that facilitation at L2/3 excitatory synapses is driven by progressive overfilling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), the loss of facilitation at Syt7 KD synapses in the present study implies that Syt7 plays a key role in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent acceleration of refilling and overfilling of the docking sites with TS vesicles. To test this hypothesis, we examined the recovery kinetics of EPSCs after TS vesicles were depleted by 3 pulses at 40 Hz in wild-type (WT) and Syt7 KD synapses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Strong PPD was observed not only in the first burst, but also in the second burst. This suggested that EPSCs in the second burst were mediated by TS vesicles, similar to those in the first burst (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref><italic>, D</italic>). Therefore, EPSC<sub>1</sub> in the second burst can be interpreted as a release from TS vesicles recovering during a given IBI. The recovery time course of EPSC<sub>1</sub> in the second burst indicated full recovery of TS vesicles within 100 ms in both excitatory synapse types in WT rats (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref><italic>, F</italic>). However, this recovery was remarkably slower in Syt7 KD synapses, requiring 5 s for full recovery, indicating that TS vesicle recovery was greatly accelerated by Syt7. Overall, synaptic facilitation and augmentation at local excitatory synapses in L2/3 can be ascribed to progressive activity-dependent increases in the occupancy of TS vesicles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), in which Syt7 plays a key role.</p>

<title>Behavioral consequences of Syt7 KD in L2/3 PCs of the mPFC</title>
<p>We previously proposed that the disparity in STP between the PC-PC and PC-IN synapses results in activity-dependent changes in the ratio of synaptic weights at the PC-PC and PC-IN synapses (J<sub>ee</sub>/J<sub>ie</sub>). This may in turn have a profound influence on persistent activity in a recurrent network by biasing the E-I balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yoon et al., 2020</xref>). Syt7 KD not only eliminated facilitation, but also the activity-dependent increase in the J<sub>ee</sub>/J<sub>ie</sub> ratio in the L2/3 network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8.1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests the possibility that Syt7 contributes to the persistent activity during working memory tasks in the L2/3 recurrent network. Trace fear conditioning (tFC) requires associative learning between an auditory cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) and temporally separate aversive events (unconditioned stimulus, US). The formation of trace fear memory requires the prelimbic area of the mPFC and hippocampus. mPFC activity during the trace interval is thought to temporarily hold CS information, enabling the network to associate temporally discontinuous events (i.e., temporal associative learning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gilmartin et al., 2013</xref>). Synaptic facilitation and augmentation are implicated in temporary memory retention in recurrent networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mongillo et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that Syt7 is crucial for synaptic facilitation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) and augmentation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) in prelimbic L2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses, we tested whether trace fear memory formation was impaired in rats with depleted Syt7 transcripts, specifically in the L2/3 PCs of the mPFC. Syt7-targeted shRNA (shSyt7) or scrambled shRNA (Scr) constructs were transfected bilaterally into the L2/3 PCs of the mPFC using IUE (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Both the Scr-transfected control and shSyt7-transfected rats underwent tFC training (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gilmartin et al. (2013)</xref>, in which prefrontal persistent firing was optogenetically inhibited, WT and KD animals exhibited similar freezing behavior during this acquisition phase. The following day, the rats were subjected to a tone test in which trace fear memory formation was assessed from the freezing response to a tone alone in a distinct context. Compared to the control group, the shSyt7-transfected group exhibited significantly lower levels of freezing behavior in response to auditory cues during the first four trials, suggesting an impairment in trace memory formation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>).</p>

<p>The tone test was repeated the following day to test for extinction memory formation. Syt7 KD animals exhibited much less freezing to the CS (+1d) than did WT animals. Considering the Rescorla-Wagner model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Yau and McNally, 2023</xref>), our results suggest that the strength of CS-US associative memory was weaker in KD animals than in WT animals; thus, the acquisition of trace fear memory was impaired by Syt7 KD in the L2/3 PCs of the mPFC.</p>
<p>Next, we assessed the locomotor activity and anxiety levels of rats using the open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze test (EPM). Scr controls and Syt7 KD rats showed similar exploratory patterns, displaying comparable total distance moved and time spent in the periphery of the OFT or the open/closed arms of the EPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8.2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that the acquisition of trace fear memory requires elevated trace activity in prelimbic PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gilmartin et al., 2013</xref>). Given that c-Fos, an immediate early gene, is upregulated following patterned activities in neurons, its expression is considered a reliable indicator of recent neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fields et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guzowski et al., 2005</xref>).

<p>To elucidate the activation patterns of specific neuronal populations, we performed immunohistochemical co-labeling of c-Fos and GAD67 (a GABAergic interneuron marker) upon tFC acquisition. The density of c-Fos(+) cells and the percentage of c-Fos(+) cells among GAD67(+) cells in all prelimbic layers were significantly lower in Syt7 KD rats than in control rats (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F-G</xref>). Additionally, analysis of the proportion of active cells among transfected L2/3 PCs (c-Fos+/GFP+) revealed that Syt7 KD L2/3 PCs were significantly more active than Scr-transfected PCs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref>). This unexpected hyperactivity of Syt7 KD PCs may be attributed to the high reciprocal connectivity between PCs and FSINs in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Holmgren et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Otsuka and Kawaguchi, 2009</xref>), as PCs with short-term depression would transmit less input to FSINs, which in turn would exert less feedback inhibition on reciprocally connected PCs. Collectively, these findings show that the slow activation of vesicle refilling supports various forms of facilitation at excitatory synapses in PFC L2/3, which is essential for neuronal activity during temporal associative learning.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study characterized STP at local excitatory synapses in the L2/3 network of the rat mPFC at physiological extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. These synapses displayed initial strong depression and then delayed facilitation at 40 Hz, while monotonous slowly developing facilitation was observed at lower frequencies. Our study suggests that such delayed facilitation after a brief depression results from a high p<sub>v</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), along with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent delayed acceleration of vesicle refilling and overfilling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The two-fold increase in EPSC during 20 pulse train stimulations under the condition of such a high p<sub>v</sub> suggests a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increase in the vesicle replenishment rate during a train; this then leads to overfilling of release sites beyond their incomplete basal occupancy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>). The high p<sub>v</sub> and strong PPD did not result from artificial bouton stimulation, AMPAR desensitization, or any potential distortion caused by optogenetic methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.5">5</xref>). Additionally, similar to short-term facilitation, PTA could be explained by an increase in the TS vesicle occupancy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-E</xref>), consistent with previous studies showing post-tetanic increases in the p<sub>occ</sub> and/or vesicle pool size at various types of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Vandael et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tran et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Silva et al., 2024</xref>). These findings suggest that release sites are partially occupied at rest and that a progressive overfilling of release sites with TS vesicles underlies facilitation and augmentation at intracortical L2/3 excitatory synapses.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Definition of vesicular release probability in the present and previous studies</title>
<p>Previous studies for post-tetanic augmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Stevens and Wesseling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Garcia-Perez and Wesseling, 2008</xref>) observed invariance of the RRP size after tetanic stimulation. In these studies, the RRP size was estimated by hypertonic sucrose solution or as the sum of EPSCs evoked 20 Hz/60 pulses train (denoted as ‘RRP<sub>hyper</sub>’). Because reluctant vesicles can be quickly converted to TS vesicles (16/s) and are released during a train (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), it is likely that the RRP size measured by these methods encompasses both LS and TS vesicles. In contrast, we assert high p<sub>v</sub> based on the observation of strong PPD, failure rates upon paired stimulations at ISI of 20 ms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given that single AP-induced vesicular release occurs from TS vesicles but not from LS vesicles, p<sub>v</sub> in the present study indicates the fusion probability of TS vesicles. From the same reasons, p<sub>occ</sub> denotes the occupancy of release sites by TS vesicles. Note that our study does not provide direct clue whether release sites are occupied by LS vesicles that are not tapped by a single AP, although an increase in the LS vesicle number may accelerate the recovery of TS vesicles. As suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Neher (2024)</xref>, even if the number of LS plus TS vesicles are kept constant, an increase in p<sub>occ</sub> (occupancy by TS vesicles) would be interpreted as an increase in ‘vesicular release probability’ if it was measured based on RRP<sub>hyper</sub>.</p>
<p>By the way, it should be noted that increases in both p<sub>v</sub> and p<sub>occ</sub> may contribute to PTA. Post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) and phorbol esters had similar effects on baseline EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Taschenberger et al., 2016</xref>), and PDBu increased both the TS vesicle pool size (1.9-fold) and fusion probability of TS vesicles (1.3-fold) at the calyx synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lin et al., 2025</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that PTP may increase both p<sub>occ</sub> and p<sub>v</sub> of TS vesicles, although it has not been yet directly tested. Moreover, acceleration of the latency in the hypertonicity-induced vesicle release raises a possibility for an increase in fusion probability of TS vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Stevens and Wesseling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Garcia-Perez and Wesseling, 2008</xref>), although it is still controversial that the acceleration of the release latency represents a reduction in the activation energy barrier for vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schotten et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Progressive overfilling of docking sites</title>
<p>Conventional models for facilitation assume an increase in p<sub>v</sub> after an AP of RRP vesicles, which had been in a low p<sub>v</sub> or reluctant state at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dittman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Turecek et al., 2016</xref>). This facilitation model is unlikely to explain our results, because TS vesicles are predominantly released not only at rest but also in the facilitated state during or after train stimulation, as evidenced by the strong PPD (ISI, 25 ms) during a 5-Hz train (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>) and at different intervals after a 40-Hz/30 pulse trains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, the PPD (ISI, 25 ms) remained pronounced during the early phase of facilitation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), arguing against the possibility of slowly increasing the p<sub>v</sub> of reluctant vesicles. These results suggested that facilitation was mediated by an activity-dependent progressive increase in occupancy of TS vesicles (TS occupancy). Facilitation through an increase in TS occupancy has been termed frequency facilitation, differentiating it from paired pulse facilitation that relies on a residual calcium-dependent transient increase in the p<sub>v</sub> of releasable vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Neher, 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Assuming an increase in TS occupancy, to attain a two-fold increase in EPSC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), the baseline occupancy of the docking sites by TS vesicles should be low, as estimated from the V-M plot (c.a. 30% in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). However, it is unclear whether the remaining docking sites that are not occupied by TS vesicles are truly vacant or are occupied by reluctant LS vesicles that are not released by the AP or AP trains. TS vesicles can be supplied by the transformation of LS to TS vesicles, both of which reside at the same docking site (LS/TS model; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Neher, 2024</xref>). Alternatively, TS vesicles can be supplied from a distinct replacement pool (RS/DS model; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Silva et al., 2021</xref>). Further studies, including ultrastructural analyses of active zones, are required to address this issue.</p>
<p>Given the crucial role of Syt7 in facilitation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), the facilitation mechanisms are closely related to how Syt7 mediates synaptic facilitation. Based on the slow kinetics of Syt7, previous computational modeling studies have proposed that Syt7 may mediate short-term facilitation through an activity-dependent increase in p<sub>v</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Turecek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jackman and Regehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Turecek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Norman et al., 2023</xref>). The present study, however, found that both facilitation and augmentation were mediated by overfilling of the release sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, Syt7-KD synapses displayed slower recovery of TS vesicles (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). These results suggest that Syt7 is essential for activity-dependent overfilling of docking sites with TS vesicles. Whereas the baseline EPSC was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), and complementary changes in the number of docking sites and their baseline occupancy were observed in Syt7 KD synapses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). These results raise a possibility that Syt7 may play a role in providing additional vacant docking sites that can be overfilled during facilitation. It remains to be elucidated whether the decrease in the number of docking sites at Syt7 KD synapses is related to the subcellular localization of Syt7 to the plasma membrane of the active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Sugita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Vevea et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>STP model in light of known Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding kinetics of Syt7</title>
<p>Syt7 acts as an upstream Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that facilitates activity-dependent replenishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bacaj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tawfik et al., 2021</xref>). The present study shows that EPSCs are mediated by TS vesicles both at rest and during activity-dependent facilitation. Releasable vesicles are homogeneous, and Syt7-dependent overfilling is responsible for the activity-dependent enhancement of EPSCs. Thus, we tested whether slowly developing facilitation could be replicated within the framework of a simple refilling model based on the known Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding kinetics of Syt7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>). To this end, we made following assumptions: (1) a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increase in the forward refilling rate (k<sub>1</sub>) requires a full Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound form of Syt7, to which multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions can bind (two or three Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions on each C2A and/or C2B domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Voleti et al., 2017</xref>); (2) sequential Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding steps are synergistic through a cooperativity factor, <italic>b</italic>; (3) Syt7 senses AP-induced local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] similar to that estimated at the calyx of Held (a Gaussian function with a full width at half maximum value of 0.2 ms and a peak of 40 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Wang et al., 2008</xref>); and (4) residual [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] follows a mono-exponential function with an amplitude of 1 μM and decay time constant of 50 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jackson and Redman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Under these assumptions and the framework of the simple refilling model, slow and delayed facilitation could be replicated by modeling k<sub>1</sub> as k<sub>1</sub> = k<sub>1,b</sub> + K<sub>1,max</sub> × [Syt7: n Ca<sup>2+</sup>], where [Syt7: n Ca<sup>2+</sup>] represents the fraction of fully Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound Syt7 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A-C</xref>). Syt7 was slowly activated over the course of the stimulus train, suggesting that the cooperative binding of multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions progressively increased the putative active form of Syt7 because of its slow membrane binding/unbinding kinetics. Nevertheless, the late phase of facilitation at high frequencies was predicted to be higher in the simulation than in the experiment. As expected, based on the notion that sustained release during HFS is limited by site clearance in the active zone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), the model/data discrepancy became more pronounced at higher frequencies. Incorporating endocytic terms into the model may mitigate late-phase discrepancies. Moreover, removal of the catalytic function of Syt7 in the model effectively accounted for the complete loss of facilitation observed in Syt7 KD (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>).</p>

<title>Conventional STF models involving cumulative increase in p<sub>v</sub> of reluctant vesicles</title>
<p>Conventional models for facilitation assume a post-AP residual Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent step increase in p<sub>v</sub> of RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dittman et al., 2000</xref>) or reluctant vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Turecek et al., 2016</xref>). Given that p<sub>v</sub> of TS vesicles is close to one in the present study, an increase in p<sub>v</sub> of TS vesicles cannot account for facilitation. The possibility for activity-dependent increase in fusion probability of LS vesicles (denoted as p<sub>v,LS</sub>) should be considered in two ways depending on whether LS and TS vesicles reside in distinct pools or in the same pool. Notably, strong PPD at short ISI implies that p<sub>v,LS</sub> is near zero at the resting state. Whereas LS vesicles do not contribute to baseline transmission, short-term facilitation (STF) may be mediated by cumulative increase in p<sub>v</sub> of LS vesicles that reside in a distinct pool. Because the increase in p<sub>v,LS</sub> during facilitation recruits new release sites (increase in N), the variance of EPSCs should become larger as stimulation frequency increases, resulting in upward deviation from a parabola in the V-M plane, as shown in recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Valera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kobbersmed et al., 2020</xref>). This prediction is not compatible with our results of V-M analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), showing that EPSCs during STF fell on the same parabola regardless of stimulation frequencies. Therefore, it is unlikely that an increase in fusion probability of reluctant vesicles residing in a distinct release pool mediates STF in the present study. For the latter case, in which LS and TS vesicles occupy in the same release sites, it is hard to distinguish a step increase in fusion probability of LS vesicles from a conversion of LS vesicles to TS. Nevertheless, our results do not support the possibility for a gradual increase in p<sub>v,LS</sub> that occurs in parallel with STF. Strong PPD, indicative of high p<sub>v</sub>, was consistently found not only in the baseline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2.1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) but also during post-tetanic augmentation phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) and even during the early development of facilitation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), arguing against the gradual increase in p<sub>v,LS</sub>. One may argue that STF may be mediated by a drastic step increase of p<sub>v,LS</sub> from zero to one, but it is not distinguishable from conversion of LS to TS vesicles.</p>

<title>Possible mechanisms underlying the depression-facilitation sequence</title>
<p>Cooperative binding of multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to Syt7 predicts delayed activation and a progressive increase in vesicle refilling during train stimulations, resulting in delayed facilitation. Combining this with a high p<sub>v</sub> could replicate not only the slow facilitation at 5 Hz, but also the unique depression-facilitation sequence observed at 40 Hz (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). As simulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pulido and Marty (2018)</xref>, delayed facilitation can be reproduced by a high p<sub>v</sub> in combination with a low baseline occupancy of replacement sites and subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent refilling. However, whether this model is also able to replicate slow facilitation at low frequencies remains to be tested. An alternative, but not exclusive, possibility for delayed facilitation is that the presynaptic global Ca<sup>2+</sup> itself may undergo a slow buildup during a train due to the saturation of endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins.</p>

<title>Facilitation requires not only Syt7, but also activation of PLC-DAG signaling</title>
<p>To gain insight into the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the vesicle-loading processes, we examined the effects of pharmacological inhibitors targeting PLC and DAG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Both a PLC inhibitor and a DAG analog reduced facilitation and augmentation. This suggests that the progressive overfilling of docking sites with TS vesicles is supported by the PLC-DAG signaling pathway and probably downstream Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lou et al., 2008</xref>). Phorbol esters have been recently shown to increase the TS fraction of docked vesicles by enhancing vesicle priming without affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients or p<sub>v</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Taschenberger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aldahabi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Papantoniou et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aldahabi et al., 2024</xref>).

<title>Roles of facilitation and augmentation in working memory and related tasks</title>
<p>Previous theoretical studies have proposed that working memory in a recurrent network can be maintained in the form of augmentation at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>) and/or persistent activity of neurons in a memory ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mongillo et al., 2012</xref>). The latter can be supported by short-term facilitation of recurrent excitatory synapses or disparity in STP between excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mongillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yoon et al., 2020</xref>). However, whether these short-term enhancements in synaptic efficacy contribute to working memory-related behaviors has not been examined. tFC is a temporal associative learning task requiring temporary retention of CS information during a trace period. The mPFC and hippocampus are crucial for tFC, and tFC is interfered with by a load of working memory and attention distraction, implying that the tFC shares the same neural substrate with other working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Raybuck and Lattal, 2014</xref>). In the present study, tFC in WT and Syt7 KD animals revealed that Syt7 deficiency in the L2/3 PCs of the mPFC impaired the acquisition of trace fear memory and reduced c-Fos expression associated with tFC training (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<p>The acquisition of trace fear memory was impaired by inhibition of persistent activity in mPFC during trace period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gilmartin et al., 2013</xref>). The similar deficit observed in Syt7 KD animals is consistent with the hypothesis that STF provides bi-stable ensemble activity in a recurrent network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mongillo et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, alternative mechanisms may be responsible for the behavioral deficit. Not only recurrent network but also long-range loop between the mPFC and the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus play a critical role in maintaining persistent activity within the mPFC especially for a delay period longer than 10 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bolkan et al., 2017</xref>). Prefrontal L2/3 is heavily innervated by MD thalamus, and L2/3-PCs subsequently relay signals to L5 cortico-thalamic (CT) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Collins et al., 2018</xref>). Given that L2/3 is an essential component of the PFC-thalamic loop, loss of STF at recurrent synapses between L2/3 PCs may lead to insufficient L2/3 inputs to L5 CT neurons and failure in the reverberant PFC-MD thalamic feedback loop. Therefore, not only L2/3 recurrent network but also its output to downstream network should be considered as a possible network mechanism underlying behavioral deficit caused by Syt7 KD L2/3.</p>
<p>In summary, activity-dependent synaptic facilitation and augmentation at prelimbic L2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses can be attributed to overfilling of release sites with TS vesicles. Given that the lack of short-term facilitation in L2/3 PCs impairs trace fear memory acquisition, temporary maintenance of CS information during trace period may be supported by an increase in the TS occupancy in presynaptic terminals of CS-representing neuronal ensembles.</p>

<p>Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats on embryonic day (E) 17.5 were deeply anesthetized with 5% (v/v) isoflurane for the duration of surgery. The uterine horns were exposed by laparotomy and wet with warm sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The plasmids (0.5-2 µg/µl) together with the 0.01% fast green dye were injected into either the left or the right lateral ventricle or bilateral ventricles of embryos through a thin glass capillary (Narishige PC-10). The embryo’s head was carefully held between the forceps-shaped electrodes of 10 mm diameter (CUY65010; NEPAGENE, Japan). Electroporation pulses (50 V for 50 ms) were delivered five times at intervals of 150 ms using a square-wave generator (ECM830; BEX, United States). The uterine horns were placed back into the abdominal cavity and abdominal muscles and skin were sutured. After the surgery, the animals were recovered under the infrared lamp.

<p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed from pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons in layer 2/3 of the prelimbic mPFC. Neuronal subtypes were initially selected based on morphology under visual guidance by using an upright microscope equipped with infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) optics (BX51WI, Olympus), and were further identified by their electrophysiological properties (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">van Aerde and Feldmeyer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). To analyze these intrinsic properties in current-clamp experiments, we measured the following parameters: (1) resting membrane potential (RMP), (2) input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>), (3) sag ratio, and (4) the F-I curve, which plots firing frequencies (F) against the amplitude of injected currents (I). Both cell types exhibited a low sag ratio below 0.1, consistent with findings from other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">van Aerde and Feldmeyer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yoon et al., 2020</xref>).

<title>Synaptic stimulation</title>
<p>IUE resulted in sparse expression of channelrhodopsin (10-20%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Exploiting the sparse expression, we employed a minimal optical stimulation method to activate a single or very few excitatory synapses in layer 2/3. The optic minimal stimulation was performed by our published protocol with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yoon et al., 2020</xref>). This approach aimed to minimize the risk of synaptic contamination, which could arise from engaging extra terminals that were initially inactive (depolarized below threshold) but became active by temporal summation during high-frequency trains. It also helped prevent the buildup of depolarization at the synaptic terminals, which might influence the probability of release, as noted by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jackman et al., 2014</xref>). To achieve this, we employed a collimated digital micromirror device (DMD)-coupled LED (Polygon400; Mightex Systems) to confine 470 nm blue light to a small area with a radius of approximately 3–8 μm (typically 3–4 μm), as measured at the focal plane of a 60× water immersion objective [numerical aperture (NA) = 1.0; LUMPlanFL, Olympus] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). To find the minimal stimulation area, the radius of illumination area was increased from 2 μm by 50% at each step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), and selected the smallest illumination area that elicited EPSCs. Setting the duration of illumination between 3 and 5 ms (typically 5 ms), photostimulation onto oChIEF-expressing cells reliably induced action potentials (APs) during 600-pulse trains (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>STP at various stimulus frequencies (5, 10, 20, and 40 Hz) was examined using 20-pulse trains. Trials of train stimulation were repeated with a prolonged interval of 30 s to avoid change in baseline properties. We observed no systematic changes in the amplitudes of the first EPSC of each train, nor did we find significant differences in the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) across stimulation trials in the same cell. For each stimulus frequency, approximately ten to twenty consecutive traces were collected and then averaged across trials to yield a mean EPSC trace. For recovery experiments, two consecutive trains of 3 or 30 stimuli at 40 Hz, with varying time intervals (0.1-10 s), were applied every 10 s or 60 s, respectively, at both excitatory synapses. For 600-stimulus trains at 10Hz, the trial was delivered only once for each cell to avoid possible after-effects caused by prolonged synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hirsch and Crepel, 1990</xref>). Prior to the stimulus trains, the EPSCs were normalized to the mean amplitude of the baseline. For the baseline measurements, paired pulses with various ISIs (20-200 ms) were delivered every 3 s (1/3 Hz) at least 20 times.</p>
<p>For all recordings, picrotoxin (PTX, 10 μM) was included in the recording solution to isolate glutamatergic responses. mPFC PC terminals were entirely glutamatergic as the application of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 20 μM), an AMPA receptor antagonist, completely abolished the monosynaptic events evoked by photostimulation. A low concentration of PTX was employed to minimize the relieving effects on spike suppression caused by blockade of GABAa receptors. We confirmed that no synaptic response was elicited by electrical stimulation in the presence of both 10 μM PTX and 20 μM CNQX.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>, 1 µM TTX (1 mM stock solution) and 0.1 mM 4-AP (500 mM stock solution) were added to the bath solution to block action potentials and restore presynaptic glutamate release, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1.5">Figure 1— figure supplement 5A</xref>, 50 µM of cyclothiazide, a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptors, was included to minimize rapid desensitization of the postsynaptic receptors.

The same procedure was also executed under sham conditions (0% light intensity) to serve as a control, thus mitigating contamination from nonspecific spontaneous events and potential errors associated with in the detection algorithm. q was determined as the mean value from the first Gaussian function after fitting the EPSC distribution with either a single or double Gaussian function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3.1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Estimation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics at axonal boutons</title>
<p>Cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] at single axonal boutons was estimated by employing the two-dye, dual-excitation wavelength technique as described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Oheim et al., 1998</xref>). This method involves measuring the fluorescence ratio of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dye to that of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive dye to correct for dye concentrations. We used Fluo-5F at concentrations of 150, 250, or 500 μM (dissociation constant, K<sub>d</sub> = 2.3 μM) as the calcium indicator dye and Alexa Flour 555 (50 μM) as the reference dye. The fluorophores were from Invitrogen. Both dyes were co-loaded into presynaptic terminals of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in mPFC through whole-cell patch clamp. Before data acquisition, the dyes were allowed to diffuse to terminal boutons for at least 30 minutes after the patch break-in, a duration sufficient for the equilibrium of dye concentrations between the soma and its axonal terminals.</p>
<p>Calcium imaging was performed by sequentially exciting Fluo-5F and AF555 at wavelengths of 473 and 559 nm, respectively, using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (FV1200; Olympus, Japan) equipped with a 60× water immersion objective (NA, 0.9; LUMPlanFl; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Once a single axonal bouton was identified, lines for scanning were drawn across boutons, oriented perpendicular to the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2.2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). After baseline fluorescence was measured, line scanning was proceeded while a single or train APs were induced by applying current pulses. Upon stimulation, green fluorescence but not red one increased along the vertical array of lines across the bouton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2.2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). Measurements were obtained under current-clamp conditions, with the resting potential regularly monitored. The scanning speed was adjusted to 600-700 Hz by controlling the line length. Line scan for measuring fluorescent transients in a bouton was repeated at least 3 times, and then averaged to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. To mitigate photobleaching, minimal intensity of the laser power and maximal pinhole size were used. Emitted light was filtered through 490/590 or 575/675 bandpass filters before detection by photomultiplier tubes for green or red fluorescence, respectively.</p>
<p>Fluorescence measurements were converted to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> using the ratio of background-subtracted fluorescence (F = F<sub>0</sub> - F<sub>b</sub>) from two dyes. The fluorescence ratio (R = F<sub>green</sub>/F<sub>red</sub>) in data traces were converted to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> using the following equation:

<p>When Ca<sup>2+</sup> is extruded with a rate constant, γ, after an AP-induced short pulse of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to a single compartment, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> initially rises to A<sub>Ca</sub> and then undergoes a mono-exponential decay with a time constant (τ<sub>Ca</sub>). Under this framework, A<sub>Ca</sub> and τ<sub>Ca</sub> depend on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding ratios of endo- and exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers (denoted as κ<sub>S</sub> and κ<sub>B</sub>, respectively) as following equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Neher, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kim et al., 2003</xref>):

<title>Trace fear conditioning</title>
<p>For trace fear conditioning (tFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gilmartin et al., 2013</xref>), individual rats were placed in the training chamber (30.5 x 25.4 x 30.5 cm; Coulbourn Instruments) consisting of metal grid floor connected to an electrical stimulator (H10-11R-TC-SF, Coulbourn Instruments) for delivery of a footshock. After a 5 min habituation period, rats received five pairings of a 20 s tone conditioned stimulus (CS, 2.5 kHz, 75 dB), followed by empty 20s trace period and a unconditioned stimulus (US; 1 s, 0.7 mA footshock) with a pseudorandom inter- trial interval (ITI) of 240 ± 20 s. During this training session, rats learned to associate the auditory CS with the shock US. The next day, the rats were tested for memory of CS-US trace association (called tone test). The acquisition of fear learning, often indicated by the extent of freezing to the CS, was assessed in a novel chamber (a white hexagonal enclosure) in a dimly lit room. During this tone (or retrieval) test, rats were first allowed to explore the new context for 5 min (habituation), followed by twelve 20 s CS presentations with a variable ITI of 120 ± 20 s. This entire session was repeated on the next day for assessment of extinction learning. Identities of the chambers were also determined with the presence of distinct odors; the training and testing chambers were cleaned with 70% ethanol and 1% acetic acid respectively before and after each session. For all experimental sessions, the activity of animals in the chambers was recorded at 30 frames per second using the EthoVision XT (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands), and stored as a video file. The freezing behavior, defined as behavioral immobility other than respiratory movement, was assessed using an open-source video analysis pipeline ezTrack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pennington et al., 2019</xref>). The percentage of freezing was calculated as a total duration of freezing divided by the total duration of observation.</p>

<caption><title>Validation of STP of optically evoked EPSCs.</title>
<p>(A) The high p<sub>v</sub> at PC-PC synapses may result from direct photo-stimulation of axon boutons. To test if optically evoked EPSCs depend on APs, the effect of 1 µM tetrodotoxin (TTX) was tested. Applying 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) and additionally 0.1 mM 4-aminopyridine, a D-type K channel blocker abolished optically evoked EPSCs (n = 8). Even when repolarization was hindered by subsequent addition of 100 µM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a potassium channel blocker, EPSCs were not rescued. These findings suggest that the light-evoked responses are dependent on APs of presynaptic axon fibers rather than photo-induced depolarization of presynaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Little and Carter, 2013</xref>).

<p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) A mixture of Fluo-5F (150, 250 or 500 μM) and Alexa Flour 555 was loaded on their axonal boutons of L2/3-PCs through whole-cell patch techniques for dual excitation ratiometric measurements of the cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] at axonal boutons.

A linear fit to the plot gave the amplitude of AP-CaT (A<sub>Ca</sub> = 1.16 μM) from the y-intercept, representing the amplitude of free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increase in the absence exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer. The calcium binding ratio of endogenous static Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers (κ<sub>S</sub>) was estimated as 96 from the x-intercept of the linear regression based on <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 2</xref> in <italic>Material and Methods</italic>.

The y-intercept was 43 ms, an estimate for a dye-independent value for Ca<sup>2+</sup> decay time constant (τ<sub>c</sub>) (<xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 3</xref> in <italic>Material and Methods</italic>).

The horizontal line indicates 50 nM. The mean [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>rest</sub> at three different concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye were not different and measured as 50 nM, suggesting that the dye did not influence [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>rest</sub>. (<bold>G-I</bold>) Strong PPD and the subsequent STF may be caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation (CDF) of calcium influx into presynaptic boutons, respectively. To test these possibilities, we measured presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increments evoked by each of successive APs applied in a train at 40 Hz.

(<bold>I</bold>) Total Ca<sup>2+</sup> increments (Δ[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>T</sub>; free plus bound form) are plotted against the number of APs in the train (n = 13). Δ[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>T</sub> were calculated based on <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 2</xref> with κ<sub>S</sub> set to 90. No significant change was observed for the estimates of Δ[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>T</sub> at each of first 4 APs during 40 Hz train, indicating that contributions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation and CDF to STP are unlikely.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> work explores how synaptic activity encodes information during memory tasks. All reviewers agree that the work is of very high quality and that the methodological approach is praiseworthy. Although the experimental data support the possibility that phospholipase diacylglycerol signaling and synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) dynamically regulate the vesicle pool required for presynaptic release, a concern remains that the central finding of paired-pulse depression at very short intervals could be due to a mechanism that does not depend on exocytosis, such as Ca²⁺ channel inactivation, rather than vesicle pool depletion. Overall, this is a <bold>solid</bold> study although the results still warrant consideration of alternative interpretations.</p>

<p>To summarize: The authors' overfilling hypothesis depends crucially on the premise that the very-quickly reverting paired-pulse depression seen after unusually short rest intervals of &lt;&lt; 50 ms is caused by depletion of release sites whereas Dobrunz and Stevens (1997) concluded that the cause was some other mechanism that does not involve depletion. The authors now include experiments where switching extracellular Ca2+ from 1.2 to 2.5 mM increases synaptic strength on average, but not by as much as at other synapse types. They contend that the result supports the depletion hypothesis. I didn't agree because the model used to generate the hypothesis had no room for any increase at all, and because a more granular analysis revealed a mixed population with a subset where: (a) synaptic strength increased by as much as at standard synapses; and yet (b) the quickly reverting depression for the subset was the same as the overall population.</p>
<p>The authors raise the possibility of additional experiments, and I do think this could clarify things if they pre-treat with EGTA as I recommended initially. They've already shown they can do this routinely, and it would allow them to elegantly distinguish between pv and pocc explanations for both the increases in synaptic strength and the decreases in the paired pulse ratio upon switching Ca2+ to 2.5 mM. Plus/minus EGTA pre-treatment trials could be interleaved and done blind with minimal additional effort.</p>
<p>Showing reversibility would be a great addition too, because, in our experience, this does not always happen in whole-cell recordings in ex-vivo tissue even when electrical properties do not change. If the goal is to show that L2/3 synapses are less sensitive to changes in Ca2+ compared to other synapse types - which is interesting but a bit off point - then I would additionally include a positive control, done by the same person with the same equipment, at one of those other synapse types using the same kind of presynaptic stimulation (i.e. ChRs).</p>
<p>Specific points (quotations are from the Authors' rebuttal)</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Author response image 1, I was instead suggesting a plot of PPR in 1.2 mM Ca2+ versus the relative increase in synaptic strength in 2.5 versus in 1.2 mM. This continues to seem relevant.</p>
<p>(2) &quot;Could you explain in detail why two-fold increase implies pv &lt; 0.2?&quot;</p>
<p>a. start with power((2.5/(1 + (2.5/K1) + 1/2.97)),4) = 2*power((1.3/(1 + (1.3/K1) + 1/2.97)),4);</p>
<p>b. solve for K1 (this turns out to be 0.48);</p>
<p>c. then implement the premise that pv -&gt; 1.0 when Ca2+ is high by calculating Max = power((C/(1 + (C/K1) + 1/2.97)),4) where C is [Ca] -&gt; infinity.</p>
<p>d. pv when [Ca] = 1.3. mM must then be power((1.3/(1 + (1.3/K1) + 1/2.97)),4)/Max, which is &lt;0.2.</p>
<p>Note that modern updates of Dodge and Rahamimoff typically include a parameter that prevents pv from approaching 1.0; this is the gamma parameter in the versions from Neher group.</p>
<p>(3) &quot;If so, we can not understand why depletion-dependent PPD should lead to PPF.&quot;</p>
<p>When PPD is caused by depletion and pv &lt; 0.2, the number of occupied release sites should not be decreased by more than one-fifth at the second stimulus so, without facilitation, PPR should be &gt; 0.8. The EGTA results then indicate there should be strong facilitation, driving PPR to something like 1.2 with conservative assumptions. And yet, a value of &lt; 0.4 is measured, which is a large miss.</p>
<p>(4) Despite the authors' suggestion to the contrary, I continue to think there is a substantial chance that Ca2+-channel inactivation is the mechanism underlying the very quickly reverting paired-pulse depression. However, this is only one example of a non-depletion mechanism among many, with the main point being that any non-depletion mechanism would undercut the reasoning for overfilling. And, this is what Dobrunz and Stevens claimed to show; that the mechanism - whatever it is - does not involve depletion. The most effective way to address this would be affirmative experiments showing that the quickly reverting depression is caused by depletion after all. Attempting to prove that Ca2+-channel inactivation does not occur does not seem like a worthwhile strategy because it would not address the many other possibilities.</p>
<p>(5) True that Kusick et al. observed morphological re-docking, but then vesicles would have to re-prime and Mahfooz et al. (2016) showed that re-priming would have to be slower than 110 ms (at least during heavy use at calyx of Held).</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The central issue for evaluating the overfilling hypothesis is the identity of the mechanism that causes the very potent (&gt;80% when inter pulse is 20 ms), but very quickly reverting (&lt; 50 ms) paired pulse depression (Fig 1G, I). To summarize: the logic for overfilling at local cortical L2/3 synapses depends critically on the premise that probability of release (pv) for docked and fully primed vesicles is already close to 100%. If so, the reasoning goes, the only way to account for the potent short-term enhancement seen when stimulation is extended beyond 2 pulses would be by concluding that the readily releasable pool overfills. However, the conclusion that pv is close to 100% depends on the premise that the quickly reverting depression is caused by exocytosis dependent depletion of release sites, and the evidence for this is not strong in my opinion. Caution is especially reasonable given that similarly quickly reverting depression at Schaffer collateral synapses, which are morphologically similar, was previously shown to NOT depend on exocytosis (Dobrunz and Stevens 1997). Note that the authors of the 1997 study speculated that Ca2+-channel inactivation might be the cause, but did not rule out a wide variety of other types of mechanisms that have been discovered since, including the transient vesicle undocking/re-docking (and subsequent re-priming) reported by Kusick et al (2020), which seems to have the correct timing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments on an alternative possibility besides Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation. Kusick et al. (2020) showed that transient destabilization of docked vesicle pool is recovered within 14 ms after stimulation. This rapid recovery implies that post-stimulation undocking events might be largely resolved before the 20 ms inter-stimulus interval (ISI) used in our paired-pulse ratio (PPR) experiments, arguing against the possibility that post-AP undocking/re-docking events significantly influence PPR measured at 20 ms ISI. Furthermore, Vevea et al. (2021) showed that post-stimulus undocking is facilitated in synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) knockout synapses. In our study, Syt7 knockdown did not affect PPR at 20 ms ISI, suggesting that the undocking process described in Kusick et al. may not be a major contributor to the paired-pulse depression observed at 20 ms interval in our study. Therefore, it is unlikely that transient vesicle undocking primarily underlies the strong PPD at 20 ms ISI in our experiments. Taken together, the undocking/redocking dynamics reported by Kusick et al. are too rapid to affect PPR at 20 ms ISI, and our Syt7 knockdown data further argue against a significant role of this process in the PPD observed at 20 ms interval.</p>

<p>In an earlier round of review, I suggested raising extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, to see if this would increase synaptic strength. This is a strong test of the authors' model because there is essentially no room for an increase in synaptic strength. The authors have now done experiments along these lines, but the result is not clear cut. On one hand, the new results suggest an increase in synaptic strength that is not compatible with the authors' model; technically the increase does not reach statistical significance, but, likely, this is only because the data set is small and the variation between experiments is large. Moreover, a more granular analysis of the individual experiments seems to raise more serious problems, even supporting the depletion-independent counter hypothesis to some extent. On the other hand, the increase in synaptic strength that is seen in the newly added experiments does seem to be less at local L2/3 cortical synapses compared to other types of synapses, measured by other groups, which goes in the general direction of supporting the critical premise that pv is unusually high at L2/3 cortical synapses. Overall, I am left wishing that the new data set were larger, and that reversal experiments had been included as explained in the specific points below.</p>
<p>Specific Points:</p>
<p>(1) One of the standard methods for distinguishing between depletion-dependent and depletion-independent depression mechanisms is by analyzing failures during paired pulses of minimal stimulation. The current study includes experiments along these lines showing that pv would have to be extremely close to 1 when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is 1.25 mM to preserve the authors' model (Section &quot;High double failure rate ...&quot;). Lower values for pv are not compatible with their model because the k<sub>1</sub> parameter already had to be pushed a bit beyond boundaries established by other types of experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It should be noted that we did not arbitrarily pushed the k<sub>1</sub> parameter beyond boundaries, but estimated the range of k<sub>1</sub> based on the fast time constant for recovery from paired pulse depression as shown in Fig. 3-S2-Ab.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors now report a mean increase in synaptic strength of 23% after raising Ca to 2.5 mM. The mean increase is not quite statistically significant, but this is likely because of the small sample size. I extracted a 95% confidence interval of [-4%, +60%] from their numbers, with a 92% probability that the mean value of the increase in the full population is &gt; 5%. I used the 5% value as the greatest increase that the model could bear because 5% implies pv &lt; 0.9 using the equation from Dodge and Rahamimoff referenced in the rebuttal. My conclusion from this is that the mean result, rather than supporting the model, actually undermines it to some extent. It would have likely taken 1 or 2 more experiments to get above the 95% confidence threshold for statistical significance, but this is ultimately an arbitrary cut off.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our key claim in Fig. 3-S3 is not the statistical non-significance of EPSC changes, but the small magnitude of the change (1.23-fold). This small increase is far less than the 3.24-fold increase predicted by the fourth-power relationship (D&amp;R equation, Dodge &amp; Rahamimoff, 1967), which would be valid under the conditions that the fusion probability of docked vesicles (p<sub>v</sub>) is not saturated. We do not believe that addition of new experiments would increase the magnitude of EPSC change as high as the Dodge &amp; Rahamimoff equation predicts, even if more experiments (n) yielded a statistical significance. In other words, even a small but statistically significant EPSC changes would still contradict with what we expect from low p<sub>v</sub> synapses. It should be noted that our main point is the extent of EPSC increase induced by high external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], not a p-value. In this regard, it is hard for us to accept the Reviewer’s request for larger sample size expecting lower p-value.</p>
<p>Although we agree to Reviewer’s assertion that our data may indicate a 92% probability for the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> -induced EPSC increases by more than 5%, we do not agree to the Reviewer’s interpretation that the EPSC increase necessarily implies an increase in p<sub>v</sub>. We are sorry that we could not clearly understand the Reviewer’s inference that the 5% increase of EPSCs implies p<sub>v</sub> &lt; 0.9. Please note that release probability (p<sub>r</sub>) is the product of p<sub>v</sub> and the occupancy of docked vesicles in an active zone (p<sub>occ</sub>). We imagine that this inference might be under the premise that p<sub>occ</sub> is constant irrespective of external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Contrary to the Reviewer’s premise, Figure 2c in Kusick et al. (2020) showed that the number of docked SVs increased by c. a. 20% upon increasing external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] to 2 mM. Moreover, Figure 7F in Lin et al. (2025) demonstrated that the number of TS vesicles, equivalent to p<sub>occ</sub> increased by 23% at high external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. These extents of p<sub>occ</sub> increases are similar to our magnitude of high external Ca<sup>2+</sup> -induced increase in EPSC (1.23-fold). Of course, it is possible that both increase of p<sub>occ</sub> and p<sub>v</sub> contributed to the high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-induced increase in EPSC. The low PPR and failure rate analysis, however, suggest that p<sub>v</sub> is already saturated in baseline conditions of 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and thus it is more likely that an increase in p<sub>occ</sub> is primarily responsible for the 1.23-fold increase. Moreover, the 1.23-fold increase, does not match to the prediction of the D&amp;R equation, which would be valid at synapses with low p<sub>v</sub>. Therefore, interpreting our observation (1.23-fold increase) as a slight increase in p<sub>occ</sub> is rather consistent with recent papers (Kusick et al.,2020; Lin et al., 2025) as well as our other results supporting the baseline saturation of p<sub>v</sub> as shown in Figure 2 and associated supplement figures (Fig. 2-S1 and Fig. 2-S2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The variation between experiments seems to be even more problematic, at least as currently reported. The plot in Figure 3-figure supplement 3 (left) suggests that the variation reflects true variation between synapses, not measurement error.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Note that there was a substantial variance in the number of docked or TS vesicles at baseline and its fold changes at high external Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition in previous studies too (Lin et al., 2025; Kusick et al., 2020). Our study did not focus on the heterogeneity but on the mean dynamics of short-term plasticity at L2/3 recurrent synapses. Acknowledging this, the short-term plasticity of these synapses could be best explained by assuming that vesicular fusion probability (p<sub>v</sub>) is near to unity, and that release probability is regulated by p<sub>occ</sub>. In other words, even though p<sub>v</sub> is near to unity, synaptic strength can increase upon high external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], if the baseline occupancy of release sites (p<sub>occ</sub>) is low and p<sub>occ</sub> is increased by high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Lin et al. (2025) showed that high external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] induces an increase in the number of TS vesicles (equivalent to p<sub>occ</sub>) by 23% at the calyx synapses. Different from our synapses, the baseline p<sub>v</sub> (denoted as p<sub>fusion</sub> in Lin et al., 2025) of the calyx synapse is not saturated (= 0.22) at 1.5 mM external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], and thus the calyx synapses displayed 2.36-fold increase of EPSC at 2 mM external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], to which increases in p<sub>occ</sub> as well as in p<sub>v</sub> (from 0.22 to 0.42) contributed. Therefore, the small increase in EPSC (= 23%) supports that p<sub>v</sub> is already saturated at L2/3 recurrent synapses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>And yet, synaptic strength increased almost 2-fold in 2 of the 8 experiments, which back extrapolates to pv &lt; 0.2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry that we could not understand the first comment in this paragraph. Could you explain in detail why two-fold increase implies pv &lt; 0.2?</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If all of the depression is caused by depletion as assumed, these individuals would exhibit paired pulse facilitation, not depression. And yet, from what I can tell, the individuals depressed, possibly as much as the synapses with low sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, arguing against the critical premise that depression equals depletion, and even arguing - to some extent - for the counter hypothesis that a component of the depression is caused by a mechanism that is independent of depletion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For the first statement in this paragraph, we imagine that ‘the depression’ means paired pulse depression (PPD). If so, we can not understand why depletion-dependent PPD should lead to PPF. If the paired pulse interval is too short for docked vesicles to be replenished, the first pulse-induced vesicle depletion would result in PPD. We are very sorry that we could not understand Reviewer’s subsequent inference, because we could not understand the first statement.</p>

<p>I would strongly recommend adding an additional plot that documents the relationship between the amount of increase in synaptic strength after increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the paired pulse ratio as this seems central.</p>

<p>(3) Decrease in PPR. The authors recognize that the decrease in the paired-pulse ratio after increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> seems problematic for the overfilling hypothesis by stating: &quot;Although a reduction in PPR is often interpreted as an increase in pv, under conditions where pv is already high, it more likely reflects a slight increase in p<sub>occ</sub> or in the number of TS vesicles, consistent with the previous estimates (Lin et al., 2025).&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We admit that there is a logical jump in our statement you mentioned here. We appreciate your comment. We re-wrote that part in the revised manuscript (line 285) as follows:</p>
<p>“Recent morphological and functional studies revealed that elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> induces an increase in the number of TS or docked vesicles to a similar extent as our observation (Kusick et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2025), raising a possibility that an increase in p<sub>occ</sub> is responsible for the 1.23-fold increase in EPSC at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> . A slight but significant reduction in PPR was observed under high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> too. An increase in p<sub>occ</sub> is thought to be associated with that in the baseline vesicle refilling rate. While PPR is always reduced by an increase in p<sub>v,</sub> the effects of refilling rate to PPR is complicated. For example, PPR can be reduced by both a decrease (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and an increase (Lin et al., 2025) in the refilling rate induced by EGTA-AM and PDBu, respectively. Thus, the slight reduction in PPR is not contradictory to the possible contribution of p<sub>occ</sub> to the high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> effects.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I looked quickly, but did not immediately find an explanation in Lin et al 2025 involving an increase in pocc or number of TS vesicles, much less a reason to prefer this over the standard explanation that reduced PPR indicates an increase in pv.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fig. 7F of Lin et al. (2025) shows an 1.23-fold increase in the number of TS vesicles by high external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. The same figure (Fig. 7E) in Lin et al. (2025) also shows a two-fold increase of p<sub>fusion</sub> (equivalent to p<sub>v</sub> in our study) by high external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (from 0.22 to 0.42,). Because p<sub>occ</sub> is the occupancy of TS vesicles in a limited number of slots in an active zone, the fold change in the number of TS vesicles should be similar to that of p<sub>occ</sub>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors should explain why the most straightforward interpretation is not the correct one in this particular case to avoid the appearance of cherry picking explanations to fit the hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The results of Lin et al. (2025) indicate that high external [Ca<sub>2+</sub>] induces a milder increase in p<sub>occ</sub> (23%) compared to p<sub>v</sub> (190%) at the calyx synapses. Because the extent of p<sub>occ</sub> increase is much smaller than that of p<sub>v</sub> and multiple lines of evidence in our study support that the baseline p<sub>v</sub> is already saturated, we raised a possibility that an increase in p<sub>occ</sub> would primarily contribute to the unexpectedly low increase of EPSC at 2.5 mM [Ca<sub>2+</sub>]<sub>o</sub>. As mentioned above, our interpretation is also consistent with the EM study of Kusick et al. (2020). Nevertheless, the reduction of PPR at 2.5 mM Ca<sub>2+</sub> seems to support an increase in p<sub>v,</sub> arguing against this possibility. On the other hand, because p<sub>occ</sub> = k<sub>1</sub>/(k<sub>1</sub>+b<sub>1</sub>) under the simple vesicle refilling model (Fig. 3-S2Aa), a change in p<sub>occ</sub> should associate with changes in k<sub>1</sub> and/or b<sub>1</sub>. While PPR is always reduced by an increase in p<sub>v,</sub> the effects of refilling rate to PPR is complicated. For example, despite that EGTA-AM would not increase p<sub>v,</sub> it reduced PPR probably through reducing refilling rate (Fig. 2-S1). On the contrary, PDBu is thought to increase k<sub>1</sub> because it induces two-fold increase of p<sub>occ</sub> (Fig. 7L of Lin et al., 2025). Such a marked increase of p<sub>occ,</sub> rather than p<sub>v,</sub> seems to be responsible for the PDBu-induced marked reduction of PPR (Fig. 7I of Lin et al., 2025), because PDBu induced only a slight increase in p<sub>v</sub> (Fig. 7K of Lin et al., 2025). Therefore, the slight reduction of PPR is not contradictory to our interpretation that an increase in p<sub>occ</sub> might be responsible for the slight increase in EPSC induced by high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>.</p>

<p>(4) The authors concede in the rebuttal that mean pv must be &lt; 0.7, but I couldn't find any mention of this within the manuscript itself, nor any explanation for how the new estimate could be compatible with the value of &gt; 0.99 in the section about failures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have never stated in the rebuttal or elsewhere that the mean p<sub>v</sub> must be &lt; 0.7. On the contrary, both of our manuscript and previous rebuttals consistently argued that the baseline p<sub>v</sub> is already saturated, based on our observations including low PPR, tight coupling, high double failure rate and the minimal effect of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation.</p>

<p>(5) Although not the main point, comparisons to synapses in other brain regions reported in other studies might not be accurate without directly matching experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please understand that it not trivial to establish optimal experimental settings for studying other synapses using the same methods employed in the study. We think that it should be performed in a separate study. Furthermore, we have already shown in the manuscript that action potentials (APs) evoked by oChIEF activation occur in a physiologically natural manner, and the STP induced by these oChIEF-evoked APs is indistinguishable from the STP elicited by APs evoked by dual-patch electrical stimulation. Therefore, we believe that our use of optogenetic stimulation did not introduce any artificial bias in measuring STP.</p>

<p>As it is, 2 of 8 synapses got weaker instead of stronger, hinting at possible rundown, but this cannot be assessed because reversibility was not evaluated. In addition, comparing axons with and without channel rhodopsins might be problematic because the channel rhodopsins might widen action potentials.</p>

<p>We continuously monitored series resistance and baseline EPSC amplitude throughout the experiments. The figure below shows the mean time course of EPSCs at two different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. As it shows, we observed no tendency for run-down of EPSCs during experiments. If any, such recordings were discarded from analysis. In addition, please understand that there is a substantial variance in the number of docked vesicles at both baseline and high external Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Lin et al., 2025; Kusick et al., 2020) as well as short-term dynamics of EPSCs at our synapses.</p>

<p>(6) Perhaps authors could double check with Schotten et al about whether PDBu does/does not decrease the latency between osmotic shock and transmitter release. This might be an interesting discrepancy, but my understanding is that Schotten et al didn't acquire information about latency because of how the experiments were designed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Schotten et al. (2015) directly compared experimental and simulation data for hypertonicity-induced vesicle release. They showed a pronounced acceleration of the latency as the tonicity increases (Fig. 2-S2), but this tonicity-dependent acceleration was not reproduced by reducing the activation energy barrier for fusion (ΔEa) in their simulations (Fig. 2-S1). Thus, the authors mentioned that an unknown compensatory mechanism counteracting the osmotic perturbation might be responsible for the tonicity-dependent changes in the latency. Importantly, their modeling demonstrated that reducing ΔEa, which would correspond to increasing p<sub>v</sub> results in larger peak amplitudes and shorter time-to-peak, but did not accelerate the latency. Therefore, there is currently no direct explanation for the notion that PDBu or similar manipulations shorten latency via an increase in p<sub>v</sub>.</p>

<p>(7) The authors state: &quot;These data are difficult to reconcile with a model in which facilitation is mediated by Ca2+-dependent increases in pv.&quot; However, I believe that discarding the premise that depression is always caused by depletion would open up wide range of viable possibilities.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We hope that Reviewer understands the reasons why we reached the conclusion that the baseline p<sub>v</sub> is saturated at our synapses. First of all, strong paired pulse depression (PPD) cannot be attributed to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation because Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at the axon terminal remained constant during 40 Hz train stimulation (Fig.2 -S2). Moreover, even if Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation is responsible for the strong PPD, this view cannot explain the delayed facilitation that emerges subsequent pulses (third EPSC and so on) in the 40 Hz train stimulation (Fig. 1-4), because Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation gradually accumulates during train stimulations as directly shown by Wykes et al. (2007) in chromaffin cells. Secondly, the strong PPD and very fast recovery from PPD indicates very fast refilling rate constant (k<sub>1</sub>). Under this high k<sub>1</sub>, the failure rates were best explained by p<sub>v</sub> close to unity. Thirdly, the extent of EPSC increase induced by high external Ca<sup>2+</sup> was much smaller than other synapses such as calyx synapses at which p<sub>v</sub> is not saturated (Lin et al., 2025), and rather similar to the increases in p<sub>occ</sub> estimated at calyx synapses or the EM study (Kusick et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2025).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>I continue to think that measuring changes in synaptic strength when raising extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a good experiment for evaluating the overfilling hypothesis. Future experiments would be better if the authors would include reversibility criteria to rule out rundown, etc. Also, comparisons to other types of synapses would be stronger if the same experimenter did the experiments at both types of synapses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We observed no systemic tendency for run-down of EPSCs during these experiments (Author response image 2). Furthermore, the observed variability is well within the expected variance range in the number of docked vesicles at both baseline and high external Ca²⁺ (Lin et al., 2025; Kusick et al., 2020) and reflects biological variability rather than experimental artifact. Therefore, we believe that additional reversibility experiments are not warranted. However, we are open to further discussion if the Reviewer has specific methodological concerns not resolved by our present data.</p>
<p>For the second issue, as mentioned above, we think that studying at other synapse types should be done in a separate study.</p>
