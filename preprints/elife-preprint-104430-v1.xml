<title>Abstract</title><p>Heterotaxy (HTX) is frequently caused by deleterious variants in the gene encoding Matrix metallopeptidase 21 (MMP21). However, the underlying pathomechanism has not been ascertained. In this study, we report on a novel HTX-associated <italic>MMP21</italic> knockout allele in humans and investigate the peptidase’s role during laterality development using <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos as animal model. The targeted inactivation of <italic>mmp21</italic> in f0 mutant <italic>Xenopus</italic> successfully phenocopied the human HTX condition, yet the cilia-driven leftward fluid flow, which initiates asymmetric gene activity at the left-right organizer (LRO), was unaltered in <italic>mmp21</italic> null frogs. Instead, our analysis of downstream events revealed that flow response, the left-sided repression of <italic>dand5</italic>, could not take place. Remarkably, gain-of-function experiments demonstrated that Mmp21 spreads over LRO cells and triggers flow response. Additionally, Mmp21 functions upstream of Cirop, another metallopeptidase, which we found specifically localized to LRO cilia. Thus, our findings suggest that Mmp21 may be the long-sought morphogen, which is actively transported by the leftward fluid flow to Cirop-laden cilia, in order to specify the left side of the embryo.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The molecular definition of the left-right body axis is a crucial step during early embryogenesis, allowing complex chiral organs like the vertebrate heart to orderly emerge and to be asymmetrically positioned within body cavities. In humans, the normal arrangement of thoracic and abdominal organs is called <italic>situs solitus</italic> (SS), whereas <italic>situs inversus</italic> (SI) describes a complete mirror-imaged orientation, not necessarily associated with health constraints. In contrast, severe health conditions can occur if single or multiple organs are misoriented, multiplied or missing, commonly referred to as heterotaxy (HTX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Estimations for the frequency of laterality defects are difficult to make as methodologies and definitions vary between epidemiological studies in the field. However, a retrospective 12-year spanning population-based study of infants diagnosed with syndromic or non-syndromic laterality defects determined an overall prevalence of 1.9 per 10 000 live births<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Humans and all other vertebrates, except Sauropsida and Cetartiodactyla, utilize a cilia-dependent mechanism to establish laterality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. During neurulation, a ciliated epithelium, called left-right organizer (LRO) arises at the embryonic midline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Central LRO cells harbor posteriorly polarized motile mono-cilia, which rotate in a clockwise fashion thereby generating a transient leftward flow of extracellular fluid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The fluid flow represents the initial asymmetric stimulus, which is exclusively perceived on the left side by lateral LRO cells through sensory cilia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. These sensor cells express a specific set of morphogens, most importantly and archetypically: Nodal homolog 1 (Nodal1) and its antagonist DAN domain BMP antagonist family member 5 (Dand5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Flow response post-transcriptionally downregulates left-sided <italic>dand5</italic> expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Hence, Nodal1 is released from repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and travels from the midline to the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) to activate the so-called Nodal signaling cascade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. This cascade is conserved among all vertebrates and involves self-induction of a Nodal homolog, allowing its propagation throughout the left LPM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. At the same time, Nodal signaling induces the feedback inhibitor Left-right determination factor (Lefty) as well as the transcription factor Paired like homeodomain 2 (Pitx2). Whereas Lefty restricts the spatio-temporal action of Nodal ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, Pitx2 eventually directs asymmetric organogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In 2015, Matrix metallopeptidase 21 (MMP21) was discovered as a novel laterality determinant in patients with deleterious <italic>MMP21</italic> variants, causing a form of autosomal recessive HTX (MIM 616749)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Loss of Mmp21 in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> resembled the human left-right patterning defects, indicating a highly conserved role in the lateralization process. Although it was reported that cilia motility in the murine LROs was not disturbed in <italic>Mmp21</italic> mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, the hierarchical placement and function of Mmp21 remained otherwise elusive. Remarkably, we recently found that <italic>MMP21</italic> belongs to an ancient genetic module, which is only preserved in vertebrates with a fluid flow generating LRO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we report on a novel HTX-associated germline variant of <italic>MMP21</italic> and dissect the role of Mmp21 during symmetry breakage leveraging on the power of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> model system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Through loss-of-function (LOF) experiments, we show that Mmp21 is situated in a hub downstream of flow but upstream of left-sided <italic>dand5</italic> repression. Gain-of-function (GOF) experiments reveal that Mmp21 acts as a non-cell-autonomous fluid flow effector, which is able to travel over LRO cells following its secretion. Moreover, our study demonstrates that Mmp21 operates upstream of another peptidase called Ciliated left-right organizer metallopeptidase (Cirop). <italic>CIROP</italic>, like <italic>MMP21</italic>, is associated with HTX (MIM 619702) and belongs to the same fluid flow-related gene module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. As Cirop localizes to cilia of LRO sensor cells, we suggest that Mmp21 is a morphogen, which diffuses with the leftward fluid flow to specify the left side in a Cirop-dependent manner.</p>

<title>The domain architecture of human MMP21 is conserved in <italic>Xenopus</italic></title>
<p>MMP21 and all other MMP family members are zinc-dependent endopeptidases of the metzincin type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This type is characterized by the presence of a HEXXH motif in the catalytic domain (CD) followed by a methionine-turn (Met-turn) in close proximity. The glutamate of the HEXXH motif exerts catalytic function, whereas the two histidines together with a more C-terminal histidine, glutamic or aspartic acid serve as zinc ligands. MMPs show an extended consensus motif (HEXXHXXGXXH) and are synthesized as preproproteins. In latent MMPs, a conserved cysteine within the propeptide binds the catalytic zinc atom to block enzymatic activity, a mechanism known as cysteine switch. MMP21 has a Furin cleavage site (FCS) as well as C-terminal Hemopexin-like repeats, which create a four-bladed beta-propeller, a structure known to provide substrate specificity and to mediate inhibitor interaction in other MMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. These features are conserved in <italic>Xenopus</italic> Mmp21 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and fold into a protein that, after maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A</xref>), is predicted by ColabFold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> to possess a bipolar, globular structure with an open catalytic cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p>

<title>A novel biallelic frameshift variant of <italic>MMP21</italic> causes HTX</title>
<p>The relevance of MMP21 for normal development is already evident but was further emphasized by our finding of a novel <italic>MMP21</italic> null allele in a cohort of 108 index cases with laterality defects (ID 4263)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Exome sequencing revealed a biallelic germline deletion c.537_547delGCTGCTGGGCG in the female proband (II-6) with familial HTX, born to consanguineous parents (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). This small deletion translates to an early frameshift variant p.(L180Gfs*74), which is suspected to induce nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title><italic>Xenopus mmp21</italic> is specifically expressed in central LRO cells</title>
<p>To get an entry point for our functional study, we then analyzed the spatio-temporal activity of <italic>mmp21</italic> via RNA ISH in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). <italic>mmp21</italic> expression starts during neurulation and is pronounced when leftward fluid flow peaks at stage 17. Transcripts appear in posterior cells of the embryonic midline with hypo- and notochordal fate. These cells include the central flow-generating cells of the LRO but not the somitic LRO sensor cell population. After neurulation, the expression of <italic>mmp21</italic> gradually diminishes, though it remains detectable in the tailbud during later stages. Notably, <italic>mmp21</italic> expression in zebrafish embryos is restricted to LRO cells as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, suggesting a specific role for the peptidase in events occurring within that tissue.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Disturbed flow response induces laterality defects in <italic>mmp21</italic> mutants</title>
<p>In order to characterize the physiological function of Mmp21, we chose a CRISPR/Cas9 based LOF approach to generate f0 mutants, also known as crispants. Zygotes were injected with Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (CRNP) made with a sgRNA directed against the second exon of <italic>mmp21</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2A</xref>). This target site corresponds to D142 within the propeptide of Mmp21 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Direct sequencing of PCR products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> from pooled genomic DNA of stage 45 tadpoles and subsequent Synthego Inference of CRISPR Edits (ICE) analysis confirmed efficient mutagenesis of the <italic>mmp21</italic> locus with an indel rate of 92 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2A</xref>). <italic>mmp21</italic> crispants presented high rates of HTX and SI, when scored for heart, gallbladder and intestine orientation at stage 45, but developed otherwise normally (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), thereby phenocopying humans with biallelic <italic>MMP21</italic> LOF variants.</p>

</fig>
<p>Assessments of the Nodal cascade in Mmp21 depleted embryos were conducted with a <italic>pitx2</italic> ISH, which revealed absence of left-sided cascade activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Of note, reintroduction of <italic>mmp21</italic> mRNA rescued <italic>pitx2</italic> expression in the left LPM, thus demonstrating specificity of the LOF phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2B</xref>). Surprisingly, when we mutagenized <italic>mmp21</italic> exclusively on the left or on the right side, we found both sides contributing to the phenotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), a characteristic that was never reported for a factor in this context before.</p>
<p>Due to our observation that <italic>mmp21</italic> is expressed in the central proportion of the LRO, a cell population only known for the generation of the leftward fluid flow, we analyzed fluid flow dynamics of <italic>mmp21</italic> mutants via videomicroscopy-based tracking of applied fluorescent microspheres (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). However, neither flow directionality nor flow speed was disturbed, in good agreement with the undisturbed cilia motility in <italic>Mmp21</italic> mutant mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In the light of these results, we hypothesized that loss of Mmp21 should manifest at the level of LRO sensor cells, which perceive and interpret the leftward fluid flow. Hence, LRO <italic>nodal1</italic> and <italic>dand5</italic> expression domains were quantified post-flow in <italic>mmp21</italic> crispants using ISH and subsequent image thresholding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">E</xref>). As expected, the domain size of <italic>nodal1</italic> was unaltered in <italic>mmp21</italic> mutants. Intriguingly, comparison of left versus right <italic>dand5</italic> domains unveiled that regular left-sided attenuation of <italic>dand5</italic> mRNA level, i.e. flow response, failed in Mmp21-depleted embryos. Accordingly, <italic>pitx2</italic> expression was reestablished in <italic>mmp21</italic> crispants by a left-sided translation-blocking morpholino oligomer (TBMO) mediated knockdown of <italic>dand5</italic> to mimic flow response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2C</xref>). These results suggest that downstream events like Nodal1 maturation, secretion, transfer to the LPM or self-induction are Mmp21-independent processes. Thus, Mmp21 function is situated in a hub downstream of flow but upstream of <italic>dand5</italic> repression.</p>

<p>Our initial rescue experiments showed a relatively high proportion of embryos that activated the Nodal cascade not only on the left but also ectopically on the right side, raising the question whether this phenotype is representative for a Mmp21 GOF. To test this idea, we overexpressed Mmp21 in left versus right LRO cells followed by a <italic>pitx2</italic> ISH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Mmp21 was found to be a potent inducer of bilateral Nodal signaling, particularly when targeted to the right side. However, left-sided <italic>mmp21</italic> injections were also able to initiate the cascade on the contralateral side but with reduced efficacy. Strikingly, frequencies of virtually 100 % could be achieved with the same left-sided injection scheme by gradually increasing the <italic>mmp21</italic> dose, indicating that Mmp21 acts non-cell-autonomously. Ectopic activation of the Nodal cascade can result from a defective midline barrier, which is a transient group of axial cells expressing Lefty to shield the right LPM from left-sided Nodal-signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. To exclude that Mmp21 affects this structure, we first analyzed <italic>lefty</italic> expression along the midline with ISH in embryos overexpressing Mmp21, but found no reduction on mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3A</xref>). Since Mmp21 and Lefty may interact on protein level and because one would expect a delayed right-sided cascade initiation if this phenotype was caused from midline leakage, we monitored the onset of <italic>nodal1</italic> expression stage-wise with an ISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3B</xref>). Within this fine-meshed temporal resolution, we observed a synchronized emergence of left- and right-sided <italic>nodal1</italic> expression in Mmp21 GOF embryos. Therefore, we conclude that Mmp21 is a non-cell-autonomous inducer of the Nodal cascade, which does not compromise the barrier function of the midline.</p>

<p>Next, we wanted to assess if the catalytic activity of Mmp21 is necessary for its function (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Surprisingly, an active site mutant E338A construct was still able to induce the Mmp21 GOF phenotype. In contrast, the triple mutant H337F-E338A-H341F construct, in which the two HEXXH domain histidines were additionally changed to phenylalanine, lost the potency to induce the Nodal cascade. These data imply that the integrity of the CD is likely required for Mmp21 function, whereas its enzymatic activity might not be crucial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our LOF analysis showed that Mmp21 is required for the downregulation of <italic>dand5</italic> in left LRO sensor cells. Consequently, we hypothesized that the gain of Mmp21 attenuates <italic>dand5</italic> in right sensor cells, too, thereby inducing ectopic Nodal signaling. In agreement with this idea, <italic>nodal1</italic> expression at the LRO was not affected by overexpressed Mmp21 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) but <italic>dand5</italic> on the right side was reduced to the level of the left side post-flow (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Mmp21 acts as a morphogen</title>
<p>Expression of <italic>mmp21</italic> in central LRO cells, Mmp21-dependent <italic>dand5</italic> repression in LRO sensor cells, non-cell-autonomous induction of the Nodal cascade by Mmp21 and the presence of a N-terminal signal-peptide in Mmp21 pointed to a scenario in which the peptidase specifies the left-right axis as would a classical morphogen. Hence, we decided to analyze the localization of Mmp21 via immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Visualization was achieved with an HA-tagged Mmp21, as one commercial and two custom-made antibodies failed to detect the endogenous protein. Mmp21-HA, which was unilaterally expressed in LRO cells, showed a diffuse distribution with scattered apical aggregates. Remarkably, Mmp21-HA was not limited to targeted cells marked by co-injected mGFP but spread over the LRO as would be expected for a diffusible signaling molecule. To verify that the observed distribution is not artifactual, injected embryos were incubated during LRO formation with Brefeldin A, a fungal lactone known to block vesicle transport along the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi route, thus inhibiting secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Brefeldin A effectively reduced the spreading of Mmp21, limiting it to the injected mGFP-positive LRO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3C</xref>). Notably, the diffusion of Mmp21 was also observed if the construct was targeted to LRO-unrelated naïve epithelial cells of the animal cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3D</xref>). In this tissue, Mmp21 was not only found in vesicular structures of targeted, mGFP-positive cells but also in clusters along the apical cell borders of non-targeted, mGFP-negative cells, which resembled the localization of Wnt and Hedgehog ligands during their diffusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In order to study if extracellular mobility is relevant for Mmp21 function, we utilized archenteron injections of methylcellulose (MC), a minimally invasive method to increase the viscosity of the extracellular fluid over the LRO (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The MC injections alone prevented the induction of the Nodal cascade. Notably, MC also prevented the non-cell-autonomous contralateral induction of the Nodal cascade caused by left-sided <italic>mmp21</italic> injections, which was sufficient to restore wild-type Nodal signaling in an autocrine fashion. Likewise, the Nodal cascade was inverted if MC was injected into embryos that overexpressed Mmp21 on the right side. In conclusion, MC restricts the field of Mmp21 action to expressing cells, reinforcing the notion that the peptidase may acts as a <italic>bona fide</italic> morphogen in the context of leftward fluid flow.</p>

<title>Cirop is a downstream effector of Mmp21 on LRO cilia</title>
<p>We recently identified and characterized Cirop, another peptidase of the metzincin type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), which is also required downstream of flow but upstream of <italic>dand5</italic> repression. However, unlike Mmp21, Cirop harbors a C-terminal transmembrane domain, is expressed in LRO sensor cells, acts cell-autonomously on the left side and is unable to induce HTX upon overexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. These findings suggested to us that Cirop constitutes a permissive signal for left-right axis specification and could therefore function as a downstream effector of Mmp21. This conception was further supported by the striking cilia localization of HA-tagged Cirop in targeted mGFP-positive LRO sensor cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Cirop is a downstream transducer of Mmp21 at LRO cilia.</title>

<p>To test the hierarchical placement of these two peptidases, <italic>mmp21</italic> mRNA and <italic>cirop</italic> CRNPs were co-injected into left blastomeres, leading to left-sided <italic>cirop</italic> mutants that simultaneously overexpress Mmp21 on the ipsilateral side (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In these embryos, Mmp21 was unable to rescue the absence of the Nodal cascade caused by left-sided loss of Cirop. Instead, Nodal signaling was largely inverted, which is in line with the diffusible nature of Mmp21 and its placement upstream of Cirop, which remained unedited and thus functional on the right side.</p>
<p>In summary, our analysis uncovered the underlying pathomechanism of HTX, attributed to homozygous <italic>MMP21</italic> null variants like the novel p.(L180Gfs*74) variant described in this study. It revealed that Mmp21 conveys the positional information for the hitherto unspecified left side as a fluid flow transported morphogen.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The number of reported <italic>MMP21</italic> variants associated with HTX is increasing, but the function and hierarchical position of Mmp21 within the underlying process of laterality determination remained enigmatic. Our functional study shows that Mmp21 has a pivotal role in symmetry breakage and builds a functional unit with the leftward fluid flow. We would like to propose that Mmp21 embodies the long sought-after instructive cue, enriched asymmetrically by the ciliated LRO.</p>
<p>Our model suggests the following steps (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>): (1) Central LRO cells synthesize and release Mmp21 from their apical side. (2) The cilia driven leftward fluid flow guides the diffusion of Mmp21 towards left LRO sensor cells. (3) Mmp21 signaling through ciliary localized Cirop in left sensor cells eventually triggers the post-transcriptional downregulation of <italic>dand5</italic>, leading to the activation of Nodal signaling on the left side.</p>
<p>This model is a derivation of the so-called morphogen model, originally suggested in the groundbreaking paper by the Hirokawa group on the identification of leftward fluid flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. It provides a compelling explanation for the <italic>mmp21</italic> LOF and GOF results across many levels of analysis. The Nodal cascade pattern provides a useful readout to assess the rigor of mechanistic models in the laterality field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, despite not being analyzed or discussed in many studies nowadays. In the case of Mmp21 LOF, absence of the Nodal cascade can be attributed to the loss of the instructive signal, namely Mmp21, carrying the identity information for the left side. In contrast, the bilateral Nodal cascade observed after Mmp21 GOF results from excessive signal, which has the ability to diffuse against the fluid flow under non-physiological conditions. The Hirokawa group postulated that only proteins in the range of 20-40 kDa could generate a stationary gradient over the LRO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. We interpolated their data and concluded that it is valid to extend this to 50 kDa, matching the molecular weight of mature Mmp21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A</xref>). However, as Mmp21 resembled the localization of Wnt and Hedgehog ligands during their proteoglycan-associated spread in naïve epithelia cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, one can speculate that interactions with components of the extracellular matrix may occur. Such interactions could limit arbitrary diffusion of Mmp21 within the flow medium in accordance with absence of the Nodal cascade in cases of disturbed cilia motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our model contrasts with the so-called two-cilia model, which is based on Brueckner and colleagues’ idea that mechanosensory cilia directly detect the fluid flow <italic>per se</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The Hamada and Yuan groups independently demonstrated that bending of LRO cilia induces <italic>dand5</italic> flow response in sensor cells, using an elaborate optical tweezer setup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. This response was linked with a higher number of intracellular calcium ion transients and depended on Polycistin 2 (Pkd2), which forms homo-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> or heterotetrametric cation channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Pkd2 complexes with the potential channel subunit Polycistin 1 like 1 (Pkd1l1) presumably on LRO cilia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Like <italic>MMP21</italic> and <italic>CIROP</italic>, <italic>PKD1L1</italic> is associated with HTX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (MIM 617205) and belongs to the same genetic module that is only preserved in species with a flow generating LRO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. As Pkd1l1 appears to be an upstream repressor of Pkd2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, one can speculate that Mmp21 and Cirop directly inactivate Pkd1l1 through its large extracellular domain, linking protease activity to flow-related calcium signaling.</p>
<p>Of note, we do not exclude the possibility that bending of LRO cilia has instructive capacity for the left-right axis. A scenario is conceivable in which the basic mechanisms from the two-cilia and morphogen model cooperate to increase systemic robustness, thus lowering the intrinsic frequency of laterality defects. Such a scenario is also supported by a recent report from the Niehrs group published during the preparation of this manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The authors describe that the secreted growth factor R-spondin 2 (Rspo2), which has not yet been described to be causative for human laterality defects, appears to act as a fluid flow transported morphogen in <italic>Xenopus</italic> as well. Deciphering the hierarchy of these potentially interlinked determinants in different model organisms will shed light on the composition of the core module required for leftward fluid flow perception.</p>

Cell borders are marked by F-actin. <bold>(D)</bold> Diffusion of Mmp21 in LRO-unrelated naïve epithelial cells occurs along cell borders, which are visualized by F-actin. Cell bodies and borders of Mmp21 secreting cells are marked by co-expressed mGFP. Dashed white line rectangles outline the magnified regions, highlighting Mmp21-HA foci between non-secreting cells. Orthogonal view shows apical aggregation of Mmp21-HA.</p></caption>

<p>This report explores the role of matrix metalloprotease MMP21 in left-right patterning in Xenopus. Based on a series of <bold>compelling</bold> experiments, the authors demonstrate that MMP21 can be secreted and acts upstream of dand5 without affecting cilia flow. The experiments are interesting and <bold>valuable</bold>; however, the claims by the authors lack consideration of other models that could also explain their findings.</p>

<p>The manuscript describes the role of mmp21, a metallopeptidase, in left-right patterning. MMP21 has been implicated in genetic studies of patients with heterotaxy and the authors add an additional case. However, a molecular mechanism for Htx/LR patterning defects is not clear although one previous study implicated Notch signaling. The authors find that mmp21 does indeed cause LR patterning defects in Xenopus consistent with work in mice and zebrafish without affecting cilia motility. Importantly, the authors extend this work to place mmp21 in the LR pathway between dand5 (in the nodal cascade) and the cilia-driven sensation of flow. With RNA overexpression studies, the authors show MMP21 can induce Nodal signaling bilaterally suggesting it is an activator of the pathway, potentially through regulation of dand5 asymmetry. The authors also show that the role of MMP21 is upstream of another matrix metalloprotease CIROP which is tethered to the plasma membrane and possibly the cilium. They propose that mmp21, which is secreted, may represent a morphogen that is asymmetrically distributed along the LR axis due to cilia-driven flow and sensed by sensory cilia in the LRO.</p>
<p>The authors attempt to address a highly controversial subject in the LR patterning field, that is, the debate between Nodal Vesicular Particles (NVP, ie morphogens) being driven by cilia to activate signaling on the left and the Two Cilia model which posits that mechanosensation of fluid flow and not morphogens drive asymmetric organogenesis.</p>
<p>The model they propose is that mmp21 is secreted in the center of the LRO. LRO cilia generate leftward flow driving mmp21 to the left where sensory cilia at the LRO margin detect the mmp21 via cirop and suppress dand5, leading to activation of Nodal and Pitx2 expression.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the authors need to consider alternative models in the discussion and acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses of their work. All three reviewers felt that their conclusion that mmp21 is a morphogen is premature and that other models could also fit their data which needs to be discussed. The authors need to soften the conclusion that other models have been excluded.</p>
