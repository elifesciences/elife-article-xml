<title>Abstract</title><p>The prevailing opinion emphasizes fronto-parietal network (FPN) is key in mediating general fluid intelligence (gF). Meanwhile, recent studies show that human MT complex (hMT+), located at the occipito-temporal border and involved in 3D perception processing, also plays a key role in gF. However, the underlying mechanism is not clear, yet. To investigate this issue, our study targets visuo-spatial intelligence, which is considered to have high loading on gF. We use ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA/glutamate concentrations in hMT+ combined with resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC), behavioral examinations including hMT+ perception suppression test, and a gF subtest for its visuo-spatial component. Our findings show that both GABA in hMT+ and frontal-hMT+ functional connectivity significantly correlate with the performance of visuo-spatial intelligence. Further, serial mediation model demonstrates that the effect of hMT+ GABA on visuo-spatial <italic>g</italic>F is fully mediated by the hMT+ frontal FC. Together, our findings highlight the importance in integrating sensory and frontal cortices in mediating the visuospatial component of general fluid intelligence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>General fluid intelligence (gF) is a current problem-solving ability, which shows high inter-individual differences in humans(Cattell &amp; Raymond, 1963). At the beginning of the last century, Spearman(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Spearman, 1904</xref>) proposed that some general or g factor contributes to our gF. One key component of gF is visuo-spatial intelligence that, usually tested by visual materials, shows high g-loading(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Colom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Deary et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jung &amp; Haier, 2007</xref>). The exact neural mechanisms of the interplay of visuo spatial intelligence with gF remain yet unclear, though.</p>
<p>The“neuro-efficiency” hypothesis is one explanation for individual differences in gF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haier et al., 1988</xref>). This hypothesis puts forward that the human brain’s ability to suppress irrelevant information leads to more efficient cognitive processing. Correspondingly, using a well-known visual motion paradigm (center-surround antagonism)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>), Melnick et al found a strong link between suppression index (SI) of motion perception and the scores of the block design test (BDT, a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), which measures the visuo-spatial component (3D domain) of gF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>). Motion surround suppression (SI), a specific function of human extrastriate cortical region, middle temporal complex (hMT+), aligns closely with this region’s activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gautama &amp; Van Hulle, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, hMT+ is a sensory cortex involved in visual perception processing (3D domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cumming &amp; DeAngelis, 2001</xref>). These findings suggest that hMT+ potentially plays a significant role in 3D visuo-spatial gF by facilitating the efficient processing of 3D visual information and suppressing irrelevant information. However, more evidence is needed to uncover how the hMT+ functions as a core region for 3D visuo-spatial intelligence. We here hypothesize a key role of hMT+ GABA and its functional connectivity with the frontal cortex in mediating visuospatial gF(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>).</p>

The inhibition mechanism centered on hMT+, including the molecular level: the GABAergic inhibition in hMT+ (green circle), brain connectivity level: hMT+ - frontal functional connectivity (blue circle), and behavior level: hMT+ specific surround suppression of visual motion (red circle), contributes to the visuo-spatial component of gF (3D domain, yellow circle). (<bold>b)</bold> Schematic of experimental design. Session 1 (rectangle box of short line) was the functional MRI and MRS scanning at resting state. Session 2 (rectangle box of solid line) was another region of MRS acquisition. In the two sessions, the order of MRS scanning regions (hMT+ and V1) was counter balanced across participants. There was a structural MRI scanning before each MRS data acquisition. The interval between the two sessions was used for behavioral measurement (rectangle box of dotted line): block design task (BDT) and psychophysical task - motion discrimination.

<p>To investigate our hypothesis, this work conducted multi-level examination including biochemical (Glutamatergic - GABAergic in hMT+), regional-systemic (brain connectivity with hMT+ - based), and behavioral (visual motion function in hMT+) levels to reveal if hMT+ contributes to the 3D visuo-spatial component of gF. We employ ultra-high field (7T) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technology to reliably resolve GABA and Glu concentrations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ende, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Song et al., 2021</xref>). To verify the specificity of hMT+, we used primary visual cortex (V1) - based GABA/Glu as control as it mediates the 2D rather than 3D visual domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cumming &amp; DeAngelis, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings first demonstrate that GABAergic inhibition mechanisms (but not excitatory Glu) in hMT+ region relate to 3D visuo-spatial ability. Further, analysis of functional brain connectivity at rest reveals that the network (between hMT+ and frontal cortex) relating to hMT+ GABA and perceptual suppression contribute to visuo-spatial gF. Our results provide direct evidence that GABA-ergic inhibitory mechanisms in hMT+ region (a sensory cortex) mediate the multi-level visuo-spatial component (3D domain) of gF thus drawing a direct connection of biochemistry, brain connectivity, and behavior.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To determine whether the function of hMT+ cortex contributes to visuo-spatial component (3D domain) of gF, we adopted the experimental design depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>. Thirty-six healthy subjects participated in this study. Participants underwent two MRI sessions: the first encompassing resting-state fMRI and magnetic resonance spectra (MRS), and the second solely involving MRS. A 30-minute interval separated these sessions, during which participants performed motion discrimination tasks (using center-surround antagonism stimuli)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>) and the block design test (BDT), which assesses the visuo-spatial ability (3D domain) of gF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fangmeier et al., 2006</xref>). In the motion discrimination tasks, a grating of either large or small size was randomly presented at the center of the screen. The grating drifted either leftward or rightward, and participants were asked to judge the perceived moving direction. While in the Block design test, participants were asked to rebuild the figural pattern within a specified time limit using a set of red and white blocks. Both the volume-of-interests (VOIs) of MRS scanning in the left hMT+ (targeted brain area) and the left primary visual cortex (V1, control brain area) had dimensions of 2×2×2 cm<sup>3</sup>, with the MRS scanning sequences being randomized across the two MRS sessions. The hMT+ MRS VOIs were demarcated using an anatomical landmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dumoulin et al., 2000</xref>). For 14 subjects, we also utilized fMRI to functionally pinpoint the hMT+ to validate the placement of the VOI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, b). The V1 MRS VOIs were anatomically defined (Methods). Here, MRS data after extensive quality control (31/36 in hMT+, and 28/36 in V1) were taken for further analysis (Methods).</p>

<title>GABA and Glu concentrations in hMT+ and V1 and their relation to SI and BDT</title>
<p>An example of a MRS voxel located in hMT+ is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>. LCModel fittings for GABA spectra from all subjects in hMT+ (<italic>n</italic> = 31) and V1 (<italic>n</italic> = 28) are illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref> (color scale presents the BDT scores). We discerned a significant association between the inter-subjects’ BDT scores and the GABA levels in hMT+ voxels, but not in V1 voxels. Quantitative analysis displayed that BDT significantly correlates with GABA concentrations in hMT+ voxels (<italic>r</italic> = 0.39, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03, <italic>n</italic> = 31, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). After using partial correlation to control for the effect of age, the relationship remains significant (<italic>r</italic><sub>partial</sub> = 0.43 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02, 1 participant excluded due to the age greater than mean + 2.5SD). In contrast, there was no correlation between BDT and GABA levels in V1 voxels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">figure supplement 1a</xref>). Further, we show that SI significantly correlates with GABA levels in hMT+ voxels (<italic>r</italic> = 0.44, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 31, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). In contrast, no significant correlation between SI and GABA concentrations in V1 voxels was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">figure supplement 1b</xref>). This finding is in line with prior results, which indicates that motion perception is associated with neural activity in hMT+ area, but not in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schallmo et al., 2018</xref>). LCModel fittings for Glu spectra from all subjects in hMT+ (<italic>n</italic> = 31) and V1 (<italic>n</italic> = 28) voxels are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">figure supplement 2a</xref>.</p>

<p>Unlike in the case of GABA, no significant correlations between BDT and Glu levels were found in both hMT+ and V1 voxels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">figure supplement 2b, c</xref>). While, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Song et al., 2021</xref>), we observed significant positive correlations between GABA and Glu concentrations in both hMT+ (<italic>r</italic> = 0.62, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>n</italic> = 31) and V1 voxels (<italic>r</italic> = 0.56, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002, <italic>n</italic> = 28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3a, b</xref>). Additionally, significant correlations between SI and BDT, small threshold and SI were discerned (<italic>r</italic> = 0.59, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0002, <italic>n</italic> = 34, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3e</xref>, <italic>r</italic><sub>partial</sub> = 0.67, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, 1 participant excluded due to the age greater than mean + 2.5SD; <italic>r</italic> = -0.43, <italic>P</italic> = 0.016, <italic>r<sub>partial</sub></italic> = 0.44, <italic>P</italic> = 0.014). While there was no significant correlation between large threshold and SI, corroborating previous conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>). Two outliers evident in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref> were excluded, with consistent results depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">figure supplement 4a</xref>.

<title>MT - frontal FC relates to SI and BDT</title>
<p>We next took the left hMT+ as the seed region and separately measured interregional FCs between the seed region and each voxel in the frontal regions (a priori search space). These measurements were correlated with the performance in 3D visuospatial ability (BDT) to identify FCs with significant correlations. Results from connectivity-BDT analysis are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>. We found that brain regions with high FC strength to the seed region (left hMT+) significantly correlated with BDT scores, these included mainly regions situated within the canonical cognitive cores of FPN (Brodmann areas (BAs) 6, 9, 10, 46, 47)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Assem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Deary et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Duncan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Duncan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gray et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jung &amp; Haier, 2007</xref>).

<p>To address the question whether spatial suppression plays a role, we correlated hMT+ - based global FCs with SI. Though spatial suppression during motion perception (quantified by SI) is considered to be the function of area hMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gautama &amp; Van Hulle, 2001</xref>), the top-down modulation from the frontal cortex can increase surround suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Our functional connectivity-SI analysis in the frontal regions (a priori search space) displayed 3 brain regions in which FCs strength significantly correlated with SI: right BA4/6, left BA6, and right BA46 (summarized in Table supplement 2, and shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Across the whole brain search, we identified total 7 brain regions in which FCs strength significantly correlated with SI, and 3 of these were in the frontal cortex.

<title>Local hMT+ GABA acts on SI and BDT via global MT-frontal connectivity</title>
<p>To determine whether local neurotransmitter levels (such as GABA and Glu) in the hMT+ region mediate the broader 3D visuo-spatial ability of BDT, which as a component of gF, is linked to the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fangmeier et al., 2006</xref>), we correlated the significant FCs of hMT+ – frontal in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref> (also shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) with the GABA and Glu levels in hMT+ region.

There were no significant correlations between these FCs and the excitatory Glu levels in hMT+ (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Across the whole brain search, we obtained the same two hMT+ - frontal FCs significantly correlating with both hMT+ GABA levels and BDT (Table supplement 4), this is consistent with the results in the priori search space (frontal cortex) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

<p>Taken together, our results displayed that the overlap FCs from the analyses of connectivity - behavior (BDT and SI) -GABA are the hMT+ - BA 46 and hMT+ - BA 6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, b). These results suggest that the coupling of FCs of hMT+ - frontal regions (BA 46 and BA 6) with local hMT+ GABA provides the neural basis for both the simple motion perception (quantified by SI) and the complex 3D visuo-spatial ability (quantified by BDT).</p>
<p>In order to fully investigate the potential roles of the multiples variables contributing to BDT scores, serial mediation analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hayes, 2013</xref>) were applied to both MR and behavioral data. Following our hypothesis, the independent variable (X) is hMT+ GABA, the dependent variable (Y) is BDT scores, the covariate is the age, and the mediators are FC (M1) and SI (M2). We used the overlap clusters from the analyses of connectivity-BDT-GABA and connectivity-SI-GABA to compute the FC of hMT+ - BA46, 1 participant was excluded due to his age greater than mean + 2.5SD. The serial mediation model is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>. GABA levels in hMT+ significantly negatively correlated with the FC of hMT+ - BA46 (β = - 0.32, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), which in turn significantly negatively correlated with SI (β = - 0.19, <italic>P</italic> = 0.035), and consequently, significantly positively correlated with BDT (β = 38.5, <italic>P</italic> = 0.009). Critically, bootstrapped analyses revealed that our hypothesized indirect effect (i.e., hMT+ GABA → FC of hMT+ - BA46 → SI → BDT) was significant (β = 2.28, SE = 1.54, 95% CI = [0.03, 5.94]). The model accounted for 34% of the variance in BDT. However, when considering the MT-BA6 FC as the mediator M1, the serial model does not show a significant indirect effect. Consequently, we explored a mediation model, which revealed that the MT-BA6 FC totally mediates the relationship between GABA and BDS. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). For sensitivity purposes, we tested the alternative models, in which the order of the mediators was reversed. The pathway that hMT+ GABA was predicted to be associated with SI, followed by the FC of hMT+ - BA 46, and then BDT, did not yield the chained mediation effects on BDT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">figure supplement 6</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize (shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), the results from the serial mediation analyses are consistent with our hypothesis. That is, higher GABAergic inhibition in hMT+ relates to stronger negative FC between hMT+ and BA46, leading to enhanced ability for surround suppression (filtering out irrelevant information(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tadin, 2015</xref>), which ultimately results in more efficient visual 3D processing as key component of gF (the higher BDT scores).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we provide evidence that hMT+ inhibitory mechanisms mediate processing in the visuo-spatial component (3D domain) of gF on multiple levels, that is, from molecular over brain connectivity to behavior. First, this study found that higher hMT+ inhibitory GABA levels (but not excitatory Glu) relate to FC between hMT+ and BA 46 that contribute to both SI and 3D visuo-spatial intelligence (BDT). Our serial mediation analyses indicate that the inhibitory mechanisms related to hMT+ and its GABA levels (but not Glu), FCs of hMT+ - BA46 coupling with hMT+ inhibitory GABA (but not excitatory Glu), and behavior (SI indexing perceptual suppression in hMT+) predict the inter-subject variance in the 3D visuo-spatial intelligence (BDT) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>). Second, we demonstrate discrete GABAergic inhibition mechanisms in hMT+ that mediate the strong FCs between hMT+ - frontal regions (BA46 and BA6): significant negative correlation with the FC of hMT+ - BA 46 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>), whereas there is significant positive correlation with the FC of hMT+ - BA 6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). This indicates that different frontal regions, DLPFC (BA 46) and premotor cortex (BA6), contribute uniquely to gF through hMT+ - based inhibitory mechanisms.</p>
<p>The goal of our research is to reveal that the inhibitory (not excitatory) mechanism in hMT+ contributes to multi-level processing in 3D visuo-spatial ability (BDT). Monkey electrophysiological experiments revealed that selective attention gates the visual cortex, including area MT, effectively suppressing the irrelevant information(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Everling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Treue &amp; Maunsell, 1996</xref>). These findings align with the “neural efficiency” hypothesis of intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haier et al., 1988</xref>), which puts forward the human brain’s ability to suppress the repetition of information. Neural suppression is associated with the balance between excitation and inhibition (EIB), usually represented by covariation between Glutamate and GABA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ozeki et al., 2009</xref>). Here, this study exploited the high spectral resolution afforded by ultrahigh field (7T) MRS to reliably resolve GABA measurement, to adequately discriminate the glutamate and glutamine signals, and to resolve the high accuracy Glu measurement(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ende, 2015</xref>). This work implemented the MRS scanning in hMT+ (3D visual domain) and V1 (2D visual domain) regions and found that hMT+ inhibitory GABA (but not excitatory Glu) significantly correlated with 3D visuo-spatial intelligence, i.e., the higher GABA levels in hMT+ (rather than excitatory Glu) relate to higher visual 3D processing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). We searched the global hMT+ - based FCs with the connectivity-BDT analyses (in priori search space and whole brain search to valid), and then, correlated these significant FCs with the GABA and Glu concentrations in hMT+ . We found two FCs (MT+ - BA46 and hMT+ - BA6) significantly correlating with hMT+ inhibitory GABA (whereas no FC significantly correlated with hMT+ excitatory Glu). Accordingly, our results emphasize the importance of hMT+ inhibitory GABA (but not excitatory Glu) in processing the 3D visual-spatial intelligence (BDT).</p>
<p>Our recent human study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Song et al., 2021</xref>) and other study’s animal experiments(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ozeki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sato et al., 2016</xref>) demonstrated that the conjoint action of inhibition (GABA) and excitation (Glu) underlies visual spatial suppression. In this work, our novel data show the chained mediation effects from local hMT+ GABA to more global 3D visuo-spatial intelligence: hMT+ GABA → FC (MT+ and BA46) → SI → BDT. Thereby, our data indicate that inhibitory mechanisms in hMT+, from the biochemical level of GABA over FC to the behavioral level, can predict the inter- subject variance in the 3D visuo-spatial intelligence (BDT) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>).</p>
<p>Another interesting finding reveal that GABAergic inhibition in hMT+ coupling with distinct functional connectivity patterns between BA 46-MT+ and BA6-MT+. A previous human fMRI experiment found that the positive and negative correlations between 3D visuo-spatial intelligence and the activation of frontal regions appeared at different reasoning phases (validation or integration phases during reasoning)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fangmeier et al., 2006</xref>). On the one hand, a monkey electrophysiological experiment reported the delayed modulation from PFC (especially in DLPFC (BA 46))) to area MT during a visual motion task(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zaksas &amp; Pasternak, 2006</xref>). Computational models converged with empirical data of awake monkey experiments slowing temporal modulation from PFC to MT/MST(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Donner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Siegel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wimmer et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, human MEG studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Donner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wilming et al., 2020</xref>) reported that gamma-band activity in visual cortex (including area MT) exhibits high coherence with the activity in (pre-) motor regions (BA 4/6). These results suggest that the relation of long-range FC and local inhibitory mechanism (MT+ GABA) support our findings that inhibitory GABA in hMT+ contributes to efficient long-range integration and coordination in distant brain areas like the prefrontal and premotor cortex.</p>
<p>How does hMT+ functions as a core region for 3D visuo-spatial intelligence. rather than as simple input module? The results in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, c showed that the overlap brain regions from the analyses of connectivity-BDT-GABA/connectivity-SI-GABA are the hMT+ - BA 46. This overlap couples with local visual suppression (SI) and consequently plays an important role in 3D visuo-spatial intelligence. The direction discrimination task in this work (the visual motion paradigm of center-surround antagonism) was previously considered a mainly local function of hMT+(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tadin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>). However, our results with connectivity-SI analyses revealed that both local (FC within BA 18) and global brain connectivity (FC between hMT+ and frontal regions) contribute to SI (Table supplement 3). In human psychophysical experiments(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>) the brief stimulus duration (∼100 ms) in motion discrimination precludes most top-down attentional feedback effects(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zaksas &amp; Pasternak, 2006</xref>), while, attention, which predicted the performance of the motion discrimination task, was sustained throughout the stimulus intervals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Siegel et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, animal experiments have revealed that the local circuits in the visual cortex combining with top-down modulation and intracortical horizontal connection mediate the visual-spatial suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Angelucci et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Keller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results (shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, b, right) present the intrinsic binding of local GABAergic inhibition in hMT+, which suppressing redundancy of visual motion processing (SI), and the activity of brain connectivity between hMT+ and frontal regions. These individually inherent traits may contribute to the individual difference in 3D visuo-spatial ability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, b, left). A candidate divisive normalization model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carandini &amp; Heeger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Reynolds &amp; Heeger, 2009</xref>) can explain how such reverberation affects the process of suppressing the irrelevant information, from perception to intelligence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tadin, 2015</xref>). We summarize a framework (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) to indicate and visualize our findings.</p>
<p>Recently, Duncan et al. demonstrated coding of general fluid intelligence (gF) in distributed regions, defining them as part of multi-demand (MD) systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Assem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Duncan et al., 2020</xref>). The MD system encompasses a range of cognitive domains, including working memory, mathematics, language, and relational reasoning. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melnick et al. (2013)</xref>, motion surround suppression (SI) and time thresholds for small and large gratings, which reflect hMT+ functionality, are correlated with Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed indicators. Additionally, Fedorenko et al. identified multi-demand activation regions around the occipito-temporal areas, potentially overlapping with hMT+ (Fedorenko et al., 2013). As a key region in the representation of sensory flows (including optic, tactile, and auditory flows)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fetsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gu et al., 2006</xref>), hMT+ shows potential to be central to the MD system. Future research could focus on multi- task paradigms to further investigate the mechanisms of hMT+ and its relationship with broader cognitive functions.</p>
<p>Together, this study offers a comprehensive insight into how the information exchange and integration between the sensory cortex (hMT+) and cognition core of BA 46, coupling with the hMT+ GABA, can predict the performance of 3D visuo-spatial ability (BDT). Our results provide direct evidence that a sensory cortex area (hMT+), its GABA biochemistry, functional connectivity, and cognition behavior levels, can assemble into complex cognition as an 3D visuo-spatial intellectual hub.</p>

<p>All stimuli were generated using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) with Psychophysics Toolbox(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brainard, 1997</xref>), and were shown on a linearized monitor (1920×1080 resolution, 100-Hz refresh rate, Cambridge Research System, Kent, UK). The viewing distance was 72 cm from the screen, with the head stabilized by a chinrest. Stimuli were drawn against a gray (56 cd per m<sup>-2</sup>) background.</p>
<p>A schematic of the stimuli and trial sequences is shown in our recent study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Song et al., 2021</xref>). The stimulus was a vertical drifting sinusoidal grating (contrast, 50%; spatial frequency, 1 cycle/°; speed, 4°/s) of either small (diameter of 2°) or large (diameter of 10°) size. The edge of the grating was blurred with a raised cosine function (width, 0.3°). A cross was presented in the center of the screen at the beginning of each trial for 500ms, and participants were instructed to fixate at the cross and to keep fixating at the cross throughout the trial. In each trial, a grating of either large or small size was randomly presented at the center of the screen. The grating drifted either leftward or rightward, and participants were asked to judge the perceived moving direction by a key press. Response time was not limited. The grating was ramped on and off with a Gaussian temporal envelope, and the grating duration was defined as 1 SD of the Gaussian function. The duration was adaptively adjusted in each trial, and duration thresholds were estimated by a staircase procedure. Thresholds for large and small gratings were obtained from a 160-trial block that contained four interleaved 3-down/1- up staircases. For each participant, we computed the correct rate for different stimulus durations separately for each stimulus size. These values were then fitted to a cumulative Gaussian function, and the duration threshold corresponding to the 75% correct point on the psychometric function was estimated for each stimulus size.</p>
<p>Stimulus demonstration and practice trials were presented before the first run. Auditory feedback was provided for each wrong response.

<p>MR experiments were performed in a 7T whole body MR system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a Nova Medical 32 channel array head coil. Sessions included resting-state functional MRI, fMRI localizer scan, structural image scanning, and MRS scan. Resting-state scans were acquired with 1.5-mm isotropic resolution (transverse orientation, TR/TE = 2000/20.6 ms, 160 volumes, slice number = 90, flip angle = 70°, eyes closed). Structural images were acquired using a MP2RAGE sequence (TR/ TI1/ TI2 = 5000/901/3200 ms) with 0.7-mm isotropic resolution. MRS data were collected within two regions (MT+ and V1) for each subject, and we divided them into two sessions to avoid discomfort caused by long scanning. The order of MRS VOIs (MT+ and V1) in the two sessions was counterbalanced across participants. Interval between two sessions was used for block design and motion discrimination tasks. One session included fMRI localizer scan, structural image scanning, and MRS scan for the hMT+ region; the other session included structural image scan, and MRS scan for the V1 region. Spectroscopy data were acquired using a <sup>1</sup>H-MRS single-voxel short-TE STEAM (Stimulated Echo Acquisition Mode) sequence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Frahm et al., 1989</xref>) (TE/TM/TR = 6/32/7100ms) with 4096 sampling points, 4-kHz bandwidth, 16 averages, 8 repetitions, 20×20×20 mm<sup>3</sup> VOI size, and VAPOR (variable power and optimized relaxation delays) water suppression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tkáč et al., 1999</xref>). Prior to acquisition, first- and second-order shims were adjusted using FASTMAP (fast, automatic shimming technique by mapping along projections(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gruetter, 1993</xref>). Two non-suppressed water spectra were also acquired: one for phase and eddy current correction (only RF pulse, 4 averages) and another for metabolite quantification (VAPOR none, 4 averages). Voxels were positioned based on anatomical landmarks using a structural image scan collected in the same session, while avoiding contamination by CSF, bone, and fat. The hMT+ VOIs were placed in the ventrolateral occipital lobe, which was based on anatomical landmarks(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dumoulin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schallmo et al., 2018</xref>). We did not distinguish between the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas in these hMT+ VOIs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huk et al., 2002</xref>). For 14 subjects, we also functionally identified hMT+ as a check on the placement of the VOI. A protocol was used with a drifting grating (15% contrast) alternated with a static grating across blocks (10 s block duration, 160 TRs total). Using fMRI BOLD signals, these localizer data were processed online to identify the hMT+ voxels in the lateral occipital cortex, which responded more strongly to moving vs. static gratings. In addition, we only used the left hMT+ as the target region to scan, which was motivated by studies showing that left hMT+ was more effective at causing perceptual effects(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tadin et al., 2011</xref>). For V1 region, the VOI was positioned on each subject’s calcarine sulcus on the left side(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tadin et al., 2011</xref>) based on anatomical landmarks(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boucard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dumoulin et al., 2000</xref>)</p>

<title>MRS data processing</title>
<p>Spectroscopy data were preprocessed and quantified using magnetic resonance signal processing and analysis, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/">https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/</ext-link> downloads/mrspa/), which runs under MATLAB and invokes the interface of the LCModel (Version 6.3-1L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). First, we used the non-suppressed water spectra to perform eddy current correction and frequency/phase correction. Second, we checked the quality of each FID (16 averages) visually and removed those with obviously poor quality. Third, the absolute concentrations of each metabolite were quantitatively estimated via the Water-Scaling method. For partial-volume correction, the tissue water content was computed as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ernst et al., 1993</xref>):

where <italic>fgm</italic>, <italic>fwm</italic>, and <italic>fcsf</italic> were the GM/WM/CSF volume fraction in MRS VOI and we used FAST (fMRI’s automated segmentation tool, part of the FSL toolbox)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>) to segment the three tissue compartments from the T1-weighted structural brain images. For water T2 correction, we set water T2 as 47ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marjańska et al., 2012</xref>). Our concentrations were mM per kg wet weight. Furthermore, LCModel analysis was performed on all spectra within the chemical shift range of 0.2 to 4.0 ppm.</p>
<p>Poor spectral quality was established by a Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of more than 20%(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cavassila et al., 2001</xref>), and some data were excluded from further analysis. The details were described in our recently paper(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Song et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Rs-fMRI data processing and analysis</title>
<p>Resting-state functional image was analyzed in the Data Processing and Analysis for Brain Imaging DPABI toolbox(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yan et al., 2016</xref>) based on SPM 12 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link>). The preprocessing steps included discard of the first five volumes, slice timing, realignment to the 90th slice, coregistration of each subject’s T1-weighted anatomical and functional images, segmentation of the anatomical images into six types of tissues using DARTEL, linear detrend, regressing nuisance variables (including realignment Friston 24-parameter, global signal, white matter and CSF signal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Friston et al., 1996</xref>), normalization to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space with the voxel size of 1.5× 1.5× 1.5 mm<sup>3</sup> using DARTEL, spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 3 mm full-width-half-maximum (FWHM), and band-pass filtering with Standard frequency band (SFB, 0.01–0.1 Hz). Spherical ROI with a radius of 6mm was placed in left MT. The coordinate for left MT (-46, -72, -4, in MNI space) was obtained by our localizer fMRI experiment. We calculated the seed-to-voxel whole brain FC map for each subject. All the FC values were Fisher-Z-transformed.</p>
<p>We did a similar connectivity-behavior analysis to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Song et al., 2008</xref>). First, we computed the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between BDT scores and the FC values across subjects in a voxel-based way. Then, to evaluate the significance, we transformed the <italic>r</italic>-value into <italic>t</italic>-value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="585863v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>df</italic> denotes to the degrees of freedom, and <italic>r</italic> is the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between BDT scores and the FC values. Here, <italic>df</italic> was equal to 27. The brain regions in which the FC values to the seed region was significantly correlated with the BDT scores were obtained with a threshold of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.005 for regions of <italic>a priori</italic> (|<italic>t</italic><sub>(27)</sub> | ≥ 3.057, and adjacent cluster size ≥ 23 voxels (AlphaSim corrected)), and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 for whole-brain analyses (|<italic>t</italic> (27) | ≥ 2.771 and adjacent cluster size ≥ 37 voxels (AlphaSim corrected).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>PROCESS version 3.4, a toolbox in SPSS, was used to examine the mediation model. There are some prerequisites for mediation analysis: the independent variable should be a significant predictor of the mediator, and the mediator should be a significant predictor of the dependent variable.</p>
<p>SPSS 20 (IBM, USA) was used to conduct all the remaining statistical analysis in the study. We evaluated the correlation of variables (GABA, Glu, SI, BDT) using Pearson’s correlation analysis. Differences or correlations were considered statistically significant if <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. Significances with multiple comparisons were tested with false discovery rate (<italic>FDR</italic>) correction. The effect of age on intelligence was controlled for by using partial correlation in the correlation analysis and was taken as a covariate in the serial mediation model analysis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study of human intelligence has been the focus of cognitive neuroscience research, and finding some objective behavioral or neural indicators of intelligence has been an ongoing problem for scientists for many years. Melnick et al, 2013 found for the first time that the phenomenon of spatial suppression in motion perception predicts an individual's IQ score. This is because IQ is likely associated with the ability to suppress irrelevant information. In this study, a high-resolution MRS approach was used to test this theory. In this paper, the phenomenon of spatial suppression in motion perception was found to be correlated with the visuo-spatial subtest of gF, while both variables were also correlated with the GABA concentration of MT+ in the human brain. In addition, there was no significant relationship with the excitatory transmitter Glu. At the same time, SI was also associated with MT+ and several frontal cortex FCs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) 7T high-resolution MRS is used.</p>
<p>(2) This study combines the behavioral tests, MRS, and fMRI.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) In Melnick (2013) IQ scores were measured by the full set of WAIS-III, including all subtests. However, this study only used visual spatial domain of gF. I wonder why only the visuo-spatial subtest was used not the full WAIS-III? I am wondering whether other subtests were conducted and, if so, please include the results as well to have comprehensive comparisons with Melnick (2013).</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>(1) Table 1 and Table supplementary 1-3 contain many correlation results. But what are the main points of these values? Which values do the authors want to highlight? Why are only p-values shown with significance symbols in Table supplementary 2??</p>
<p>(2) Line 27, it is unclear to me what is &quot;the canonical theory&quot;.</p>
<p>(3) Throughout the paper, the authors use &quot;MT+&quot;, I would suggest using &quot;hMT+&quot; to indicate the human MT complex, and to be consistent with the human fMRI literature.</p>
<p>(4) At the beginning of the results section, I suggest including the total number of subjects. It is confusing what &quot;31/36 in MT+, and 28/36 in V1&quot; means.</p>
<p>(5) Line 138, &quot;This finding supports the hypothesis that motion perception is associated with neural activity in MT+ area&quot;. This sentence is strange because it is a well established finding in numerous human fMRI papers. I think the authors should be more specific about what this finding implies.</p>
<p>(6) There are no unit labels for all x- and y-axies in Figure 1. I only see the unit for Conc is mmol per kg wet weight.</p>
<p>(7) Although the correlations are not significant in Figure supplement 2&amp;3, please also include the correlation line, 95% confidence interval, and report the r values and p values (i.e., similar format as in Figure 1C).</p>
<p>(8) There is no need to separate different correlation figures into Figure supplementary 1-4. They can be combined into the same figure.</p>
<p>(9) Line 213, as far as I know, the study (Melnick et al., 2013) is a psychophysical study and did not provide evidence that the spatial suppression effect is associated with MT+.</p>
<p>(10) At the beginning of the results, I suggest providing more details about the motion discrimination tasks and the measurement of the BDT.</p>
<p>(11) Please include the absolute duration thresholds of the small and large sizes of all subjects in Figure 1.</p>
<p>(12) Figure 5 is too small. The items in plot a and b can be barely visible.</p>

<p>(1) Throughout the manuscript, hMT+ connectivity with the frontal cortex has been treated as an a priori hypothesis/space. However, there is no such motivation or background literature mentioned in the Introduction. Can the authors clarify the necessity of functional connectivity? In other words, can BOLD activity of hMT+ in the localizer task substitute for functional connectivity between hMT+ and the frontal cortex?</p>
<p>(2) There is an obvious mismatch between the in-text description and the content of the figure:</p>
<p>&quot;In contrast, there was no correlation between BDT and GABA levels in V1 voxels (figure supplement 1a). Further, we show that SI significantly correlates with GABA levels in hMT+ voxels (r = 0.44, P = 0.01, n = 31, Figure 3d). In contrast, no significant correlation between SI and GABA concentrations in V1 voxels was observed (figure supplement 1b).&quot;</p>
<p>(3) The authors' response to my previous round of review indicated that the &quot;V1 ROIs&quot; covered a substantial amount of V3 (32%). Therefore, it would no longer be appropriate to call these &quot;V1 ROIs&quot;. I'd suggest renaming them as &quot;Early Visual Cortex (EVC) ROIs&quot; to be more accurate. Can the authors justify why choosing the left hemisphere for visual intelligence task, which is typically believed to be right lateralized?</p>
<p>(4) &quot;Small threshold&quot; and &quot;large threshold&quot; are neither standard descriptions, and it is unclear what &quot;small threshold&quot; refers to in the following figure caption. Additionally, the unit (ms) is confusing. Does it refer to timing?</p>
<p>&quot;(f) Peason's correlation showing significant negative correlations between BDT and small threshold.&quot;</p>
<p>(5) In the response letter, the authors mentioned incorporating the neural efficiency hypothesis in the Introduction, but the revised Introduction does not contain such information.</p>

<p>Author response:</p>
<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study of human intelligence has been the focus of cognitive neuroscience research, and finding some objective behavioral or neural indicators of intelligence has been an ongoing problem for scientists for many years. Melnick et al, 2013 found for the first time that the phenomenon of spatial suppression in motion perception predicts an individual's IQ score.

In addition, there was no significant relationship with the excitatory transmitter Glu. At the same time, SI was also associated with MT+ and several frontal cortex FCs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) 7T high-resolution MRS is used.</p>
<p>(2) This study combines the behavioral tests, MRS, and fMRI.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In the intro, it seems to me that the multiple-demand (MD) regions are the key in this study. However, I didn't see any results associated with the MD regions. Did I miss something?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you to the reviewer for pointing this out. After careful consideration, we agree with your point of view. According to the results of Melnick 2013, the motion surround suppression (SI) and the time thresholds of small and large gratings representing hMT+ functionality are correlated with Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed Indicators, with correlation coefficients of 0.69, 0.47, 0.49, and 0.50, respectively. This suggests that hMT+ does have the potential to become the core of MD system. However, due to our results only delving into “the GABA-ergic inhibition in human MT predicts visuo-spatial intelligence mediated through the frontal cortex”, it is not yet sufficient to prove that hMT+is the core node of the MD system, we have adjusted the explanatory logic of the article. Briefly, we emphasize the de-redundancy of hMT+ in visual-spatial intelligence and the improvement of information processing efficiency, while weaken the significance of hMT+ in MD systems.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) How was the sample size determined? Is it sufficient?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you to reviewer for pointing this out. We use G*power to determine our sample size. In the study by Melnick (2013), they reported a medium effect between SI and Perception Reasoning sub-ability (r=0.47). Here we use this r value as the correlation coefficient (ρ H1), setting the power at the commonly used threshold of 0.8 and the alpha error probability at 0.05. The required sample size is calculated to be 26. This ensures that our study has reasonable power to yield valid statistical results. Furthermore, compared to earlier within-subject studies like Schallmo et al.'s 2018 research, which used 22 datasets to examine GABA levels in MT+ and the early visual cortex (EVC), our study includes an enough dataset.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Schallmo elife 2018, there was no correlation between GABA concentration and SI. How can we justify the different results different here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank reviewer for pointing this out. There are several differences between us:</p>
<p>a. While the earlier study by Schallmo et al. (2018) employed 3T MRS, we utilize 7T MRS, enhancing our ability to detect and measure GABA with greater accuracy.</p>
<p>b. Schallmo elife 2018 choose to use the bilateral hMT+ as the MRS measurement region while we use the left hMT+. The reason why we focus on left hMT+ are describe in reviewer 1. (6). Briefly, use of left MT/V5 as a target was motivated by studies demonstrating that left MT/V5 TMS is more effective at causing perceptual effects (Tadin et al., 2011).</p>
<p>c. The resolution of MRS sequence in Schallmo elife 2018 is 3 cm isotropic voxel, while we apply 2 cm isotropic voxel. This helps us more precisely locate hMT+ and exclude more white matter signal.</p>

<p>(4) Basically this study contains the data of SI, BDT, GABA in MT+ and V1, Glu in MT+ and V1-all 6 measurements. There should be 6x5/2 = 15 pairwise correlations. However, not all of these results are included in Figure 1 and supplementary 1-3. I understand that it is not necessary to include all figures. But I suggest reporting all values in one Table.</p>

<p>(5) In Melnick (2013), the IQ scores were measured by the full set of WAIS-III, including all subtests. However, this study only used the visual spatial domain of gF. I wonder why only the visuo-spatial subtest was used not the full WAIS-III?</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The decision was informed by Melnick’s findings which indicated high correlations between Surround suppression (SI) and the Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed Indexes, with correlation coefficients of 0.69, 0.47, 0.49, and 0.50, respectively. It is well-established that the hMT+ region of the brain is a sensory cortex involved in visual perception processing (3D perception). Furthermore, motion surround suppression (SI), a specific function of hMT+, aligns closely with this region's activities. Given this context, the Perception Reasoning sub-ability was deemed to have the clearest mechanism for further exploration. Consequently, we selected the most representative subtest of Perception Reasoning—the Block Design Test—which primarily assesses 3D visual intelligence.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The main reason is that our MRS ROI is the left hMT+, we would like to make different models’ ROI consistent to each other.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Recent studies have identified specific regions within the occipito-temporal cortex as part of a broader fronto-parietal, domain-general, or &quot;multiple-demand&quot; (MD) network that mediates fluid intelligence (gF). According to the abstract, the authors aim to explore the mechanistic roles of these occipito-temporal regions by examining GABA/glutamate concentrations. However, the introduction presents a different rationale: investigating whether area MT+ specifically, could be a core component of the MD network.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide evidence that GABA concentrations in MT+ and its functional connectivity with frontal areas significantly correlate with visuo-spatial intelligence performance. Additionally, serial mediation analysis suggests that inhibitory mechanisms in MT+ contribute to individual differences in a specific subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, which assesses visuo-spatial aspects of gF.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the findings are compelling and the analyses robust, the study's rationale and interpretations need strengthening. For instance, Assem et al. (2020) have previously defined the core and extended MD networks, identifying the occipito-temporal regions as TE1m and TE1p, which are located more rostrally than MT+. Area MT+ might overlap with brain regions identified previously in Fedorenko et al., 2013, however the authors attribute these activations to attentional enhancement of visual representations in the more difficult conditions of their tasks. For the aforementioned reasons, It is unclear why the authors chose MT+ as their focus. A stronger rationale for this selection is necessary and how it fits with the core/extended MD networks.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We really appreciate reviewer’s opinions. The reason why we focus on hMT+ is following: According to the results of Melnick 2013, the motion surround suppression (SI) and the time thresholds of small and large gratings representing hMT+ functionality are correlated with Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed Indicators, with high correlation coefficients of 0.69, 0.47, 0.49, and 0.50, respectively. In addition, Fedorenko et al. 2013, the averaged MD activity region appears to overlap with hMT+. Based on these findings, we assume that hMT+ does have the potential to become the core of MD system.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Moreover, although the study links MT+ inhibitory mechanisms to a visuo-spatial component of gF, this evidence alone may not suffice to position MT+ as a new core of the MD network. The MD network's definition typically encompasses a range of cognitive domains, including working memory, mathematics, language, and relational reasoning. Therefore, the claim that MT+ represents a new core of MD needs to be supported by more comprehensive evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank reviewer for pointing this out. After careful consideration, we agree with your point of view. Due to our results only delving into visuo-spatial intelligence, it is not yet sufficient to prove that hMT is the core node of the MD system. We will adjust the explanatory logic of the article, that is, emphasizing the de-redundancy of hMT+in visual-spatial intelligence and the improvement of information processing efficiency, while weakening the significance of hMT+ in MD systems.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript aims to understand the role of GABA-ergic inhibition in the human MT+ region in predicting visuo-spatial intelligence through a combination of behavioral measures, fMRI (for functional connectivity measurement), and MRS (for GABA/glutamate concentration measurement). While this is a commendable goal, it becomes apparent that the authors lack fundamental understanding of vision, intelligence, or the relevant literature. As a result, the execution of the research is less coherent, dampening the enthusiasm of the review.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Comprehensive Approach: The study adopts a multi-level approach, i.e., neurochemical analysis of GABA levels, functional connectivity, and behavioral measures to provide a holistic understanding of the relationship between GABA-ergic inhibition and visuo-spatial intelligence.</p>
<p>(2) Sophisticated Techniques: The use of ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technology for measuring GABA and glutamate concentrations in the MT+ region is a recent development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Study Design and Hypothesis</p>
<p>(1) The central hypothesis of the manuscript posits that &quot;3D visuo-spatial intelligence (the performance of BDT) might be predicted by the inhibitory and/or excitation mechanisms in MT+ and the integrative functions connecting MT+ with the frontal cortex.&quot; However, several issues arise:</p>
<p>(1.1) The Suppression Index depicted in Figure 1a, labeled as the &quot;behavior circle,&quot; appears irrelevant to the central hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In our study, the inhibitory mechanisms in hMT+ are conceptualized through two models: the neurotransmitter model and the behavioral model. The Suppression Index is essential for elucidating the local inhibitory mechanisms within the behavioral model. However, we acknowledge that our initial presentation in the introduction may not have clearly articulated our hypothesis, potentially leading to misunderstandings. We have revised the introduction to better clarify these connections and ensure the relevance of the Suppression Index is comprehensively understood.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.2) The construct of 3D visuo-spatial intelligence, operationalized as the performance in the Block Design task, is inconsistently treated as another behavioral task throughout the manuscript, leading to confusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We acknowledge that our manuscript may have inconsistently presented this construct across different sections, causing confusion. To address this, we ensured a consistent description of 3D visuo-spatial intelligence in both the introduction and the discussion sections. But we maintained ‘Block Design task score' within the results section to help readers clarify which subtest we use.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.3) The schematics in Figure 1a and Figure 6 appear too high-level to be falsifiable. It is suggested that the authors formulate specific and testable hypotheses and preregister them before data collection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised the Figure 1a and made it less abstract and more logical. For Figure 6, the schematic represents our theoretical framework of how hMT+ contributes to 3D visuo-spatial intelligence, we believe the elements within this framework are grounded in related theories and supported by evidence discussed in our results and discussions section, making them specific and testable.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Central to the hypothesis and design of the manuscript is a misinterpretation of a prior study by Melnick et al. (2013). While the original study identified a strong correlation between WAIS (IQ) and the Suppression Index (SI), the current manuscript erroneously asserts a specific relationship between the block design test (from WAIS) and SI. It should be noted that in the original paper, WAIS comprises Similarities, Vocabulary, Block design, and Matrix reasoning tests in Study 1, while the complete WAIS is used in Study 2. Did the authors conduct other WAIS subtests other than the block design task?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. Reviewer #1 also asked this question, we copy the answers in here “The decision was informed by Melnick’s findings which indicated high correlations between Surround suppression (SI) and the Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed Indexes, with correlation coefficients of 0.69, 0.47, 0.49, and 0.50, respectively. It is well-established that the hMT+ region of the brain is a sensory cortex involved in visual perception processing (3D perception). Furthermore, motion surround suppression (SI), a specific function of hMT+, aligns closely with this region's activities. Given this context, the Perception Reasoning sub-ability was deemed to have the clearest mechanism for further exploration. Consequently, we selected the most representative subtest of Perception Reasoning—the Block Design Test—which primarily assesses 3D visual intelligence.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Additionally, there are numerous misleading references and unsubstantiated claims throughout the manuscript. As an example of misleading reference, &quot;the human MT ... a key region in the multiple representations of sensory flows (including optic, tactile, and auditory flows) (Bedny et al., 2010; Ricciardi et al., 2007); this ideally suits it to be a new MD core.&quot; The two references in this sentence are claims about plasticity in the congenitally blind with sensory deprivation from birth, which is not really relevant to the proposal that hMT+ is a new MD core in healthy volunteers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have carefully read the corresponding references and considered the corresponding theories and agree with these comments. Due to our results only delving into “the GABA-ergic inhibition in human MT predicts visuo-spatial intelligence mediated by reverberation with frontal cortex”, it is not yet sufficient to prove that hMT+ is the core node of the MD system, we will adjust the explanatory logic of the article, that is, emphasizing the de redundancy of hMT+in visual-spatial intelligence and the improvement of information processing efficiency, while weakening the significance of hMT+ in MD systems. In addition, regarding the potential central role of hMT+ in the MD system, we agree with your view that research on hMT+ as a multisensory integration hub mainly focuses on developmental processes. Meanwhile, in adults, the MST region of hMT+ is considered a multisensory integration area for visual and vestibular inputs, which potentially supports the role of hMT+ in multitasking multisensory systems (Gu et al., J. Neurosci, 26(1), 73–85, 2006; Fetsch et al., Nat. Neurosci, 15, 146–154, 2012.). Further research could explore how other intelligence sub-ability such as working memory and language comprehension are facilitated by hMT+'s features.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another example of unsubstantiated claim: the rationale for selecting V1 as the control region is based on the assertion that &quot;it mediates the 2D rather than 3D visual domain (Born &amp; Bradley, 2005)&quot;. That's not the point made in the Born &amp; Bradley (2005) paper on MT. It's crucial to note that V1 is where the initial binocular convergence occurs in cortex, i.e., inputs from both the right and left eyes to generate a perception of depth.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We acknowledge the inappropriate citation of &quot;Born &amp; Bradley, 2005,&quot; which focuses solely on the structure and function of the visual area MT. However, we believe that choosing hMT+ as the domain for 3D visual analysis and V1 as the control region is justified. Cumming and DeAngelis (Annu Rev Neurosci, 24:203–238.2001) state that binocular disparity provides the visual system with information about the three-dimensional layout of the environment, and the link between perception and neuronal activity is stronger in the extrastriate cortex (especially MT) than in the primary visual cortex. This supports our choice and emphasizes the relevance of hMT+ in our study. We have revised our reference in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Results &amp; Discussion</p>
<p>(1) The missing correlation between SI and BDT is crucial to the rest of the analysis. The authors should discuss whether they replicated the pattern of results from Melnick et al. (2013) despite using only one WAIS subtest.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank for the reviewer’s suggestion. We have placed it in the main text (Figure 3e).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) ROIs: can the authors clarify if the results are based on bilateral MT+/V1 or just those in the left hemisphere? Can the authors plot the MRS scan area in V1? I would be surprised if it's precise to V1 and doesn't spread to V2/3 (which is fine to report as early visual cortex).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank for the reviewer’s suggestion. We have drawn the V1 ROI MRS scanning area (Figure supplement 1). Using the template, we checked the coverage of V1, V2, and V3. Although the MRS overlap regions extend to V2 (3%) and V3 (32%), the major coverage of the MRS scanning area is in V1, with 65% overlap across subjects.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Did the authors examine V1 FC with either the frontal regions and/or whole brain, as a control analysis? If not, can the author justify why V1 serves as the control region only in the MRS but not in FC (Figure 4) or the mediation analysis (Figure 5)? That seems a little odd given that control analyses are needed to establish the specificity of the claim to MT+</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank for the reviewer’s suggestion. We have done the V1 FC-behavior connection as control analysis (Figure supplement 7). Only positive correlations in the frontal area were detected, suggesting that in the 3D visuo-spatial intelligence task, V1 plays a role in feedforward information processing. However, hMT+, which showed specific negative correlations in the frontal, is involved in the inhibition mechanism. These results further emphasize the de-redundancy function of hMT+ in 3D visuo-spatial intelligence.</p>
<p>Regarding the mediation analysis, since GABA/Glu concentration in V1 has no correlation with BDT score, it is not sufficient to apply mediation analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It is not clear how to interpret the similarity or difference between panels a and b in Figure 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have further interpreted the difference between a and b in the revised version. Panels a represents BDT score correlated hMT+-region FC, which is obviously involved in frontal cortex. While panels b represents SI correlated hMT+-region FC, which shows relatively less regions. The overlap region is what we are interested in and explain how local inhibitory mechanisms works in the 3D visuo-spatial intelligence. In addition, we have revised Figure 4 and point out the overlap region.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) SI is not relevant to the authors‘ priori hypothesis, but is included in several mediation analyses. Can the authors do model comparisons between the ones in Figure 5c, d, and Figure S6? In other words, is SI necessary in the mediation model? There seem discrepancies between the necessity of SI in Figures 5c/S6 vs. Figure 5d.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. The relationship between the Suppression Index (SI) and our a priori hypotheses is elaborated in the response to reviewer 3, section (1). SI plays a crucial role in explicating how local inhibitory mechanisms, on the psychological level, function within the context of the 3D visuo-spatial task. Additionally, Figure 5c illustrates the interaction between the frontal cortex and hMT+, showing how the effects from the frontal cortex (BA46) on the Block Design Task are fully mediated by SI. This further underscores the significance of SI in our model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The sudden appearance of &quot;efficient information&quot; in Figure 6, referring to the neural efficiency hypothesis, raises concerns. Efficient visual information processing occurs throughout the visual cortex, starting from V1. Thus, it appears somewhat selective to apply the neural efficiency hypothesis to MT+ in this context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. There is no doubt that V1 involved in efficient visual information processing. However, in our result, the V1 GABA has no significant correlation between BDT score, suggesting that the V1 efficient processing might not sufficiently account for the individual differences in 3D visuo-spatial intelligence. Additionally, we will clarify our use of the neural efficiency hypothesis by incorporating it into the introduction of our paper to better frame our argument.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2.1)  How was the sample size determined? Is it sufficient??</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you to the reviewer for pointing this out. We use G*power to determine our sample size. In the study by Melnick (2013), they reported a medium effect between SI and Perception Reasoning sub-ability (r=0.47). Here we use this r value as the correlation coefficient (ρ H1), setting the power at the commonly used threshold of 0.8 and the alpha error probability at 0.05. The required sample size is calculated to be 26. This ensures that our study has adequate power to yield valid statistical results. Furthermore, compared to earlier within-subject studies like Schallmo et al.'s 2018 research, which used 22 subjects to examine GABA levels in MT+ and the early visual cortex (EVC), our study includes an enough dataset.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2.2)  In Schallmo elife 2018, there was no correlation between GABA concentration and SI. How can we justify the different results different here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you to the reviewer for pointing this out. There are several differences between the two studies, ours and theirs:</p>
<p>a. While the earlier study by Schallmo et al. (2018) employed 3T MRS, we utilize 7T MRS, enhancing our ability to detect and measure GABA with greater accuracy.</p>
<p>b. Schallmo elife 2018 choose to use the bilateral hMT+ as the MRS measurement region while we use the left hMT+. The reason why we focus on left hMT+ are described in review 1. (6). Briefly, use of left MT/V5 as a target was motivated by studies demonstrating that left MT/V5 TMS is more effective at causing perceptual effects (Tadin et al., 2011).</p>
<p>c. The resolution of MRS sequence in Schallmo elife 2018 is 3 cm isotropic voxel, while we apply 2 cm isotropic voxel. This helps us more precisely locate hMT+ and exclude more white matter signal.</p>

<p>Thank you to the reviewer for pointing this out. These correlations represent the relationship between behavior task (SI/BDT) and resting-state functional connectivity.

In addition, left hMT+’s surround suppression is involved in several hMT+ - frontal connectivity. Furthermore, the overlapping regions between two tasks indicate a shared underlying mechanism.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Figure 1 is a schematic and workflow chart, so labels for x- and y-axes are not needed. I believe this confusion might pertain to Figure 3. In Figures 3a and 3b, the MRS spectrum does not have a standard y-axis unit as it varies based on the individual physical conditions of the scanner; it is widely accepted that no y-axis unit is used. While the x-axis unit is ppm, which indicate the chemical shift of different metabolites. In Figure 3c, the BDT represents IQ scores, which do not have a standard unit.

<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. However, each correlation figure in the supplementary figures has its own specific topic and conclusion. The correlation figures in Supplementary Figure 1 indicate that GABA in V1 does not show any correlation with BDT and SI, illustrating that inhibition in V1 is unrelated to both 3D visuo-spatial intelligence and motion suppression processing. The correlations in Supplementary Figure 2 indicate that the excitation mechanism, represented by Glutamate concentration, does not contribute to 3D visuo-spatial intelligence in either hMT+ or V1. Supplementary Figure 3 validates our MRS measurements. Supplementary Figure 4 addresses potential concerns regarding the impact of outliers on correlation significance. Even after excluding two “outliers” from Figures 3d and 3e, the correlation results remain stable.</p>
