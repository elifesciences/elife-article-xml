<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Movement flexibility and automaticity are necessary to successfully navigate different environments. When encountering difficult terrains such as a muddy trail, we can change how we step almost immediately so that we can continue walking. This flexibility comes at a cost since we initially must pay deliberate attention to how we are moving. Gradually, after a few minutes on the trail, stepping becomes automatic so that we do not need to think about our movements. Canonical theory indicates that different adaptive motor learning mechanisms confer these essential properties to movement: explicit control confers rapid flexibility, while forward model recalibration confers automaticity. Here we uncover a distinct mechanism of treadmill walking adaptation – an automatic stimulus-response mapping – that confers both properties to movement. The mechanism is flexible as it learns stepping patterns that can be rapidly changed to suit a range of treadmill configurations. It is also automatic as it can operate without deliberate control or explicit awareness by the participants. Our findings reveal a tandem architecture of forward model recalibration and automatic stimulus-response mapping mechanisms for walking, reconciling different findings of motor adaptation and perceptual realignment.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>This version of the manuscript has been revised to enhance the rigor and completeness of our analyses, incorporating additional modeling, statistical evaluations, and theoretical contextualization. Key updates include:
Expanded Computational Modeling:
a. We tested additional computational models that describe motor adaptation and perceptual realignment as related processes, specifically the Proprioceptive Realignment Model (PReMo) and the Perceptual Error Adaptation Model (PEA).
b. We developed a new model, Perceptuomotor Recalibration + Mapping (PM-ReMap), which integrates Bayesian integration and sensory realignment with flexible mapping mechanisms, providing a more comprehensive explanation of motor adaptation.
Refined Conceptual Framework and Theoretical Discussion:
a. We contextualized our findings within existing motor learning frameworks, particularly aligning our proposed mechanisms with the three-stage model of motor learning from Tsay et al. (2024) (reasoning, refinement, and retrieval).
b. We strengthened our argument that walking adaptation operates independently of explicit strategies by evaluating reportability and intentionality criteria outlined in Tsay et al. (2024).
c. We used Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo's framework to clarify how stimulus-response mapping operates relative to a recalibrated equilibrium, providing further insight into the sharp transition observed in the Ramp Down task.
d. We justified our ramp-down design based on prior research, explaining how it balances measurement resolution, duration, and washout minimization. We also discussed evidence suggesting that alternative ramp-down rates likely yield consistent findings.
Additional Data Analyses:
a. We analyzed movement variability during learning, confirming that it aligns with predictions from our proposed mechanisms (e.g., stimulus-response mapping is initially erratic and stabilizes over time).
b. We evaluated motor output and perceptual realignment changes across washout conditions in our control experiments, further supporting the role of stimulus-response mapping in the observed sharp transition during the Ramp Down.
c. We conducted a silhouette analysis, providing strong statistical evidence for the presence of distinct subgroups/clusters in Experiment 2.
Manuscript Organization and Readability Improvements:
a. We reorganized the manuscript, moving most of the supplementary material into the main text, and integrating additional methods into the Results section for improved readability.
b. We reformulated key equations to align with standard motor learning models.
c. We refined figure organization, updated axis labels for clarity, and added bar graphs visualizing BIC comparisons.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Flexibility and automaticity are essential features of human movement, so much so that we rarely think about the details of how we move. While walking, we do not think about the bend of the ankle or how quickly to swing the leg forward to step. Yet, we easily adjust walking to accommodate many situations – a muddy trail, a grassy slope, or a snowy path. These abilities are often taken for granted until something goes awry – a sprained ankle quickly brings the details of movement execution to awareness, and deliberate control is often used to avoid pain or further injury. It is only then that we truly appreciate how much the sensorimotor system is doing without our conscious awareness.</p>
<p>We currently do not understand how different motor learning mechanisms confer both flexibility and automaticity to human movement. One well-studied process of motor learning is sensorimotor adaptation, which occurs in response to errors between the expected and actual sensory consequences of our movements. Accordingly, this motor learning mechanism helps adjust motor commands to correct for perturbations to our movements caused by altered environmental demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bastian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Huberdeau et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Adaptation is traditionally thought to rely on the cerebellum-dependent recalibration of a forward model that associates motor commands with expected sensory consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ito, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">Wolpert et al., 2001</xref>). For example, to walk on an icy sidewalk, we may need to recalibrate our prediction of how firmly our feet will grip the ground. The process of forward model recalibration is automatic and implicit, as it has been shown to operate without intention or awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Huberdeau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Tsay et al., 2024</xref>). However, forward model recalibration does not confer rapid flexibility because it cannot make immediate changes in movement – it can only adjust movement gradually trial-by-trial or step-by-step, a process that can take several minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bastian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Huberdeau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Tsay et al., 2024</xref>). The newly acquired sensorimotor recalibration must be unlearned over time to restore a normal movement when the environment returns to its original state after adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bastian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Martin et al., 1996a</xref>). For this reason, forward model recalibration leads to lasting movement errors (called “aftereffects”).</p>
<p>Sensorimotor adaptation can rely on more than forward model recalibration. We know that adaptation of goal-directed reaching movements can involve rapid flexible learning mechanisms sometimes called “stimulus-response mapping mechanisms”. Different types of stimulus-response mapping mechanisms have been characterized in previous studies: First, explicit strategies – where people deliberately change where they are aiming to reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>). Second, memory-based caching – where people learn motor responses in association with the respective environmental sensory stimuli, and cache them in memory for future retrieval (like a lookup-table) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Huberdeau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">McDougle and Taylor, 2019</xref>). Third, structural learning – where people learn general relationships between environmental sensory stimuli and motor responses and use them to produce novel responses (like when we learn to map the movement of a computer mouse to that of the cursor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Braun et al., 2009</xref>). Stimulus-response mapping mechanisms differ from forward model recalibration in that they confer rapid flexibility – novel responses can be promptly abandoned or changed for different environmental stimuli – and therefore do not lead to aftereffects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Huberdeau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Tsay et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>It is unclear if stimulus-response mapping mechanisms are involved in adapting movement types that are continuous like walking versus discrete movements like reaching. The goal of this study was to understand whether walking adaptation involves any stimulus-response mapping mechanism and, if so, how it operates and how it can be dissected from forward model recalibration. We focused on adaptation of walking movements on a split-belt treadmill: it is well established that when people walk with one foot faster than the other, they adapt the timing and location of their step to restore symmetry (Box 1).</p>
<p>In Experiment 1A we tested the presence of stimulus-response mapping during gait adaptation by evaluating whether people develop the ability to modify their walking pattern immediately for different split-belt magnitudes. Preliminary evidence suggests that people may be able to switch between at least two different walking patterns more rapidly than we would expect from forward model recalibration alone (Box 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>). Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that walking adaptation involves stimulus-response mapping in addition to forward model recalibration.</p>
<p>As our findings corroborated this hypothesis, in Experiment 1B we aimed to develop a measure to dissect individual contributions of the two mechanisms to adaptation. We based this on the well-known phenomenon of “perceptual realignment”, where perception of the belt speed difference diminishes over time during adaptation (Box 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Jensen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies show that perceptual realignment is only partial – the belt speeds feel similar but not completely equal at the end of adaptation, despite complete motor adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>). Studies also suggest that perceptual realignment may stem from forward model recalibration processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">‘t Hart and Henriques, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Izawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Rossi et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Synofzik et al., 2008</xref>). Based on these studies, we hypothesized that the extent of perceptual realignment corresponds to the contribution of forward model recalibration to motor adaptation, with the remainder attributed to stimulus-response mapping.</p>
<p>Finally, in Experiment 2 we began to explore characteristics of stimulus-response mapping. We asked whether the stimulus-response mapping mechanism is automatic, or instead under deliberate or explicit control. Stimulus-response mapping mechanisms for reaching require explicit control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Huberdeau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Tsay et al., 2024</xref>), but explicit control is poorly suited for automatic, continuous movements like walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Clark, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Paul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">Uiga et al., 2020</xref>), and can even lead to falls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">Wong et al., 2008</xref>). Unlike reaching, adaptation of walking is unaffected by explicit goals or instructions given to the participants on where to aim their feet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, we hypothesized that participants would not be able to describe how they changed walking, in contrast to what has been previously reported in reaching. We also asked if participants could use the mapping mechanism to produce novel motor outputs akin to what has been interpreted as structural learning in reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Braun et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Motor paradigm and hypotheses</title>
<p>We asked whether walking adaptation involves both forward model recalibration and stimulus-response mapping mechanisms learned in tandem (“recalibration + mapping hypothesis”). We contrasted this with the alternative hypothesis that walking adaptation may involve only forward model recalibration mechanisms (“recalibration only hypothesis”).</p>
<p>To test this, we devised the “Ramp Down” paradigm depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. After adaptation, we gradually decreased the speed of the right belt every 3 strides (see Methods). This enabled us to obtain reliable measurements of aftereffects across 21 predetermined speed configurations, spanning from the full split-belt perturbation to tied-belts.</p>

<caption><title>Experiment 1, Hypotheses and Predictions.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Conceptual schematic of our paradigm with the Ramp Down task: after adaptation, the right belt speed is gradually ramped down to match the left. <bold>(B-C)</bold> Predictions for the Ramp Down motor measures made by two competing hypotheses. <bold>(B) Recalibration only:</bold> recalibration can only change movement gradually. The Δ motor output (dotted blue line) changes slowly and does not track the rapidly decreasing perturbation (dashed red line), so that step length asymmetry aftereffects emerge immediately (solid purple line, magnitude is positive). <bold>(C) Recalibration + mapping:</bold> mapping can change movement immediately. In the first part of the task (highlighted in green), the mapping contribution to Δ motor output (dark blue shade) is scaled down immediately as the perturbation decreases. Hence, the Δ motor output (dotted blue line) changes rapidly and tracks the perturbation (dashed red line), so that there are no step length asymmetry aftereffects (solid purple line, magnitude is ~zero). In the second part of the task, the mapping contribution to Δ motor output is zero, and the recalibration contribution to Δ motor output (light blue shade) does not change significantly. Hence, the Δ motor output (dotted blue line) does not track the perturbation (red dashed line), and step length asymmetry aftereffects emerge (solid purple line, magnitude is positive). <bold>Right column inset:</bold> conceptual explanation of how both hypotheses may account for the speed match results from Leech at al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>). In the first post-adaptation speed match task, participants increase the speed of the right belt from zero to a value that is smaller than adaptation but larger than the left belt (top panel). The perturbation increases until a value that is positive but smaller than adaptation (dashed red line, middle and bottom panels). Leech et al. observed symmetric step lengths at the end of the task, indicating that the Δ motor output (dotted blue line) is smaller than it was in adaptation and matches the perturbation. The decrease in Δ motor output can be explained by the recalibration only hypothesis as forgetting/unlearning (middle panel), or by the recalibration + mapping hypothesis as flexible scaling of the mapping contribution (bottom panel).</p></caption>

<p>We specifically measured aftereffects in step length asymmetry, the movement error that arises when the compensatory adjustments to step timing and position developed in adaptation (Δ motor output) fail to match the current treadmill speed difference (perturbation):

</disp-formula>
where “Δ” represents differences between right and left steps and “mean” represents their average (see Methods and Box 1).</p>
<p>As depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, the recalibration only hypothesis predicts that aftereffects will be present for all speed configurations in the Ramp Down. This is because the Δ motor output (blue) can only change gradually, through unlearning or forgetting of the forward model recalibration (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). This change is too slow to track the perturbation (red), which is ramped down to zero rapidly over ~80 seconds. Therefore, step length asymmetry (purple) becomes positive immediately in the Ramp Down.</p>
<p>In contrast, as depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, the recalibration + mapping hypothesis predicts that aftereffects will be present for some, but not all speed configurations in the Ramp Down. Specifically, there would be no aftereffects (~zero step length asymmetry) in the first portion of the Ramp Down, because the Δ motor output (blue) changes rapidly and matches the perturbation (red). This reflects the flexibility of the stimulus-response mapping (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Aftereffects would emerge in the second portion of the task (positive step length asymmetry), reflecting forward model recalibration.</p>
<p>We include forgetting effects for the recalibration only hypothesis to account for previous findings from Leech et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>) (Box 2). The inset of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> (right column) illustrates how both hypotheses may account for near-zero step length asymmetry at the end of the speed match task. The Δ motor output decreases to match the perturbation either because the mapping mechanism flexibly scales down (recalibration + mapping hypothesis) or, alternatively, because of forgetting/unlearning (recalibration only hypothesis).</p>

<title>Motor results – step length asymmetry</title>
<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> shows the paradigm used for Experiment 1, and the time course of step length asymmetry (group mean ± SE). The Ramp Down task corresponds to the manipulation illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and is the focus of our analysis for Experiment 1. A similar ramp task was performed prior to adaptation as a control to see how participants responded to a gradually ramped perturbation at baseline (see Methods, “Ramp tasks”). Participants performed perceptual tests during the ramp tasks, which will be discussed in a later section (see “Perceptual results). Patterns of step length asymmetry during other portions of the paradigm were consistent with a large body of previous work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Reisman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>) and will not be discussed further.</p>

<p>Step length asymmetry during the baseline ramp and post-adaptation Ramp Down tasks are displayed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. For each speed configuration in the Ramp Down task, we statistically compared step length asymmetry to zero. We evaluated the emergence of aftereffects by examining when step length asymmetry became significantly positive. We found that step length asymmetry was <italic>not</italic> statistically different from zero during the first half of the Ramp Down task, for right belt speeds ranging from 1m/s to 0.5m/s faster than the left speed (these speed configurations are highlighted in green in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> right; all CI<sub>LB</sub> [confidence intervals lower bounds] ≤ −0.001 and CI<sub>UB</sub> [upper bounds] ≥ 0.009, SI Appendix, Fig. S2 and Table S1). This result indicates that aftereffects do not emerge immediately in the Ramp Down task, a finding at odds with the recalibration only prediction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> ‘predictions’ inset, top). Step length asymmetry was instead significantly positive for the second half of the task, for right belt speeds ranging from 0.45m/s to 0m/s faster than the left speed (all CI<sub>LB</sub> &gt; 0.01). These results indicate that aftereffects emerge at a mid-point during the Ramp Down task and align with behavioral predictions from the recalibration + mapping hypothesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> ‘predictions’ inset, bottom).</p>
<p>As a control, we repeated the same analysis for the baseline ramp task (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, left). We found that there was only one speed configuration for which step length asymmetry was not statistically different from zero (right speed 0.05m/s slower than left; SL asym. = 0.006 [−0.017, 0.028], mean [CI]). For all other configurations, step length asymmetry was significantly positive (CI<sub>LB</sub> ≥ 0.048 for right speed 0.1 to 0.35m/s slower than left) or negative (CI<sub>UB</sub> ≤ −0.019 for right speed 0 to 0.35m/s faster than left). This is in stark contrast to the wide range of speed configurations with near-zero step length asymmetry observed in the Ramp Down period. Hence, the ability to walk symmetrically at different speed configurations is not innate but dependent on the adaptation process. We finally tested whether the pattern of motor variability during adaptation aligns with predictions for learning new stimulus-response maps. In contrast to recalibration, mapping mechanisms are predicted to be highly variable and erratic during early learning, and stabilize as learning progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Tsay et al., 2024</xref>). Consistent with these predictions, the step length asymmetry residual variance (around a double exponential fit) decreased significantly between the start and end of adaptation (residual variance at start minus end of adaptation = 0.005 [0.004, 0.007], mean [CI]; SI Appendix, Fig. S3). These control analyses corroborate the hypothesis that the “no aftereffects” region of the Ramp Down reflects the operation of a mapping mechanism.</p>

<title>Motor results – perturbation and Δ motor output</title>
<p>To further test the competing hypotheses, we examined the perturbation and Δ motor output during the Ramp Down (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). As the belt speed difference decreased, so did the perturbation component (red). In the first half of the task, the Δ motor output (blue) appeared to match the perturbation – consistent with the lack of step length asymmetry aftereffects (green shaded portion, matching <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Additionally, in the second half of the task, the Δ motor output appeared larger than the perturbation – consistent with the positive step length asymmetry aftereffects observed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>We formally contrasted predictions made by the competing hypotheses by developing mathematical models of the Δ motor output as a function of perturbation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). In the simplest framework, the Δ motor output behavior for the recalibration and mapping mechanisms can be formalized as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v3_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn5">

</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v3_eqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Where <italic>u</italic> is the modelled Δ motor output, <italic>k</italic> is the stride number, <italic>p</italic> is the perturbation, and <italic>r</italic> is a free parameter representing the portion of the Δ motor output related to recalibration. We used Equation (6) as our model for the recalibration + mapping hypothesis. This describes the scenario where participants modulate the Δ motor output to match the perturbation (<italic>u</italic>(<italic>k</italic>)=<italic>p</italic>(<italic>k</italic>))for the first portion of the Ramp Down task. The Δ motor output remains constant during the second portion of the task (<italic>u</italic>(<italic>k</italic>) = <italic>r</italic>)because participants are unable to reduce the Δ motor output to values smaller than “<italic>r</italic>” (the amount achieved by recalibration). Parameters were estimated by fitting the model to individual participants’ Δ motor output data from the Ramp Down (see Methods).</p>
<p>The fitted Δ motor output is displayed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> (mean ± SE of fits across participants; individual fits are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S4). As expected, the recalibration + mapping fit captured the matching-then-divergent behavior of Δ motor output in response to the changing perturbation.</p>
<p>We used the dual state model of motor adaptation from Smith et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Smith et al., 2006</xref>) as our model for the recalibration only hypothesis (see Methods). The model has four parameters and can account for potential forgetting or unlearning of the Δ motor output that may occur during the Ramp Down. It can also account for the possibility that adaptation involves two recalibration mechanisms – i.e., two distinct ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ mechanisms that both learn via a process of forward model recalibration, and both contribute to aftereffects, but that learn and forget at different rates. We chose this model because it is a well-established model that is widely used to capture the Δ motor output time-course for traditional motor adaptation paradigms (i.e., those consisting of adaptation and post-adaptation phases). Yet, performance of this model for a manipulation like the Ramp Down task performed here has not yet been tested. As such, if the recalibration + mapping model fit the Ramp Down data better than the dual state model, this would provide robust evidence for the presence of a stimulus-response mapping mechanism.</p>
<p>We show the Δ motor output fit by the recalibration only (dual state) model in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> (left panel, group mean ± SE; individual fits are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S5). In contrast to the recalibration + mapping model, the dual state model was not able to capture the matching-then-divergent behavior of Δ motor output. The BIC statistic confirmed that the recalibration + mapping model fitted the data significantly better than the dual state (BIC difference = 8.422 [3.386, 13.778], mean [CI]).</p>
<p>We considered two additional prominent models for motor adaptation: optimal feedback control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Izawa and Shadmehr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Todorov, 2004</xref>) and memory of errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Herzfeld et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to the dual state, these models could not capture the matching-then-divergent behavior of Δ motor output and fitted the Ramp Down data significantly worse than the recalibration + mapping (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>; memory of errors minus recalibration+mapping BIC difference = 11.610 [6.068, 17.749], optimal feedback control minus recalibration+mapping BIC difference = 19.272 [14.216, 24.563], mean [CI]). In sum, the modeling analysis of the Δ motor output further supports the recalibration + mapping hypothesis.</p>

<title>Perceptual test and results</title>
<p>The second goal of Experiment 1 was to evaluate the hypothesis that “perceptual realignment” (a phenomenon leading to altered perception following adaptation) results from the operation of the same forward model recalibration mechanism involved in adaptation of the Δ motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Rossi et al., 2021a</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous work shows that perception realigns following gait adaptation: after adapting to a perturbation where the right treadmill belt is faster than the left, return to tied belts results in perception of the opposite asymmetry (i.e., right speed feels slower than left) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Jensen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore expected that people would perceive the belt speeds as equal at some point in the Ramp Down and eventually perceive the opposite asymmetry on tied belts. We measured this by asking participants to press a keyboard button at two separate occasions during the Ramp Down task: (1) when the belts first felt equal, and (2) when they no longer felt equal (see Methods).</p>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> depicts the button presses for the Ramp Down perceptual test (top panel, group mean) overlayed onto the Ramp Down motor data (recalibration + mapping fit). Note that the task captures a <italic>range</italic> of belt speed configurations that participants perceive as “equal speeds”, with button presses (1) and (2) corresponding to the upper and lower bounds of this range. This is expected because perception is known to be noisy and may not be sensitive enough to discriminate between belt speed configurations that are too similar.</p>

<p>We quantified perceptual realignment using the established measure of <italic>point of subjective equality</italic> (PSE), defined as the belt speed difference perceived as “equal speeds”. A PSE of zero would indicate no perceptual realignment (accurate perception) and a PSE of 1m/s (i.e., a magnitude equivalent to the difference between the belt speeds during adaptation) would indicate complete perceptual realignment such that the belt speeds feel equal during the adaptation phase.</p>
<p>We measured belt speed difference at the time of each button press. We computed PSE as the range of belt speed difference values between these two measurements:

</p>
<p>We found that <italic>PSE</italic><sub>upper bound</sub> was 0.64±0.03m/s and <italic>PSE</italic><sub>lower bound</sub> was 0.39±0.05m/s (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom panel, group mean ± SE). This was consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>).This perceptual realignment was not present during baseline testing, as illustrated in SI Appendix, Fig. S6.</p>
<p>We aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that perceptual realignment arises from the forward model mechanism of motor adaptation and is unaffected by the stimulus-response mapping mechanism. This hypothesis predicts that the extent of perceptual realignment should be: 1) approximately equal to the extent of motor adaptation achieved by recalibration, and 2) less than the total extent of motor adaptation (which also includes mapping). We quantified 1) motor adaptation by recalibration as the fitted parameter “<italic>r</italic>” from the recalibration + mapping model, and 2) total motor adaptation as the Δ motor output at adaptation plateau (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, right panel, see previous section “<italic>Motor results – perturbation and Δ motor output</italic>). We expressed these motor measures and perceptual realignment as “percent compensation for the perturbation” (i.e., normalized to the perturbation magnitude in the respective units) so that they could be compared:

</p>
<p>Where <italic>r</italic> is the fitted parameter from the recalibration + mapping model, <italic>p</italic><sub>plateau</sub> is the mean perturbation over the last 30 strides of adaptation, and <italic>u</italic><sub>plateau</sub> is the mean Δ motor output over the last 30 strides of adaptation (for Equation (9), note that 1m/s is the belt speed difference in adaptation).</p>
<p>We show group level compensation measures in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>. We found that <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor recalibration</sub> (56±4%, group mean ± SE) fell within the <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> range (39±5% to 64±3%): it was significantly smaller than the upper bound (difference = −8 [−14, −2]%) and significantly larger than the lower bound (difference = 18 [8, 28]%, mean [CI]). This supports our first prediction that perceptual realignment is comparable to the extent of motor adaptation achieved by recalibration. Furthermore, <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> was significantly smaller than <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor total</sub> (95±2%, mean ± SE; difference = 31 [25, 38]% or 57 [48, 66]%, upper or lower perceptual bounds, mean [CI]). This supports our second prediction that perceptual realignment is less than the total extent of motor adaptation.</p>
<p>We show individual <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor recalibration</sub> and <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> measures for each participant in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>. We evaluated Pearson’s correlation coefficients between these measures to test whether there is a direct relationship between perceptual realignment and the motor adaptation achieved by recalibration. We found that <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor recalibration</sub> was significantly correlated with the upper bound of <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> – the value computed using the “speeds feel equal” button press (r=0.64, p=0.002). This supports the hypothesized relationship between motor recalibration and changes to leg speed perception. Instead, <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor recalibration</sub> was not correlated with the lower bound of <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> (r=0.30, p=0.195) – this value is computed using the “right feels slower than left” button press, suggesting the true PSE may lay closer to the first button press. Together, our results support the hypothesis that perceptual realignment can be used as a proxy measure for the extent of motor adaptation achieved by forward model recalibration.</p>

<title>Modelling analysis for perceptual realignment</title>
<p>We asked whether the Ramp Down results could be explained by two recently developed frameworks designed to capture the relationship between perceptual and motor changes with reaching adaptation: the proprioceptive re-alignment model (PReMo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Tsay et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">2021</xref>) and the Perceptual Error Adaptation model (PEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). To apply these models to walking adaptation, we translated reaching to walking adaptation variables using the conceptual equivalence outlined by Tsay et al., which extends the model to different perturbation types in reaching adaptation (from visual-proprioceptive to force-field perturbations – which are mechanical like split-belt; SI Appendix, “Evaluation and development of perceptual models”). <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref> shows the fitted Δ motor output and predicted perception of speed difference for PReMo and PEA. The models could not capture the matching-then-divergent behavior of Δ motor output, performing significantly worse than the recalibration + mapping model (PReMo minus recalibration+mapping BIC difference = 24.591 [16.483, 32.037], PEA minus recalibration+mapping BIC difference = 6.834 [1.779, 12.130], mean [CI]). Furthermore, they could not capture the perceptual realignment and instead predicted that the right leg would feel faster than the left throughout the entire Ramp Down.</p>

</fig>
<p>While the mathematical formulations of the models failed to account for the observed patterns of motor recalibration and perceptual realignment, we suspected that their underlying principles remain valid for walking adaptation. We therefore developed a new model – the perceptuomotor recalibration + mapping model (PM-ReMap) – that preserved the main structure of PReMo while addressing its limitations, as identified through iterative simulations (SI Appendix, Fig. S7-8 and “Evaluation and development of perceptual models”). The final model retains PReMo’s core principle that both motor adaptation and perceptual realignment are driven by the altered perception of the Δ motor output, reflecting the Bayesian integration of predicted and actual Δ motor output further shifted by recalibration (see Methods). The PM-ReMap model also maintains the key operational properties of the mechanisms described by the recalibration + mapping model, but includes additional variables for forgetting or unlearning of recalibration during the Ramp Down.</p>
<p>As shown <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, the PM-ReMap model captured the Δ motor output in the Ramp Down with performance comparable to that of the recalibration + mapping model (BIC difference = 2.381 [−0.739, 5.147], mean [CI]). It also captured perceptual realignment, predicting that some intermediate belt speed difference in the Ramp Down is perceived as “equal speeds” (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). We compared this <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>estimate to the actual PSE measured by the perceptual task, expressed as <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> in normalized units as before. At group level, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> was comparable to the upper bound of <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> (difference = −7 [−15, 1]%, mean [CI]), but significantly larger than the lower bound (difference = 19 [8, 31]%, mean [CI]). Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between individual participants’ <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and their upper bound of <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> (r=0.63, p=0.003), but not their lower bound (r=0.30, p=0.203). Both sets of results are consistent with those observed for the recalibration + mapping model. We also confirmed that the significant correlation was driven by the model parameter <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, which captures the extent of perceptual realignment at adaptation plateau (correlation of <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> with <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> upper bound: r=0.57, p=0.009, lower bound: r=0.37, p=0.110). In sum, the PM-ReMap model accurately captures the observed patterns of motor recalibration and perceptual realignment, predicting that both reflect the same proportion of the perturbation size. As such, it extends the recalibration + mapping model by incorporating the ability to account for forgetting – typical of state space models – while still effectively capturing both recalibration and mapping mechanisms. However, performance of the PM-ReMap model does not exceed that of the simpler recalibration + mapping model, suggesting that forgetting and unlearning do not have a substantial impact on the Ramp Down.</p>

<p>First, we checked that the motor and perceptual behaviors observed in the Ramp Down could be replicated using a different method of assessment. A “speed match” task was given where participants use a joystick to increase the speed of the right belt (initially stationary) until they feel it matches the left belt (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, “Ascend”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Statton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>).

<p>Second, we replicated these findings in additional speed match experiments that varied in adaptation duration (3, 15, or 30 minutes), perturbation magnitude (1m/s or 0.4m/s speed difference) and schedule (abrupt or gradual). Across all conditions, <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> was significantly smaller than <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor total</sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>; statistical results in SI Appendix, Table S2-3). Moreover, all conditions exhibited the expected pattern of step length asymmetry in the first post-adaptation speed match task (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Specifically, step length asymmetry was: 1) ~0 at the end of the task (when belt speeds felt equal) for all conditions, 2) significantly positive at the start of the task for Ascend conditions (Short, Medium, and Long Ascend), and 3) ~0 at the start of task for Medium Descend and Small Abrupt Descend conditions. While step length asymmetry was initially negative for Short Descend and Small Gradual Descend conditions, this direction aligns with that expected from incomplete adaptation rather than aftereffects, thus supporting the recalibration + mapping hypothesis.</p>
<p>In sum, these control experiments corroborate the recalibration + mapping hypothesis by confirming that, across various conditions of perturbation duration, magnitude, and schedule, the step length asymmetry and PSE patterns are consistent with the presence of both mechanisms.</p>

<title>Relative effect of time, perturbation magnitude and schedule, and task repetition</title>
<p>We examined how the relative contributions of recalibration and mapping evolve over time and are influenced by perturbation magnitude and schedule (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). We compared Short, Medium, and Long Ascend (adapting for 3, 15, or 30 minutes), and observed progression from incomplete to complete adaptation: <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor total</sub> significantly increased with each successive duration, reaching full adaptation only in Long Ascend (SI Appendix, Tables S4-5). Despite this progression, the relative contributions of recalibration and mapping did not change over time (the ratio <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> / <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor total</sub> did not differ between conditions; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref> left and SI Appendix, Table S6). We next compared Medium Descend and Small Abrupt (1m/s or 0.4m/s perturbation), and found that recalibration contributed significantly more for the smaller perturbation (larger <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> / <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor total</sub> in Small Abrupt than Medium Descend, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref> middle and Table S6). Comparing Small Abrupt and Gradual (differing in adaptation schedule), recalibration appeared larger for Small Gradual, but this effect was not significant (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref> right and Table S6). Finally, we confirmed no differences between the “ascend” and “descend” speed match tasks (Table S6).</p>

<p>We finally examined how motor aftereffects and perceptual realignment changed across the six iterations of the speed match task post-adaptation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>; tasks are interleaved with varying intervals of tied-belt walking). We quantified motor aftereffects as the step length asymmetry expressed at the tied-belt configuration in each task (interpolated, see Methods), and perceptual realignment as the final speed difference, normalized to the respective adaptation perturbation like before. We focus on “Ascending” groups because no tied-belt configuration is expected in “Descending” tasks. At the end of adaptation, motor aftereffects were comparable to perceptual realignment in all groups (first task in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>; SI Appendix, Table S7). However, they decayed faster with repeated iterations of the task, becoming significantly smaller than perceptual realignment after 1 or 2 minutes (significant difference in the second task at 1 minute for Short and Long Ascend, and in the third task at 2 minutes for Medium Ascend, shaded in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>; Table S7). Motor aftereffects remained significantly smaller than perceptual realignment for the remainder of the post-adaptation phase is Medium and Long Ascend; however, the difference dissipated by 8 minutes for Short Ascend (Table S7).</p>
<p>In sum, we show that recalibration and mapping learn at similar rates during adaptation, resulting in comparable time courses, but their relative contributions are modulated by error size. Moreover, motor aftereffects and perceptual realignment decay differently with repeated post-adaptation tasks, potentially suggesting a differential effect on the mechanisms.</p>

<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>Experiment 1 demonstrated the presence of a stimulus-response mapping mechanism that can produce Δ motor outputs that match a range of perturbations <italic>smaller</italic> than the adaptation perturbation (in the Ramp Down task). In Experiment 2, we asked whether it can also produce Δ motor outputs that match perturbations <italic>larger</italic> than the adaptation perturbation.</p>
<p>This sheds light on whether the stimulus-response mapping of walking adaptation operates akin to memory-based or structure-based mechanisms observed in reaching adaptation. Failure to account for larger perturbations would suggest that it is memory-based. That is, the Δ motor outputs produced in adaptation may be cached in memory and later retrieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Huberdeau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">McDougle and Taylor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Poggio and Bizzi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">Wolpert et al., 2001</xref>). These Δ motor outputs span a range of magnitudes that are smaller than the adaptation perturbation (see Box 1), so that they could match smaller but not larger perturbations.</p>
<p>Conversely, success in accounting for larger perturbations would suggest that the stimulus-response mapping may be structure-based. That is, it may learn the general relationship between perturbation and appropriate Δ motor output in adaptation and later use it to generate Δ motor outputs anew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Braun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">McDougle and Taylor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">Wolpert et al., 2001</xref>). Hence, it would be able to generate Δ motor outputs to match either smaller or larger perturbations. Thus, we tested a “Ramp Up &amp; Down” condition where the speed of the right belt was both gradually increased and then decreased after adaptation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). The memory-based hypothesis predicts that step length asymmetry will become negative for perturbations <italic>larger</italic> than adaptation, while the structure-based hypothesis predicts it will remain close to zero (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref> inset, “predictions”). The rest of the paradigm was analogous to that of Experiment 1 except there was no perceptual assessment. <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref> shows step length asymmetry throughout the paradigm, and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref> shows a close-up of the Ramp Up &amp; Down task performance (group mean ± SE). The magenta portion of the task corresponds to the Ramp Down of Experiment 1, but the step length asymmetry differs because of the exposure to larger speed differences in the teal portion (a supplementary analysis confirmed that this is consistent with the recalibration + mapping hypothesis; see SI Appendix, “Ramp Down comparison between Experiments 1 and 2”, Fig. S9-10 and Table S8).</p>

</fig>
<p>On average, participants’ step length asymmetry patterns did not remain zero for speed differences larger than adaptation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>, teal). However, we observed that individual participants exhibited markedly different patterns of step length asymmetry during this phase (SI Appendix, Fig. S11). We quantified this observation by evaluating, for each participant, the number of strides in this phase with step length asymmetry below their own baseline CI (SI Appendix, Table S9). We used a density-based analysis to formally assess whether there were separate clusters in our data (see Methods). Indeed, the algorithm detected two separate clusters of participants: for 12 participants, between 38 to 60 strides were asymmetric (out of 60 total strides); for the other 8 participants, only 3 to 21 strides were asymmetric (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D-E</xref> insets, and SI Appendix, Fig. S12; difference in strides between subgroups = 36.083 [29.917, 42.250], mean [CI]). A silhouette analysis confirmed strong evidence for these clusters: the average silhouette score was 0.90, with 19 of 20 participants scoring above 0.7 – considered strong evidence – and one scoring between 0.5 and 0.7 – considered reasonable evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dalmaijer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Rousseeuw, 1987</xref>). As a control, we performed the same clustering analysis for Experiment 1, and did not find separate clusters for any of our measures of interest (SI Appendix, “Clustering analysis”, Fig. S12-13, and Table S10-11). This result indicates that 12 of 20 participants could not account for belt speed differences larger than that of adaptation, suggesting that they used a memory-based mapping mechanism (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). In contrast, 8 of 20 participants could account for these speeds, suggesting that they engaged a structure-based mapping mechanism (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref>).</p>
<p>We next aimed to exclude the possibility that participants in the structure-based subgroup may simply be faster at adapting to new perturbations than those in the memory-based subgroup and may be adapting to the new perturbations of the Ramp Up &amp; Down rather than generating Δ motor output using a previously learnt structure. To this end, we evaluated learning rates during adaptation. We found that participants in the two subgroups adapted at similar rates (strides to plateau difference, structure – memory: 135.875 [−53.208, 329.708], mean [CI]; SI Appendix, Fig. S14-15). Furthermore, the pattern of step length asymmetry variability was similar between the subgroups (structure – memory difference in residual variance relative to double exponential during initial adaptation = −0.0052 [−0.0161, 0.0044], adaptation plateau = −0.0007 [−0.0021, 0.0003], difference in variance decay = −0.0045 [−0.0155, 0.0052], mean [CI]; SI Appendix, Fig. S16). This confirms that the distinct performance clusters in the Ramp Up &amp; Down task are not driven by natural variations in learning ability, such as differences in learning speed or variability. Rather, these findings indicate that the subgroups employ different types of mapping mechanisms, which perform similarly during initial learning but differ fundamentally in how they encode, retrieve, and generalize relationships between perturbations and Δ motor outputs.</p>
<p>We considered that the mapping adjustments described here may or may not be <italic>deliberate</italic> (i.e., participants are trying to correct for the perturbation) or done with an <italic>explicit strategy</italic> (i.e., participants can accurately report a relevant strategy that would counter the perturbation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>). A recent framework for motor learning by Tsay et al. defines explicit strategies as motor plans that are both intentional and reportable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Tsay et al., 2024</xref>). Within this framework, Tsay et al. clarify that “intentional” means participants deliberately perform the motor plan, while “reportable” means they are able to clearly articulate it. An example of an explicit strategy in visuomotor reaching adaptation is when participants report that they aimed to offset a visual rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>); conceivable examples in split-belt treadmill adaptation may be reports of “taking steps of similar length”, “stepping further ahead with the right foot” or “standing on the left foot for longer”. We tested whether participants could explicitly report changes to the gait pattern that specifically correct for the split-belt perturbation.</p>
<p>At the end of the experiment, participants were asked to report (in writing) if/how they had changed the way they walked during adaptation (note that this was a later addition to the protocol and was only collected in 16 of the 20 participants). We assessed reports by categorizing them in three steps: 1) did the report mention <italic>any</italic> deliberate changes? 2) were the changes <italic>relevant</italic> to adaptation? (i.e., did the report mention any gait metric contributing to the overall Δ motor output or step length asymmetry adaptation in any amount?) 3) was the response <italic>accurate?</italic>, as participants often reported strategies that they did not actually execute.</p>
<p>We summarize results from the questionnaire in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> (original responses are reported in SI Appendix, Table S12). We found that, while 13 participants reported <italic>deliberate</italic> changes, only 6 people mentioned <italic>relevant</italic> aspects of the walking pattern (in particular, participants mentioned “limping” or temporal coordination). Furthermore, only one of these participants reported an <italic>accurate</italic> gait parameter (“I tried to spend as much time leaning on my left leg as possible”), while the remainder of the relevant responses were inaccurate (e.g., “matched duration of standing on each foot”) or vague (e.g., “I adjusted as if I was limping”). The aspect of gait most frequently reported across participants was stability (also reported as balance, not falling, or controlling sway). This suggests that, while participants may deliberately adjust their body to feel more stable, they do not seem to explicitly strategize how to offset the perturbation. Thus, mapping tends to adjust aspects of the walking pattern that participants are not explicitly aware of controlling, suggesting that this differs from explicit strategies often observed in reaching.</p>

</fig>
<p>In sum, in Experiment 2 we found that 1) participants are largely unable to explicitly describe adaptations to their walking pattern, and 2) some but not all participants can extrapolate their walking pattern to account for larger perturbations. This sheds light on how the stimulus-response mapping mechanism of walking adaptation may align with established mechanisms: it may differ from explicit strategies and resemble memory-based caching in some people and structural learning in others.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we showed that locomotor adaptation involves two learning mechanisms: forward model recalibration and a stimulus-response mapping mechanism. The recalibration mechanism changes movement gradually and relates to the perceptual changes observed in locomotor adaptation. The mapping mechanism is flexible and, once learned, can change movement immediately to account for a range of belt speed configurations. Our data suggest that this mapping operates independently of explicit strategies, and that it can be memory-based or structure-based.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Forward model recalibration of movement and perception</title>
<p>In line with various adaptation studies, we showed that people recalibrated their perception in a way that reduced how perturbed they felt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Haith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Harris, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Jensen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Moidell and Bedell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Sombric et al., 2019</xref>) – i.e., their perception of the leg speed difference diminishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Jensen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Statton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>). This perceptual change aligned with the motor change achieved through forward model recalibration. Specifically, we found a significant correlation between motor aftereffects and the speed difference participants perceived as equal. Motor aftereffects did not correlate with the speed difference later reported as no longer feeling equal, likely because participants are biased to delay responding until they are sufficiently confident, reflecting individual factors like perceptual noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Camacho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gescheider, 1997</xref>). Although previous research suggested that perceptual changes may be mediated by recalibration processes, the specific link to motor adaptation remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">‘t Hart and Henriques, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Izawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Sombric et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Synofzik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c141">Yavari et al., 2016</xref>; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Rossi et al., 2021a</xref>). Our findings demonstrate a direct relationship between perceptual and motor recalibrations, offering a novel approach to dissect forward model recalibration from stimulus-response mapping contributions to adaptation.</p>
<p>Based on our findings, we suggest that forward model recalibration counters the perturbation in the motor and perceptual domains simultaneously – it adapts the walking pattern while realigning perception of leg speed. In support of this idea, perceptual realignment resembles a well-studied “sensory cancellation” phenomenon – where forward model predictions are used to filter redundant sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blakemore et al., 1998</xref>). Forward model predictions may also be integrated with and sharpen proprioceptive estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bhanpuri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">Weeks et al., 2017</xref>), and may mediate a more complex integration of predicted and actual sensory signals contributing to perceptual changes. Consistent with the operation of a forward model thought to predict sensory consequences from efferent copies of motor commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Haruno et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ito, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">Wolpert et al., 2001</xref>), perceptual changes are expressed during active and not passive movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Sombric et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Stimulus-response mapping is flexible but requires learning</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that a stimulus-response mapping mechanism plays a role in walking adaptation. We isolated this mechanism by designing a novel “Ramp Down” task, in which the belt speed difference perturbation was ramped down to zero gradually but rapidly after adaptation (averaging 1 minute and 20 seconds). This approach contrasted prior work that employed either abrupt or slow (10-minute) transitions to tied belts post-adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Leech et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Reisman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Roemmich and Bastian, 2015</xref>). By implementing this rapid ramp-down, we were able to dissect the operation of a flexible mapping mechanism that complements recalibration, producing walking patterns suited to the changing treadmill configuration.</p>
<p>The mapping mechanism observed in our study aligns with the corrective responses described by Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo, which operate relative to a recalibrated “new normal” rather than relying solely on environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo, 2019</xref>). Accordingly, our findings suggest a tandem architecture: forward model recalibration adjusts the nervous system’s “normal state,” while stimulus-response mapping computes motor adjustments relative to this “new normal.” This architecture explains the sharp transition from flexible to rigid motor adjustments observed in our Ramp Down task. The transition occurs at the configuration perceived as “equal speeds” (~0.5 m/s speed difference) because this corresponds to the recalibrated “new normal”.</p>
<p>In the first half of the Ramp Down, participants adequately modulated their walking pattern to accommodate the gradually diminishing perturbation, achieving symmetric step lengths. Due to the recalibrated “new normal”, perturbations within this range are perceived as congruent with the direction of adaptation but reduced in magnitude. This allows the mapping mechanism to flexibly modulate the walking pattern by using motor adjustments previously learned during adaptation.</p>
<p>Importantly, the rapid duration of the Ramp Down task rules out the possibility that the observed modulation may instead reflect washout, as confirmed by the fact the aftereffects measured post-Ramp-Down were comparable to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Kambic et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Reisman et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the second half of the Ramp Down, aftereffects emerged as participants failed to accommodate perturbations smaller than the recalibrated “new normal”. These perturbations were perceived as opposite to the adaptation perturbation and, therefore, novel. Accordingly, the mapping mechanism responded as it would to a newly introduced perturbation, rather than leveraging previously learned adjustments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo, 2019</xref>). Due to the rapid nature of the Ramp Down, the mapping mechanism lacked sufficient time to learn the novel motor adjustments required for these perturbations – a process that typically takes several minutes, as shown by our baseline ramp tasks and control experiments. As mapping-related learning was negligible, the rigid recalibration adjustments dominated during this phase. Consequently, the walking pattern did not change to accommodate the gradually diminishing perturbation, leading to the emergence of aftereffects.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Mapping operates independently of explicit control</title>
<p>Our results suggest that stimulus-response mapping may operate independently of explicit control in walking adaptation. In previous work where an explicit goal is given, adaptation mechanisms deployed in addition to forward model recalibration are consistently found to operate under deliberate control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Codol et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>) – including memory-based caching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Huberdeau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">McDougle and Taylor, 2019</xref>) and structural learning mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">McDougle and Taylor, 2019</xref>). While the mapping described here shares some characteristics with explicit mechanisms, such as flexibility and modulation by error size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Kagerer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Modchalingam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Neville and Cressman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Saijo and Gomi, 2010</xref>), it diverges in critical ways. Unlike explicit strategies, which are rapidly acquired and diminish over time, this mapping mechanism exhibits prolonged learning beyond 15 minutes, with a rate comparable to recalibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Huberdeau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">McDougle et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with these distinctions, mounting evidence indicates that explicit strategies do not play a strong role in split-belt walking adaptation where an explicit movement goal is not provided to the participants; for example, people do not adapt faster even after watching someone else adapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Song et al., 2020</xref>). Strategic adjustments to the walking pattern can be temporarily elicited by providing additional visual feedback of the legs and an explicit goal of how to step. Yet, these adjustments disappear immediately upon removal of the visual feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>), and have no effect on the underlying adaptive learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Malone and Bastian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, performing a secondary cognitive task during walking adaptation does not affect the amount of motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hinton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Malone and Bastian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Rossi et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Vervoort et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we show that explicit strategies are not systematically used to adapt step length asymmetry and Δ motor output: the participants in our study either did not know what they did, reported changes that did not actually occur or would not lead symmetry. Only one person reported “leaning” on the left (slow) leg for as much time as possible, which is a relevant but incomplete description for how to walk with symmetry. Four reports mentioned pressure or weight, which may indirectly influence symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Hirata et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Lauzière et al., 2014</xref>), but they were vague and conflicting (e.g., “making heavy steps on the right foot” or “put more weight on my left foot”). All other responses were null, explicitly wrong or irrelevant, or overly generic, like wanting to “stay upright” and “not fall down”. We acknowledge that our testing methodology has limitations. First, it may introduce biases related to memory recall or framing of the questionnaire. Second, while it focuses on participants’ intentional use of explicit strategies to control walking, it does not rule out the possibility of passive awareness of motor adjustments or treadmill configurations. Despite these limitations, the motor adjustments reported by participants consistently fail to meet the criteria for explicit strategies as outlined by Tsay et al.: reportability and intentionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Tsay et al., 2024</xref>). Together with existing literature, this supports the interpretation that stimulus-response mapping operates automatically.</p>
<p>In sum, the mapping mechanism combines the advantages of automaticity and flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Huberdeau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>). This is ecologically important for both movement accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">Uiga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">Wong et al., 2008</xref>) and for walking safely in real-world situations, where we walk while talking or doing other tasks, and terrains are uneven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Clark, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Paul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">Wong et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Mapping operates as memory-based in some people, structure-based in others</title>
<p>Results from Experiment 2 highlight individual differences in the learning mechanisms underlying generalization to unexperienced belt speed differences. The generalization to novel perturbation sizes observed here is in line with previous suggestions of “meta-learning” in the savings of walking adaptation (i.e., faster relearning when exposed to a different perturbation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Leech et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Malone et al., 2011</xref>). Generalization to <italic>larger</italic> perturbations after reaching adaptation was shown to be incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abeele and Bock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Lazar and Van Laer, 1968</xref>), and it was unclear whether the movement patterns had been <italic>extrapolated</italic> beyond what had been experienced, or rather was just the same as in adaptation. Surprisingly, we found 40%-60% divide in our participants regarding the capacity to extrapolate walking patterns to account for larger perturbations.</p>
<p>We suggest that structural learning may underlie the ability to extrapolate walking patterns and walk symmetrically for belt speed differences larger than adaptation, as seen in 8 of 20 participants. Indeed, generalization in reaching adaptation may rely on a process of structural learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Braun et al., 2009</xref>) (note, however, that this was tied to explicit aiming; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>). Our participants may have learned the scaling relationship between belt speed perturbation and the walking pattern needed to walk symmetrically and use this scaling to produce new walking patterns matching larger perturbations.</p>
<p>In contrast, memory-based theories of mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dassonville et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Poggio and Bizzi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Van Vugt and Ostry, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">Wolpert et al., 2001</xref>) may explain why 12 participants walked asymmetrically for perturbations larger than adaptation, despite generalizing to smaller perturbations. Consistent with error-correction mappings, the walking patterns may be stored in memory during adaptation in association with the amount of perturbation they correct, and then retrieved during the ramp tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Van Vugt and Ostry, 2018</xref>). As people transition through a range of walking patterns in adaptation (see gradual adaptation of Δ motor output in Box 1 and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), they may store these intermediate walking patterns and later use them to generalize to smaller perturbations. Alternatively, people may store a limited number of walking patterns in memory, such as those for baseline and adaptation plateau, and produce intermediate patterns by interpolating between these memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Poggio and Bizzi, 2004</xref>). While interpolation has sometimes been used as a marker of structural learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Braun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Haruno et al., 2001</xref>), we argue that it fundamentally relies on stored memories. Moreover, distinguishing interpolation from intermediate memory storage during adaptation is challenging, so we adopted extrapolation as a more robust approach.</p>
<p>Both memory- and structure-based operations of mapping align with Tsay et al.’s framework for motor learning: first, action–outcome relationships are learned through exploration; second, motor control policies are refined to optimize rewards or costs, such as reducing error; and finally, learned mappings or policies are retrieved based on contextual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Tsay et al., 2024</xref>). Consistent with the proposed stages of exploration followed by refinement, we found that motor behavior during adaptation was initially erratic but became less variable at later stages of learning. Similarly, consistent with the retrieval stage, the generalization observed in the ramp tasks indicates that learned motor outputs are flexibly retrieved based on belt speed cues.</p>

<title>Mapping may underly savings upon re-exposure to the same or different perturbation</title>
<p>Our control experiments demonstrate that repeated exposure to perturbations opposite to adaptation – induced by the ascending speed match tasks post-adaptation – reduces motor and perceptual aftereffects at a different rate. Specifically, the magnitudes of motor and perceptual aftereffects were comparable at the end of adaptation, but diverged within 2 minutes of washout as motor aftereffects became smaller than perceptual aftereffects. This pattern aligns with that from Leech et al. showing that savings reduces motor aftereffects to a greater extent than perceptual aftereffects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>). Notably, the study involved repeated exposure to both the adaptation perturbation and the opposite perturbation through ascending speed match tasks structured like our paradigm. We suggest that savings – traditionally defined as the smaller initial errors, faster relearning, and smaller aftereffects when re-adapting to the same perturbation – also occurs for the opposite perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Day et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Krakauer and Shadmehr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Malone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Martin et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Reisman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Roemmich and Bastian, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Rossi et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Shadmehr and Brashers-Krug, 1997</xref>). This may explain why studies have found savings after exposure to perturbations of different magnitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; Leech et al., 2018b).</p>
<p>Specifically, we suggest that savings operates via the mapping mechanism. Mapping is ideal for savings because, in contrast to recalibration, it can take a value of zero during post-adaptation without having to unlearn. This means that, upon readaptation, the mapping adjustment may be able to immediately “jump” to a positive value, rather than adapting de novo from zero like recalibration. This may give mapping a competitive advantage such that, with repeated exposure to split-belt walking, it may contribute relatively more than recalibration to the overall adaptation. Indeed, savings has opposite effects on recalibration and mapping-like explicit mechanisms – reducing the former and increasing the latter contribution – at least in reaching adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avraham et al., 2021</xref>). In walking adaptation, Roemmich and Bastian show that savings is larger when participants recall experiencing a larger perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Roemmich and Bastian, 2015</xref>). While their test differs from the perceptual tasks in our study, it is plausible that participants with smaller perceptual realignment may have perceived and then recalled the perturbation more accurately, relating the magnitude of savings to the extent learnt by mapping.</p>
<p>The different decay of motor and perceptual aftereffects observed by us and Leech et al. indicates that the contribution of mapping to reducing aftereffects through savings is twofold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>). First, upon repeated exposure to the adaptation perturbation, mapping accounts for a larger proportion of the learning, thereby reducing recalibration and hence both motor and perceptual aftereffects. Second, upon repeated transitions from the adaptation perturbation to tied-belts, mapping learns motor adjustments in the direction opposite to those induced by adaptation, using these adjustments to actively counteract recalibration. As adjustments by mapping do not change perception, this process only reduces motor aftereffects, explaining why they are smaller than perceptual aftereffects. Two findings directly support the interpretation that the return to tied belts post-adaptation induces opposite learning in mapping. First, abrupt transitions from split belts to tied belts after adaptation are treated as perturbations in the opposite direction in terms of muscle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo, 2019</xref>). Second, previous work demonstrated savings following adaptation to the opposite split-belt perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Malone et al., 2011</xref>). In traditional paradigms with abrupt removal of the perturbation post-adaptation, mapping may mask the true magnitude of motor aftereffects, leading to an apparent lack of relationship with perceptual aftereffects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Statton et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<p>Body movement depends on environment perturbations (red) and Δ motor output (blue). The Δ motor output is adjusted by recalibration (light blue) and mapping (dark blue) mechanisms, which perform different operations and are arranged in tandem. We propose the following architecture and flow: <bold>(1.

The <italic>same</italic> recalibration adjustment <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> serves as an input to <italic>both</italic> areas responsible for conscious perception (green box) and Δ motor output (blue box). <bold>(2. Perception)</bold> Conscious perception is computed by cancelling out the recalibration adjustment from the actual sensory feedback (green box, perception of the belt speed difference perturbation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline47.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>is the difference between the actual speed difference <italic>p</italic>and recalibration <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>). The perceived perturbation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline48.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>serves as an input to the mapping mechanism (dark blue box). <bold>(3. Mapping)</bold> The mapping mechanism produces adjustment <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> that can vary in magnitude to appropriately account for the perceived perturbation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline49.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>(dark blue box, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> scales with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline50.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>and matches its magnitude). <bold>(4. Δ Motor output)</bold> The overall adjustment to Δ motor output is computed by adding the mapping adjustment <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and recalibration adjustment <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>. The corner in the Δ motor output versus perturbation profile arises because mapping is computed based on the perceived perturbation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline51.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>(not the actual perturbation <italic>p</italic>) and is only learnt for positive <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline52.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>(the experienced direction). When the perturbation is perceived to be opposite than adaptation, even if it is not, mapping is zero and the Δ motor output is constant, reflecting recalibration adjustments only (blue box, when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline53.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <italic>p</italic> ≥0 the mapping adjustment <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> is zero and <italic>u</italic>=<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>).</p></caption>

<p>The perturbation <italic>p</italic> represents the effect of the belt speed difference on movement or perception. Note that motor and perceptual quantities are represented in the same relative units (relative to the perturbation).</p>
<p>The light blue “recalibration” box represents the operation of the forward model recalibration mechanism: this mechanism is not flexible, so that it produces the same output <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> for any perturbation <italic>p</italic>. The recalibration <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> may project to both sensory integration and motor control areas (green and blue boxes), where it may be used to recalibrate perception and movement.</p>
<p>The green “perception” box represents the process of perceptual realignment.

It cancels out the portion of the perturbation predicted by the forward model, so that it is output is the perceived perturbation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. The perceived perturbation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>may serves both as signal for conscious speed perception (that captured by perceptual tests), and as an input to the stimulus-response mapping mechanism (dark blue box).</p>
<p>The dark blue “mapping” box represents the operation of the stimulus-response mapping mechanism.

<p>The blue “Δ motor output” box represent the computation of the Δ motor output.

<p>We propose the following series of computations. First, the recalibration is used to compute the perceived perturbation (green box). Second, the perceived perturbation is relayed to the mapping mechanism and used to compute the mapping-related motor adjustment (dark blue box). Third, recalibration-related and mapping-related motor adjustments are summed to produce the Δ motor output (blue box).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our model proposes three key features of the mapping mechanism that distinguish it from standard adaptation models. First, the mapping produces near-immediate changes to motor output in response to varying perturbations – contrasting the gradual changes proposed by state-space models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Herzfeld et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). Second, it accesses the perceived perturbation signal which integrates external sensory information with internal forward model state – contrasting the unimodal input proposed by optimal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Todorov, 2005</xref>). Third, the mapping operates automatically and is learnt with adaptation – contrasting the readily implementable explicit strategies modeled for reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>). These features enable automatic motor adjustments that complement recalibration to match varying perturbations, allowing our model to account for the observed symmetric walking across different treadmill speed configurations.</p>

<title>Implications for models of adaptation</title>
<p>We found that prominent computational models for motor adaptation could not account for the flexible properties of the stimulus-response mapping mechanism. State-space models, such as the dual state or memory of error models, could only capture recalibration-like mechanisms because their states store a single motor adjustment at any given time and change only gradually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Coltman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Diedrichsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Herzfeld et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Inoue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Lee and Schweighofer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>). Despite promising concepts involving external sensory stimuli, current implementations of optimal control models for adaptation cannot capture mapping because they operate like state-space models, computing motor output linearly from a state that holds a single value and is updated gradually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Izawa and Shadmehr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Todorov, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">2004</xref>). Similarly, despite their potential to account for parallel changes in movement and perception, models like Proprioceptive Re-alignment Model (PReMo) or Perceptual Error Adaptation also operate akin to state-space models and could not capture mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Tsay et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>We developed two models that account for the post-learning properties of mapping mechanism in the Ramp Down task, with or without unlearning of the recalibration mechanism. Future work is needed to expand these models to also account for the learning process in adaptation. Despite not being as thoroughly formalized as serial or parallel models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Lee and Schweighofer, 2009</xref>), tandem models integrate the features necessary to effectively account for the properties of mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Honda et al., 2018</xref>). Like parallel models, tandem models allow both mechanisms to access external error signals, which is necessary for mapping to respond quickly to changes in the perturbation. This cannot occur in serial models, where mapping only receives input from the recalibration mechanism and has no access to external signals. Instead, mapping would only change as a response to changes in recalibration, limiting its rate of change to be equal to or slower than that of recalibration. Like serial models, tandem models use the output of one mechanism (recalibration) as input to the other (mapping), which is necessary for mapping to compute complementary adjustments that achieve symmetric walking during the initial portion of the Ramp Down. This cannot occur in parallel models, where mapping only receives external inputs and has no access to the state of recalibration. Instead, mapping would need to operate solely relative to its own portion of the learning, scaling linearly from its magnitude at adaptation plateau to zero throughout the Ramp Down. Since the magnitude of mapping is smaller than the perturbation at the adaptation plateau, mapping has less to adjust over the Ramp Down. Consequently, it would decay slower than the perturbation and aftereffects would emerge immediately.</p>
<p>Existing models offer key insight into further development of a comprehensive framework for mapping. Taylor and Ivry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>) was able to capture flexible adjustments by strategic aiming and incorporate it into state-space models – though assuming these adjustments are immediately available upon exposure to the adaptation perturbation. Modifications could be explored to capture the adaptation learning process of mechanisms that are not immediate, like the mapping mechanism for walking adaptation and uninstructed aiming strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bond and Taylor, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">McDougle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, optimal control frameworks are promising for modeling mapping mechanisms across paradigms because they can account for how paradigm-specific stimuli – implicit and explicit rewards and costs – influence movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Todorov, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>). They may also be instrumental to account for the potentially multiple sources of errors contributing to adaptation – which may include a combination of motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Haith and Krakauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Smith et al., 2006</xref>), perceptual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Tsay et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>), sensory prediction, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Haith and Krakauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">Tseng et al., 2007</xref>), and energy cost signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Finley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Sánchez et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">2017</xref>). While we use kinematic measures for our modelling analysis to align with established procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">McDougle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Smith et al., 2006</xref>), recalibration can at least partially proceed when kinematic error is clamped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gonzalez-Rubio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Long et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that other sources of error may also be at play. Building on preliminary frameworks that integrate sensory predictions and external sensory stimuli for motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cheng and Sabes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Honda et al., 2018</xref>), future models may effectively account for mapping across paradigms.</p>

<title>Neural substrates</title>
<p>Operation of the recalibration mechanism may rely on the cerebellum and its protections to sensorimotor cortices. It is well known that the cerebellum houses forward models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Tanaka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">Wolpert et al., 2001</xref>) and is involved in motor adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bastian, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Martin et al., 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Morton and Bastian, 2006</xref>) and perceptual realignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Izawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Statton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Synofzik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c141">Yavari et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, its neural architecture and functional organization are highly optimized for integrating multiple input signals into a unified learning process: First, the error input from climbing fibers to individual Purkinje cells can itself be multisensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Diedrichsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ju et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Tanaka et al., 2020</xref>). Second, processing within the cerebellum can integrate multisensory signals to produce a coordinated sensory cancellation response, either directly within individual Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Lai et al., 2021</xref>) or through their convergence in the nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ito, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Tanaka et al., 2020</xref>). Third, cerebellar outputs carrying distinct signals, such as different movement parameters, can be integrated in the premotor cortex to adapt movement in a coordinated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Herzfeld et al., 2018</xref>). These characteristics support the suggestion that adaptation is driven by multiple sources of error. Cerebellar connectivity also supports the opposite process, whereas the same forward model recalibration in the cerebellum may have diverse downstream effects depending on the specific targets of its output projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">Welniarz et al., 2021</xref>). Cerebellar circuits are anatomically homogeneous and may perform analogous computations, supporting the idea that their differing functional roles depend largely on their inputs and downstream output structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ito, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Schmahmann, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Tanaka et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>We hypothesize that perceptual and recalibration-related motor changes with adaptation reflect recalibration of the same forward models in the cerebellum, processed downstream by motor and sensory cortices. Cerebellar output from single regions of the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Pisano et al., 2021</xref>), and possibly single output cells from the cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Judd et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Sultan et al., 2012</xref>), projects to both sensory and motor cortical areas, modulating their activity in a coordinated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Lindeman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Popa et al., 2013</xref>). We suggest that this connection mediates sensory cancellation during active movement, as this cancellation is observed in both sensory and motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Seki and Fetz, 2012</xref>) and relies on cerebellar predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blakemore et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brooks and Cullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Rondi-Reig et al., 2014</xref>). Perceptual realignment may operate by filtering out self-generated sensory stimuli from the adapted movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blakemore et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brooks and Cullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Rondi-Reig et al., 2014</xref>), or the predictable environmental stimuli from the treadmill speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Rondi-Reig et al., 2014</xref>). This may explain the increased activity in the parietal lobe, alongside cerebellum and frontal lobe, with split-belt walking adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hinton et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Operation of the mapping mechanism may rely on a similar network. Recalibration-adjusted perceptual information on the treadmill configuration may be relayed via sensory cortical areas and cerebellum to motor cortical areas, where it may be mapped to motor adjustments. This is supported by the interconnectivity between these substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Judd et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Kandel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Sultan et al., 2012</xref>), and by the cortical contribution to the flexible control of walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Drew and Marigold, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Reisman et al., 2010</xref>) beyond voluntary control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Delval et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Petersen et al., 2012</xref>). Mapping may also involve spinal control – which is rapid and automatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Takakusaki, 2013</xref>) and can play a role in split-belt walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Ogawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Vasudevan et al., 2011</xref>) – but likely through connection with supraspinal structures due to the extensive training needed for plasticity within the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Thompson et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, we hypothesize that mapping does not involve the prefrontal cortex, which is instead associated with explicit control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Goldman-Rakic, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>). Indeed, the prefrontal cortex becomes less active with split-belt adaptation, and greater deactivation is associated with more symmetric strides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hinton et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Motor adjustments resulting from recalibration and mapping may be integrated either cortically or subcortically. Cortical integration is supported by adaptation studies in primates, demonstrating cortical correlates consistent with the combined operation of recalibration-like and mapping-like mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chase et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). The recalibration-like mechanism modulates cortical motor cells uniformly via a shared upstream input, leading to fixed motor adjustments across environmental conditions. The mapping-like mechanism changes the weight or tuning direction of individual cortical cells, leading to flexible motor adjustments that differ across environmental conditions. Nevertheless, studies in humans show that cerebral damage does not block walking adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Choi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Reisman et al., 2007</xref>), potentially supporting the alternative hypothesis that recalibration and mapping signals may be combined subcortically.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>We aim to propose a framework for motor adaptation that is both parsimonious and based on a simple model. However, this simplicity inevitably comes with certain limitations. First, our model is descriptive and focused on capturing the novel features of the data revealed by the Ramp Down task, rather than the entire motor adaptation time series. Second, there may be alternative interpretations to our results, and a few mechanisms may underly the stimulus-response mapping observed here. While mapping differs from explicit strategies as they are currently defined, we still lack a comprehensive framework to capture the varying levels and nuanced characteristics of intentionality and awareness of different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Tsay et al., 2024</xref>). Additionally, evidence suggests that walking adaptation involves optimizing motor commands to minimize energy costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Finley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Sánchez et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">2017</xref>). Therefore, our results may be explained by extending current optimal control models to account for our finding that motor commands are computed using internal state estimates and sensory feedback from the environment in tandem. Future work is needed to develop a generative model capable of capturing the features of adaptation presented here, and further characterize the nature of the stimulus-response mapping mechanism of automatic adaptation.</p>

<title>Conclusions and future directions</title>
<p>We here characterized two distinct learning mechanisms involved in walking adaptation, both of which are not under explicit control: recalibration – which leads to motor and perceptual aftereffects, and mapping – which only changes movement, does not contribute to aftereffects, and shows meta-learning to different perturbation sizes. Future work should explore whether the mapping mechanism described here could be of clinical significance: given the combined flexibility and automaticity, mapping has the potential to ameliorate known problems such as transitioning between walking environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Sombric et al., 2017</xref>) and dual-tasking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Clark, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, our findings that different people adapt using different learning mechanisms (i.e., memory or structure-based mapping) highlights the importance of assessing individual characteristics of adaptation for both understanding of the neural mechanisms as well as translation to rehabilitation. Finally, the framework proposed here has important implications for the development of computational models of adaptation, and may help reconcile different findings related to savings, energetics, and sources of errors.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We recruited one-hundred adults (66 females, 23.6 ± 3.9 years old, mean ± SD) for this study, and we reanalyzed data from ten additional adults collected in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>) (9 female, 21.3 ± 2.9 years old). The protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board and participants provided written informed consent. Participants had no known neurological or musculoskeletal disorders, were naïve to split-belt walking, and participated in only one of the nine experiments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Participants walked on a split-belt treadmill (Woodway, Waukesha, WI, USA) with a thin wooden divider between the belts to avoid stepping on the opposite belt. We controlled the belt speeds with a custom Vizard program (WorldViz), and briefly stopped the treadmill between each phase of the paradigm with the following exceptions: the treadmill was not stopped before the ramp tasks of Experiments 1 and 2 or the first post-adaptation speed match task of the Small Gradual control experiment (people transitioned directly from the preceding walking blocks into the tasks, avoiding abrupt speed changes). We occluded vision and sound of the belt speeds using a cloth drape and headphones that played white noise during the ramp or speed match tasks. A television screen was placed in front of the treadmill and used for these tasks as described later.</p>
<p>Participants wore a non-weight-bearing safety harness, and held on to the treadmill handrail when the treadmill was started or stopped, but were instructed to let go and cross their arms as soon as they began walking. Kinematic data were collected using infrared-emitting markers (Optotrak, Northern Digital, Waterloo, ON, Canada) at 100Hz, placed bilaterally over the toe (fifth metatarsal head), ankle (lateral malleolus), knee (lateral femoral epicondyle), hip (greater trochanter), pelvis (iliac crest), and shoulder (acromion process).</p>

<title>Ramp tasks</title>
<p>For all ramp tasks of Experiments 1 and 2, the speed of the right belt was changed by 0.05m/s every 3 strides (defined below) during right leg swing. The baseline ramp of both experiments consisted of 7 increasing right speeds from 0.35m/s to 0.65m/s. The post-adaptation Ramp Down of Experiment 1 consisted of 21 decreasing right speeds from 1.5m/s to 0.5m/s. The post-adaptation Ramp Up &amp; Down of Experiment 2 consisted of 41 total right speeds: 11 increasing speeds from 1.5m/s to 2m/s, followed by 30 decreasing speeds from 1.95m/s to 0.5m/s. The left belt speed was constant at 0.5 m/s for all ramp tasks.</p>
<p>In Experiment 1, a keyboard was placed on the treadmill handrail. In the post-adaptation Ramp Down task, participants were asked to press a button the first time they perceived the right belt to be (1) as fast as the left, and (2) faster than the left. In the baseline ramp, they press to report the right belt feeling (1) as fast as the left, and (2) slower than the left. This was explained prior to the experiment and the above prompts were displayed during the tasks on the TV screen.</p>
<p>As described in SI Appendix, “Ramp Down design”, the Ramp Down task was specifically designed to measure the pattern of aftereffects in a way that ensured reliable and robust measurements with sufficient resolution across speeds, and that minimized washout to prevent confounding the results. To balance time constraints with a measurement resolution adequate for capturing perceptual realignment, we used 0.05 m/s speed decrements, matching the perceptual sensitivity estimated from our re-analysis of the baseline data from Leech et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>). To obtain robust motor aftereffect measurements, we collected three strides at each speed condition, as averaging over three strides represents the minimum standard for consistent and reliable aftereffect estimates in split-belt adaptation (typically used in catch trials) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>). To minimize unwanted washout by forgetting and/or unlearning, we did not pause the treadmill between adaptation and the post-adaptation ramp tasks, and ensured the Ramp Down was relatively quick, lasting approximately 80 seconds on average. Of note, the Ramp Down design ensures that even in cases of partial forgetting, the emergence pattern of aftereffects remains consistent with the underlying hypotheses.</p>

<p>At the end of Experiment 2, participants answered this question on a computer: <italic>Did you deliberately change how you walked to account for how fast the belts were moving? If so, describe how. Note: deliberately means that you thought about and decided to move that way. The question refers to the entire central ~20min walking block</italic>.

<title>Speed match tasks and control experiments</title>
<p>The protocol and tasks for controls experiments, shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, were based on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Statton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>). The left belt was fixed at 0.4m/s for Small Abrupt or Gradual and at 0.5m/s otherwise. The right belt speed equaled the left during baseline, post-adaptation, and catch trial (administer two-third into adaptation to all but Small Gradual). Small Gradual adapted for 15 minutes, with the right belt at 0.4 m/s for the first 30 seconds, 0.8 m/s for the last 30 seconds, and increasing linearly in between. Small Abrupt adapted for 15 minutes with the right belt at 0.8m/s. Short Ascend &amp; Descend, Medium Ascend &amp; Descend, and Long Ascend adapted for 3, 15, or 30 minutes with the right belt at 1.5m/s.</p>
<p>Speed match tasks lasted 30 seconds with a time bar displayed on the TV screen. Participants controlled the right speed with a keypad with 4 buttons: 1) large increment varying between 50, 55 or 65 mm/s as in Vazquez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>), 2) large −50mm/s decrement, 3) small 5mm/s increment, 4) small −5mm/s decrement. “Ascend” tasks, beginning with the right belt stationary, were used in baseline for all experiments, and post-adaptation for Short Ascend, Medium Ascend and Long Ascend (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). “Descend” tasks, beginning at the adaptation speed, were used for post-adaptation of the other experiments.</p>

<title>Motor measures</title>
<p>We defined a stride as the period between two consecutive left heel strikes (<italic>LHS</italic><sub>1</sub> to <italic>LHS</italic><sub>2</sub>). We computed motor measures for each stride using equations (1) – (3) (see Results), as in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Finley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Sombric et al., 2017</xref>).

</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Right (<italic>R</italic>) and left (<italic>L</italic>) step lengths are the anterior-posterior distance between the ankle markers of the two legs at right heel strike (<italic>RHS</italic>) and left heel strike (<italic>LHS</italic><sub>2</sub>) respectively. Step position is the anterior-posterior position of the ankle marker, relative to average of the two hip markers, at heel strike of the same leg. Left and right step times are the times from <italic>LHS</italic><sub>1</sub> to <italic>RHS</italic>, and from <italic>RHS</italic> to <italic>LHS</italic><sub>2</sub> respectively. Step velocity is the average anterior-posterior velocity of the ankle marker relative to average of the two hip markers, over the duration of the step (left: <italic>LHS</italic><sub>1</sub> to <italic>RHS</italic>, right: <italic>RHS</italic> to <italic>LHS</italic><sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>In Experiment 2, we also computed the measure of “strides to plateau” using individual step length asymmetry data from the adaptation phase only. We first smoothed the data with a 5-point moving average filter. We then calculated the number of strides till five consecutive strides fell within the “plateau range”, defined as the mean ± 1SD of the last 30 strides of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Malone and Bastian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In both experiments, we assessed how adaptation influences variability by evaluating within-participant residual variance in step length asymmetry around a double exponential model fit during adaptation. The double exponential model equation is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> where stride is the stride number in adaptation, and <italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub>, τ<sub><italic>1</italic></sub>, <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub>, τ<sub>2</sub>, are model parameters. We fitted this model to individual participants’ step length asymmetry data in adaptation, using the MATLAB <italic>lsqcurvefit</italic> function. Initial parameters values were set to [−0.177, 322.072 −0.216,29.662] for Experiment 1 and [−0.177, 418.725, −0.203, 44.307] for Experiment 2, derived from fitting the model to group mean data (with initial parameters [−0.2,300,−0.2,30]). We computed residuals as the difference between individual step length asymmetry data and the corresponding double exponential model fit. We finally computed variability as the variance of these residuals over (1) the initial 30 strides of adaptation and (2) the final 30 strides of adaptation. In the control experiments, we interpolated step length asymmetry as a function of speed in the task. We used locally weighted linear regression (MATLAB ‘<italic>smooth’</italic>, method = ‘lowess’, span = 20, with query speeds ranging from minimum to maximum speed at which a stride was taken (average across participants) in steps of 5 mm/s. The speed of a stride refers to the average speed for the duration of that stride; similarly, when multiple strides were taken at the same speed, the average step length asymmetry over those strides was used for our analysis.</p>

<title>Clustering analysis</title>
<p>We tested to see if there were separate clusters of participants in our dataset. For Experiment 1, the measure used for clustering was the number of strides in the Ramp Down with step length asymmetry above the baseline CI. For Experiment 2, it was the number of strides in the first portion of the Ramp Up &amp; Down (first 60 strides, teal in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) with step length asymmetry below the baseline CI. For both experiments, “baseline CI” was computed separately for each participant as the 95% CI of the mean of step length asymmetry data in the second baseline tied-belt block (after the baseline ramp task; see Statistical Analysis).</p>
<p>We used the MATLAB “dbscan” density-based clustering algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ester et al., 1996</xref>) and automated the choice of parameters adapting previously published procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Naik Gaonkar and Sawant, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Rahmah and Sitanggang, 2016</xref>) (SI Appendix, “Clustering analysis” and Pseudocode). The resulting algorithm does not require any user input; it automatically assigns participants to clusters (whose number is not predefined), or labels them as outliers, based solely on each participant’s measure of interest. We also performed a silhouette analysis to assess the validity of the clusters identified in Experiment 2, using the MATLAB “silhouette” function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dalmaijer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Rousseeuw, 1987</xref>).</p>

The feedback and Kalman gain are computed recursively using equations provided by Todorov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Todorov, 2005</xref>). We fit this model to individual participants’ motor output data similarly to how we performed the dual state fits. The optimal control theory model implemented here has 6 parameters: <italic>a</italic> = forgetting factor for the perturbation estimate, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline22.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> = variance of the perturbation estimate, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline23.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> = variance of the step length asymmetry estimate, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline24.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> = observation variance, <italic>Q</italic> = cost associated with step length asymmetry, <italic>L</italic> = cost associated with motor output. We set the initial parameter values to [0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 1000, 1000], lower bounds to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and upper bounds to [1, 10, 10, 10, 10^6, 10^6].</p>

<title>Memory of errors</title>
<p>We implemented the memory of errors model as defined by Herzfeld et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Herzfeld et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to the dual state, the model updates an internal estimate of the perturbation, and uses it to produce a motor output equal to this perturbation. However, the learning rate is not fixed, but varies on each trial depending on the error and the history of errors:
<disp-formula id="ueqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v3_ueqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Where <italic>k</italic> is the stride number, <italic>u</italic> is the motor output, <italic>p</italic> is the perturbation, <italic>e</italic> is the sensory prediction error, <italic>a</italic> is a parameter capturing forgetting, and <italic>η</italic> is the learning rate. As mentioned, the learning rate depends on the error and history of errors. Specifically, it is computed on each trial as follows:
<disp-formula id="ueqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v3_ueqn8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Each <bold><italic>g</italic></bold>(<italic>e</italic>(<italic>k</italic>))is a basis element with preferred error <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline25.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, so that <bold><italic>g</italic></bold>(<italic>e</italic>(<italic>k</italic>))has maximum value when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline26.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, and the value progressively decays, similar to a normal distribution, for <italic>e</italic>(<italic>k</italic>)smaller or larger than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline27.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup> corresponds to the variance in a normal distribution, and here captures how sharply does <bold><italic>g</italic></bold>(<italic>e</italic>(<italic>k</italic>))decay as the difference between <italic>e</italic>(<italic>k</italic>)and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline28.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> increases.</p>
<p><bold><italic>w</italic></bold>(<italic>k</italic>)is a vector that defines error sensitivity, and is updated each trial to increase sensitivity for errors that are experienced most consistently. Specifically, it is a vector that stores a scaling factor for each basis error center contained in the vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline29.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>: the learning rate is higher in response to errors associated with larger <bold><italic>w</italic></bold> scaling factor. <bold><italic>w</italic></bold> is updated such that if the error on one trial has the same sign as the error on the previous trial, the sensitivity to that error increases, otherwise it decreases. The model updates the entire <bold><italic>w</italic></bold> vector, rather than just the element corresponding to experienced error. The amount of the update is proportional to <bold><italic>g</italic></bold>(<italic>e</italic>(<italic>k</italic>−1)), meaning that sensitivities to errors similar to that experienced on this trial are updated the most, while sensitivities to errors different from that experienced on this trial are updated the least. The update magnitude is additionally scaled by the learning rate <italic>β</italic>.</p>
<p>We set the initial value of <bold><italic>w</italic></bold> as follows:
<disp-formula id="ueqn9">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v3_ueqn9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="ueqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v3_ueqn10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Where ∑<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> <italic>g</italic>(0)<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> is the sum of all elements of <bold><italic>g</italic></bold>(<bold>0</bold>), and <italic>η</italic><sub>0</sub> is a parameter representing the naïve learning rate.</p>
<p>In our study, this model captures the scenario where the learning rate is largest for step length asymmetry values that have been experienced the most and most consistently. We fitted the model parameters, <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup>, <italic>β, η</italic><sub>0</sub>, and <italic>a</italic> using initial values [0.5, 0.001, 0.001, 0.9] and bounds [0, 0, 0, 0] (lower) and [10, 1, 1, 1] (upper).</p>

<title>Proprioceptive re-alignment model (PReMo)</title>
<p>We evaluated the PReMo model developed by Tsay et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Tsay et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">2021</xref>), using the following equivalencies with the walking adaptation variables (SI Appendix, “Evaluation and development of perceptual models”): <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = step length asymmetry, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline30.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> = proprioceptive and sensory prediction uncertainties, <italic>K</italic> = learning rate. For the model fits, we set the goal <italic>G</italic> = 0, as it represents explicit strategies (but alternative values are considered in the SI Appendix).</p>
<p>The model operates by first integrating proprioceptive and predictive estimates for step length asymmetry (where prediction = goal):
<disp-formula id="ueqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v3_ueqn11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>In the original model, perception is further shifted by the visual-proprioceptive mismatch. However, this proprioceptive shift is zero in the absence of visual feedback, and step length asymmetry perception depends only on the integrated estimate:
<disp-formula id="ueqn12">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v3_ueqn12.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>

<p>Perceptual error drives implicit adaptation of step length asymmetry:
<disp-formula id="ueqn13">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v3_ueqn13.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The original model does not contain a perturbation term, which is needed to fit the model to the Ramp Down data. To introduce this, we replace the implicit adaptation equation above with separate observation and hidden state update equations, where the hidden state <italic>x</italic>(<italic>k</italic>)represents Δ motor output and <italic>p</italic>(<italic>k</italic>)is the perturbation:
<disp-formula id="ueqn14">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v3_ueqn14.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>While the original model does not explicitly define the perceived perturbation, we can infer this equation using the relationship between step length asymmetry, perturbation, and Δ motor output:
<disp-formula id="ueqn15">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v3_ueqn15.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
We assume no shift in the perception of Δ motor output as this is not defined by the model:
<disp-formula id="ueqn16">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v3_ueqn16.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>We used <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>per</italic></sup>to obtain model predictions for the perception of belt speed difference, setting the prediction to “right leg feels faster” when <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>per</italic></sup> &gt;0, “feels equal” when <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>per</italic></sup> = 0, and “feels slower” when <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>per</italic></sup> &lt;0.</p>
<p>To limit redundancy during model fitting, we substitute individual uncertainty terms with the relative weight variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline31.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline32.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. We then fitted the two model parameters <italic>K</italic> and <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> to individual data. The initial value of <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> was set to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline33.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> based on results from Zhang et al. showing that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline34.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). The initial value of the learning rate <italic>K</italic> was set to 0.03; this value was selected to ensure that the time course of learning of <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> would match that of recalibration observed in control experiments (learning of <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> after 3 minutes reached 78% of the learning observed after 15 minutes; similarly, recalibration in the Short groups was 78% of that in the Medium groups – both averaged across Ascend and Descend group means). We set lower bounds = [0, 0] and upper bounds = [1, 1], and simulated the entire paradigm but computed error minimization on the Ramp Down task only as explained before.</p>

<title>Perceptual Error Adaptation model (PEA)</title>
<p>We evaluated the PEA model developed by Zhang et al., which models perception as the Bayesian integration of any available sensory modalities as well as sensory predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). We set the following variable equivalencies: <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = step length asymmetry, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline35.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> = proprioceptive and sensory prediction uncertainties, <italic>A</italic> = retention rate, <italic>B</italic> = learning rate. We set target <italic>T</italic> = 0. As split-belt adaptation does not involve vision, we do not have the variables <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline36.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>and simplify the model accordingly.</p>
<p>The perceived movement is the Bayesian integration of proprioceptive and predictive information:
<disp-formula id="ueqn17">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v3_ueqn17.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

</disp-formula>
We finally introduced variables for hidden state <italic>x</italic>(<italic>k</italic>), perturbation <italic>p</italic>(<italic>k</italic>), and reported perceived perturbation <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>per</italic></sup>(<italic>k</italic>)(used to predict speed difference perception) as we did for PReMo:

<p>We fitted the model parameters <italic>A,B</italic>, and <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> to individual data using initial values = [0.97, 0.2, 1/3], selected approximately based on the average parameter values reported by Zhang et al. across experiments.

<title>Perceptuomotor recalibration + mapping (PM-ReMap)</title>
<p>As described in SI Appendix, “Evaluation and development of perceptual models”, PM-ReMap was formulated as an extension of PReMo that addressed its key limitations. The first limitation was that PReMo assumes perceptual realignment arises from mismatches between sensory modalities, such as vision and proprioception. We addressed this by accounting for perceptual realignment driven by mismatches between predicted and actual sensory outcomes of motor commands. The second limitation was that PReMo assumes perceptual realignment changes immediately to reflect a proportion of the perturbation on each stride – causing it to return to zero in the Ramp Down. We addressed this by incorporating a learning rate that mediates gradual changes in perceptual realignment. The third limitation was that PReMo lacks an automatic mapping mechanism capable of driving immediate changes in motor output. While it includes a variable that may function as a mapping mechanism, this variable relies on an explicit strategy, adjusts motor output gradually through a learning rate, and lacks a defined equation to determine its value. We addressed this limitation by defining an equation for this variable consistent with an automatic mapping mechanism and removing the learning rate to enable immediate changes in motor output.</p>
<p>The final model equations are as follows:
<disp-formula id="ueqn21">

</p>
<p>We used <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>per</italic></sup> to obtain model predictions for the perception of belt speed difference as explained for PReMo. To obtain the estimated point of subjective equality <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline37.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, we first determined the stride at which <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>per</italic></sup> crossed zero (sign flips from positive to negative). We then computed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline38.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>as the perturbation at that stride normalized to the perturbation at adaptation plateau: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline39.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>To limit redundancy during model fitting, we substitute individual uncertainty with a relative weight variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline40.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline41.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.

<title>General fitting procedure</title>
<p>We fitted each model to individual participants’ Δ motor output data in the Ramp Down. Specifically, we found parameter values that minimize the residual sum of squares between the Ramp Down Δ motor output data and the modelled <italic>u</italic>. Dual state, optimal control, memory of errors, PReMo, and PEA models involve hidden states that depend on the history of perturbations and are not expected to be zero at the start of the Ramp Down. To account for this, we simulated these models over the entire paradigm, but computed the residual sum of squares solely on the Ramp Down to ensure fair model comparison with the recalibration + mapping model. We used the <italic>fmincon</italic> MATLAB function with constraint and optimality tolerances tightened to 10^-20 (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical tests were performed in MATLAB with significance level α=0.05 (two-sided). For Experiment 1, we performed within-group statistical analyses to compare the following measures to zero. For each participant and for each speed in the ramp tasks, we first averaged step length asymmetry over the 3 strides taken at that speed to obtain the measures listed in a) and b):</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Step length asymmetry for each of the 7 speeds in the baseline ramp task (m=7)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Step length asymmetry for each of the 21 speeds in the Ramp Down task (m=21)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Difference in BIC between our model (recalibration + mapping) and each of the alternative models (dual state, optimal feedback control, memory of errors, PEA, PReMo, PM-ReMap) (m=6)</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>Each item on the list represents a “family of related tests” (measures considered together for multiple comparisons), where “m” is the number of tests in the family. We computed bootstrap distributions of each measure by generating 10,000 bootstrapped samples of 20 participants (resampled with replacement from Experiment 1) and averaging the measure over participants in each sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Efron and Tibshirani, 1994</xref>). We then computed confidence intervals (CI) corrected for multiple comparisons using the False Discovery Rate procedure (FDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2005</xref>). That is, for each family of related tests, we adjusted the significance level to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v3_inline42.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where “m” is the total number of tests and “R” is number of tests deemed significant for α = 0.05. Note that we report FDR-corrected CIs in the Results sections. A test is significant if the corrected CI does not overlap zero, indicating that the measure is significantly different from zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Cumming and Finch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Efron and Tibshirani, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>For both experiments, we computed within-participant CIs for the mean baseline step length asymmetry. For each participant, we generated 10,000 bootstrapped samples of N strides, resampled with replacement from 2-min baseline block following the ramp task, where N is the number of strides in this phase. We averaged step length asymmetry over strides in each sample and computed the 95% CI.</p>
<p>For Experiment 2, we performed between-group statistical analyses to assess whether the following measures differed between the memory-based and structure-based subgroups:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Number of strides to plateau (m=1)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Number of strides in teal portion of the Ramp Up &amp; Down (first 60 strides) with step length asymmetry below the within-participant baseline CI (as described above) (m=1)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We generated 10,000 bootstrapped samples, each comprising 20 participants: 12 from the memory-based subgroup and 8 from the structure-based subgroup (resampled with replacement). For each sample “b”, we averaged the measure of interest over participants resampled from each subgroup to obtain µ<sub>memory</sub> (b) and µ<sub>structure</sub> (b), and evaluated the difference of the means between the subgroups: Δµ(b)=µ<sub>memory</sub> (b)-µ<sub>structure</sub> (b). We computed the CI for this difference, correcting for multiple comparisons using FDR as explained for Experiment 1.</p>
<p>For the control experiments, we performed within-group statistical analyses to compare the following measures to zero (or 100% as defined), using the same procedure as Experiment 1:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p><italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> (m=7, counting one comparison per group), computed using the first post-adaptation task (normalized to 0.4m/s for Small Gradual)</p></list-item>

<title>Box 1. Split-belt walking adaptation paradigm and motor responses</title>
<p>There are three established motor measurements that are used to quantify split-belt walking adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Finley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Reisman et al., 2005</xref>): “Perturbation” measures the effect of the split-belt treadmill on the stepping pattern — the total movement error we would see in the absence of adaptation. “Δ motor output” measures the extent that individuals compensate for the perturbation by changing their stepping pattern — how much they alter when (time) and where (position) they step on the treadmill with each foot. “Step length asymmetry” measures the remaining movement error — the difference between Δ motor output and perturbation (see Methods).</p>
<p><xref rid="figB1" ref-type="fig">Box 1-Figure 1A</xref> illustrates the standard paradigm used in studies of split-belt adaptation, with abrupt transitions between tied-belt to split-belt phases, and <xref rid="figB1" ref-type="fig">Box 1-Figure 1B</xref> illustrates the standard motor response. In the “baseline” phase, the perturbation (red), Δ motor output (blue), and step length asymmetry (purple) are zero, reflecting equal belt speeds and symmetric walking. In the “adaptation” phase, the belt speeds are different and the perturbation is positive. Initially, this leads to movement errors observed as the negative step length asymmetry. The Δ motor output gradually adapts to compensate for the perturbation, so that the step length asymmetry returns to zero. In “post-adaptation”, the belt speeds are tied and the perturbation is again zero. Individuals exhibit initial movement errors called “aftereffects”: the Δ motor output mismatches the perturbation (it remains elevated) and step length asymmetry is positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Rossi et al., 2021a</xref>, 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Statton et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<title>Box 2. Relevant methodologies and results from prior work on perceptual recalibration during locomotor learning</title>
<p><xref rid="figB2" ref-type="fig">Box 2-Figure 1</xref> illustrates selected portions of the “speed match” paradigm manipulation used in prior work and the respective step length asymmetry data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>). The paradigm and data shown in <xref rid="figB2" ref-type="fig">Box 2-Figure 1A</xref> are consistent with that explained in Box 1 (with the addition of a brief tied-belt catch trial in adaptation). Note that participants walk with near-zero step length asymmetry by the end of adaptation and exhibit large aftereffects post-adaptation.</p>
<p>The study investigated “perceptual realignment”, where perception of speed becomes biased in adaptation, partially compensating for the speed difference so that it feels smaller. They measured perception of speed with “speed match” tasks: participants control the speed of the right belt and try to match it to that of the left belt (as described later in our Control experiments).</p>
<p>Left and right panels <xref rid="figB2" ref-type="fig">Box 2-Figure 1B</xref> depict the tasks performed before and after adaptation – top row shows belt speeds and bottom row shows step length asymmetry. Before adaptation, participants can accurately match the speeds and walk symmetrically at this near-tied-belt configuration (right and left speeds are ~equal and step length asymmetry is ~zero at the end of the “before adapt” task). After adaptation, participants overshoot the speed of the right belt and select a speed configuration that is biased towards that experienced in adaptation, perceiving this as “equal speeds” (the right speed is intermediate between the adaptation right speed and the target left speed at the end of the “after adapt” task). The key result is that participants walk with near-zero step length asymmetry at this configuration (“after adapt”, bottom row).</p>
<p>This suggests that participants may have learned to walk symmetrically at two distinct speed configurations: the adaptation configuration, and the configuration that they perceive as “equal speeds”. As illustrated in a later section (Results: Experiment 1 – Motor paradigm and hypotheses), this flexible behavior may be indicative of stimulus-response mapping mechanisms.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study introduces a novel split-belt treadmill learning task to reveal distinct and parallel learning sub-components of gait adaptation: slow and gradual error-based perceptual realignment, and a more deliberate and flexible &quot;stimulus-response&quot; style learning process. The behavioural results <bold>convincingly</bold> support the presence of a non-error-based learning process during continuous movements, and the computational modelling provides comprehensive further evidence for establishing this learning process. These results will be of interest for the broader motor learning community.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Rossi et al. asked whether gait adaptation is solely a matter of slow perceptual realignment or if it also involves fast/flexible stimulus-response mapping mechanisms. To test this, they conducted a series of split-belt treadmill experiments with ramped perturbations, revealing behavior indicative of a flexible, automatic stimulus-response mapping mechanism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study includes a perceptual test of leg speed, which correlates with the perceptual realignment component of motor aftereffects. This indicates that changes in motor performance are not fully accounted for by perceptual realignment.</p>
<p>(2) The study evaluates the possible contributions of explicit strategy using a framework (Tsay et al., 2024) and provides evidence for minimal strategy involvement in split-belt adaptation through subjective reports.</p>
<p>(3) The study incorporates qualitatively distinct, hypothesis-driven models of adaptation and proposes a new framework that integrates these mechanisms. Relatedly, the study considers a range of alternative models, demonstrating that perceptual recalibration and remapping uniquely explain the patterns of behavior and aftereffects, ruling out models that focus solely on a single process (e.g., PReMo, PEA, memory of errors, optimal feedback control) and others that do not incorporate remapping (dual rate state space models).</p>

<p>Recent findings in the field of motor learning have pointed to the combined action of multiple mechanisms that potentially contribute to changes in motor output during adaptation. A nearly ubiquitous motor learning process occurs via the trial-by-trial compensation of motor errors, often attributed to cerebellar-dependent updating. This error-based learning process is slow and largely unconscious. Additional learning processes that are rapid (e.g., explicit strategy-based compensation) have been described in discrete movements like goal-directed reaching adaptation. However, the role of rapid motor updating during continuous movements such as walking has been either under explored or inconsistent with those found during adaptation of discrete movements. Indeed, previous results have largely discounted the role of explicit strategy-based mechanisms for locomotor learning. In the current manuscript, Rossi et al. provide convincing evidence for a previously unknown rapid updating mechanism for locomotor adaptation. Unlike the now well-studied explicit strategies employed during reaching movements, the authors demonstrate that this stimulus-response mapping process is largely unconscious. The authors show that in approximately half of subjects, the mapping process appears to be memory based while the remainder of subjects appear to perform structural learning of the task design. The participants that learned using a structural approach had the capability to rapidly generalize to previously unexplored regions of the perturbation space.</p>
<p>One result that will likely be particularly important to the field of motor learning is the authors' quite convincing correlation between the magnitude of proprioceptive recalibration and the magnitude error-based updating. This result beautifully parallels results in other motor learning tasks and appears to provide a robust marker for the magnitude of the mapping process (by means of subtracting off the contribution of error-based motor learning). This is a fascinating result with implications for the motor learning field well beyond the current study.</p>
<p>A major strength of this manuscript is the large sample size across experiments and the extent of replication performed by the authors in multiple control experiments.</p>
<p>Finally, I commend the authors on extending their original observations via Experiment 2. While it seems that participants use a range of mapping mechanisms (or indeed a combination of multiple mapping mechanisms), future experiments may be able to tease apart why some subjects use memory versus structural mapping. A future ability to push subjects to learn structurally-based mapping rules has the potential to inform rehabilitation strategies.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is well written, the results are clear, and the data and analyses are convincing.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Convincing behavioral data supporting the existence of multiple learning processes during split-belt adaptation. Further convincing correlations typing the extent of forward-model based adaptation with proprioceptive recalibration.</p>
<p>
(2) The authors test a veritable &quot;zoo&quot; of prior motor learning models to show that these models do not account for their behavioral results.</p>
<p>
(3) The authors develop a convincing alternative model (PM-ReMap) that appears to account for their behavioral results by explicitly modeling forward-model based adaptation in parallel with goal remapping.</p>

<p>In this work, Rossi et al. use a novel split-belt treadmill learning task to reveal distinct sub-components of gait adaptation. The task involved following a standard adaptation phase with a &quot;ramp-down&quot; phase that helped them dissociate implicit recalibration and more deliberate SR map learning. Combined with modeling and re-analysis of previous studies, the authors show multiple lines of evidence that both processes run simultaneously, with implicit learning saturating based on intrinsic learning constraints and SR learning showing sensitivity to a &quot;perceptual&quot; error. These results offer a parallel with work in reaching adaptation showing both explicit and implicit processes contributing to behavior; however, in the case of gait adaptation the deliberate learning component does not appear to be strategic but is instead a more implicit SR learning process.</p>
<p>The authors have done a commendable job responding to my comments and critiques. I have updated the S/W below to reflect that.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The task design is very clever and the &quot;ramp down&quot; phase offers a novel way to attempt to dissociate competing models of multiple processes in gait adaptation</p>
<p>
- The analyses are thorough, as is the re-analysis of multiple previous data sets; the expanded modeling analyses are strong</p>
<p>
- The querying of perception of the different relative belt speeds is a very nice addition, allowing the authors to connect different learning components with error perception</p>
<p>
- The conceptual framework is compelling, highlighting parallels with work in reaching but also emphasizing differences, especially w/r/t SR learning versus strategic behaviors. Thus the discovery of an SR learning process in gait adaptation would be both novel and also help conjoin different siloed subfields of motor learning research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The expanded modeling analyses are useful although the SR process still seems somewhat mysterious (is it explicit/implicit? how exactly is it interacting with re-calibration?); however, understanding this system more could be a fruitful topic for future work</p>
<p>
- The sample size for the individual difference analysis is somewhat modest</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Rossi et al. asked whether gait adaptation is solely a matter of slow perceptual realignment or if it also involves fast/flexible stimulus-response mapping mechanisms. To test this, they conducted a series of split-belt treadmill experiments with ramped perturbations, revealing behavior indicative of a flexible, automatic stimulus-response mapping mechanism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study includes a perceptual test of leg speed, which correlates with the perceptual realignment component of motor aftereffects. This indicates that there are motor performances that are not accounted for by perceptual re-alignment.</p>
<p>(2) They study incorporates qualitatively distinct, hypothesis-driven models of adaptation and proposes a new framework that integrates these various mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The study could benefit from considering other alternative models. As the authors noted in their discussion, while the descriptive models explain some patterns of behaviour/aftereffects, they don't currently account for how these mechanisms influence the initial learning process itself.</p>
<p>(1a) For example, the pattern of gait asymmetric might differ for perceptual realignment (a smooth, gradual process), structural learning (more erratic, involving hypothesis testing/reasoning to understand the perturbation, see (Tsay et al. 2024) for a recent review on Reasoning), and stimulus-response mapping (possibly through a reinforcement based trial-and-error approach). If not formally doing a model comparison, the manuscript might benefit from clearly laying out the behavioural predictions for how these different processes shape initial learning.</p>
<p>(1b) Related to the above, the authors noted that the absence of difference during initial learning suggests that the differences in Experiment 2 in the ramp-up phase are driven by two distinct processes: structural learning and memory-based processes. If the assumptions about initial learning are not clear, this logic of this conclusion is hard to follow.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this insightful comment. We agree that considering alternative models and clarifying their potential contributions to the initial learning process would enhance the manuscript. We performed additional analyses and revised the text to outline how the mechanisms of adaptation in our study align with the framework described by Tsay et al. (2024) regarding the initial learning process and other features of adaptation.</p>
<p>First, we referenced the Tsay et al. framework in the Introduction and Discussion to highlight parallels between their description of implicit adaptation and our forward model recalibration mechanism (producing motor changes and perceptual realignment). Specifically, the features defining recalibration in our study – gradual, trial-by-trial adjustments, rigid learning that leads to aftereffects, and limited contribution to generalization – align with those described by Tsay et al.</p>
<p>Second, we used the description provided by Tsay et al. to test the presence of explicit strategies in our study. We specifically test for the criteria of reportability and intentionality, corroborating the finding that our stimulus response mapping mechanism differs from explicit strategies.</p>
<p>“A recent framework for motor learning by Tsay et al. defines explicit strategies as motor plans that are both intentional and reportable (Tsay et al., 2024). Within this framework, Tsay et al. clarify that &quot;intentional&quot; means participants deliberately perform the motor plan, while &quot;reportable&quot; means they are able to clearly articulate it.” (Experiment 2 Results, lines 515-518).</p>
<p>“…the motor adjustments reported by participants consistently fail to meet the criteria for explicit strategies as outlined by Tsay et al.: reportability and intentionality (Tsay et al., 2024).” (Discussion, lines 657-660).</p>
<p>Third, we interpreted the operation of stimulus-response mapping within the Tsay theoretical framework for the three stages of motor learning: 1) “reasoning” to acquire new action–outcome relationships, 2) “refinement” of the motor action parameters, and 3) “retrieval” of learnt motor actions based on contextual cues. We note that the definition of these stages closely aligns with our definition for stimulus response mapping mechanisms. Moreover, according to Tsay’s definition, both implicit and explicit learning mechanisms can involve similar reasoning and retrieval processes. This shared operational basis may explain why our stimulus-response mapping mechanism exhibits some characteristics associated with explicit strategies, such as flexibility and generalizability.</p>
<p>We performed a new analysis to evaluate Tsay’s framework predictions that, if walking adaptation includes a stimulus-response mapping mechanism following these three stages of motor learning, the learning process would initially be erratic and would then stabilize as learning progresses. We assessed within-participant residual variance in step length asymmetry around a double exponential model fit during adaptation, testing the prediction that this variability would decrease between the start and end of adaptation. Experiment 1 results confirmed this prediction, showing that a significant reduction in variability as adaptation progressed.</p>
<p>“We finally tested whether the pattern of motor variability during adaptation aligns with predictions for learning new  stimulus response maps. In contrast to recalibration, mapping mechanisms are predicted to be highly  variable  and  erratic  during  early learning, and stabilize as learning progresses (Tsay et al., 2024). Consistent with these predictions,  the  step  length  asymmetry residual  variance  (around  a  double exponential  fit)  decreased  significantly between the start and end of adaptation (residual variance at start minus end of adaptation = 0.005 [0.004, 0.007], mean [CI]; SI Appendix, Fig. S3). These control analyses corroborate the hypothesis that the “no aftereffects” region of the Ramp Down reflects the operation of a mapping mechanism.”</p>
<p>(Experiment 1 Results, lines 187-194; Methods, lines 1040-1050).</p>
<p>Moreover, Experiment 2 results demonstrated that the pattern of variability (its magnitude and decay in adaptation) did not differ between participants using memory-based versus structure-based stimulus-response mapping mechanisms. These findings suggest that both types of mapping operate accordingly to Tsay’s stages of motor learning.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, the pattern of step length asymmetry variability was similar between the subgroups (structure – memory difference in residual variance relative to double exponential during initial adaptation = -0.0052 [0.0161, 0.0044], adaptation plateau = -0.0007 [-0.0021, 0.0003], difference in variance decay = -0.0045 [-0.0155, 0.0052], mean [CI]; SI Appendix, Fig. S16). This confirms that the distinct performance clusters in the Ramp Up &amp; Down task are not driven by natural variations in learning ability, such as differences in learning speed or variability. Rather, these findings indicate that the subgroups employ different types of mapping mechanisms, which perform similarly during initial learning but differ fundamentally in how they encode, retrieve, and generalize relationships between perturbations and Δ motor outputs.” (Experiment 2 Results, lines 503-511).</p>
<p>“Both memory- and structure-based operations of mapping align with Tsay et al.’s framework for motor learning: first, action–outcome relationships are learned through exploration; second, motor control policies are refined to optimize rewards or costs, such as reducing error; and finally, learned mappings or policies are retrieved based on contextual cues (Tsay et al., 2024). Consistent with the proposed stages of exploration followed by refinement, we found that motor behavior during adaptation was initially erratic but became less variable at later stages of learning. Similarly, consistent with the retrieval stage, the generalization observed in the ramp tasks indicates that learned motor outputs are flexibly retrieved based on belt speed cues.” (Discussion, lines 701-708).</p>
<p>Finally, we addressed the prediction outlined by Tsay et al. that repeated exposure to perturbations attenuates the magnitude of forward model recalibration, with savings being driven by stimulus-response mapping mechanisms. While we could not directly test savings for the primary perturbation used during adaptation, we were able to indirectly evaluate savings for a different perturbation through analyses of our control experiments combined with previous results from Leech et al. (Leech et al., 2018). Specifically, we examined how motor aftereffects and perceptual realignment evolved across repeated iterations of the speed-matching task post-adaptation in Ascending groups. Each task began with the right leg stationary and the left leg moving at 0.5 m/s – a configuration corresponding to a perturbation of -0.5 m/s, which is opposite in direction to the adaptation perturbation. By analyzing repeated exposures to this -0.5 m/s perturbation across iterations, we gained insights into the learning dynamics associated with this perturbation and the effect of repeated exposures on motor aftereffects and perceptual realignment. Consistent with predictions from Tsay et al., our results combined with Leech et al. demonstrate that, with repeated exposures to the same perturbation, perceptual realignment decays while the contribution of stimulus-response mapping to aftereffect savings is enhanced. We present this analysis and interpretation in Control Experiments Results, lines 429-442; Figure 8B; Table S7; and Discussion lines 709-753.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1c) The authors could also test a variant of the dual-rate state-space model with two perceptual realignment processes where the constraints on retention and learning rate are relaxed. This model would be a stronger test for two perceptual re-alignment processes: one that is flexible and another that is rigid, without mandating that one be fast learning and fast forgetting, and the other be slow learning and slow forgetting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We tested multiple variants of the suggested models, and confirmed that they cannot capture the motor behavior observed in our Ramp Down task. We include Author response image 1 with the models fits, Author response table 1 with the BIC statistics, and the models equations below. Only the recalibration + mapping model captures the matching-then-divergent behavior of the Δ motor output, corroborating our interpretation that state-space based models cannot capture the mapping mechanism (see Discussion, “Implications for models of adaptation”). Furthermore, all models fit the data significantly worse than the recalibration+mapping model according to the BIC statistic.</p>

<p>(2) The authors claim that stimulus-response mapping operates outside of explicit/deliberate control. While this could be true, the survey questions may have limitations that could be more clearly acknowledged.</p>
<p>(2a) Specifically, asking participants at the end of the experiments to recall their strategies may suffer from memory biases (e.g., participants may be biased by recent events, and forget about the explicit strategies early in the experiment), be susceptible to the framing of the questions (e.g., participants not being sure what the experimenter is asking and how to verbalize their own strategy), and moreover, not clear what is the category of explicit strategies one might enact here which dictates what might be considered &quot;relevant&quot; and &quot;accurate&quot;.</p>
<p>(2b) The concept of perceptual realignment also suggests that participants are somewhat aware of the treadmill's changing conditions; therefore, as a thought experiment, if the authors have asked participants throughout/during the experiment whether they are trying different strategies, would they predict that some behaviour is under deliberate control?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have expanded the discussion to explicitly acknowledge that our testing methodology for assessing explicit strategies may have limitations, recognizing the factors mentioned by the reviewer. Moreover, as mentioned in response to comment (1), we leveraged the framework from Tsay et al., 2024 and its definition of explicit strategies to ensure a robust and consistent approach in interpreting the survey responses.</p>
<p>We revised the Experiment 2 Results section, lines 515-518, to specify that we are evaluating the presence of explicit strategies according to the criteria of intentionality and reportability:</p>
<p>“A recent framework for motor learning by Tsay et al. defines explicit strategies as motor plans that are both intentional and reportable (Tsay et al., 2024). Within this framework, Tsay et al. clarify that &quot;intentional&quot; means participants deliberately perform the motor plan, while &quot;reportable&quot; means they are able to clearly articulate it.”</p>
<p>We then reorganized the Discussion to include a separate section “Mapping operates independently of explicit control”, lines 646-661, where we discuss limitations of the survey methodology and interpretation of the results according to Tsay et al., 2024:</p>
<p>“Here, we show that explicit strategies are not systematically used to adapt step length asymmetry and Δ motor output: the participants in our study either did not know what they did, reported changes that did not actually occur or would not lead symmetry. Only one person reported “leaning” on the left (slow) leg for as much time as possible, which is a relevant but incomplete description for how to walk with symmetry. Four reports mentioned pressure or weight, which may indirectly influence symmetry (Hirata et al., 2019; Lauzière et al., 2014), but they were vague and conflicting (e.g., “making heavy steps on the right foot” or “put more weight on my left foot”). All other responses were null, explicitly wrong or irrelevant, or overly generic, like wanting to “stay upright” and “not fall down”. We acknowledge that our testing methodology has limitations. First, it may introduce biases related to memory recall or framing of the questionnaire. Second, while it focuses on participants' intentional use of explicit strategies to control walking, it does not rule out the possibility of passive awareness of motor adjustments or treadmill configurations. Despite these limitations, the motor adjustments reported by participants consistently fail to meet the criteria for explicit strategies as outlined by Tsay et al.: reportability and intentionality (Tsay et al., 2024). Together with existing literature, this supports the interpretation that stimulus response mapping operates automatically.”</p>
<p>We also made the following addition to the “Limitations” section of the Discussion (lines 917-919):</p>
<p>“While mapping differs from explicit strategies as they are currently defined, we still lack a comprehensive framework to capture the varying levels and nuanced characteristics of intentionality and awareness of different mechanisms (Tsay et al., 2024).”</p>
<p>We finally note that “Unlike explicit strategies, which are rapidly acquired and diminish over time, this mapping mechanism exhibits prolonged learning beyond 15 minutes, with a rate comparable to recalibration” (Discussion, lines 632-634).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The distinction between structural and memory-based differences in the two subgroups was based on the notion that memory-based strategies increase asymmetry. However, an alternative explanation could be that unfamiliar perturbations, due to the ramping up, trigger a surprise signal that leads to greater asymmetry due to reactive corrections to prevent one's fall - not because participants are generalizing from previously learned representations (e.g., (Iturralde &amp; Torres-Oviedo, 2019)).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that reactive corrections could contribute to the walking pattern in response to split-belt perturbations, as detailed by Iturralde &amp; Torres-Oviedo, 2019. We also acknowledge that reactive corrections are rapid, flexible, feedback-driven, and automatic – characteristics that make them appear similar to stimulus-response mapping. However, a detailed evaluation of our results suggests that the behaviors observed in the ramp tasks cannot be fully explained by reactive corrections. Reactive corrections occur almost immediately, quickly adjusting the walking pattern to reduce error and improve stability. This excludes the possibility that what we identified as stimulusresponse mapping could instead be reactive corrections, because the stimulus-response mapping observed in our study is acquired slowly at a rate comparable to recalibration. It also excludes the possibility that the increased asymmetry in the Ramp Up &amp; Down could be due to reactive corrections, because these would operate alongside mapping to help reduce asymmetry rather than exacerbate it.</p>
<p>We made substantial revisions to the Discussion and included the section “Stimulus-response mapping is flexible but requires learning” to explain this interpretation (lines 595-622):</p>
<p>“The mapping mechanism observed in our study aligns with the corrective responses described by Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo, which operate relative to a recalibrated &quot;new normal&quot; rather than relying solely on environmental cues (Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo, 2019). Accordingly, our findings suggest a tandem architecture: forward model recalibration adjusts the nervous system's &quot;normal state,&quot; while stimulus-response mapping computes motor adjustments relative to this &quot;new normal.&quot; This architecture explains the sharp transition from flexible to rigid motor adjustments observed in our Ramp Down task. The transition occurs at the configuration perceived as &quot;equal speeds&quot; (~0.5 m/s speed difference) because this corresponds to the recalibrated “new normal”.</p>
<p>In the first half of the Ramp Down, participants adequately modulated their walking pattern to accommodate the gradually diminishing perturbation, achieving symmetric step lengths. Due to the recalibrated “new normal”, perturbations within this range are perceived as congruent with the direction of adaptation but reduced in magnitude. This allows the mapping mechanism to flexibly modulate the walking pattern by using motor adjustments previously learned during adaptation. Importantly, the rapid duration of the Ramp Down task rules out the possibility that the observed modulation may instead reflect washout, as confirmed by the fact the aftereffects measured post-Ramp-Down were comparable to previous work (Kambic et al., 2023; Reisman et al., 2005).</p>
<p>In the second half of the Ramp Down, aftereffects emerged as participants failed to accommodate perturbations smaller than the recalibrated “new normal”. These perturbations were perceived as opposite to the adaptation perturbation and, therefore, novel. Accordingly, the mapping mechanism responded as it would to a newly introduced perturbation, rather than leveraging previously learned adjustments (Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo, 2019). Due to the rapid nature of the Ramp Down, the mapping mechanism lacked sufficient time to learn the novel motor adjustments required for these perturbations – a process that typically takes several minutes, as shown by our baseline ramp tasks and control experiments. As mapping-related learning was negligible, the rigid recalibration adjustments dominated during this phase. Consequently, the walking pattern did not change to accommodate the gradually diminishing perturbation, leading to the emergence of aftereffects.”</p>

<p>(4) Further contextualization: Recognizing the differences in dependent variables (reaching position vs. leg speed/symmetry in walking), could the Proprioceptive/Perceptual Re-alignment model also apply to gait adaptation (Tsay et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024)? Recent reaching studies show a similar link between perception and action during motor adaptation (Tsay et al., 2021) and have proposed a model aligning with the authors' correlations between perception and action. The core signal driving implicit adaptation is the discrepancy between perceived and desired limb position, integrating forward model predictions with proprioceptive/visual feedback.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and agree that the Proprioceptive Re-alignment model (PReMo) and Perceptual Error Adaptation model (PEA), offer valuable insights into the relationship between perception and motor adaptation. To explore whether these frameworks apply to gait adaptation, we conducted an extensive modeling analysis. This is shown in Figure 5 and Supplementary Figures S7-S8, and is detailed in the text of Experiment 1 Results section “Modelling analysis for perceptual realignment” (lines 327–375), Methods section “Proprioceptive re-alignment model (PReMo)” (lines 1181-1221), Methods section “Perceptual Error Adaptation model (PEA)” (lines 1222-1247), Methods section “Perceptuomotor recalibration + mapping (PM-ReMap)” (lines 1248-1286), and SI Appendix section “Evaluation and development of perceptual models.” (lines 99-237).</p>
<p>First, we evaluated how PReMo and PEA models fitted our Ramp Down data. We translated the original variables to walking adaptation variables using a conceptual equivalence explained by one of the features explored by Tsay et al. (2022). Specifically, the manuscript provides guidance on extending the PReMo model from visuomotor adaptation in response to visual-proprioceptive discrepancies, to force-field adaptation in response to mechanical perturbations – which share conceptual similarities with split-belt treadmill perturbations. The manuscript also discusses that, if vision is removed, the proprioceptive shift decays back to zero according to a decay parameter. This description entails that proprioceptive shift cannot increase or develop in the absence of vision. We applied the models to split-belt adaptation in accordance with this information, as described in the SI Appendix: “PReMo variables equivalents for walking adaptation”. As reported in Experiment 1 Results “Modelling analysis for perceptual realignment” (lines 327–375) and Figure 5, neither PReMo nor PEA adequately captured the key features of our Ramp Down data: “The models could not capture the matching-then-divergent behavior of Δ motor output, performing significantly worse than the recalibration + mapping model (PReMo minus recalibration+mapping BIC difference = 24.591 [16.483, 32.037], PEA minus recalibration+mapping BIC difference = 6.834 [1.779, 12.130], mean [CI]). Furthermore, they could not capture the perceptual realignment and instead predicted that the right leg would feel faster than the left throughout the entire Ramp Down”.</p>
<p>Second, we used simulations to confirm that PReMo and PEA cannot account for the perceptual realignment observed in our study, and to understand why. At adaptation plateau, PReMo predicts that perceived and actual step length asymmetry converge, as shown in Fig. S7A, top, and as detailed in the SI Appendix “Original PReMo simulations”. We found that this is because PReMo assumes that perceptual realignment arises specifically from mismatches between different sensory modalities. This assumption works for paradigms that introduce an actual mismatch between sensory modalities, such as visuomotor adaptation paradigms with a mismatch between vision and proprioception. This assumption also works for paradigms that indirectly introduce a mismatch between integrated sensory information from different sensory modalities. In force-field adaptation, both proprioceptive and visual inputs are present and realistic, but when these inputs are integrated with sensory predictions, the resulting integrated visual estimate is mismatched compared to the integrated proprioceptive estimate. In contrast, the assumption that perceptual realignment arises from sensory modalities mismatches does not work for paradigms that involve a single sensory modality. Split-belt adaptation only involves proprioception as no visual feedback is given, and perceptual realignment arises from discrepancies between predicted and actual motor outcomes, rather than between integrated sensory modalities.</p>
<p>To overcome this limitation, we reinterpreted the variables of the PReMo model, while keeping the original equations, to account for realignment driven by mismatches of the same nature as the perturbation driving adaptation. As reported in the SI Appendix “Iterative simulations for the development of PM-ReMap”, the simulation (Fig. S7A, middle row) “showed perceptual realignment at adaptation plateau, addressing a limitation of the original model. However, it failed to account for the Ramp Down perceptual results, inaccurately predicting that belt speeds feel equal when they are actually equal (Fig. S7A, middle row, perceived perturbation decays alongside actual perturbation and converge to zero at the end of the Ramp Down). […] This occurs because, under the retained PReMo equations, <italic>β<sub>p</sub></italic> and <italic>β<sub>v</sub></italic> change immediately and are proportional to the difference between <inline-formula id="sa4equ4"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-101671-sa4-equ4.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="sa4equ5"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-101671-sa4-equ5.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> on each trial, so that they ramp down to zero in parallel with the perturbation”.</p>
<p>We also noted that the simulations of the original and reinterpreted PReMo models could also not support the operation of the mapping mechanism observed in the Ramp Down (Fig. S7B). We describe that “This occurs because the overall motor output <italic>x<sub>p</sub></italic>, which includes both recalibration and mapping mechanisms, changes gradually according to the learning rate 𝐾. Consequently, changes in 𝐺 take many trials to be fully reflected in <italic>x<sub>p</sub></italic>. Hence, we found complementary limitations where PReMo assumes perceptual realignment changes immediately while mapping adjustments develop gradually – but the opposite is true in our data”.</p>
<p>We therefore modified the PReMo equations and developed a new model, called perceptuomotor recalibration + mapping (PM-ReMap) that addresses these limitations and is able to capture our Ramp Down motor and perceptual results. As described in the SI Appendix “Iterative simulations for the development of PM-ReMap”, “we introduced an update equation for <italic>β<sub>p</sub></italic> so that it changes gradually trial-by-trial according to the learning rate 𝐾. We then removed the learning rate from the update equation for <italic>x<sub>p</sub></italic> so that it integrates two distinct types of changes: 1) the gradual changes in <inline-formula id="sa4equ6"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-101671-sa4-equ6.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> driven by <italic>β<sub>p</sub></italic> and representing the recalibration mechanism, and 2) the immediate changes in 𝐺 – representing the mapping mechanism”. The final equations of the PM-ReMap model are as follows:</p>

<p>As reported in Experiment 1 Results, “Modelling analysis for perceptual realignment”, and as shown in Fig. 5C, “the PM-ReMap model captured the Δ motor output in the Ramp Down with performance comparable to that of the recalibration + mapping model (BIC difference = 2.381 [-0.739, 5.147], mean [CI]).

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Recent findings in the field of motor learning have pointed to the combined action of multiple mechanisms that potentially contribute to changes in motor output during adaptation. A nearly ubiquitous motor learning process occurs via the trial-by-trial compensation of motor errors, often attributed to cerebellar-dependent updating. This error-based learning process is slow and largely unconscious. Additional learning processes that are rapid (e.g., explicit strategy-based compensation) have been described in discrete movements like goal-directed reaching adaptation. However, the role of rapid motor updating during continuous movements such as walking has been either under-explored or inconsistent with those found during the adaptation of discrete movements. Indeed, previous results have largely discounted the role of explicit strategy-based mechanisms for locomotor learning. In the current manuscript, Rossi et al. provide convincing evidence for a previously unknown rapid updating mechanism for locomotor adaptation. Unlike the now well-studied explicit strategies employed during reaching movements, the authors demonstrate that this stimulus-response mapping process is largely unconscious. The authors show that in approximately half of subjects, the mapping process appears to be memory-based while the remainder of subjects appear to perform structural learning of the task design. The participants that learned using a structural approach had the capability to rapidly generalize to previously unexplored regions of the perturbation space.</p>
<p>One result that will likely be particularly important to the field of motor learning is the authors' quite convincing correlation between the magnitude of proprioceptive recalibration and the magnitude error-based updating. This result beautifully parallels results in other motor learning tasks and appears to provide a robust marker for the magnitude of the mapping process (by means of subtracting off the contribution of error-based motor learning). This is a fascinating result with implications for the motor learning field well beyond the current study.</p>
<p>A major strength of this manuscript is the large sample size across experiments and the extent of replication performed by the authors in multiple control experiments.</p>
<p>Finally, I commend the authors on extending their original observations via Experiment 2. While it seems that participants use a range of mapping mechanisms (or indeed a combination of multiple mapping mechanisms), future experiments may be able to tease apart why some subjects use memory versus structural mapping. A future ability to push subjects to learn structurally-based mapping rules has the potential to inform rehabilitation strategies.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is well written, the results are clear, and the data and analyses are convincing. The manuscript's weaknesses are minor, mostly related to the presentation of the results and modeling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The overall weaknesses in the manuscript are minor and can likely be addressed with textual changes.</p>
<p>(1) A key aspect of the experimental design is the speed of the &quot;ramp down&quot; following the adaptation period. If the ramp-down is too slow, then no after-effects would be expected even in the alternative recalibration-only/errorbased only hypothesis. How did the authors determine the appropriate rate of ramp-down? Do alternative choices of ramp-down rates result in step length asymmetry measures that are consistent with the mapping hypothesis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comment regarding the rate of the Ramp Down following the adaptation period and its potential impact on aftereffects under different hypotheses. We added a detailed explanation for how we determined the Ramp Down design, including analyses of previous work, to the SI Appendix, “Ramp Down design”, lines 22-98. We also describe the primary points in the main Methods section, “Ramp Tasks”, lines 978-991:</p>
<p>As described in SI Appendix, “Ramp Down design”, the Ramp Down task was specifically designed to measure the pattern of aftereffects in a way that ensured reliable and robust measurements with sufficient resolution across speeds, and that minimized washout to prevent confounding the results. To balance time constraints with a measurement resolution adequate for capturing perceptual realignment, we used 0.05 m/s speed decrements, matching the perceptual sensitivity estimated from our re-analysis of the baseline data from Leech et al. (Leech et al., 2018a). To obtain robust motor aftereffect measurements, we collected three strides at each speed condition, as averaging over three strides represents the minimum standard for consistent and reliable aftereffect estimates in split-belt adaptation (typically used in catch trials) (Leech et al., 2018a; Rossi et al., 2019; Vazquez et al., 2015). To minimize unwanted washout by forgetting and/or unlearning, we did not pause the treadmill between adaptation and the post-adaptation ramp tasks, and ensured the Ramp Down was relatively quick, lasting approximately 80 seconds on average. Of note, the Ramp Down design ensures that even in cases of partial forgetting, the emergence pattern of aftereffects remains consistent with the underlying hypotheses.</p>
<p>In the SI Appendix, we explain that, while we did not test longer ramp-down durations directly, previous data suggest that durations of up to at least 4.5 minutes would yield step length asymmetry measures consistent with our results and the mapping hypothesis. Additionally, our control experiments replicated the behavior observed in the Ramp Down using speed match tasks lasting only 30 seconds, further supporting the robustness of our findings across varying durations.</p>

<p>(2) Overall, the modeling as presented in Figure 3 (Equation 1-3) is a bit convoluted. To my mind, it would be far more useful if the authors reworked Equations 1-3 and Figure 3 (with potential changes to Figure 2) so that the motor output (u) is related to the stride rather than the magnitude of the perturbation. There should be an equation relating the forward model recalibration (i.e., Equation 1) to the fraction of the motor error on a given stride, something akin to u(k+1) = r * (u(k) - p(k)). This formulation is easier to understand and commonplace in other motor learning tasks (and likely what the authors actually fit given the Smith &amp; Shadmehr citation and the derivations in the Supplemental Materials). Such a change would require that Figure 3's independent axes be changed to &quot;stride,&quot; but this has the benefit of complementing the presentation that is already in Figure 5.</p>

<p>I think that some changes to the text/ordering could improve the manuscript's readability. In particular:</p>
<p>(1) My feeling is that much of the equations presented in the Methods section should be moved to the Results section. Particularly Equations 9-11. The introduction of these motor measures should likely precede Figure 1, as their definitions form the crux of Figure 1 and the subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>(2) It is unclear to me why many of the analyses and discussion points have been relegated to Supplemental Material. I would significantly revise the manuscript to move much of the content from Supplemental Material to the Methods and Discussion (where appropriate). Even the Todorov and Herzfeld models can likely simply be referenced in the text without a need for their full description in the Supplemental material - as their implementations appear to this reviewer as consistent with those presented in the respective papers. Beyond the Supplementary Tables, my feeling is that nearly all of the content in Supplemental can either be simply cited (e.g. alternative model implementations) or directly incorporated into the main manuscript without compromising the readability of the manuscript.</p>

<p>We reorganized the manuscript and SI Appendix substantially, moving content to the Results or other main text section. The changes included those recommended by the reviewer:</p>
<p>• We moved the equations describing step length asymmetry, perturbation, and Δ motor output (originally numbered Eq. 9-11) to the Results section (Experiment 1, “Motor paradigm and hypothesis”, lines 131-133, now numbered Eq. 1-3).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Rossi et al. use a novel split-belt treadmill learning task to reveal distinct sub-components of gait adaptation. The task involved following a standard adaptation phase with a &quot;ramp-down&quot; phase that helped them dissociate implicit recalibration and more deliberate SR map learning. Combined with modeling and re-analysis of previous studies, the authors show multiple lines of evidence that both processes run simultaneously, with implicit learning saturating based on intrinsic learning constraints and SR learning showing sensitivity to a &quot;perceptual&quot; error. These results offer a parallel with work in reaching adaptation showing both explicit and implicit processes contributing to behavior; however, in the case of gait adaptation the deliberate learning component does not appear to be strategic but is instead a more implicit SR learning processes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The task design is very clever and the &quot;ramp down&quot; phase offers a novel way to attempt to dissociate competing models of multiple processes in gait adaptation.</p>
<p>(2) The analyses are thorough, as is the re-analysis of multiple previous data sets.</p>
<p>(3) The querying of perception of the different relative belt speeds is a very nice addition, allowing the authors to connect different learning components with error perception.</p>
<p>(4) The conceptual framework is compelling, highlighting parallels with work in reaching but also emphasizing differences, especially w/r/t SR learning versus strategic behaviors. Thus the discovery of an SR learning process in gait adaptation would be both novel and also help conjoin different siloed subfields of motor learning research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The behavior in the ramp-down phase does indeed appear to support multiple learning processes. However, I may have missed something, but I have a fundamental worry about the specific modeling and framing of the &quot;SR&quot; learning process. If I correctly understand, the SR process learns by adjusting to perceived L/R belt speed differences (Figure 7). What is bugging me is why that process would not cause the SR system to still learn something in the later parts of the ramp-down phase when the perceived speed differences flip (Figure 4). I do believe this &quot;blunted learning&quot; is what the SR component is actually modeled with, given this quote in the caption to Figure 7: &quot;When the perturbation is perceived to be opposite than adaptation, even if it is not, mapping is zero and the Δ motor output is constant, reflecting recalibration adjustments only.&quot; It seems a priori odd and perhaps a little arbitrary to me that a SR learning system would just stop working (go to zero) just because the perception flipped sign. Or for that matter &quot;generalize&quot; to a ramp-up (i.e., just learn a new SR mapping just like the system did at the beginning of the first perturbation). What am I missing that justifies this key assumption? Or is the model doing something else? (if so that should be more clearly described).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur that this point was confusing, and we performed additional analyses and revised the text to improve clarity. Specifically, we clarify that the stimulus-response mapping does indeed still learn in the second portion of the Ramp Down, when the perceived speed differences flip. However, learning by the mapping mechanism proceeds slowly – at a rate comparable to that of forward model recalibration, taking several minutes. The duration of the task is relatively short, so that learning by the mapping mechanism is limited. We schematize the learning to be zero as an approximation. We have now included an additional modelling analysis (as part of our expanded perceptual modelling analyses), which shows there is no significant improvement in modelling performance when accounting for forgetting of recalibration or learning in the opposite direction by mapping in the second half of the ramp down, supporting this approximation. We explain this and other revisions in detail below.</p>
<p>We include a Discussion section “Stimulus-response mapping is flexible but requires learning” where we improve our explanation of the operation of the mapping mechanism in the Ramp Down by leveraging the framework proposed by Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo, 2019. The section first explains that mapping operates relative to a new equilibrium corresponding to the current forward model calibration (lines 595-603):</p>
<p>“The mapping mechanism observed in our study aligns with the corrective responses described by Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo, which operate relative to a recalibrated &quot;new normal&quot; rather than relying solely on environmental cues (Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo, 2019). Accordingly, our findings suggest a tandem architecture: forward model recalibration adjusts the nervous system's &quot;normal state,&quot; while stimulus-response mapping computes motor adjustments relative to this &quot;new normal.&quot; This architecture explains the sharp transition from flexible to rigid motor adjustments observed in our Ramp Down task. The transition occurs at the configuration perceived as &quot;equal speeds&quot; (~0.5 m/s speed difference) because this corresponds to the recalibrated “new normal”.”</p>
<p>The following paragraph (lines 604-611) explain how this concept reflects in the first half of the Ramp Down:</p>
<p>“In the first half of the Ramp Down, participants adequately modulated their walking pattern to accommodate the gradually diminishing perturbation, achieving symmetric step lengths. Due to the recalibrated “new normal”, perturbations within this range are perceived as congruent with the direction of adaptation but reduced in magnitude. This allows the mapping mechanism to flexibly modulate the walking pattern by using motor adjustments previously learned during adaptation. Importantly, the rapid duration of the Ramp Down task rules out the possibility that the observed modulation may instead reflect washout, as confirmed by the fact the aftereffects measured post-Ramp-Down were comparable to previous work (Kambic et al., 2023; Reisman et al., 2005).”</p>
<p>The last paragraph (lines 612–622) explain the second half of the Ramp Down in light of the equilibrium concept and of the slow learning rate of mapping:</p>
<p>“In the second half of the Ramp Down, aftereffects emerged as participants failed to accommodate perturbations smaller than the recalibrated “new normal”. These perturbations were perceived as opposite to the adaptation perturbation and, therefore, novel. Accordingly, the mapping mechanism responded as it would to a newly introduced perturbation, rather than leveraging previously learned adjustments (Iturralde and TorresOviedo, 2019). Due to the rapid nature of the Ramp Down, the mapping mechanism lacked sufficient time to learn the novel motor adjustments required for these perturbations – a process that typically takes several minutes, as shown by our baseline ramp tasks and control experiments. As mapping-related learning was negligible, the rigid recalibration adjustments dominated during this phase. Consequently, the walking pattern did not change to accommodate the gradually diminishing perturbation, leading to the emergence of aftereffects.”</p>
<p>We also revised the Discussion section “Mapping operates as memory-based in some people, structure-based in others”, to clarify the processes of interpolation and extrapolation (lines 689-700). This revision helps explain why mapping may generalize to a ramp-up faster than learning a perturbation perceived in the opposite direction (when considered together with the explanation that mapping operates relative to the new recalibrated equilibrium) In the former case (generalize to a ramp-up), a structure-based mapping can use the extrapolation computation: it leverages previous knowledge of which gait parameters should be modified and how – e.g., modulating the positioning our right foot to be more forward on the treadmill – but must extrapolate the specific parameter values – e.g., how more far forward. In the latter case (learning a perturbation perceived in the opposite direction), even a structure-based mapping would need to figure out what gait parameters to change completely anew – e.g., modulating the positioning of the foot in the opposite way, to be less forward, requires a different set of control policies.</p>
<p>We mentioned above that this illustration of the mapping mechanism relies on the assumption that the additional learning of the mapping mechanism in the second half of the Ramp Down is negligible. As part of our revisions for the “Modelling analysis for perceptual realignment”, we developed a new model – the perceptuomotor recalibration + mapping model (PM-ReMap) that extends the recalibration + mapping model by accounting for the possibility that Δ motor output is not constant in the second half of the Ramp Down (main points are at lines 355-275, and Figure 5; see response to Reviewer #1 (Public review), Comment 4, for a detailed explanation). We find that performance of the PM-ReMap model does not exceed that of the simpler recalibration + mapping model, suggesting that the Δ motor output does not change substantially in the second half of the Ramp Down. Note that, if the Δ motor output decayed in this phase, it could be due to forgetting or unlearning of the recalibration mechanism, or also it could be due to the mapping mechanism learning in the opposite direction than it did in adaptation. In the Results section, we focused on describing recalibration forgetting/unlearning for simplicity. However, in the Discussion section “Mapping may underly savings upon re-exposure to the same or different perturbation”, we explain in detail how the motor aftereffects also depend on the mapping mechanism learning in the opposite direction, as corroborated by our Control experiments and previous work. Therefore, the finding that the PM-ReMap model performance does not exceed that of the simpler recalibration + mapping model suggest that both effects – recalibration forgetting/unlearning and opposite-direction-learning of mapping – are not significant, nor is their combined effect on the Δ motor output.</p>

<p>(2) A more minor point, but given the sample size it is hard to be convinced about the individual difference analysis for structure learning (Figure 5). How clear is it that these two groups of subjects are fully separable and not on a continuum? The lack of clusters in another data set seems like a somewhat less than convincing control here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed an additional analysis – a silhouette analysis – to confirm the presence of these clusters in our data (Methods, lines 1070-1072). The results, reported in Experiment 2 Results, lines 487-490, confirmed that there is strong evidence for the presence of these clusters:</p>
<p>“A silhouette analysis confirmed strong evidence for these clusters: the average silhouette score was 0.90, with 19 of 20 participants scoring above 0.7 – considered strong evidence – and one scoring between 0.5 and 0.7 – considered reasonable evidence (Dalmaijer et al., 2022; Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990; Rousseeuw, 1987).”</p>

<p>(2) Line 649: in reaching the calibration system does respond to different error sizes; why not here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion. Similar to reaching adaptation, the recalibration in walking adaptation also scales based on the error size experienced in adaptation. What we meant to convey is that, once a calibration has been acquired in adaptation, the recalibration process is rigid in that it can only change gradually. So if we jump the perturbation to a different value, the original calibration is transiently used until the system has the time to recalibrate again. For example, if we jump abruptly from the adaptation perturbation to a perturbation of zero in postadaptation, the adaptation calibration persists resulting in aftereffects.</p>
<p>We revised the manuscript to clarity these points. First, we explicitly report that forward model recalibration scales based on the error size experienced in adaptation:</p>
<p>“We next compared Medium Descend and Small Abrupt (1m/s or 0.4m/s perturbation), and found that recalibration contributed significantly more for the smaller perturbation (larger <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> / <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor-total</sub> in Small Abrupt than Medium Descend, Fig. 8A middle and Table S6).” (Control experiments Results, lines 422-425)</p>
<p>“the mapping described here shares some characteristics with explicit mechanisms, such as flexibility and modulation by error size” (Discussion, lines 630-631)</p>
<p>Additionally, we leverage the framework proposed by Tsay et al., 2024, to improve our explanation of the characteristics of the different learning mechanisms. Please refer to our response to “Reviewer #1 (Public review)”, Comment (1).</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Why exactly does the &quot;perturbation&quot; in Figure 3 have error bars?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In walking adaptation, the perturbation that participants experienced is closely dictated by the treadmill belt speeds, but not exactly, because participants are free to move their feet as they like, so that their ankle movement may not always match the treadmill belts exactly. Therefore, we record the perturbation that is actually experienced by each participant’s feet using markers. We then display the mean and standard error of this perturbation.</p>
<p>We moved the equation describing the perturbation measure from the Methods to the Experiment 1 Results (lines 131-133, Eq. 1-3). We believe this change will help the reader understand the measures depicted.</p>
