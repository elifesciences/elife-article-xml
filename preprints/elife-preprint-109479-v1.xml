<abstract><p>Polyphenolic compounds are widely explored for health benefits, including hypertension, but their active ingredients, molecular targets, and mechanisms remain poorly defined. We identify the xanthone Mangostin from <italic>Garcinia mangostana</italic> as a potent modulator of several potassium channels, with large-conductance K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channels as its primary target for vasorelaxation. Mangostin activated BK channels as α subunits alone, in complexes with vascular β1 subunits, and in reconstituted BKα/β1–Ca<sub>v</sub> nanodomains. It shifted BK voltage activation to more negative potentials by antagonizing channel closure and promoting channel opening without markedly altering Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity. Docking, competition, single channel analysis and mutagenesis localized the binding site in the pore cavity below the SF, involving gating-critical S6 residues I308, L312, and A316, and suggest that Mangostin stays bound in closed and open states. These findings establish BK channel activation as the core molecular mechanism driving Mangostin’s vascular effects and define its structural mode of action, informing nutraceutical safety assessment and BK-targeted drug design.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nutraceuticals (superfoods, dietary supplements, and traditional remedies) promise a plethora of health benefits that are usually not definitely proven by clinical studies. Well-known examples are resveratrol present in grapes and red wine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Jang <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brown <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>), carotenes and tocopherols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study Group, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hennekens <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Xin <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), or the recent resurgence of quercetin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Di Pierro <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). In evaluating clinical relevance and explore pharmacological opportunities of such phytochemicals, obstacles are often the identification of the biologically active substance in complex matrices of plant secondary metabolites and the lack of a definite cellular determinant that could link a biologically active substance to a physiological process. However, a clear molecular target and mechanism of action that can explain its effects is the prerequisite to further drug development.</p>
<p>Natural polyphenols are known to modulate diverse potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channel families. For example, various members of the flavonoid subgroup activate K<sub>Ca</sub> (BK) channels as well as several K<sub>v</sub>, K<sub>ir</sub>, and K<sub>2P</sub> channels, including TREK-1 channels ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gierten <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Nardi and Olesen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kim, Kang and Han, 2011</xref>); for a comprehensive review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Richter-Laskowska <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>)). A recent study suggested that α-Mangostin, a xanthone from <italic>Garcinia mangostana,</italic> modulates ion channels and binds in the pore cavity of TREK K<sub>2P</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). α- and γ-Mangostins are the main xanthones found in the mangostane fruit pericarp, whose ethanolic extracts are used as traditional medicine and consumed as nutraceuticals. They are thought to exert a plethora of health-promoting effects, such as cardioprotective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Eisvand <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), analgesic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Kong, Jia and Jia, 2022</xref>), antiinflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), antidiabetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">John <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), antifibrotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), antimicrobial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tatiya-Aphiradee, Chatuphonprasert and Jarukamjorn, 2016</xref>), and antiproliferative effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Majdalawieh <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Interestingly, very recent research reported that α-Mangostin has antihypertensive properties, and it decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a rat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Earlier studies had demonstrated the relaxation of aortic rings upon Mangostin incubation, but remained somewhat contradictory as to the site of action and the molecular target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chairungsrilerd <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tep-Areenan and Suksamrarn, 2012</xref>). Hence, the molecular mechanism of this antihypertensive effect of Mangostin remains unclear.</p>
<p>Major potassium channels present in vascular smooth muscle are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated BK channels, also known as MaxiK, Slo1 or K<sub>Ca</sub>1.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wu and Marx, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Tykocki, Boerman and Jackson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Pereira da Silva <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). They are synergistically activated by intracellular calcium (Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup>) and voltage, and they play a crucial role in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone, with implications for blood pressure regulation. BK channels act as feedback regulators which counteract depolarization and balance the elevation of Ca <sup>2+</sup> through voltage-dependent L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The pore-forming BKα subunit is expressed ubiquitously, and tissue specific properties are conveyed by regulatory β-, γ-, and LINGO subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Latorre <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gonzalez-Perez and Lingle, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dudem <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). In vascular smooth muscle cells, BKα assembles with the β1 subunit, which enhances its apparent Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> sensitivity, decreases voltage sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dworetzky <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brenner <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Orio and Latorre, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Li and Yan, 2016</xref>), and modulates its pharmacological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">McManus <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hanner <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Structurally, BK channels are homotetramers consisting of the pore-forming α subunits with 7 transmembrane segments (S0-S6), a linker region, and two intracellular RCK domains. The RCK domains and their interface to the transmembrane segments contain different Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> binding sites, S1-S4 comprise the voltage sensing domain, and S5 and S6 together with the pore helix constitute the pore domain. Both depolarization or Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> elevation can open the pore via allosteric mechanisms, and this regulation as well as the modulation by mutations, small molecules, and regulatory subunits can be described well by an allosteric gating model ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Horrigan and Aldrich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Latorre <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>)). However, the structural determinants that underlie this allosteric modulation remain unclear. The S6 segment has been shown to undergo conformational changes during activation, and several gating sensitive residues as well as modulator binding sites for molecules of surprisingly different chemical structure are known in this pore region or the adjacent linker to the cytoplasmic C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Nardi and Olesen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhou, Xia and Lingle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Roy <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hoshi, Xu, <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen, Yan and Aldrich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Webb <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hoshi and Heinemann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schewe <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rockman, Vouga and Rothberg, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gonzalez-Sanabria <italic>et al</italic>., 2025</xref>). Investigations of the activation mechanism indicated that these substances act without directly affecting the voltage- or Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensory domains, probably by modifying the close interactions of S5 and S6 with the voltage sensor bundle and the gating ring that enable opening of the channel.</p>
<p>Small molecule BK channel activators are promising to treat diverse diseases like fragile X syndrome, overactive bladder, pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstruction, erectile dysfunction, and reperfusion injury; however, no prospective drug successfully completed a phase III trial yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bentzen <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barenco-Marins <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ferraguto <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Therefore, adding a pharmacophore derived from the xanthone group may aid in developing future drug candidates.</p>
<p>We used a combination of functional studies in cultured cells and vascular tissue as well as molecular docking to show that BK channels are a molecular target of Mangostins and that they mediate vascular relaxation observed upon Mangostin application. BK channels were opened most prominently among the K<sup>+</sup> channel representatives tested and were activated by α-Mangostin as well as by an extract of the mangosteen pericarp marketed as a nutraceutical. Investigation of the activation mechanism showed that α-Mangostin essentially facilitates BK channel activation by shifting its voltage dependence, modulating gating kinetics, and enhancing the open probability, without changing the Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> sensitivity. These effects were due to direct binding to the pore-forming BKα subunit. Competition experiments, molecular docking, and scanning mutagenesis identified the binding region in S6 just below the selectivity filter (SF). Mangostin activation was preserved in reconstructed nanodomains with Ca<sub>v</sub> channels, which cause local elevation of intracellular Ca <sup>2+</sup>, mimicking the physiological situation in smooth muscle cells. Finally, we show that BK channels specifically mediate relaxation of aortic preparations from mice. Our study explains the molecular activation of BK channels by a natural xanthone and sheds light on the mechanism underlying one of its claimed health benefits.</p>

<title>α-Mangostin particularly activates BKα and BKα/β1 channels</title>
<p>In previous studies, α-Mangostin was shown to activate members of the K<sub>2P</sub> channel family, while other K<sup>+</sup> channels were inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">2023</xref>). We aimed to obtain a broader pharmacological profile of α-Mangostin in K<sup>+</sup> channels and we investigated members of all six subfamilies of K<sub>2P</sub> channels as well as representatives of the K<sub>v</sub> and K<sub>ir</sub> channel families. Confirming the previous studies, we observed a strong activation of TREK-1 K<sub>2P</sub> channels (fold change 10.33 ± 1.64; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>) and inhibition of TRESK K<sub>2P</sub> channels as well as K<sub>v</sub>1.3 channels by ≈50% and ≈60 %, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref> and <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>). Furthermore, we identified three additional targets of α-Mangostin: strongly inhibited were the K<sub>2P</sub> members TWIK-1<sup>m</sup> (≈88 %), TWIK-2<sup>m</sup> (≈50 %), and TASK-3 (≈80 %) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref> and <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>). In contrast, BK channels were most potently activated, with a fold change of 20.41 ± 2.39 for BKα channels and of 24.42 ± 3.85 for BKα/β1 channels, which is the complex predominantly present in smooth muscle cells of the vasculature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, C</xref>). This suggested that BK channels, especially the BKα/β1 heteromer, could be the molecular target mediating the vasorelaxant Mangostin effects reported in above studies.</p>

<p>The preparations from <italic>Garcinia mangostana</italic> plants that are consumed as ‘nutraceuticals’ contain an unstandardized mixture of secondary plant metabolites, among them other Mangostin derivatives. Therefore, we also investigated their modulatory effect on TREK-1, BKα and BKα/β1 currents (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The very similar γ-Mangostin activated BKα channels with slightly higher efficacy (fold change of 38.54 ± 4.8) than TREK-1 and BKα/β1 channels (fold change of 11.35 ± 1 and 29.32 ± 5.03). Interestingly, the dietary supplement (solubilized equivalent to 10 µM α-Mangostin) activated TREK1, BKα and BKα/β1 channels comparably to pure α-/γ-Mangostin (fold change of 9.18 ± 2.74, 19.98 ± 2.99 and 20.92 ± 3.49; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), highlighting that mangostane xanthones retain their activity in such extracts.</p>
<p>The application of different α-Mangostin concentrations resulted in a fast and dose-dependent activation of BKα and BKα/β1 channels, with a similar apparent EC<sub>50</sub> of 3.16 ± 1.13 µM and 2.57 ± 1.32 µM, suggesting that the potency of α-Mangostin is not affected by the presence of the β1-subunit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). However, we frequently noticed a decline of currents at concentrations &gt;12 µM and limited solubility of higher Mangostin concentrations, which may imply that the actual maximal activation could not be reached.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>α-Mangostin shifts the voltage activation of BKα and BKα/β1 channels to more negative values</title>
<p>Having established the prominent activation of BKα and BKα/β1 channels by α-Mangostin, we wanted to gain more insight into its activation mechanism. The open probability of BK channels is controlled by voltage signals, calcium signals, or shift of the closed-open equilibrium (e.g. by mutations or modulators), and the current further depends on the single channel amplitude and the time the channel adopts an open conductive state. We therefore investigated these aspects of BK channel gating in macroscopic and single-channel measurements.</p>
<p>As we already observed in the ramp measurements, the threshold of BK voltage activation was shifted to more negative potentials upon α-Mangostin application (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Therefore, we first examined if α-Mangostin affects the voltage activation of BK channels. We used a step protocol over a range of potentials followed by a repolarization step to elicit tail currents in symmetrical bi-ionic conditions where intracellular K<sup>+</sup> was replaced with Cs<sup>+</sup> to reduce the strong outward currents in whole-cell experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>; Cs<sup>+</sup> does not alter voltage activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Piskorowski and Aldrich, 2006</xref>)). We quantified the change in voltage activation induced by α-Mangostin by calculating the voltage of half-maximal activation (V<sub>½</sub>) from the Boltzmann fit of conductance-voltage (GV) relationships (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The application of 10 µM α-Mangostin caused a substantial left-shift of the V<sub>½</sub> by 53.08 ± 4.9 mV in BKα channels (from 110.45 ± 2.69 mV to 57.37 ± 3.6 mV). This effect was even more pronounced in smooth muscle-like BKα/β1 channels, where V<sub>½</sub> shifted by 82.42 ± 4.96 mV to more hyperpolarized voltages (from 147.25 ± 5.66 mV to 64.83 ± 4.25 mV). The slope of the Boltzmann fit was not different before and after α-Mangostin activation in both channels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, insets). Hence, BKα and BKα/β1 channels already opened at less depolarized voltages in the presence of α-Mangostin, whereas voltage activation itself was not affected.</p>

<title>α-Mangostin predominantly affects deactivation of BKα and BKα/β1 channels</title>
<p>An inspection of the currents elicited by the families of rectangle pulses shows that gating kinetics are altered in the α-Mangostin activated state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The shift in V<sub>½</sub> towards more negative potentials upon α-Mangostin activation could be caused either by an acceleration of channel activation, or by a slowing down of channel deactivation, or a combination of both. We therefore analyzed the kinetics of activation and deactivation by fitting monoexponential functions to the time course of outward and tail currents for the +100 mV pulse to obtain their time constants (τ). BKα channels are characterized by fast activating current and a fast deactivation visible as decay of the tail current, while the presence of the β1 subunit slows these kinetics down (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, bottom; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dworetzky <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>)). After application of 10 µM α-Mangostin, activation of BKα channels was moderately accelerated (1.7-fold) with a τ of activation of 7.96 ± 1.64 ms before and 4.71 ± 0.71 ms afterwards, while the τ for deactivation at -50 mV increased ≈7-fold from 0.9 ± 0.04 ms to 6.85 ± 1.11 ms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Again, this effect was more pronounced in the smooth muscle-like BKα/β1 channels, where activation was more that 5-fold faster with τ values of 63.76 ± 16.03 ms before and 12.36 ± 1.20 ms after α-Mangostin application. Deactivation kinetics were most affected with a substantial ≈27-fold increase in τ from 3.60 ± 0.16 ms to 95.6 ± 13.99 ms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results suggest that the mechanism of α-Mangostin action differentially affects gating transitions that are associated with activation and deactivation.</p>
<p>As BK channels can be massively activated by Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> under physiological conditions, we further obtained GV-relationships in the basal and in the activated state for higher Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> concentrations relevant in smooth muscle cells to test if α-Mangostin activation is independent of Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). α-Mangostin shifted the V<sub>½</sub> in 10 µM free Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> by 50.55 ± 9.13 mV to more negative potentials, comparable to the resting state with 0.1 µM free Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup>. However, in 1 µM Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> α-Mangostin the V<sub>½</sub> shift was slightly higher, resulting in a shift by 82.74 ± 10.17 mV. This is consistent with previous studies, as BKα channel gating is primarily voltage-driven at very low Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> concentrations and Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> driven at high concentrations, while in the low-micromolar range (i.e., around 1 µM), Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> binding sites are partially occupied, resulting in nonlinear gating where enhanced modulator effects can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cui, Cox and Aldrich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Magleby, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Clay, 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>α-Mangostin activation mechanism on single-channel and macroscopic current level</title>
<p>The marked slowing of deactivation visible as the slow tail current decay in macroscopic current recordings suggests that individual channels are open for longer periods of time in the presence of α-Mangostin. To investigate the effect of α-Mangostin on individual channels, we recorded single channel currents in excised inside-out patches from HEK293 cells in the presence of 100 nM free Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Under these conditions, the open probability (P<sub>o</sub>) of BK channels at a potential of +40 mV was very low (0.002 ± 0.0008), but rose to 0.77 ± 0.08 after activation by 10 µM α-Mangostin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) with only very brief closings (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, 1s inset). The single channel amplitude derived from the all-points-histogram was not different between basal and α-Mangostin activated states (9.18 ± 0.29 pA and 9.76 ± 0.26 pA; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). We constructed dwell time distributions to determine the differences in the duration that a single channel resides in the closed or open state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The Log closed dwell time distributions showed a large shift of the main component to shorter dwell times, from 2.38 ± 0.23 (237 ms) to -1.39 ± 0.36 (less than 0.1 ms). The open dwell time distribution revealed that the log open time was markedly reduced from -0.84 ± 0.45 to 0.8 ± 0.24 (i.e. from 0.14 ms to 6.28 ms). The fact that the open and closed times were both affected suggests that α-Mangostin can bind to the open and the closed state. Accordingly, application of α-Mangostin on closed BK-channels (at – 80mV) resulted in maximal activation with the first depolarization pulse, indicating that α-Mangostin reached its site of action during the closed period (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Localization of the α-Mangostin binding site</title>
<p>We recently described the polypharmacology of the class of negatively charged activators (NCA) in different potassium channels, specifically in TREK-1 and BK channels. The BK channel opener GoSlo-SR-5-6 also activated TREK-1 channels, while BL-1249 known as TREK/TRAAK channel opener, also activated BK channels. We identified their common binding site in the pore close to the fenestration of TREK-1 channels and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations predicted the equivalent binding site in the pore of BK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schewe <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). The question arose if α-Mangostin could also occupy this binding site, as in part suggested in a docking by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), who proposed that P183 and L304, which both are part of the NCA binding site, interact with α-Mangostin in TREK-1 channels. Therefore, we measured the dose-dependent α-Mangostin activation of TREK-1 wildtype channels and its ‘signature’ mutant of the fenestration, L304C. As expected, the apparent affinity is markedly reduced in the L304C mutant in the measurable concentration range (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2A</xref>). Quaternary ammonium ions are known to occupy the central cavity of K<sup>+</sup> channels as TREK-1 and BK just below the SF near the NCA binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Li and Aldrich, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Piechotta <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fan <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). In a competition experiment, we recorded dose-response relationships and determined theIC<sub>50</sub> value for Tetrapentylammonium (TPA) with and without preactivation by 10 µM α-Mangostin. The TPA IC<sub>50</sub> value increased ≈9-fold from 0.72 ± 0.64 µM to 6.33 ± 0.86 µM in the presence of α-Mangostin (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2B</xref>), showing that α-Mangostin was present in the pore and hindered the access of TPA to its binding site. Finally, cysteine scanning mutagenesis of residues in M2 and M4 revealed that mainly G181, I182, P182 on M2 and G308 in M4 were involved, while most M4 residues tested had intermediary effects (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2C</xref>), suggesting that the binding region of α-Mangostin between M2 and M4 overlaps with the NCA binding site identified with the help of BL-1249, but is not completely identical (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2D</xref>).</p>
<p>We next probed if α-Mangostin accesses the pore cavity of BKα channels, as in TREK channels, or binds elsewhere in the protein. We conducted a competition experiment as above and measured the dose-dependent inhibition by 0.1, 1 and 10 µM Tetrahexylammonium (THexA; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In the presence of α-Mangostin, the inhibition by THexA was clearly reduced, and the apparent THexA affinity (as estimated IC<sub>50</sub>) was steeply decreased ≈21-fold from 77.51 ± 5.53 nM to 1.64 ± 0.58 µM, showing that the presence of α-Mangostin hindered the access of THexA to its binding site. This is consistent with previous findings that GoSlo-RS-5-6, which binds in the BK pore, also competes with THexA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Roy <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Webb <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schewe <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). In contrast, the presence of BC5, an activator shown to bind at the interface between the transmembrane and intracellular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), did not interfere with THexA binding (estimated THexA IC<sub>50</sub> 45.60 ± 8.05 nM; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>At least one hydroxyl group of α-Mangostin is predicted to be negatively charged in physiological pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2025</xref>), therefore we tested the impact of solution pH on the activation potency. Indeed, the shift in V<sub>½</sub> induced by 10 µM α-Mangostin was pH-dependent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In pH 6, the shift was reduced to 34.71 ± 5.63 mV, while it increased to 75.97 ± 2.02 mV in pH 8.5, indicating that the negative charge is critical for effective activation and α-Mangostin might resemble an NCA-like compound.</p>
<p>In addition, we used molecular docking to determine the location of a possible binding site in the BKα inner pore. We obtained 20 poses which were all located at the cavity wall in middle S6 between residues I308 and V319, in a pocket below the SF, without obstructing the central passageway for K<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3</xref>). Three poses were clustered with a binding energy of -8.58 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, where the hydrophobic core was wedged in between S6 and S6 of the adjacent subunit. For the best pose, possible molecular interactions were predicted for the residues I308, L312, F315 and A316 in S6 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>; <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
<p>To functionally investigate the predicted binding site, we mutated residues in the pore-lining S6 helix with side chains facing into the cavity. Many substitutions in this region affect gating of BK channels and are involved in intersubunit S6-S6 contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhou, Xia and Lingle, 2011</xref>). Therefore, we chose only substitutions that were most WT-like with respect to Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> and voltage sensitivity, i.e., I308A, L312M, A316P for the hits from the docking, and additionally S317R and Y318S as internal controls that were not predicted to be part of the binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen, Seebohm and Sanguinetti, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen, Yan and Aldrich, 2014</xref>). We first assessed the shift in voltage activation induced by 10 µM α-Mangostin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, E</xref>). V<sub>1/2</sub> shifts of Y318S and S317R were not or only moderately different compared to the wildtype channel (41.46 ± 5.17 mV and 34.33 ± 3.37 mV). In contrast, the three mutants I308A, L312M, and in particular A316P had a markedly reduced shift in V<sub>1/2</sub> (19.97 ± 3.12 mV, 27.89 ± 5.42 mV, and 4.56 ± 1.23 mV, respectively). To ensure that the almost absent shift in A316P was not caused by a general disruption of allosteric signal transduction, we also included A316G, which showed a reduction in V<sub>1/2</sub> comparable to I308A and L312M (23.57 ± 2.05 mV).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we tested GoSlo-SR-5-6 as alternative activator, which was shown to bind in the same pore region involving A316 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Webb <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schewe <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Like for α-Mangostin, I308A and A316P reduced the shift in V<sub>½</sub> induced by 1 µM GoSlo-SR-5-6 from 42.71 ± 3.05 mV to 25.89 ± 4.05 and 25.0 ± 2.8 mV; however, A316P did not abolish GoSlo-SR-5-6 activation, showing that the complete loss of activation for α-Mangostin was likely caused primarily by a loss of binding and not by an inference of the mutation with the drug transduction mechanism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Hence, we conclude that α-Mangostin binds to and activates BKα channels via the upper S6 segment, critically involving residues I308, L312, and A316.</p>

<title>α-Mangostin activation in BK-Ca<sub>v</sub> nanodomains</title>
<p>In resting smooth muscle cells, there is no BK channel activation within their physiological voltage range. However, in native tissue, BK channels are organized in nanodomains together with Ca<sub>v</sub> channels that can generate an increase in Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> concentration in the range of several orders of magnitude in their vicinity, allowing BK channels to open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Shah, Guan and Yan, 2022</xref>). This BK-Ca<sub>v</sub> complex can be restored in heterologous expression systems, and, as the intracellular solution contains 5 mM EGTA to suppress an overall increase of Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup>, BK channels will activate only when nearby Ca<sub>v</sub> channels cause a high local Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berkefeld <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berkefeld and Fakler, 2008</xref>). BKα/β1 channels expressed alone therefore produced virtually no current upon stepwise depolarization to +50 mV (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref>), but could be activated by α-Mangostin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). In BKα/β1-Ca<sub>v</sub> complexes, Ca<sup>2+</sup> inward currents were elicited, which allowed BKα/β1 channels to open in a more negative voltage range, and these BKα/β1 currents were further enhanced by 10 µM α-Mangostin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). The α-Mangostin-activated current through BKα/β1 channels in the Ca<sub>v</sub> complexes (as difference between BKα/β1-Ca<sub>v</sub> currents before and after activation) was activated at more negative potentials than in BKα/β1 channels alone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Hence, α-Mangostin could potentiate BKα/β1 channel currents upon local Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> increase through nearby Ca<sub>v</sub>-channels, as it could occur upon a Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> spike in a cell.</p>

<title>α-Mangostin relaxes vascular tissue in aortic preparations via BK channels</title>
<p>Cardiovascular benefits of Mangostins could arise from vasodilatory effects leading to a reduction of blood pressure. Years ago, a study reported that γ-Mangostin, in which the methoxy group of α-Mangostin is exchanged for a hydroxyl group, induced relaxation of rat aortic rings, but no molecular target was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tep-Areenan and Suksamrarn, 2012</xref>). We sought to demonstrate that Mangostin-induced vasorelaxation of native vascular tissue is indeed mediated by BK channels. Aortic preparations from mice were equilibrated at a contraction force of 2-3 mN and subsequently precontracted half-maximally with 100 nM noradrenaline. The application of 10 µM α-Mangostin quickly and efficiently induced relaxation, while relaxation was absent or greatly attenuated when the specific BK channel inhibitor Iberiotoxin (IbTx) was applied for 5-6 minutes before α-Mangostin was administered (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). In total, α-Mangostin reduced the normalized contraction force of the preparations by more than 85 % (to 0.16 ± 0.08) compared to the precontracted state, while it did not change after IbTx application alone (1.04 ± 0.002) or after preblock of BK channels (0.78 ± 0.12), proving that BK channels must mediate the vasodilative effect seen upon Mangostin treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We provide mechanistic insight into how a natural xanthone compound modulates BK channels, which are major players in vascular function. α-Mangostin activates BK channels by shifting their voltage sensitivity and slowing deactivation, with lesser effects on activation and marked effects on Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> sensitivity. We show that binding of α-Mangostin is state-independent, and we provide evidence for a binding site in the gating-sensitive S6 segment.</p>

<title>Mangostin binds to closed and open channels and promotes the open state</title>
<p>BK channel P<sub>o</sub> is controlled by Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup>, voltage, a shift of the closed-open equilibrium of the pore domain, or a combination of those stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cui, Cox and Aldrich, 1997</xref>). Mangostin shifted the voltage activation curve to more negative potentials, meaning an increased open probability at negative voltages. The slope of the GV-relationship was not changed neither in homomeric BKα nor in the smooth muscle BKα/β1 channels, indicating that voltage sensitivity itself was not directly affected by α-Mangostin. Shifts in the V<sub>½</sub> values induced by α-Mangostin were present over a wide range of Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 µM), which implies that the closed-open equilibrium is shifted towards the open state by a mechanism distinct from Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> sensing, or that at least the Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> sensing mechanism is not likely to contribute significantly to α-Mangostin activation. The higher shift observed in in 1 µM Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> likely reflects the known non-linear gating features that result from pronounced allosteric coupling of voltage and Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> signals in this concentration range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cui, Cox and Aldrich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Magleby, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Clay, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sun and Horrigan, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The activation can be mainly explained by the marked slowing of the deactivation time constants. Consistently, the mean open dwell time was increased in the single channel measurements, while we observed no change in amplitude with and without α-Mangostin (corresponding to a conductance of ≈240 pS). The impact on open as well as closed dwell time distributions and the instantaneous activation of macroscopic currents from the closed state suggest that the molecule binds state-independently.</p>
<p>In the presence of the β1 subunit, which is present in vascular BK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Knaus <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>), the activation characteristics were enhanced. The activation time course was little affected in BKα channels, but in BKα/β1 channels an acceleration of the activation caused by α-Mangostin became more prominent, counteracting the slow activation kinetics brought by the β1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">McManus <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>). Additionally, the slow deactivation time course in the presence of the β1 subunit was further slowed down remarkably. As the affinity (as estimated EC<sub>50</sub>) was very similar and the binding site is located in the S6 segment in the inner pore, the stronger shift in the V<sub>½</sub> value is likely not due to changes in binding, but caused by an enhanced shift of the closed-open equilibrium toward the open state, such as the stabilization of the voltage sensor in an active conformation. Such β-subunit dependent effects have also been reported for other modulators, e.g., DHS-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">McManus <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Giangiacomo <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>), DHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hoshi, Tian, <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), arachidonic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Martín <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>),17β-Estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Valverde <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), and some GoSlo compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Large <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>The binding site of α-Mangostin includes residues in the gating-sensitive S6 segment</title>
<p>We demonstrated the presence of α-Mangostin in the channel pore by competition for binding with quaternary ammonium ions known to bind below the SF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Li and Aldrich, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fan <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), and, predicted by molecular docking, identified residues in the S6 segment that are part of the binding site.</p>
<p>α-Mangostin binds in the cleft formed by the S6 helices of adjacent subunits, and substitution of the nonpolar residues I308, L312, and especially A316 most strongly reduced the shift in V<sub>½</sub> induced by α-Mangostin. All residues are known to participate in gating: they are part of a hydrophobic network within S6 that acts as hinge upon channel opening, and polar substitutions strongly favor the open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhou, Xia and Lingle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen, Yan and Aldrich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hite, Tao and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>). L312 has further been shown to stabilize intersubunit interaction with F315, whose destruction opens the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The α-Mangostin binding region overlaps with the reported binding site of the NCA GoSlo-SR-5-6, where L312, A316, S317 and V319 are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Webb <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schewe <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), but it is not identical. When we functionally investigated the α-Mangostin binding site close to the fenestration in TREK-1 channels, we also found only a partial overlap with key residues involved in the NCA binding site. Interaction with P183 and L304 was consistent with an earlier molecular docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), but the strongest reduction of activation was found for residues in M2 rather than M4.</p>

<title>Mechanism of Mangostin activation</title>
<p>We expect that small structural or electrostatic changes in this gating-sensitive region strongly affect the closed–open equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhou, Xia and Lingle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen, Yan and Aldrich, 2014</xref>). Previous studies suggest several alternative mechanisms by which α-Mangostin could induce channel opening. We have shown that NCAs bind to a region below the selectivity filter (SF) in several K<sup>⁺</sup> channels, such as K<sub>2P</sub> (e.g., TREK), hERG, or BK channels to induce channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schewe <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). We speculated that the negative charge common to these activators might alter SF ion occupancy via an electrostatic mechanism, thereby promoting SF opening. Our finding that the potency of α-Mangostin depends on pH suggests that a negative charge may also be critical for its activation mechanism. However, the importance of the SF for BK gating remains unresolved. Furthermore, α-Mangostin also did not increase the single-channel conductance as seen for NCAs in TREK-2 channels, which are known to be gated at the SF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schewe <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the contribution of the SF to the Mangostin effect requires further investigation. Alternatively, α-Mangostin binding to the gating-critical S6 region could induce gating at a putative lower gate; however, such a gate is currently speculative, as the available BK structures lack clear evidence for a lower gate (but the final closed state may still be elusive) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hite, Tao and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tao, Hite and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the concepts of an SF gate or a lower gate, hydrophobic gating has been proposed as an alternative gating mechanism in BK channels. MD simulations suggest that the pore of metal-free (presumably closed) BK structures undergoes dewetting, whereas the pore of metal-bound (presumably open) structures remains hydrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Jia <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gu and de Groot, 2023</xref>). Thus, binding of negatively charged α-Mangostin might prevent or antagonize dewetting of the hydrophobic cavity and thereby stabilize the conductive pore state. Indeed, a recent MD study suggested that the NCA NS11021, a smooth muscle relaxant with a biarylthiourea structure, can enter the dewetted BK pore to promote hydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Rockman, Vouga and Rothberg, 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Nordquist, Jia and Chen, 2024</xref>). However, the same MD simulations also indicated that NS11021 has no stable binding pose but engages in various hydrophobic interactions with pore-cavity residues. In contrast, our results suggest a more stable binding pose with specific interactions, as inferred from our mutagenesis data. Clearly, further work is required to elucidate the mechanism of BK channel gating and the exact way Mangostin and other NCAs modulate this process to promote channel activation.</p>

<title>Activation of BK channels in nanodomains and relaxation of aortic tissue</title>
<p>Our data demonstrate that Mangostin is able to potentiate Ca<sub>v</sub>-induced BK currents, and that Mangostin-activated BK channels are responsible for relaxation of mouse vascular tissue, explaining the reduction of blood pressure reported in a recent animal study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>We reconstructed nanodomains of BK and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels, as e.g. present in arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berkefeld <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Tykocki, Boerman and Jackson, 2017</xref>). In smooth muscle cells, BK activation is strictly coupled to changes in Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup>. Physiological Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup> concentrations lie between 100 nM in the resting state, 0.4-1 µM upon activation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilizing receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Savineau and Marthan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hill-Eubanks <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), and up to several ten micromolar (10-40 µM) when sparks form locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">ZhuGe <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berkefeld, Fakler and Schulte, 2010</xref>). Transient outward currents through activated BK channels then act as negative feedback, repolarize the cell and terminate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Shah, Guan and Yan, 2022</xref>). We demonstrated that the α-Mangostin activated current is potentiated by the coupling to Ca<sub>v</sub> channels. BKα/β1 currents in in the physiological voltage range of smooth muscle cells (-50 - -30 mV) would be very small in resting Ca<sub>i</sub><sup>2+</sup>, while the P<sub>o</sub> would be already very high when exceeding 10 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, leaving less room for activation. α-Mangostin would particularly impact potentiation of BK currents upon physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation (i.e. between 1 and 10 µM) and would synergistically lower the BKα/β1 activation threshold to enhance the negative feedback mechanism.</p>
<p>Accordingly, our investigation of precontracted aortic tissue from mice showed a remarkable and robust relaxation after application of α-Mangostin. Such relaxation of aortic rings after application of α- or γ-Mangostin were reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chairungsrilerd <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tep-Areenan and Suksamrarn, 2012</xref>) but the exact molecular target remained inconsistent. Given the strong activation of BK channels and as the relaxation was absent upon preincubation with the selective inhibitor IbTx in our experiments, BK channels must represent the molecular target of Mangostins in vascular smooth muscle cells.</p>
<p>Interestingly, relaxation was also reported for other xanthone derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cheng and Kang, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Capettini <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Câmara <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Diniz <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), which legitimates further research of substituted xanthones as pharmacophore. Robust data of bioavailability and the existence and nature of active metabolites are currently lacking. A small study claimed that α-Mangostin was bioavailable in humans after supplement ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kondo <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Animal research analyzed metabolites and showed that maximal plasma concentrations are reached 1 hour after oral intake in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ramaiya <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Petiwala <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Han <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). However, no metabolites have been functionally investigated to help in optimization of the Mangostin pharmacophore; however, our finding that γ-Mangostin has a slightly higher potency in activating TREK-1 and BKα channels may be a starting point.</p>
<p>Our screen across different K<sup>+</sup> channel families revealed that other representatives of the K<sub>2P</sub> (TWIK-1 and TASK-3) were particularly inhibited by more than 60 %. This could also link other claimed benefits of Mangostin to their molecular targets. Importantly, hERG currents were unaffected, mitigating the cardiotoxicity risk upon consumption of Mangostin nutraceuticals. BK channel function is decreased in chronic conditions that are often associated with the lack of a balanced diet and age, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Tykocki, Boerman and Jackson, 2017</xref>). Consequences as increased vascular tone and hypertension, ultimately leading to reduced cardiovascular health and premature death, may therefore be addressed with Mangostin xanthones as a potential new class of BK channel activators.</p>

Fitmaster (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) was used to generate GV-relationships and fits with the Boltzmann function, and for the monoexponential fits to obtain activation and deactivation time constants. EC<sub>50</sub> / IC<sub>50</sub> values were obtained by fitting a Hill equation to the dose-response data using IgorPro (v6.3.7; WaveMetrics, Portland, USA) or Prism (v8.4.3; Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, USA).

With I<sub>0</sub>, basal current; I<sub>max</sub>, activated current; c, concentration; c<sub>½</sub> EC<sub>50</sub> / IC<sub>50</sub>; h, Hill coefficient. Statistical analysis was conducted with the built-in functions of Prism. If data were not normally distributed, nonparametric tests were used. Variances were compared with F-tests. Two means were then compared with a paired or unpaired t-test. Three or more groups were compared using one-way ANOVA when variances and standard deviation were considered equal by Bartlett’s test, otherwise the Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA was applied. Dunnett’s T3 post-hoc test was used to account for multiple comparisons in ANOVA, and Dunn’s post-hoc test was used for non-parametric tests. Data and statistical tests are reported in supplementary tables for each figure. Symbols for P values are used in the figures as follows: *** (P &lt;0.001), ** (P ≤0.01), * (P ≤0.05), ns (P ≥0. 05).</p>
<p>Structures were visualized with PyMOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Schrodinger LLC, 2015</xref>) and figures were assembled with Inkscape v1.3 (GNU General Public License, v3).</p>

<p>The present manuscript by Cordeiro et al., shows <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that α-mangostin, a xanthone obtained from the fruit of the Garcinia mangostana tree, behaves as a strong activator of the large-conductance (BK) potassium channels; macroscopic currents and single-channel experiments show that α-mangostin produces an increase in the probability of opening, without affecting the single-channel conductance. The authors put forward that α-mangostin activation of the BK channel is state-independent, and molecular docking and mutagenesis suggest that α-mangostin binds to a site in the internal cavity. Additionally, the authors show that α-mangostin can relax arteries, further suggesting the plausibility of the proposed effects of this compound. These are <bold>valuable</bold> findings that should be of interest to channel biophysicists and physiologists alike.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors aimed to identify the molecular target and mechanism by which α-Mangostin, a xanthone from Garcinia mangostana, produces vasorelaxation that could explain the antihypertensive effects. Building on prior reports of vascular relaxation and ion channel modulation, the authors convincingly show that large-conductance potassium BK channels are the primary site of action. Using electrophysiological, pharmacological, and computational evidence, the authors achieved their aims and showed that BK channels are the critical molecular determinant of mangostin's vasodilatory effects, even though the vascular studies are quite preliminary in nature.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The broad pharmacological profiling of mangostin across potassium channel families, revealing BK channels - and the vascular BK-alpha/beta1 complex - as the potently activated target in a concentration-dependent manner.</p>
<p>(2) Detailed gating analyses showing large negative shifts in voltage-dependence of activation and altered activation and deactivation kinetics.</p>
<p>(3) High-quality single-channel recordings for open probability and dwell times.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present manuscript, Cordeiro et al. show that α-mangostin, a xanthone obtained from the fruit of the Garcinia mangostana tree, behaves as an agonist of the BK channels. The authors arrive at this conclusion through the effect of mangostin on macroscopic and single-channel currents elicited by BK channels formed by the α subunit and α + β1sununits, as well as αβ1 channels coexpressed with voltage-dependent Ca2+ (CaV1,2) channels. The single-channel experiments show that α-mangostin produces a robust increase in the probability of opening without affecting the single-channel conductance. The authors contend that α-mangostin activation of the BK channel is state-independent and molecular docking and mutagenesis suggest that α-mangostin binds to a site in the internal cavity. Importantly, α-mangostin (10 μM) alleviates the contracture promoted by noradrenaline. Mangostin is ineffective if the contracted muscles are pretreated with the BK toxin iberiotoxin.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The set of results combining electrophysiological measurements, mutagenesis, and molecular docking reveals α-mangostin as a potent activator of BK channels and the putative location of the α-mangostin binding site. Moreover, experiments conducted on aortic preparations from mice suggest that α-mangostin can aid in developing drugs to treat a myriad of diverse diseases involving the BK channel.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) Although the results indicate that α-mangostin is modifying the closed-open equilibrium, the conclusion that this can be due to a stabilization of the voltage sensor in its active configuration may prove to be wrong. It is more probable that, as has been demonstrated for other activators, the α-mangostin is increasing the equilibrium constant that defines the closed-open reaction (L in the Horrigan, Aldrich allosteric gating model for BK). The paper will gain much if the authors determine the probability of opening in a wide range of voltages, to determine how the drug is affecting (or not), the channel voltage dependence, the coupling between the voltage sensor and the pore, and the closed-open equilibrium (L).</p>
<p>(2) Apparently, the molecular docking was performed using the truncated structure of the human BK channel. However, it is unclear which one, since the PDB ID given in the Methods (6vg3), according to what I could find, corresponds to the unliganded, inactive PTK7 kinase domain. Be as it may, the apo and Ca2+ bound structures show that there is a rotation and a displacement of the S6 transmembrane domain. Therefore, the positions of the residues I308, L312, and A316 in the closed and open configurations of the BK channel are not the same. Hence, it is expected that the strength of binding will be different whether the channel is closed or open. This point needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>(1) From Figure 3A, it is apparent that the increase in Po is at the expense of the long periods (seconds) that the channel remains closed. One might suggest that α-mangostin increases the burst periods. It would be beneficial if the authors measured both closed and open dwell times to test whether α-mangostin primarily affects the burst periods.</p>
<p>(2) In several places, the authors make similarities in the mode of action of other BK activators and α-mangostin; however, the work of Gessner et al. PNAS 2012 indicates that NS1619 and Cym04 interact with the S6/RCK linker, and Webb et al. demonstrated that GoSlo-SR-5-6 agonist activity is abolished when residues in the S4/S5 linker and in the S6C region are mutated. These findings indicate that binding of the agonist is not near the selectivity filter, as the authors' results suggest that α-mangostin binds.</p>
<p>(3) The sentence starting in line 452 states that there is a pronounced allosteric coupling between the voltage sensors and Ca2+ binding. If the authors are referring to the coupling factor E in the Horrigan-Aldrich gating model, the references cited, in particular, Sun and Horrigan, concluded that the coupling between those sensors is weak.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This research shows that a-mangostin, a proposed nutraceutical, with cardiovascular protective properties, could act through the activation of large conductance potassium permeable channels (BK). The authors provide convincing electrophysiological evidence that the compound binds to BK channels and induces a potent activation, increasing the magnitude of potassium currents. Since these channels are important modulators of the membrane potential of smooth muscle in vascular tissue, this activation leads to muscle relaxation, possibly explaining cardiovascular protective effects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present evidence based on several lines of experiments that a-mangostin is a potent activator of BK channels. The quality of the experiments and the analysis is high and represents an appropriate level of analysis. This research is timely and provides a basis to understand the physiological effects of natural compounds with proposed cardio-protective effects.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The identification of the binding site is not the strongest point of the manuscript. The authors show that the binding site is probably located in the hydrophobic cavity of the pore and show that point mutations reduce the magnitude of the negative voltage shift of activation produced by a-mangostin. However, these experiments do not demonstrate binding to these sites, and could be explained by allosteric effects on gating induced by the mutations themselves.</p>
