<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The hippocampus executes crucial functions from declarative memory to adaptive behaviors associated with cognition and emotion. However, the mechanisms of how morphogenesis and functions along the hippocampal dorsoventral axis are differentiated and integrated are still largely unclear. Here, we show that <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> genes are distinctively expressed in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, respectively. The loss of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> results in ectopic CA1/CA3 domains in the ventral hippocampus. The deficiency of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> leads to the failed specification of dorsal CA1, among which there are place cells. The deletion of both <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes causes almost agenesis of the hippocampus with abnormalities of trisynaptic circuit and adult neurogenesis. Moreover, <italic>COUP-TFI</italic>/<italic>-TFII</italic> may cooperate to guarantee appropriate morphogenesis and function of the hippocampus by regulating the <italic>Lhx5-Lhx2</italic> axis. Our findings revealed a novel mechanism that <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> converge to govern the differentiation and integration of distinct characteristics of the hippocampus in mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Memory, including declarative and nondeclarative memory, unifies our mental world to ensure the quality of life for people of all ages, from newborns to elderly individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eichenbaum &amp; Cohen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kandel, Dudai, &amp; Mayford, 2014</xref>). The pioneering studies of Milner and her colleagues revealed that the hippocampus is required for declarative memory but not nondeclarative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Penfield &amp; Milner, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scoville &amp; Milner, 1957</xref>). The discovery of activity-dependent long-term potentiation and place cells provides the neurophysiological basis of hippocampal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bliss &amp; Lomo, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">O’Keefe &amp; Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>). The rodent hippocampus can be divided into the dorsal and ventral domains, corresponding to the posterior and anterior hippocampus in humans, respectively. In recent decades, numerous studies have supported the Moser theory that the hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure with distinct characteristics of gene expression, connectivity, and functions along its dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bast, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fanselow &amp; Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Moser &amp; Moser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Strange, Witter, Lein, &amp; Moser, 2014</xref>). The dorsal hippocampus, which connects and shares similar gene expression with the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fanselow &amp; Dong, 2010</xref>), serves the “cold” cognitive function associated with declarative memory and spatial navigation. The ventral hippocampus, which connects and generates similar gene expression with the amygdala and hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cenquizca &amp; Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kishi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pitkanen, Pikkarainen, Nurminen, &amp; Ylinen, 2000</xref>), corresponds to the “hot” affective states related to emotion and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fanselow &amp; Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tyng, Amin, Saad, &amp; Malik, 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, to date, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the morphogenesis, connectivity, and functions along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus are differentiated and integrated are largely unknown.</p>
<p>The hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe structure in the adult rodent forebrain, originates from the medial pallium (MP) in the medial line of the early dorsal telencephalon. The cortical hem (CH), which is located ventrally to the MP, functions as an organizer for hippocampal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hébert &amp; Fishell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Schuurmans &amp; Guillemot, 2002</xref>). It has been demonstrated that both extrinsic signals, such as <italic>Wnts</italic> and <italic>Bmps</italic>, and intrinsic factors, including <italic>Emx1</italic>, <italic>Emx2</italic>, <italic>Lef1</italic>, <italic>Lhx2</italic>, and <italic>Lhx5</italic>, are involved in the regulation of early morphogenesis of the hippocampus. As the earliest <italic>Wnt</italic> gene to be exclusively expressed in the cortical hem, <italic>Wnt3a</italic> is required for the genesis of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">S. M. Lee, Tole, Grove, &amp; McMahon, 2000</xref>); in addition, <italic>Lef1</italic> is downstream of Wnt signaling, and the hippocampus is completely absent in <italic>Lef1-neo/neo</italic> null mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Galceran, Miyashita-Lin, Devaney, Rubenstein, &amp; Grosschedl, 2000</xref>). Wnt signaling is essential for early development of the hippocampus. <italic>Emx1</italic> and <italic>Emx2</italic> are mouse homologs of <italic>Drosophila empty spiracles</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Simeone et al., 1992</xref>). Interestingly, the dorsal hippocampus is smaller in an <italic>Emx1</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yoshida et al., 1997</xref>), while <italic>Emx2</italic> is required for the growth of the hippocampus but not for the specification of hippocampal lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tole, Goudreau, Assimacopoulos, &amp; Grove, 2000</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Lhx5</italic>, which encodes a LIM homeobox transcription factor and is specifically expressed in the hippocampal primordium, is necessary for the formation of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>Lhx2</italic>, encoding another LIM homeobox transcription factor, is required for the development of both the hippocampus and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mangale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Monuki, Porter, &amp; Walsh, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Porter et al., 1997</xref>). Intriguingly, deficiency of either <italic>Lhx5</italic> or <italic>Lhx2</italic> results in agenesis of the hippocampus, and more particularly, these genes inhibit each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hébert &amp; Fishell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mangale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Roy, Gonzalez-Gomez, Pierani, Meyer, &amp; Tole, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>), indicating that the <italic>Lhx5</italic> and <italic>Lhx2</italic> genes may generate an essential regulatory axis to ensure the appropriate hippocampal development. Nevertheless, whether there are other intrinsic genes that participate in the regulation of morphogenesis and function of the hippocampus has not been fully elucidated.</p>
<p><italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes, including <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> (also known as <italic>NR2F1</italic>) and <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> (also known as <italic>NR2F2</italic>), encode two transcription factor proteins belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yang, Feng, &amp; Tang, 2017</xref>). Mutations of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> are highly related to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), such as intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bertacchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Contesse, Ayrault, Mantegazza, Studer, &amp; Deschaux, 2019</xref>), and mutations of the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene are associated with congenital heart defects (CHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">High et al., 2016</xref>). By using animal models, our studies and others have demonstrated that <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes participate in the regulation of the development of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> plays an essential role in the differentiation of cortical excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons, the development of the dorsal hippocampus, and cortical arealization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Armentano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bertacchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Del Pino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">J. Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Flore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lodato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">C. Zhou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">C. Zhou, Tsai, &amp; Tsai, 2001</xref>). <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> plays a vital role in the development of the amygdala, hypothalamus, and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">S. Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim, Takamoto, Yan, Tsai, &amp; Tsai, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tang, Rubenstein, Tsai, &amp; Tsai, 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, whether and how <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and/or <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> genes regulate the differentiation and integration of hippocampal morphogenesis, connectivity, and function is still largely unclear.</p>
<p>Here, our data show that <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and -<italic>TFII</italic> genes are differentially expressed along the dorsoventral axis of the postnatal hippocampus. The loss of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> results in ectopic CA1 and CA3 domains in the ventral hippocampus. In addition, the deficiency of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> leads to not only dysplasia of the dorsal hippocampus but also failed specification and differentiation of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neuron lineage. Furthermore, the deletion of both genes in the <italic>RXCre</italic>/+; <italic>COUP-TFI<sup>F/F</sup></italic>; <italic>COUP-TFII<sup>F/F</sup></italic> double mutant mouse causes almost agenesis of the hippocampus, accompanied by compromised specification of the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) domains. The components of the trisynaptic circuit are abnormal in the corresponding single-gene or double-gene mutant model. Moreover, <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes may cooperate to guarantee the appropriate morphogenesis and function of the hippocampus by regulating the <italic>Lhx5-Lhx2</italic> axis.</p>

<title>Differential expression profiles of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> genes along the dorsoventral axis in the developing and postnatal hippocampus</title>
<p>To investigate the functions of the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> genes in the hippocampus, immunofluorescence staining was first performed to examine their expression in wild-type mice at postnatal month 1 (1M). In both the coronal and sagittal sections, COUP-TFI exhibited a septal/dorsal high-temporal/ventral low expression pattern along the hippocampus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Aa, d, c, f, g, j, m, i, l</xref>, and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">o</xref>), and its expression is highest in the dorsal CA1 region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Aa, d, c, f, j</xref>, and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">l</xref>), where place cells are mainly located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">O’Keefe &amp; Conway, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">O’Keefe &amp; Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>), and the dorsal DG, where there are adult neural stem cells (NSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gould &amp; Cameron, 1996</xref>). However, the expression of COUP-TFII was high in the temporal/ventral hippocampus but was barely detected in the septal/dorsal part of the hippocampus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ab, c, e, f, h, i, k, l, n</xref>, and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">o</xref>). The dorsal-high COUP-TFI and ventral-high COUP-TFII expression profiles were further verified in the postnatal hippocampi at 1M by western blotting assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ap, q</xref>). At embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5), COUP-TFI was detected in the dorsal pallium (DP) laterally and COUP-TFII was expressed in the MP and CH medially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Aa-b</xref>). At E11.5 and E12.5, the expression of COUP-TFII remained in the CH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ac-d, Bb-c</xref>). Interestingly, COUP-TFI and -TFII generated complementary expression patterns in the hippocampal primordium with COUP-TFI in the dorsal MP and COUP-TFII in the ventral CH at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ba-f</xref>). Additionally, septal/dorsal-high COUP-TFI and temporal/ventral-high COUP-TFII expression patterns were observed at postnatal day 0 (P0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Bg-l</xref>). The data above revealed that the differential expression patterns of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> genes were generated and maintained along the dorsoventral axis in the early hippocampal primordium, the developing and postnatal hippocampus, indicating that they could play distinct roles in the mediation of the morphogenesis and functions of the hippocampus.</p>

<p>Next, to investigate the roles of <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes in the hippocampus, an <italic>RXCre</italic> mouse was used to excise the expression of the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and/or <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Swindell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). The deletion efficiency of RXCre recombinase was verified by immunofluorescence assays. Compared with control mice, either <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> or <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> could be excised in the postnatal hippocampus of corresponding single-gene mutants at 1M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ca-i</xref>). In addition, compared with control mice, both the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> genes were almost completely deleted in the hippocampal primordium in mutant mice at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Cj-o</xref>). Since the LacZ expression serves as an indicator for the deletion of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Swindell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tang et al., 2012</xref>), we performed immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against COUP-TFII and LacZ on the sagittal sections of <italic>RXCre/+; COUP-TFII<sup>F/+</sup></italic> and <italic>RXCre/+; COUP-TFII<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice at E11.5. COUP-TFII was readily detected at the hippocampal primordium of the heterozygous mutant embryo at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Da, c, g</xref>); in contrast, the expression of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> was significantly reduced in the homozygous mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Dd, f, j</xref>). In addition, compared with the heterozygous mutant embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Db-c, h</xref>), the LacZ signals clearly increased in the hippocampal primordium of the homozygous mutant embryo at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1De-f, k</xref>), suggesting that RXCre recombinase can efficiently excise the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene in the hippocampal primordium as early as E11.5. Intriguingly, we observed that the expression of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> increased in the caudal hippocampal primordium of the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> homozygous mutant embryo at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Di, l</xref>), indicating that similar to the observations in the early optic cup (Tang et al., 2010), <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and -<italic>TFII</italic> genes could be partially compensate with each other in the developing hippocampal primordium. All the data above show that RXCre recombinase could efficiently excise <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and/or <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> in the early developing and postnatal hippocampus.</p>

<title>The <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene is required for the appropriate morphogenesis of the ventral hippocampus but not of the dorsal hippocampus</title>
<p>Given that the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene is highly and specifically expressed in the postnatal ventral hippocampus and the CH of the hippocampal primordium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we asked whether the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene is required for the appropriate morphogenesis of the hippocampus, particularly the ventral hippocampus. To answer this question, we conducted Nissl staining with samples from the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> single-gene (<italic>RXCre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFII<sup>F/F</sup></italic>or <italic>RXCre/+</italic>; <italic>CII<sup>F/F</sup></italic>) knockout mouse model. In coronal sections, compared with the control at 1M, the septal hippocampus was normal; unexpectedly, an ectopic CA-like region was observed medially in the temporal hippocampus in the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutant, where the prospective posterior part of the medial amygdaloid (MeP) nucleus was situated, indicated by the star (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ba-f</xref>). The presence of the ectopic CA-like region in the ventral but not dorsal hippocampus of the mutant was further confirmed by the presence of the prospective MeP and amygdalohippocampal area (AHi) in sagittal sections, as indicated by the star (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Bg-l</xref>). Furthermore, immunofluorescence assays were performed to verify whether specific lineages of the hippocampus were altered with sagittal sections, in which the subregions of both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus were well displayed and distinguished. Ctip2 is a marker for CA1 pyramidal neurons and DG granule neurons, and HuB is a marker for CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sugiyama, Osumi, &amp; Katsuyama, 2014</xref>). The dorsal hippocampus appeared normal in both the control and mutant mice at 1M (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ca-l</xref>). Nonetheless, compared with the observations in control mice, an ectopic HuB-positive CA3 pyramidal neuron lineage, indicated by the star, and a duplicated Ctip2-positive CA1 pyramidal neuron lineage, indicated by the arrowhead, were observed in the ventral hippocampal area in the mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ca-f, m-r</xref>), revealing that there were ectopic CA1 and CA3 lineages in the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>Consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Leid et al., 2004</xref>), the expression of Ctip2 was detected in the amygdala including the AHi and posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nucleus (PMCo); in addition, Ctip2 was also highly expressed in the dorsal part of the MeP (MePD) in the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Cb, n</xref>).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, compared with the controls at 1M, there were ectopic CA domains in the mutant ventral hippocampus with the expense of the Ctip2 positive AHi and MePD amygdaloid nuclei (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ce, q</xref>), indicated by the arrows. Clearly, all the data above suggested that the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene is necessary to ensure the appropriate morphogenesis of the ventral hippocampus.</p>
<p>At early embryonic stages, <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> was preferentially expressed in the CH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1— figure supplement 1Ab, d, 1Bb, e</xref>), the organizer of the hippocampus, and at postnatal 1-month-old (1M) stage, <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> was also highly expressed in some amygdala nuclei such as the AHi and medial amygdaloid nucleus, which are adjacent to the ventral/temporal hippocampus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ae, h, n</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). We would like to investigate the correlation of the CH and/or amygdala anlage with the duplicated ventral hippocampal domains in the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutant in detail in our future study. The observations above suggest that <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> is not only specifically expressed in the ventral hippocampus but is also required for morphogenesis and probably the function of the ventral hippocampus. Since the ventral hippocampus participates in the regulation of emotion and stress, mutations in the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene lead to CHDs, and the formation of the ventral hippocampus is disrupted in <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutant mice at 1M, we wondered whether CHD patients with <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutations also exhibit symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia.</p>

<title>The <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> gene is required for the specification and differentiation of the dorsal CA1 identity</title>
<p>Next, we asked whether the deletion of the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> gene by <italic>RXCre</italic> also affected the development of the hippocampus.

Then, we asked whether the loss of the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> gene caused abnormal specification and differentiation of hippocampal lineages. Compared with the control mice, <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> mutant mice had fewer HuB-positive CA3 pyramidal neurons, as indicated by the star; intriguingly, Ctip2-positive CA1 pyramidal neurons failed to be detected, as indicated by the arrowhead, with Ctip2-positive DG granule neurons unaltered in the dorsal hippocampus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Ba-l</xref>). The loss of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neuron identity in mutant mice was further confirmed by Wfs1, another dorsal CA1 pyramidal neuron-specific marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Takeda et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Ca-r</xref>). Nonetheless, the HuB-positive and Ctip2-positive lineages were comparable in the ventral hippocampus between the control and mutant mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Ba-f, m-r</xref>), even though the low expression of COUP-TFI was detected there. Indeed, <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> is not only expressed at the highest level in the dorsal CA1 but is also required for the specification and differentiation of dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons, among which place cells are essential for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">O’Keefe &amp; Conway, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">O’Keefe &amp; Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>).</p>

<p>Given that dysplasia of the dorsal hippocampus was generated in both the <italic>Emx1Cre</italic> and <italic>RXCre</italic> models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Flore et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Aa-l</xref>), we asked whether the development of dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons was also abolished in <italic>Emx1Cre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFI<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice. To answer this question, immunofluorescence staining was conducted first. Compared with that in the control mice, the proportions of either the Wfs1- or Ctip2-positive CA1 domain were reduced in the mutant mice at 3M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Aa-h</xref>), indicating that the differentiation of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons was also compromised in the <italic>Emx1Cre</italic> model, although it was less severe than that in the <italic>RXCre</italic> model. To make our findings more consistent with previous studies, we further conducted experiments with the <italic>Emx1Cre</italic> model. Afterward, to investigate the fine structure of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons, Golgi staining was performed. Compared with those of control mice, the numbers of secondary dendrites and branch points of both the apical and basal dendrites were significantly reduced in the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons of mutant mice at 3M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure 2— figure supplement 1Ba-e</xref>). Then, the dorsal hippocampus-related spatial learning and memory behavior test, the Morris water maze, was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vorhees &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>).

<title>The <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> genes coordinate to ensure the genesis of the hippocampus</title>
<p>Given that the loss of either <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> or <italic>-TFII</italic> leads to dysplasia of the dorsal or ventral hippocampus, respectively, we asked whether these genes compensate for each other to regulate the morphogenesis of the hippocampus.

Nonetheless, the reason for the lethality of the double-mutant mice is still unknown. Nissl staining data showed that compared with that of control mice, the septal hippocampus was severely shrunken, as indicated by the star, and the temporal hippocampus was barely observed in the double-mutant mouse brains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Aa-h</xref>). Unexpectedly, an ectopic nucleus was observed in the region of the prospective temporal hippocampus, indicated by the arrowhead, in the double-mutant mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Ag-h</xref>). In addition, compared with those of controls, the regions with HuB-positive CA3 pyramidal neurons and Ctip2-positive or Prox1-positive DG granule neurons were diminished in the double mutants; in particular, Ctip2-positive dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons could not be detected in the double mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Ba-l</xref>). Furthermore, compared with the domains of controls, no HuB-positive, Ctip2-positive, or Prox1-positive domains could be detected in the prospective temporal hippocampus in the double mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Ca-l</xref>).

To answer this question, the components of the trisynaptic circuit were characterized in the ventral hippocampus of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutants, the dorsal hippocampus of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> mutants, and the septal hippocampus of double mutants. Calretinin is a marker of mossy cells, Calbindin is a marker of mossy fibers, and SMI312 is a marker of Schafer collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Flore et al., 2017</xref>). Compared with those of controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Aa, b, e, f, i</xref>, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">j</xref>), the numbers of Calretinin-positive mossy cells were reduced, Calbindin-positive mossy fibers were longer but thinner, and SMI312-positive Schafer collaterals were thinner and discontinued in the ventral hippocampus of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutants at 1M (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Ac, d, g, h, k</xref>, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">l</xref>). In addition, similar to the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Flore et al., 2017</xref>), the numbers of Calretinin-positive mossy cells were decreased, Calbindin-positive mossy fibers were shorter and thinner, and SMI312-positive Schafer collaterals were barely detected in the dorsal hippocampus of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Ac, d, g, h, k</xref>, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">l</xref>), compared with those of controls at 1M (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Ba, b, e, f, i</xref>, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">j</xref>).

<title>The expression of several essential regulatory genes associated with early hippocampal development was abnormal in double mutants</title>
<p>Given that the hippocampus was almost completely diminished in double mutants, we asked how <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes participated in the regulation of the early morphogenesis of the hippocampus. To answer this question, total RNA isolated from the whole telencephalons of control (n=5) and double-mutant-(n=3) embryos at E11.5 was used to generate cDNA, and then real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays were performed.

Consistent with RT-qPCR data, the expression of Lhx2 was comparable between the control and double-mutant mice at E11.5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Be-h, e’-h’</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of the Lhx2 protein was increased in the hippocampal primordium in the <italic>COUP-TF</italic> double-mutant mice at E13.5 and E14.5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Bm-p, m’-p’, u-x, u’-x’</xref>). The upregulation of Lhx2 expression is most likely associated with the reduced expression of the <italic>Lhx5</italic> gene.</p>

<p>Next, we asked whether neural precursor cells (NPCs), intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs), or newborn neurons were affected in the early development of the hippocampus in double-mutant mice. Sox2 is a marker for NPCs, Tbr2 is a marker for IPCs, and NeuroD1 is a marker for newborn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yu, Marchetto, &amp; Gage, 2014</xref>). The expression of Sox2 in the hippocampal regions was comparable between the control and double-mutant mice at E14.5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Ca-d, a’-d’</xref>), indicating that the generation of NPCs was normal. Nevertheless, compared with the control embryos, the numbers of Tbr2-positive IPCs and NeuroD1-positive newborn neurons were reduced in the double-mutant embryos (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Ce-l, e’-l’</xref>), and the reduction was significant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Our observations were consistent with previous findings in <italic>Lhx5</italic> null mutant mice that the specification of the hippocampal NPCs was normal, but the later differentiation event was abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>). All the data above suggest that <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes may cooperate to ensure the early morphogenesis of the hippocampus by regulating the appropriate expression levels of <italic>Lhx5</italic> and <italic>Lhx2</italic> genes.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our present study, we observed dorsal-high COUP-TFI and ventral-high COUP-TFII expression profiles in the postnatal hippocampus. The deletion of the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene led to duplicated CA1 and CA3 domains of the ventral hippocampus. The loss of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> resulted in the failed specification and differentiation of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neuron lineage with a diminished dorsal hippocampus. Furthermore, the deficiency of both <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes caused atrophy of almost the entire hippocampus, accompanied by compromised generation of the CA1, CA3, and DG identities. In addition, the dorsal trisynaptic components, ventral trisynaptic components, or entire trisynaptic components were abolished in the corresponding <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> gene mutant, <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene mutant, or <italic>COUP-TFI</italic>/<italic>-TFII</italic> double-gene mutant mice. Moreover, <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes may cooperate to ensure the appropriate morphogenesis and function of the hippocampus by regulating the <italic>Lhx5-Lhx2</italic> axis.</p>

<label>1.</label><title><italic>COUP-TFII</italic> governs the distinct characteristics of the ventral hippocampus</title>
<p>Sixty years ago, the pioneering work of Milner and her colleagues discovered the essential role of the hippocampus in declarative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Penfield &amp; Milner, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scoville &amp; Milner, 1957</xref>). Recently, accumulating evidence has supported the Moser theory that the hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure with distinct characteristics of gene expression, connectivity, and function along its dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bast, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fanselow &amp; Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Moser &amp; Moser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Strange et al., 2014</xref>). The dorsal hippocampus marked in blue, in which gene expression is similar to the neocortex, serves the “cold” cognitive function associated with declarative memory and spatial navigation, and the ventral hippocampus marked in red, in which gene expression is close to the hypothalamus and amygdala, corresponds to the “hot” affective states related to emotion and anxiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The ventral hippocampus generates direct connectivity with the amygdala, hypothalamus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cenquizca &amp; Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hoover &amp; Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kishi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pitkanen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Roberts et al., 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, thus far, the molecular and cellular mechanism of how the morphogenesis, connectivity, and function of the ventral hippocampus is achieved has been largely unclear.</p>
<p><italic>COUP-TFII</italic>, a nuclear receptor gene associated with heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">High et al., 2016</xref>), was highly and exclusively expressed in the ventral hippocampus in 1-month-old mice and was expressed ventrally in the CH of the hippocampal primordium in mouse embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Ea</xref>), indicating that the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene may participate in the regulation of the development and function of the ventral hippocampus. First, deficiency of the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene led to the duplication of the CA1 and CA3 domains of the ventral hippocampus but not the dorsal hippocampus, which was confirmed both morphologically and molecularly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Second, the formation of the trisynaptic circuit was specifically abolished in the ventral hippocampus of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that the intrahippocampal circuit, information transfer, and function of the ventral hippocampus could be compromised. Third, the ventral hippocampus generates neural circuits with the mPFC, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and hypothalamus, which are associated with anxiety/behavioral inhibition, fear processing, pleasure/reward seeking, and the neuroendocrine system, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anacker &amp; Hen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baik, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bryant &amp; Barker, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cenquizca &amp; Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Herman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kishi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">O’Leary &amp; Cryan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pitkanen et al., 2000</xref>). These ventral hippocampal projections may be important for processing information related to emotion and anxiety. Intriguingly, our previous studies revealed that <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> is required for the development of the hypothalamus, amygdala, and olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">S. Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">X. Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), all of which generate functional neural circuits with the ventral hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fanselow &amp; Dong, 2010</xref>). Particularly, both the hypothalamus and amygdala are also diminished in <italic>RXCre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFII<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">S. Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tang et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that their interconnectivities with the ventral hippocampus are abnormal. Thus, all the findings above suggest that <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> is a novel and essential intrinsic regulator that controls the morphogenesis, connectivity, and function of the ventral hippocampus.</p>
<p>Given that mutations of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> are highly associated with CHDs and are required for the distinct characteristics of the ventral hippocampus, we wondered whether CHD patients carrying mutations of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> also display symptoms of psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia, related to the ventral hippocampus. In our future study, we would like to generate hippocampus-specific or hippocampal subdomain-specific conditional knockout models to dissect distinct roles of the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene in the hippocampus, particularly in the ventral hippocampus, in detail.</p>

<p>The expression of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic>, another orphan nuclear receptor gene associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bertacchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Contesse et al., 2019</xref>), is high in the dorsal MP of the hippocampal primordium and is higher in the dorsal hippocampus than in the ventral hippocampus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Ea</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Flore et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with previous observations in <italic>Emx1Cre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFI<sup>F/F</sup></italic>mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Flore et al., 2017</xref>), the dorsal hippocampus but not the ventral hippocampus was specifically shrunken in <italic>RXCre/+; COUP-TFI<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> is expressed at the highest level in dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), indicating that the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> gene may play a role in the specification and differentiation of dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons. As expected, the expression of Ctip2 and Wfs1, two markers for dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons, could not be detected in the prospective dorsal CA1 domain in <italic>RXCre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFI<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>); furthermore, <italic>Emx1Cre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFI<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice partially phenocopied the compromised development of the dorsal CA1 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). It seems that the spatiotemporal activity of RXCre recombinase is better or broader than that of the Emx1Cre recombinase during the critical period of the specification of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neuron identity. In addition, the Golgi staining assay revealed that the development of the dendrites of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons was abnormal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure 2— figure supplement 1</xref>). All the observations above indicate that the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> gene is not only necessary for the morphogenesis of the dorsal hippocampus but is also required for the specification and differentiation of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons, among which there are place cells. The identification of place cells fifty years ago was one of the most important breakthroughs in understanding the role of the hippocampus in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">O’Keefe &amp; Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>). Except for spatial information, place cells in the dorsal CA1 may also encode nonspatial representations, such as time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eichenbaum, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lisman et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, 95% of patients carrying <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> mutations are associated with ID. Here, our observations support the notion that the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> gene is a novel intrinsic regulator that specifies the dorsal CA1 pyramidal cell identity, which will benefit the understanding of both neurophysiological functions of the hippocampus and the etiology of NDD including ID and ASD.</p>

<p>In wild-type mice, <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> genes generated complementary expression profiles in the embryonic hippocampal primordium with <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> in the dorsal MP, marked in green; <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> in the ventral CH, marked in red (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Ea</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); and in the postnatal hippocampus with high-COUP-TFI expression in the dorsal, marked in green; and high-COUP-TFII expression in the ventral, marked in red (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Ea</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These findings indicated that <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes may coordinate to regulate hippocampal development. Indeed, as discussed above, the loss of either <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> or <italic>-TFII</italic> only leads to dysplasia of the dorsal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Flore et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) or ventral hippocampus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), respectively; intriguingly, while both genes are efficiently excised by <italic>RXCre</italic> in the hippocampal primordium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), more severely shrunken hippocampi developed in the 3-week-old double knockout mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The dosage-dependent severity of hippocampal abnormalities suggested that two nuclear receptor genes, <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> could cooperate with each other to execute an essential and intrinsic function in the development of the hippocampus.</p>
<p>It is known that both extrinsic signals and intrinsic factors participate in the regulation of the early development of the hippocampus. Notably, mutations of <italic>Wnt3a</italic> and <italic>Lef1</italic> eliminate the entire hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Galceran et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">S. M. Lee et al., 2000</xref>). Given that the expression of <italic>Axin2</italic>, <italic>Lef1</italic> and <italic>Tcf4</italic>, three Wnt-responsive transcription factor genes, was not altered in the <italic>COUP-TF</italic> double mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), it is unlikely that abnormal Wnt signaling is the cause of the compromised hippocampus. <italic>Lhx5</italic> is specifically expressed in the hippocampal primordium and is required for the morphogenesis of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>Lhx2</italic> is necessary for hippocampal development by repressing cortical hem fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mangale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Monuki et al., 2001</xref>). Agenesis of the hippocampus is observed in either <italic>Lhx5</italic> or <italic>Lhx2</italic> null mutant mice, and these genes particularly repress each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hébert &amp; Fishell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mangale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Roy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>), indicating that the proper expression levels of <italic>Lhx5</italic> and <italic>Lhx2</italic> genes are critical to maintain the appropriate development of the hippocampus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Eb</xref>). The transcriptional and protein expression levels of <italic>Lhx5</italic> but not <italic>Lhx2</italic> were first reduced in the hippocampal primordium of <italic>COUP-TF</italic> double-mutant mice at E11.5; later, enhanced expression of the Lhx2 protein was detected in the hippocampal primordium of double-mutant mice at E13.5 and E14.5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref>). Moreover, the number of Lhx5-positive Cajal-Retzius cells was clearly reduced in the double mutant embryos at E11.5, E13.5 and E14.5; consistent with the observations in the <italic>Lhx5</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Miquelajáuregui et al., 2010</xref>), the generation of Sox2-positive hippocampal NPCs was not affected, but the development of Tbr2-positive IPCs and NeuroD1-positive newborn neurons was abnormal in <italic>COUP-TF</italic> double-mutant mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, our findings reveal a novel intrinsic regulatory mechanism that <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>COUP-TFII</italic>, two disease-associated nuclear receptor genes, may cooperate with each other to ensure proper hippocampal morphogenesis by regulating the <italic>Lhx5-Lhx2</italic> axis. Intriguingly, compared with the adult <italic>Emx1Cre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFI<sup>F/F</sup></italic>mutant mice, the hippocampus was much smaller in the adult <italic>Emx1Cre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFI<sup>F/F</sup></italic>; <italic>COUP-TFII<sup>F/F</sup></italic> double-gene mutant mice; nevertheless, both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus were readily detected in double-gene mutants with <italic>Emx1Cre</italic> (our unpublished observations). In addition, the discrepancy between the shrunken dorsal hippocampus associated with the loss of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and the duplicated CA domains of the ventral hippocampus associated with the deficiency of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> suggested that the regulatory network related to <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes during the early morphogenesis of the hippocampus could be much more complicated than suspected and should be investigated in our future study.</p>

<label>4.</label><title><italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes are imperative for the formation of the trisynaptic circuit</title>
<p>The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) are interconnected through various neural circuits to mediate the flow of the information associated with declarative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Basu &amp; Siegelbaum, 2015</xref>). Both direct and indirect glutamatergic circuits are involved in the relay of information from the EC to the hippocampal CA1, and the trisynaptic pathway is the most well-characterized indirect circuit. The EC sends sensory signals from association cortices via the perforant path to the DG, then the DG granule cells send excitatory mossy fiber projections to CA3 pyramidal neurons, and CA3 pyramidal neurons project to CA1 via the Schaffer collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">H. Lee, GoodSmith, &amp; Knierim, 2020</xref>). Consistent with the high expression of COUP-TFI in the dorsal hippocampus and COUP-TFII in the ventral hippocampus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), the dorsal trisynaptic circuit is specifically damaged in <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> mutants, as is the ventral trisynaptic circuit in <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutant mice. Moreover, the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit was almost completely absent in the double mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, and our unpublished observations). The information transfer associated with the trisynaptic circuits should be abolished particularly in the dorsal and/or the ventral hippocampus in the above corresponding genetic mouse models. Interestingly, <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> is also required to specify the medial EC cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">J. Feng et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the impaired formation and function of trisynaptic circuits could be caused by the abnormal development of CA1, CA3, DG or EC lineages. Nonetheless, given that newborn granule neurons are continuously generated in the adult DG to integrate into the existing neural circuits essential for declarative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Toda, Parylak, Linker, &amp; Gage, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tuncdemir, Lacefield, &amp; Hen, 2019</xref>) and that hippocampal adult neurogenesis was severely compromised in the <italic>COUP-TF</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we could not exclude the possibility that impaired adult neurogenesis may also contribute to the malformation and impaired function of the trisynaptic pathway in double mutants.</p>
<p>The hippocampus is heterogeneous along its dorsoventral axis, and either the dorsal or ventral hippocampus generates unique and distinguishable characteristics of gene expression and connectivity, which enable the hippocampus to execute an integrative function from the encoding and retrieval of certain declarative memory to adaptive behaviors. Lesions of the dorsal hippocampus, which are essential for the cognitive process of learning and memory, lead to amnesia and ID; while damage to the ventral hippocampus, which is central for emotion and affection, is highly associated with psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Our findings in this study reveal novel intrinsic mechanisms by which two nuclear receptor genes, <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and -<italic>TFII</italic>, which are associated with NDD or CHD, converge to govern the differentiation and integration of the hippocampus along the dorsoventral axis morphologically and functionally. Furthermore, our present study provides novel genetic model systems to investigate the crosstalk among the hippocampal complex in gene expression, morphogenesis, cell fate specification and differentiation, connectivity, functions of learning/memory and emotion/anxiety, adaptive behaviors, and the etiology of neurological diseases. Nevertheless, many enigmas, such as whether and how the abnormalities of either the dorsal or ventral hippocampus affect the characteristics of the other, remain unsolved. In addition to the excitatory lineages and circuits, interneurons and inhibitory circuits play vital roles in maintaining the plasticity and functions of the hippocampus. We also wonder whether and how defects in interneurons and inhibitory circuits could contribute to the compromised morphogenesis, connectivity, and functions of the hippocampus and the etiology of psychiatric and neurological conditions including ID, ASD, depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>We homogenized the isolated dorsal and ventral hippocampus tissues from 1-month-old mice respectively in the RIPA buffer (Applygen) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (Invitrogen) and then centrifuged at the speed of 12,000 rpm for 30 mins. We collected the supernatants and analyzed the total concentrations by the BCA kit (Applygen). Gradient SDS-PAGE gels were used to separate the same amounts of protein sample (40 μg/lane), and then the proteins were transferred to the PVDF membranes (Millipore). After being blocked by the 3% BSA (Sigma) for 2h, the membranes that contained proteins were incubated by primary antibodies at 4 °C O/N. The membranes were rinsed with 1×PBST three times for 10 mins and then treated with biotinylated secondary antibodies for 2h at RT. After washing with 1×PBST, membranes were treated with the HRP-conjugated streptavidin for 1h at RT. Finally, we used the chemiluminescence detection system (Tanon) to detect the bands. The density of the protein band was analyzed by the software Image J.</p>
<p>The primary antibodies were used in the experiment as below: mouse anti-COUP-TFI (1:2000, R&amp;D, Cat # PP-H8132-00), rabbit anti-COUP-TFII (1:3000, a gift from Dr. Zhenzhong Xu, Zhejiang University, China). The following secondary antibodies were applied in the study, including goat anti-mouse IgG biotin-conjugated (1:1000, KPL, Cat # 16-18-06), goat anti-rabbit IgG biotin-conjugated (1:1000, KPL, Cat # 16-15-06).</p>

<title>Golgi staining</title>
<p>Deep anesthesia was performed before sacrificing the control and mutant mice, and the brains were immediately isolated. The FD rapid GolgiStain kit (FD NeuroTech) was used to process the brain tissue samples, which were immersed in an equal volume of immersion solution mixed with solutions A and B and stored in the dark for two weeks at RT. At least 5mL of immersion solution was used for each cubic meter of the tissue. To achieve the best results, the container of tissue was gently swirled from side to side twice a week during the incubating period. Afterwards, the brain tissue was transferred to solution C in the dark at RT for at least 72 hours (up to 1 week). Finally, the tissues were cut into 100 μm thick slices with a cryostat at -20°C to -22°C and transferred to gelatin-coated microscope slides containing solution C using a sample retriever. The slices were dried naturally at RT. The concrete staining procedure of the kit was followed using the manufactory’s protocol. Then, the sections were rinsed twice with double-distilled water for 4 minutes each time. The slices were placed in a mixture of one volume of solution D, one volume of solution E, and two volumes of double distilled water for 10 minutes and were rinsed twice with distilled water for 4 minutes each time. The sections were later dehydrated in 50%, 75%, and 95% ethanol for 4 minutes respectively. Next, the slices were dehydrated in 100% ethanol 4 times for 4 minutes each time. Finally, the sections were cleared in xylene and mounted with a neutral resin medium.</p>

<title>Morris water maze</title>
<p>By recording the time spent by the mice swimming in the water tank and finding the escape platform hidden underwater, and the swimming trajectory, the Morris water maze test can objectively reflect the spatial learning and memory ability of the mice. We poured tap water into the water maze tank and added an appropriate amount of well-mixed, milky white food dye. The height of the liquid level was about 1 cm higher than the escape platform, and the water temperature was kept at about 25±1℃. At the same time, four markers of different shapes were pasted on the four directions of the inner wall above the water tank to distinguish different directions. The Morris water maze test was divided into the training phase and the probe trial phase. The training phase lasted for 6 days, 4 times a day, and the interval between each training was about 30 minutes. During training, the mice were placed into the tank from the entry points of four different quadrants facing the inner wall, and their latency was recorded from the time they entered the water to the time they found a hidden underwater platform and stood on it. After the mouse found the platform, we let it stay on the platform for 10 seconds before removing it. If the mouse failed to discover the platform 60 seconds after entering the water, it was guided to find the platform and left to stay for 10 seconds. Each mouse was placed into the water tank from four water entry points and recorded as one training session. The probe trial was carried out on the seventh day, and the underwater platform was removed. Each experimental mouse was put into the water tank at the same water entry point and allowed to move for 60 seconds. The time that each mouse spent in the quadrant, where the platform was originally placed, was recorded.</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>The number of specified immunofluorescent marker-positive cells was assessed by Image J Cell Counter in full image fields. Three brain sections per mouse were counted for each index. GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad) was used to perform statistical analysis. The data analysis used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Dunnett’s or Tukey’s post hoc tests, and student’s unpaired t-test. The data were expressed as the mean ± SEM. The data obtained from at least three independent replicates were used for statistical analysis. P&lt; 0.05 was considered the significant statistical difference.</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study demonstrating distinct roles for the nuclear receptor genes COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII in hippocampal development. The strength of evidence is <bold>compelling</bold>, using rigorous state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate functional redundancy of these genes in regulating the Lhx2/Lhx5 axis. The major strengths of the study are the dramatic morphogenic phenotypes, and the resultant altered gene networks. These findings have theoretical or practical implications beyond a single field, and will be of interest to geneticists, developmental neurobiologists and chromatin biologists among others.</p>

<p>The hippocampus is a structure in the cerebral cortex known to be compartmentalised into regions with different functions. Dorsal hippocampus is involved in cognitive functions such as declarative memory and spatial navigation and interconnects chiefly with the neocortex. Ventral hippocampus interconnects with limbic structures such as amygdala and hypothalamus and is involved in affective states and anxiety. What specifies this functional regionalisation during development is not well understood. The present study focuses on the role of transcription factors COUPTFI and COUPTFII, confirming a previously observed dorsal to ventral gradient of expression of COUPTFI in both embryonic and adult mouse hippocampus, and reporting that expression of COUPTFII is strongest in ventral hippocampus. The aim of the authors was then to probe the role of these transcription factors with the use of conditional knockout of one or both factors using RxCre+ mice (sometimes Emx1Cre+ for comparison). As predicted, COUPTFI insufficiency resulted in failure of the CA1 subregion of the dorsal hippocampus to develop properly (with concomitant loss of performance in a spatial memory task) COUPTFII knockdown had even more marked effects upon the ventral hippocampus with ectopic CA1/CA3 domains forming, while a double knockout lead to a drastic reduction in size of the hippocampus with subsequent effects upon the appearance of hippocampal synaptic circuitry and the capacity for adult neurogenesis (a feature of rodent hippocampus). In order to help explain the role of COUPTFI/II a role in regulating expression of two transcription factors LHX2 and LHX5, known to be crucial to hippocampal development, was tested by examining gene and protein expression. Changes in LHX2 and LHX5 was observed and a role for COUPTFI/II in regulating expression of these genes was postulated.</p>
<p>I believe the authors have largely achieved their aims and the results mostly support the conclusions, but, as discussed further below, there are some weaknesses in the data and some areas that could be expanded upon and improved. The methods are mostly appropriate. The use of the transgenic mice and the application of histological methods, especially tyramide amplified immunohistochemistry, is exemplary. However, I'm not sure a wide enough range of tests to explore the phenotype of the transgenic mice was employed to back the conclusions drawn by the authors. The introduction and discussion are nicely written and explain the general concepts and conclusions well. The work makes an important contribution to our understanding of brain development in general and hippocampal development in particular.</p>
<p>Turning to more specific comments, I must first point out that specification of the ventral hippocampus by expression of COUPTFII is not an entirely original finding, as it was suggested for the developing human hippocampus following immunohistochemical experiments illustrating COUPTFII expression to be confined to the ventral hippocampal structures of the medial temporal cortex (doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhx185). Of course, this study, unlike the present study, was restricted to fetal cortex, not adult, and also reported expression of COUP-TFI throughout dorsal and ventral hippocampal structures but without observing any dorsal to ventral gradient, however I feel its contribution to the field has been overlooked by the present study, and should be incorporated into the introduction and/or discussion.</p>
<p>More information about Rx-cre mice would be informative and could help explain the different phenotype observed when EMX1-cre mice were used to conditionally knock down COUPTFI/II expression.</p>
<p>The demonstration of antagonistic gradients of COUP-TFI and -TFII across the hippocampus is more convincing in the immunohistochemical preparations than in the western blots. The qualitative data presented in Fig.1p does not convincingly represent the quantitative data presented in Fig.1q. There seem to be multiple bands for COUP-TFII and I wonder exactly how quantifying this was approached?</p>
<p>Behavioural testing is limited to one test of dorsal hippocampus function. other tests for non-spatial memory, e.g. novel object recognition, or ventral hippocampus function, e.g. step through passive avoidance, might have lead to some interesting discriminations between the various knock down animals (see doi: 10.3389/fnagi.2018.00091).</p>
<p>Abnormalities in the trisynaptic circuit. No studies of actual synapses, either physiological or morphological, were carried out. I wonder to what extent these immunohistochemical studies just further reflect the abnormalities in hippocampal morphology presented earlier in the manuscript without specifically telling us about synaptic circuits? Although the immunohistochemical preparations are beautiful, they are inadequate on their own in telling us much about what sort of synaptic circuitry exists in the transgenic animals.</p>
<p>LHX2/LHX5 interaction. The immunohistochemical study, which shows clear differences in LHX5 and LHX2 protein expression at E14.5 in double knockdown mice is more convincing than the qPCR study at E11.5, which show surprisingly small differences in mRNA expression. Could the authors expand upon whether this is due to stage of development, or differences between mRNA and protein expression? Why hasn't both mRNA and protein expression data at both time points been presented?</p>
<p>Response to the re-submission</p>
<p>I am happy that the western blot presentation has been improved, and my minor comments attended to. It is disappointing, although understandable given the timeframe, that the lack of qPCR data at 14.5 ED has not been rectified. The immunohistochemical data alone is qualitative and only indicative of LHX5 expression remaining depressed and LHX2 expression possibly increasing between E11.5 and E14.5. In the absence of qPCR data, a more quantitative immunohistochemical study, such as counting blind the number of LHX5+ Cajal-Retzius cells, or measuring optical density of LHX2 expression under rigorous experimental conditions regarding image collection and processing, would be required to support the hypothesis that COUPTFI/II expression modulates the LHX2/LHX5 axis.</p>

<p>The Author's chose to limit their response to re-doing the Lhx5 immuno using the correct antibody which now displays the expected staining: Lhx5 expression is limited to the hem. They have not however presented a characterization of where the RxCre acts, although this was pointed out by other reviewers as well. It would have been useful to demonstrate the expression domain in particular with respect to the time of its initiation, to explain how it causes a phenotype close to that described for the Lhx5 knockout (Zhao et al., 1999). From the decrease of Lhx5 expression and the CR cells which arise from the hem, it appears that the RxCre does indeed act in the hem. However, the timing and spatial pattern is important to establish, as I had pointed out in my first review, &quot;If [the expression of RxCre] it has a dorso-ventral bias in the early embryo, it could explain the regional difference in the COUPTF phenotypes.&quot;</p>
<p>The major interpretive criticisms I made have not been addressed even though these would have only required a re-writing and re-interpretation of the data. The revised manuscript continues to include major errors of interpretation such as the idea that Lhx2 and Lhx5 &quot;inhibit each other&quot;, something that is unsupported since the expression domains of these two genes are mutually exclusive as is clear from the authors' own new data and the literature.Lines 355-360: &quot;The expression of Lhx2 was comparable between the control and double-mutant mice at E11.5 (Figure 5Be-h, e'-h'). Interestingly, the expression of the Lhx2 protein was increased in the hippocampal primordium in the COUP-TF double-mutant mice at E13.5 and E14.5 (Figure 5Bm-p, m'-p', u-x, u'-x'). The upregulation of Lhx2 expression is most likely associated with the reduced expression of the Lhx5 gene&quot;There's clearly no Lhx5 in the hippocampal primordium so how is this possible?</p>
<p>The authors have missed the insights from key papers that they cite, e.g. (lines 352-354) &quot; The expression of Lhx2 was expanded ventrally into the choroid plexus in the Lhx5 null mutant mice (Zhao et al., 1999)&quot; - this paper in fact shows there is no choroid plexus. Lhx2 appears to extend to the midline likely because the hem isn't specified. The authors would benefit from reading <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.25.513532">https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.25.513532</ext-link> in which Lmx1a is shown to be the master regulator of the hem.</p>
<p>
A sentence like (lines 77-81) further blurs the literature: &quot;Intriguingly, deficiency of either Lhx5 or Lhx2 results in agenesis of the hippocampus, and more particularly, these genes inhibit each other (Hébert &amp; Fishell, 2008; Mangale et al., 2008; Roy, Gonzalez-Gomez, Pierani, Meyer, &amp; Tole, 2014; Zhao et al., 1999), indicating that the Lhx5 and Lhx2 genes may generate an essential regulatory axis to ensure the appropriate hippocampal development&quot;</p>
<p>
First, none of the papers they cite shows that these two factors inhibit each other. Second, the &quot;agenesis of the hippocampus&quot; in the Lhx2 knockout mentioned in Porter et al. (1997) was later shown to be due to a transformation of the hippocampal primordium into an EXPANDED hem (Mangale et al.) In contrast, the &quot;agenesis of the hippocampus&quot; in the Lhx5 mutant appears to be due to the near-complete LOSS of the hem and evidenced by the loss of its derivatives, the choroid plexus and the CR cells (Zhao et al., 1999). The fact that loss of these two factors have opposite effects on the hem (each resulting in loss of the hippocampus, one due to transformation of the hippocampal primordium into hem and the other because of a lack of hipopcampal induction) does not mean that there is an Lhx5-Lhx2 &quot;axis&quot; regulating hippocampal development.</p>
<p>I won't repeat my other comments here, but the majority of them were not addressed in any way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I find it unfortunate that the authors have chosen not to use the detailed input provided by the reviewers which would have greatly improved their manuscript.</p>

<p>The authors have made significant improvements in addressing my major concerns raised during the previous review. However, I still have some lingering concerns regarding the quantification and statistical analysis presented in the manuscript. Specifically, there is a lack of robust quantification and statistical analysis to support the conclusions drawn, particularly in relation to the numbers of DG, CA1, and CA3 neurons.</p>
<p>To strengthen the validity and reliability of the findings, I would strongly recommend the authors to incorporate a more rigorous quantitative approach in their research. This could involve implementing stereological methods or other appropriate techniques to accurately estimate the numbers of neurons in the DG, CA1, and CA3 regions. By doing so, the authors would enhance the credibility of their conclusions and provide more solid evidence for their claims.</p>

<p>We agree. We will incorporate the previous discovery that COUPTFII expression is confined to the ventral hippocampus in early human fetal forebrain (doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhx185) in the discussion section of &quot;COUP-TFII governs the distinct characteristics of the ventral hippocampus&quot;.</p>

<p>Our data in Figure 4 show clearly that at the neural circuit level, compared with the corresponding control, the trisynaptic circuit is abnormal in all three models; therefore, in the discussion section of &quot;COUP-TF genes are imperative for the formation of the trisynaptic circuit&quot;, we will add the following sentence, &quot;We would like to investigate what sort of synaptic circuitry is compromised either physiologically or morphologically in the trisynaptic circuit of individual animal model in detail in the future studies.</p>

<p>1. Better presentation of the western blot results</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. Based on the suggestion, new information about the western blot results has been added in the revised Figure 1Ap. We added a dash to each western blot image to indicate the target band of COUP-TFI (46 KDa), COUP-TFII (45 KDa), and GAPDH (37 KDa), respectively. There were two bands in the blot of COUP-TFII, with the upper band corresponding to mouse IgG at 50 KDa, and the bottom band corresponding to COUP-TFII protein at 45 KDa. Therefore, only the lower bands of COUP-TFII are used for the quantitative analysis. The expression of COUP-TFII in the ventral hippocampus is clearly higher than that in the dorsal hippocampus.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Full presentation of the Immunohistochemistry and qPCR results for at E11.5 and E14.5 in double knockdown mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. Based on the suggestion, we added immunofluorescent data in the double knockout mice at E11.5 in the Figure 5Ba-h. Meanwhile, given that it takes time to prepare animal samples at E14.5 for RT-qPCR assays, we performed immunofluorescent assays at both E13.5 and E14.5 to make sure that the changes of Lhx5 and Lhx2 expression in the hippocampal regions between the control and mutant mice were consistent. As shown in the new Figure 5B, consistent with the downregulated expression of Lhx5 transcripts in the double mutant, the expression of the Lhx5 protein was reduced in the CH in the double mutants at E11.5; moreover, the numbers of Lhx5-positive Cajal-Retzius cells decreased in the double mutant embryos at E11.5, E13.5 and E14.5 (Figure 5Ba-d, a’-d’, a’’-d’’, i-l, i’-l’, q-t, q’-t’). Consistent with RT-qPCR data, the expression of Lhx2 was comparable between the control and double-mutant mice at E11.5 (Figure 5Be-h, e’-h’). Interestingly, the expression of the Lhx2 protein was increased in the hippocampal primordium in the COUP-TF double-mutant mice at E13.5 and E14.5 (Figure 5Bm-p, m’-p’, u-x, u’-x’). Please find the altered descriptions in the Page 15, lines 347-351, 353-358 and Page 21, lines 500-503 in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Minor corrections. Lines 159-162, prospected not quite the right word. I would suggest &quot;an ectopic CA-like region was observed medially in the temporal hippocampus in the COUP1TFII mutant, where the prospective posterior part of the medial amygdaloid nucleus was situated, (MeP), indicated by the star (Figure 1Ba-f). The presence of the ectopic CA-like region in the ventral but not dorsal hippocampus of the mutant was further confirmed by the presence of the prospective MeP and amygdalohippocampal area (AHi) in sagittal sections, as indicated by the star. See also line 251. Line437/438 I would suggest &quot;... most important breakthroughs in understanding the role of the hippocampus in memory.&quot;</p>

<p>1. It is also important to point out that the immunofluorescence data in Figure 5B is contrary to what is known for Lhx5 (it's not expressed in the neocortical and hippocampal vz) and Lhx2 (it's not expressed in the choroid plexus). Authors should explain how their conclusions could align more clearly, and consider the possibility that their results are due to a possible artifact of image setting issues or worse, antibody specificity issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Very good point. Based on the comments and suggestions, we first tested another Lhx5 antibody, R&amp;D, Cat # AF6290, in the immunofluorescence assays. Indeed, there was something wrong with the previous Lhx5 antibody, Millipore, Cat # AB5762. With the new Lhx5 antibody, consistent with the reported in situ data, the expression of Lhx5 was detected specifically in the CH at E11.5, and in the Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone of the telencephalon. The same Lhx2 antibody, Santa Cruz, Cat # sc-19344, which has been used successfully in one of our previous studies (Tang et al., Development, 2012) (PMID: 22492355), was used in the present study. We believe that the observations at the MP and DP of the samples are really associated with the expression of Lhx2 protein. We performed new immunofluorescence assays with the new Lhx5 antibody and confirmed with the Lhx2 antibody. As shown in new Figure 5B, consistent with the downregulated expression of Lhx5 transcripts in the double mutant, the expression of the Lhx5 protein was reduced in the CH in the double mutants at E11.5; moreover, the numbers of Lhx5-positive Cajal-Retzius cells decreased in the double mutant embryos at E11.5, E13.5 and E14.5 (Figure 5Ba-d, a’-d’, a’’-d’’, i-l, i’-l’, q-t, q’-t’). Consistent with RT-qPCR data, the expression of Lhx2 was comparable between the control and double-mutant mice at E11.5 (Figure 5Be-h, e’-h’). Interestingly, the expression of the Lhx2 protein was increased in the hippocampal primordium in the COUP-TF double-mutant mice at E13.5 and E14.5 (Figure 5Bm-p, m’-p’, u-x, u’-x’). Please find the changed descriptions in Page 15, lines 347-351, 353-358 and Page 21, lines 500-503 in the revised manuscript.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The expression domain of RxCre remains poorly explained, and the early expression of COUPTFI and II (E10.5-E12.5) could be considered major weaknesses of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. The generation of RXCre was reported by Swindell et al., Genesis, 2006 (PMID: 16850473). Given that the activation of the LacZ expression serves as an indicator for the deletion of the COUP-TFII gene (Tang et al., Development, 2012) (PMID: 22492355), we performed the immunofluorescent data with antibodies against COUP-TFII and LacZ on the sagittal sections of RXCre/+; COUP-TFIIF/+ heterozygous mutant and RXCre/+; COUP-TFIIF/F homozygous mice at E11.5. As shown in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 1Da-f, COUP-TFII was readily detected at the hippocampal primordium of the heterozygous mutant embryo at E11.5 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1Da, c, g); in contrast, the expression of COUP-TFII significantly decreased in the homozygous mutant (Figure 1—figure supplement 1Dd, f, j). In addition, compared with the heterozygous mutant embryo, the LacZ signals increased distinctly in the hippocampal primordium of the homozygous mutant embryo at E11.5 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1Db-c, e-f, h, k), suggesting that RXCre recombinase can efficiently excise the COUP-TFII gene in the hippocampal primordium as early as E11.5.

<p>Meanwhile, we also added the early expression of COUP-TFI and -TFII at E10.5 and E11.5 in new Figure 1—figure supplement 1Aa-d. At embryonic days 10.5 (E10.5), COUP-TFI was detected in the dorsal pallium (DP) laterally and COUP-TFII was expressed in the MP and CH medially (Figure 1—figure supplement 1Aa, b). At E11.5, the expression of COUP-TFII remained in the hippocampal primordium, including MP and CH (Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ac, d). Please find the corresponding changes in Page 6, lines 129-132 and Page 9, lines 202-203 in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>1. Regarding the RxCre line, I was also confused about its spatiotemporal expression, as this line is not a commonly used Cre line and no detailed description is provided in the manuscript. Searching this line shows a previous paper by the authors (PMID: 22492355) in which they tested the RxCre recombinase activity. At E12.5, RxCre induced high LacZ expression in the ventral telencephalon but much less in the dorsal telencephalon. But they did not check later stage. Therefore, it's hard to explain the defective dorsal hippocampus in RxCre, CFI CKO. They should check later stage.</p>

<p>The generation of RXCre was reported by Swindell et al., Genesis, 2006 (PMID: 16850473), which reveals high Cre recombinase activity of RXCre in the eye and ventral telencephalon. Given that the activation of the LacZ expression serves as an indicator for the deletion of COUP-TFII gene, Tang et al., Development, 2012 (PMID: 22492355), we performed the immunofluorescent data with antibodies against COUP-TFII and LacZ on the sagittal sections of RXCre/+; COUP-TFIIF/+ heterozygous mutant and RXCre/+; COUP-TFIIF/F homozygous mice at E11.5. As shown in new Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, compared with the heterozygous mutant embryo, the expression of COUP-TFII was significantly decreased in the homozygous mutant; in addition, the LacZ signals evidently increased in the hippocampal primordium of the homozygous mutant embryo at E11.5, suggesting that RXCre recombinase can efficiently excise the target gene in the hippocampal primordium as early as E11.5. The expression of COUP-TFI is barely detectable in the early developing hippocampal primordium including MP at E10.5, E11.5 and E12.5. The expression of COUP-TFI is high in the MP of the control (Figure 1Cj, l); in contrast, the COUP-TFI expression is barely detectable in the MP of the homozygous double mutant at E14.5, indicating that RXCre can efficiently delete the COUP-TFI gene in the hippocampal primordium at E14.5. The loss of the COUP-TFI gene in the MP as early as E14.5 by RXCre initiates the defective dorsal hippocampus in RXCre/+; COUP-TFIF/F knockout mice.</p>

<p>We carefully checked and made changes throughout the manuscript accordingly. For example, “imperative” was used 6 times in the previous manuscript, lines 20, 255, 486, 499, 522, 553; “imperative” was used only once in Page 22, line 522 in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>1. I am confused why the authors analyzed 1-month-old mice in some instances but 3-month-old mice in others.</p>

<p>The RXCre/+; COUP-TFIF/F; COUP-TFIIF/F double mutant mice barely survived beyond postnatal 3 weeks. To make our findings consistent and comparable, we mainly prepared figures with observations on about 1-month-old mice in the RXCre related single or/and double gene mutant mouse models. In the study of the Emx1Cre related COUP-TFI mouse model, due to behavioral tests such as the Morris water maze test, experiments were performed with the adult experimental animal about postnatal 3 months. In order to be consistent with the stage of the mice for the behavioral tests, we only displayed morphological data with observations on the control and Emx1Cre/+; COUP-TFIF/F mutant mice at about postnatal 3-month.</p>
