<title>Abstract</title><p>Photoreceptors in the retina of a vertebrate’s eye are supported by a tissue adjacent to the retina, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The RPE delivers glucose to the outer retina, consumes photoreceptor outer segments discs, and regenerates 11-cis-retinal. Here we address the question of whether photoreceptors also provide metabolic support to the RPE. We use complementary approaches and animal models to show that glucose is the primary fuel for the retina, that photoreceptors are the primary cell type in the retina to consume glucose, and that lactate derived from photoreceptor glucose consumption is transported to and catabolized by the RPE. These data rigorously support and extend the concept of a metabolic ecosystem between photoreceptors and RPE.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors causes blindness in patients with retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. Proteins encoded by &gt;100 distinct genes linked to these diseases have remarkably diverse biochemical activities. We hypothesize that defects in many of these genes create, either directly or indirectly, metabolic stress in photoreceptors. To address the validity of this idea, we are exploring photoreceptor energy metabolism and the metabolic interactions between photoreceptors and their environment.</p>
<p>Photoreceptors in the outer retina receive nutrients from blood that flows through the fenestrated choriocapillaris just inside the sclera of the eye. Between the photoreceptors and this blood supply there is a monolayer of cells called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The basal and apical plasma membranes of the RPE cells are enriched with the glucose transporter GLUT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Takata et al., 1992</xref>). Glucose is delivered from circulation to the outer retina via these transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Swarup et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Isolated retinas break down glucose through aerobic glycolysis and primarily convert the carbon from glucose into lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Warburg, 1925</xref>). This process, as opposed to oxidation of glucose carbons to CO<sub>2</sub> in mitochondria, classically occurs in tumor tissue and is referred to as the Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Warburg et al., 1927</xref>). Of the cells in the retina, photoreceptors express the same isoforms of glycolytic enzymes that are in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lowry et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lindsay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Casson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rajala et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rueda et al., 2016</xref>). Retinas without photoreceptors consume less glucose and produce less lactate than normal retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Graymore, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Reading and Sorsby, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Winkler et al., 2004</xref>). These data suggest that aerobic glycolysis is performed by photoreceptors.</p>
<p>In a previous report, we described evidence that RPE cells minimize their consumption of glucose so that more glucose can traverse the RPE to reach the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kanow et al., 2017</xref>). We also proposed that lactate produced by photoreceptors can suppress consumption of glucose by RPE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kanow et al., 2017</xref>). That proposal was based on the results of <italic>ex vivo</italic> analyses of metabolic flux in retinas, RPE-choroid and cultured RPE cells. Here we tested our proposal more rigorously by using multiple unique mouse models, and by infusing <sup>13</sup>C-labeled fuels into mice and quantifying <sup>13</sup>C-labeled metabolites in their retinas and RPE-choroid tissues. We show that the retina primarily consumes glucose, that photoreceptors are the main consumers of glucose in the retina, and that lactate, both from circulation and from photoreceptors influences energy metabolism in the RPE.</p>

<title>Retina metabolism is fueled primarily by circulating glucose</title>
<p>Rapid consumption of glucose and production of lactate are key metabolic features of isolated retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Warburg, 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Winkler, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ames et al., 1992</xref>). An isolated mouse retina incubated in culture medium produces nearly two moles of lactate from each mole of glucose that it consumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hass et al., 2023a</xref>). Isolated retinas can oxidize fuels other than glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Keen and Chlouverakis, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Winkler, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chertov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adijanto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Joyal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kanow et al., 2017</xref>), yet the degree to these fuels are normally used <italic>in vivo</italic> is unknown.</p>
<p>We designed an experiment to compare consumption of several types of fuels by retinas within the eyes of awake, freely moving mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hui et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2020</xref>). Mice were equipped with jugular vein and carotid artery catheters. We infused glucose fully labeled with <sup>13</sup>C (“<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose” or “m+6 glucose”) through the jugular veins. For comparison, in separate experiments we infused <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-lactate, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>4</sub>-succinate, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-glutamine, or <sup>13</sup>C<sub>4</sub>-malate into jugular vein catheters for four hours (glucose) or two hours (each other fuel). Metabolite concentrations and infusion rates are listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> shows the experiment scheme, and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> shows how these fuels integrate into energy metabolism. During the infusion we collected plasma from a carotid artery catheter every 30 minutes. Two or four hours after initiating the infusion, we collected final plasma samples, euthanized each mouse, dissected tissue samples, and froze them in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Isotopic labeling of metabolites in plasma and tissue samples was quantified either by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS).</p>

<p>Jugular vein and carotid artery catheters were installed in C57BL/6J mice.

<p>Plasma samples were used to confirm that each infused fuel reached isotopic steady state in circulation (Supplementary Fig. 1A-E). At isotopic steady state, we determined the extent to which each infused fuel is used to make m+3 pyruvate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), m+2 citrate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), m+2 glutamate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), and m+2 aspartate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) in the neural retina. The y-axis for these figure panels shows normalized labeling, which is calculated as the fractional enrichment of a metabolite (including all isotopologues) with <sup>13</sup>C in the tissue relative to the fractional enrichment of the source of <sup>13</sup>C in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hui et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2020</xref>). When the infused fuel is <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose, a normalized labeling value for pyruvate of 1.0 would mean that 100% of pyruvate produced in the tissue was produced from glucose that had been taken up from circulating blood.</p>
<p>Metabolic intermediates in the retina are primarily derived from <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose and <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-lactate, and poorly labeled from all other sources. m+6 glucose generates circulating m+3 lactate (Supplementary Fig. 2A), and carbons from circulating m+3 lactate can contribute to <sup>13</sup>C- labeled pyruvate, citrate, glutamate, and malate in the retina (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-F</xref>). Therefore, a portion of glucose-derived labeling can occur via lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hui et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, <sup>13</sup>C-lactate can undergo gluconeogenesis and generate circulating <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose (Supplementary Fig. 2B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">TeSlaa et al., 2021</xref>). We calculated the direct contributions of glucose or lactate to the TCA cycle (approximated by averaging <sup>13</sup>C labeling on citrate, α-ketoglutarate, glutamate, and aspartate) in the retina using a previously described formula (Described in Supplementary note 3 of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hui et al., 2017</xref>)). This type of analysis produces an unrealistic result, that 114% of the retina’s TCA cycle is directly fueled by glucose, and 8.5% by lactate. However, this calculation is impacted by m+1 labeling on TCA cycle intermediates, which is abundant (pink bars in Supplementary Fig. 2C). M+1 labeling may be an artifact of <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> that was generated by other tissues but recycled in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Duan et al., 2022</xref>). When m+1 isotopologues are not included, the revised calculation indicates that glucose and lactate fuel 73.9% and 3.3% of the retina’s TCA cycle (Supplementary Fig. 2D). The primary message of these calculations is that glucose is the major TCA cycle fuel in the retina, and that the direct contribution of circulating lactate to retina metabolism is small.</p>

<title>Photoreceptors are the main consumers of glucose in the retina</title>
<p>Previous studies showed that glucose consumption increases while rod photoreceptors are developing within the retina, and decreases when photoreceptors degenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cohen and Noell, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Reading and Sorsby, 1962</xref>). We compared rates of glucose consumption by normal retinas (C57BL/6J) vs. by retinas without photoreceptors (<italic>Aipl1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> in the C57BL/6J background). <italic>Aipl1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are models of Leber congenital amaurosis. In these mice, rod and cone photoreceptors degenerate fully by one month of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ramamurthy et al., 2004</xref>). We used this model to confirm the contribution of photoreceptors to retina glucose consumption.</p>
<p>We used an enzymatic assay to quantify depletion of glucose from the medium bathing freshly isolated retinas. <italic>Aipl1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> retinas deplete glucose from the medium at only 15% of the rate of C57BL/6J controls and they release lactate at 22% of the control rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). We also measured accumulation of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub> lactate within the isolated retinas when they were incubated in <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose. The initial rate of <sup>13</sup>C lactate accumulation within <italic>Aipl1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> retinas is only 11% of the rate of C57BL/6J controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Retinas were dissected from eyes then incubated in Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate buffer supplemented with 5 mM glucose, at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Glucose consumption from medium (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>D</bold>, <bold>F</bold>) and lactate production (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>E</bold>, <bold>G</bold>) were monitored over 1-1.5 hours. These assays were used to determine how glycolytic metabolism is affected by (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) photoreceptor degeneration due to loss of AIPL1 (n=3-4), (<bold>D</bold>, <bold>E</bold>) loss of Glut1 from the retina (n=4-5), or (<bold>F</bold>, <bold>G</bold>) loss of Glut1 from rod photoreceptors (n=5). Loss of photoreceptors, loss of retinal Glut1, or loss of rod Glut1 slowed retina glucose utilization.

<p>GLUT1 is the only glucose transporter that normally is expressed in detectable amounts in rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Daniele et al., 2022</xref>). If photoreceptors consume most of the glucose provided to retinas, then deletion of Glut1 from photoreceptors should diminish glucose consumption substantially. We determined initial rates of glucose depletion and lactate accumulation in culture medium by retinas from mice in which <italic>Glut1</italic> was conditionally deleted either from the whole retina (RetΔ<italic>Glut1</italic>) or from rods only (RodΔ<italic>Glut1</italic>). Loss of <italic>Glut1</italic> from the entire retina slows the rate of glucose depletion to 30% of the rate of Glut1<sup>fl/fl</sup> control retinas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and lactate export to 22% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). In the experiment comparing RodΔ<italic>Glut1</italic> mice to controls, glucose consumption and lactate production were assessed in the presence of 10 mM lactate and 100 µM palmitate-BSA in the KRB buffer bathing retinas. Loss of <italic>Glut1</italic> from rod photoreceptors slows glucose depletion to 26% of <italic>Glut1<sup>fl</sup></italic><sup>/fl</sup> controls <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and lactate export to 53% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). These data confirm that photoreceptors are the primary cell type that takes up glucose and exports lactate, and that they import glucose mostly through GLUT1.</p>

<title>Photoreceptors can use lactate for fuel when glucose is unavailable</title>
<p>Remarkably, despite being the main consumers of glucose in the retina, rod photoreceptors do not die immediately upon loss of components essential for glycolysis or for uptake of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chinchore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Daniele et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Weh et al., 2023</xref>). That suggests that rods can use other fuels when glucose is not available. We hypothesized that under normal conditions oxidation of glucose by a rod consumes NAD<sup>+</sup>, so its capacity to import and oxidize lactate is limited. But when glucose is not available for oxidation the cytosolic NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio in rod should increase. A greater abundance of cytosolic NAD<sup>+</sup> could promote oxidation of cytosolic lactate to pyruvate. This would deplete intracellular lactate and generate a gradient of lactate that favors import of extracellular lactate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>Mice lacking Glut1 in rod photoreceptors (RodΔGlut1) and identically treated littermate control mice were euthanized, and retinas dissected.

<p>We compared fuel preferences of isolated mouse retinas in KRB supplemented with 5 mM glucose, 10 mM lactate, and 100 µM palmitate-BSA. We included palmitate because previous reports had shown that it can be a respiratory fuel for retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Joyal et al., 2016</xref>). We used three treatment conditions. The overall concentration of each metabolic fuel remained the same across treatment conditions, but in each treatment condition only one of the fuels was labeled with <sup>13</sup>C. We isolated retinas from control and RodΔGlut1 mice and then incubated them for 2 hours in these media. We harvested the retinas, extracted metabolites from them, and used GC-MS to quantify how the carbons from each type of fuel had integrated into metabolic intermediates. <sup>13</sup>C from each fuel can integrate its carbons into TCA cycle intermediates, but glucose and lactate substantially outperformed palmitate under these conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>We compared consumption of fuels by control and RodΔGlut1 retinas. We tested the idea that rods oxidize other fuels when access to glucose is decreased. The absence of GLUT1 in rods substantially influences the abundance of metabolic intermediates in the retina (Supplementary Fig. 3), and how well these intermediates were <sup>13</sup>C labeled from each fuel (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-E</xref>).</p>
<p>Fractional labeling from <sup>13</sup>C glucose decreased for most metabolic intermediates, suggesting a diminished ability of glucose to fuel a portion of retina metabolism (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). However, fractional labeling of the glycolytic intermediates 3-PG and PEP increased substantially in the absence of GLUT1 in rods. Notably, it has been reported that Müller cells express low levels of pyruvate kinase (PK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lindsay et al., 2014</xref>). Abnormally high uptake of <sup>13</sup>C glucose into Müller cells could cause a buildup of <sup>13</sup>C labeled 3PG and PEP upstream of the PK reaction. A similar finding for <italic>Glut1</italic>-deficient macrophages has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Freemerman et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The absence of GLUT1 in rods limits incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C from glucose, but incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C from lactate increases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). That finding suggests that lactate consumption increases to compensate for the diminished ability to import glucose into rods. Pyruvate and several other intermediates were labeled more in RodΔ<italic>Glut1</italic> retinas by <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-lactate. Incorporation of carbons from <sup>13</sup>C<sub>16</sub>-palmitate decreased in RodΔ<italic>Glut1</italic> retinas, suggesting that glucose and palmitate metabolism in retinas are synergistic (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Our findings suggest that when the supply of glucose to photoreceptors is cut off, photoreceptors instead catabolize lactate.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> evidence that RPE imports lactate that has been exported from photoreceptors</title>
<p>Normally, photoreceptors are the primary exporters of lactate in mouse retinas. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> show that when fueled with glucose, <italic>Aipl1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> retinas export much less lactate than normal retinas. Several groups have demonstrated that RPE can transport lactate, and that lactate RPE transport is essential for retinal health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">la Cour et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Daniele et al., 2008</xref>). Kanow et al. proposed that lactate that has been exported from the retina is metabolized within the RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kanow et al., 2017</xref>). That hypothesis was based on findings from <italic>ex vivo</italic> analyses of tissues and cultured RPE cells. We designed an <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment that uses retinas without photoreceptors to test this hypothesis in the eyes of living mice. We predicted that without photoreceptors to export lactate, less lactate will be imported into the RPE-choroid.</p>
<p>We dissected RPE-choroid tissue from control mice and from two different lines of mice in which photoreceptors had degenerated, <italic>Aipl1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Pde6b<sup>H620Q</sup></italic><sup>/H620Q</sup>. <italic>Pde6b<sup>H620Q</sup></italic><sup>/H620Q</sup> mice are models of retinitis pigmentosa, with a slower form of retinal degeneration than <italic>Aipl1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davis et al., 2008a</xref>). We used GC-MS to quantify the abundance of metabolites in RPE-choroid tissue of these models (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-F</xref>). Lactate is the only glycolytic metabolite in the RPE-choroid that consistently was less abundant when photoreceptors in the retina had degenerated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,D</xref>). This finding further supports the idea that normally the RPE imports lactate made by and released from photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Daniele et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

Lactate was not the only metabolite with altered levels in these models, but it was the only metabolite that was altered consistently in the RPE-choroid of all four model systems. In three of four models, there also was an increase in aspartate, suggesting either an increase in retina-derived aspartate, an increase in local aspartate production, or a decrease in local aspartate consumption.

</fig>
<p>Those results confirm that photoreceptors must be present for glycolysis to be the dominant metabolic pathway in the retina. AIPL1<sup>-/-</sup> retinas do not make enough lactate to export it in abundance to the RPE.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo analysis:</italic> We hypothesized that lactate imported from photoreceptors normally is a significant fraction of the total lactate in RPE-choroid tissue. Disrupted delivery of glucose-derived lactate from the retina to the RPE would limit the amount of lactate in RPE-choroid. We designed an experiment to test this.</p>
<p>We infused a bolus dose of 100 mg/kg <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose into jugular vein catheters in C57BL/6J and <italic>Aipl1</italic> <sup>-/-</sup> mice. We euthanized mice 1, 2, 3, or 5 minutes following the infusion, and dissected the retina and RPE-choroid. We extracted metabolites from each tissue and used mass spectrometry to quantify the extent to which carbons from <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose were used to make glycolytic and mitochondrial intermediates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C and D</xref>). The result confirms our prediction that much less m+3 lactate reaches the RPE-choroid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>) in AIPL1<sup>-/-</sup> mice than in controls.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, other findings from that <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment were unexpected and puzzling. We found that <sup>13</sup>C labeled glycolytic intermediates (DHAP and PEP) upstream of the reaction catalyzed by PK seemed to accumulate both in retinas and in RPE-choroid from AIPL1<sup>-/-</sup> eyes. That result appeared inconsistent with our <italic>ex vivo</italic> analyses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A,B</xref>) and our predictions.</p>
<p>Further analyses revealed the explanation for this unexpected observation. There is an unavoidable delay of ∼2 minutes between euthanasia and the time when retina and RPE- choroid tissues are fully dissected and frozen. During that interval there is no fresh blood available to the tissues to maintain a supply of glucose. We hypothesized that due to the rapid consumption of glucose by photoreceptors in normal retinas, postmortem metabolism could deplete glycolytic intermediates rapidly in the tissue. Metabolites would be depleted faster in wild-type retinas that have photoreceptors than in AIPL1<sup>-/-</sup> retinas during the time between euthanasia and tissue harvest.</p>
<p>We performed an <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiment to test this hypothesis. We incubated isolated retinas from C57BL/6J and AIPL1<sup>-/-</sup> mice for 10 minutes in KRB medium supplemented with 5 mM <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>- glucose. Then we moved the retinas to KRB medium without glucose. We collected retinas at 0, 1, 3, and 5 minutes after moving the tissue, and then quantified glycolytic intermediates.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the absolute quantities of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled DHAP, 3PG and PEP (black lines in Supplementary Fig. 4A) in normal retinas decreased rapidly, 50-70% within the first minute. In contrast, these intermediates were stable in AIPL1<sup>-/-</sup> retinas (red lines in Supplementary Fig. 4A). We also monitored the fractional labeling of the metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 4B). The fractional labeling of early glycolytic intermediates also decreased within the first minute.</p>
<p>However, the fractional labeling of later intermediates, pyruvate and lactate remained closer to their initial values at the time that glucose was withdrawn.</p>
<p>This result of this <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiment is consistent with our hypothesis. What had appeared to be accumulation of DHAP and PEP in AIPL1<sup>-/-</sup> tissues relative to control tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) is caused by an artifact. The artifact occurs during the unavoidable delay between euthanasia and harvesting of the tissue. It is caused by very rapid consumption of glucose by photoreceptors in control retinas. That rapid consumption does not occur in AIPL1<sup>-/-</sup> retinas. The same effect occurs in RPE-choroid tissue after blood flow to the eye has stopped. During that time the wild-type retina, which is in close contact with the RPE, can consume glucose rapidly from the RPE until we separate the tissues in the final step of the dissection.</p>
<p>The <italic>ex vivo</italic> simulation shows that fractional labeling of DHAP and PEP at the time of euthanasia are not well preserved during 1-2 minutes of ischemia (Supplementary Fig. 4B). However, fractional labeling of pyruvate and lactate are better preserved. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E and F</xref> show the results of the same bolus infusion experiment as in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C and D</xref> but instead of the data being expressed as absolute amounts they are expressed as fractional labeling. It shows that pyruvate and lactate are substantially less labeled both in the retina and in the RPE of mice that lack photoreceptors in their retinas. Even though glycolytic intermediates are depleted faster the RPE-choroid from control mice still have as much as 9 times more lactate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>) than the RPE-choroid from eyes that do not have photoreceptors.</p>
<p>In summary, the <italic>in vivo</italic> bolus infusion confirms that less lactate reaches the RPE-choroid when there are no photoreceptors in the retina.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Normal vision is dependent on the circulation of carbon between the retina and RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Daniele et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2022</xref>). The retina and the RPE provide metabolic support for each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lakkaraju et al., 2020</xref>). Energy from light isomerizes 11-cis retinal to all-trans in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wald, 1968</xref>). The visual cycle in the RPE then uses metabolic energy to regenerate 11-cis retinal for the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Saari, 2016</xref>). Photoreceptors also use substantial carbon to generate outer segments disks, which constantly turn over and which require glucose transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Young, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Swarup et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Daniele et al., 2022</xref>). The RPE also recycles material from the tips of rod outer segments, and it transports ions, nutrients and water to and from the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Young and Bok, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Quinn and Miller, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">la Cour et al., 1994</xref>). In this report we focused on energy metabolism.</p>
<p>In a previous report, we described distinct metabolic features of the retina and RPE and proposed that they are complementary and optimized to ensure that sufficient glucose can traverse the RPE to fuel the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kanow et al., 2017</xref>). That hypothesis was based primarily on biochemical measurements from isolated mouse retina tissue, mouse RPE-choroid tissue and cultured human RPE cells. After proposing the hypothesis, which we referred to as a “metabolic ecosystem”, we felt that a more direct demonstration of metabolic relationships in the eye of a living animal would better support this hypothesis. This report describes those tests and several new observations.</p>

<title>Why do photoreceptors consume so much glucose?</title>
<p>Photoreceptors hydrolyze ATP to maintain an essential ion gradient across their plasma membrane, and they use the energy extracted from glycolysis to synthesize new ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ames et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Okawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ingram et al., 2020</xref>). We show that most of the glycolytic activity in the retina within the eye of a living mouse happens in photoreceptors. Because photoreceptor and RPE mitochondria consume so much O<sub>2</sub>, the steady state concentration of O<sub>2</sub> in the outer retina is very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Linsenmeier, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yu and Cringle, 2006</xref>). In any biological system, mitochondrial activity is limited by O<sub>2</sub> availability, and glycolysis necessarily becomes a predominant metabolic pathway from which to extract energy from fuels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gstraunthaler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gilglioni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hass et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tan et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>It is possible that retinas benefit from limited availability of O<sub>2</sub>. Along with light, O<sub>2</sub> is a major source of retina lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wiegand et al., 1983</xref>). Maintaining low O<sub>2</sub> levels in the retina could slow or prevent lipid peroxidation. A highly active mitochondrial metabolism in photoreceptors and RPE could therefore help to shield retina lipids from peroxidation.</p>
<p>Glucose also is used in anabolic pathways, and it is necessary for outer segment synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Daniele et al., 2022</xref>). It is likely that a far greater proportion of glucose turnover feeds into catabolic pathways than into anabolic pathways. Yet the absence of glucose catabolism does not result in immediate photoreceptor death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chinchore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Daniele et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Weh et al., 2023</xref>), and to an extent, lactate can substitute for glucose as an energetic fuel. This may imply that if there is a defect that impacts glycolysis, increasing lactate supply or catabolism could be a therapeutic mechanism to sustain photoreceptors.</p>

<title>What sustains the RPE?</title>
<p>We showed in this report that in the eye of a living animal lactate exported from the retina can be imported into RPE and oxidized in mitochondria. Lactate slows the consumption of glucose in RPE cells and mouse RPE-choroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kanow et al., 2017</xref>). Lactate may therefore protect glucose from being consumed by the RPE, and allow for more glucose to fuel photoreceptor metabolic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kanow et al., 2017</xref>). However, lactate is not the only fuel that RPE cells consume. They metabolize proline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>), succinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bisbach et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hass et al., 2022</xref>), glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Xu et al., 2020</xref>), and fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adijanto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Reyes-Reveles et al., 2017</xref>). RPE cells also have the ability to store and mobilize glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Senanayake et al., 2006</xref>). It will be important to establish the relative contributions of each of these fuels to RPE metabolism in the eye of a living animal and to determine how they are influenced by illumination, circadian factors, aging and disease.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>All experiments adhered to our approved IACUC protocol and the ARVO statement for the use of animals in ophthalmology research. Mice were group housed at an ambient temperature of 25°C, with a 12-hour light cycle, and <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to water and normal rodent chow. We used male and female wild-type C57BL/6J (RRID: IMSR_JAX:000664) mice, and AIPL1<sup>-/-</sup> mice bred to a C57BL/6J background over a series of at least six back-crosses. Mouse ages ranged from 2-6 months old except for RetΔGlut1, which were used at 1 month of age to avoid significant retinal degeneration. RodΔGlut1 mice were used at 2.5 months of age. We determined <italic>ex vivo</italic> glucose uptake, <italic>ex vivo</italic> lactate release, and metabolite content in tissue from Glut1<sup>LoxP/LoxP</sup>; crx-cre (RetΔGlut1) and <italic>Glut1</italic><sup>LoxP/LoxP</sup>;<italic>Pde6g-<sup>creERT2</sup></italic>(RodΔGlut1) mice. The generation of these transgenic mouse models is described in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Koch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Daniele et al., 2022</xref>). To induce cre recombinase activity in RodΔGlut1 mice, animals were given daily intraperitoneal injections of 100 μg tamoxifen / g body weight over 3 days.</p>
<p>Injection formulations were made by dissolving tamoxifen at 100 mg/ml in ethanol and diluting this solution 1:10 in corn oil. Injections were given beginning at 5 weeks of age and were also administered to littermate controls (Glut1<sup>LoxP/LoxP</sup>). <italic>Pde6b<sup>H620Q/H620Q</sup></italic> mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davis et al., 2008b</xref>) and kept as homozygous breeders.</p>

<title>Euthanasia and tissue dissection</title>
<p>Mice were euthanized by awake cervical dislocation. The time of day for euthanasia was after 11 am, to avoid variability due to peak outer segment phagocytosis. We dissected eyes from the mouse into room temperature Hank’s buffered salt solution (Gibco, Cat#: 14170120). Eyes were cleared of extraocular muscle and collagenous tissue and the cornea was separated from the sclera by cutting along the ora serrata. We removed the cornea, iris, and lens, then teased apart the remaining retina and RPE-choroid tissue. This process typically takes ∼2-4 minutes for both eyes from one mouse. Retina and RPE-choroid tissue were immediately flash frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> (<italic>in vivo</italic> experiments) or used in downstream experiments then flash frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> (<italic>ex vivo</italic> metabolic flux).</p>

<title>Installation of jugular vein and carotid artery catheters</title>
<p>The procedure for chronic jugular vein and carotid artery catheterization was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ayala et al., 2011</xref>) by the Metabolic and Cellular Phenotyping Core of the University of Washington’s Diabetes Research Center. Briefly, following induction and maintenance under systemic inhaled anesthesia (isoflurane 1.5-2% in 1 mL/min), mice were administered with 4 mg/kg ketoprofen to reduce post-surgical swelling and provide analgesia. For intravenous infusions, jugular veins were isolated through a lateral incision to the trachea, and a silastic catheter was introduced into the vein, anchored to surrounding tissue, tunneled subcutaneously to the nape of the neck and connected to a vascular access port. A subset of mice received a contralateral carotid artery cannulation for blood sampling. The catheters were filled with heparinized saline, the skin incisions were sutured, and the mice recovered for 1 week before conscious infusion studies.</p>

<sec id="s5e">
<title>Infusions</title>
<p>We infused labeled fuels one of two ways. In the first way (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, Supplemental Fig. 1) jugular catheters were infused gradually through syringes connected to syringe pumps. Metabolites were dissolved in sterile saline and infused at the concentrations and rates listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to long term infusions we administered 100 mg/kg <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose as a bolus through jugular catheters, over a period of approximately 20 seconds. One, two, three, and five minutes after the start of the infusion, mice were euthanized. Retina and RPE-choroid tissue were dissected and snap frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<sec id="s5f">
<title>Ex vivo metabolic flux</title>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, mouse retina and RPE-choroid tissue was incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer (98.5 mM NaCl, 4.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>- 7H<sub>2</sub>O, 20 mM HEPES, 2.6 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O, 25.9 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.4) supplemented with 5 mM U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose. This buffer was equilibrated at 37°C, 21% O<sub>2</sub>, and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> prior to incubations. We incubated freshly dissected tissue in media at 37°C, 21% O<sub>2</sub>, and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for amounts of time indicated in each figure. Following each incubation, tissue samples were flash frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Medium was sampled every 30 minutes to evaluate glucose and lactate content.</p>

<title>Glucose and lactate assays</title>
<p>Glucose and lactate levels in cell culture supernatant were determined enzymatically, as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Seidemann, 1973</xref>) but adapted for use in a 96 well plate. A detailed description of the adapted glucose assay protocol can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.protocols.io/view/glucose-concentration-assay-hexokinase-g6pdh-metho-dm6gpj5jdgzp/v1">https://www.protocols.io/view/glucose-concentration-assay-hexokinase-g6pdh-metho-dm6gpj5jdgzp/v1</ext-link>.

For each assay, levels of glucose or lactate are determined by measuring absorbance of light at 340 nm, which reflects NADH or NADPH produced in the assay. We measured absorption of 340 nm light using a Synergy 4 plate reader (BioTek).</p>

<title>Metabolite extraction</title>
<p>Metabolites were separated from tissue in an extraction buffer consisting of 80% methanol, 20% H<sub>2</sub>O, and 10 μM methylsuccinate (Sigma, Cat#: M81209) as an internal standard. The extraction buffer was equilibrated on dry ice, and 150 μL was added to each sample. Tissues were then disrupted by sonication and incubated on dry ice for 45 minutes to precipitate protein. Proteins were pelleted at 17,000 × g for 30 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant containing metabolites was lyophilized at room temperature until dry and stored at −80°C until derivatization. The pellet containing protein was resuspended by sonication in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0) and protein was determined by a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher, Cat#: 23225).</p>

<title>Metabolite derivatization for Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry</title>
<p>Dried samples were derivatized with 10 μL of 20 mg/mL methoxyamine HCl (Sigma, Cat#: 226904) dissolved in pyridine (Sigma, Cat#: 270970) and incubated at 37°C for 90 minutes. Samples were further derivatized with 10 μL tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (Sigma, Cat#: 394882) and incubating at 70°C for 60 minutes.</p>

<title>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry</title>
<p>Metabolites were analyzed on an Agilent 7890/5975C GC-MS using methods described extensively in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chertov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Du et al., 2015</xref>). One microliter of derivatized sample is injected and delivered to an Agilent HP-5MS column by helium gas (flow rate: 1 mL/min). The column temperature starts at 100°C for 4 minutes then increases by 5°C/min to 300°C, where it is held for 5 min. We collect ion intensities after a 6.5-min solvent delay.</p>
<p>Selected ion monitoring (SIM) records only selected m/z in expected retention time windows. These masses range from m/z: ∼50–600. Peaks were integrated in MSD ChemStation (Agilent Technologies, version E.02.01.1177), and correction for natural isotope abundance was performed using IsoCor 1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Millard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Heinrich et al., 2018</xref>). Corrected metabolite signals were converted to molar amounts by comparing metabolite peak abundances in samples with those in a ‘standard mix’ containing known quantities of metabolites. Multiple concentrations of this mix were extracted, derivatized, and run alongside samples in each experiment. These known metabolite concentrations were used to generate a standard curve that allowed for metabolite quantification. Paired tissues such as retinas and RPE-choroid from the same mouse were treated as technical replicates and averaged.</p>

<title>Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry</title>
<p>For liquid chromatography, samples were separated on an Acquity 2D UPLC equipped with an Acuity BEH Amide column (Waters, 2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm). The mobile phases were (A) water with 10 m<italic>M</italic> ammonium acetate (pH 8.9) and (B) acetonitrile/water (95%/5%) with 10 m<italic>M</italic> ammonium acetate (pH 8.9). All solvents were LC–MS Optima grade (Fisher Scientific). The protocol was 0 min: [5% A, 95% B], 2 min [15% A, 85% B], 2.8 min: [40% A, 60% B], 3.2 min: [50% A, 50% B], 3.7 min: [15% A, 85% B], 4.4 min: [5% A, 95% B], at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. Chromatographically separated glucose was quantified on a Waters Xevo TQ mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization. Glucose ions were collected in negative mode with a cone = 18 V, collision energy = 8 V, parent ions of m/z = 179-185 and daughter ions of m/z=89-92. Dwell time for each ion was 0.08 s.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All displayed data include mean ± standard error and may additionally show individual experimental replicates. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software, version 10.0). Significance thresholds were set to α&lt;0.05. When p-values are not directly shown, * indicates p&lt;0.05, ** indicates p&lt;0.01, *** indicates p&lt;0.001. “n” signifies sample size, which is indicated in figure legends for corresponding experiments. For glucose depletion and lactate production in medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), a linear regression was used to calculate slopes for glucose consumption or lactate production over the first hour of the experiment. Slopes were compared using a student’s t-test. T-tests were also used to analyze the data in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-L</xref>. Other data were analyzed by a two-way ANOVA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref><bold>. C-E</bold>, Supplemental Fig. 3). Post-hoc comparisons for 2-way ANOVAs and multiple T-tests (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) were made using the two-stage step-up method of Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli.</p>

<p>This research is <bold>valuable</bold> as it investigates metabolic shuttling between photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) using in vivo infusion techniques and mouse models. The authors find that the retina significantly relies on circulating glucose, with photoreceptors being the primary consumers of glucose, which is <bold>convincing</bold>. However, the study has <bold>incomplete</bold> evidence to support the claims that photoreceptors can use lactate as a fuel source, that lactate exported from photoreceptors is utilized by the RPE, and that lactate contributes to the TCA cycle in the RPE. These claims need substantial revision to include potential alternative explanations or perform key experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors sought to build upon their prior work, which suggested the presence of an outer retinal metabolic microenvironment using ex vivo and in vitro systems, by using in vivo methods and a multitude of genetic models. The authors convincingly demonstrate that the retina prefers circulating glucose to some other circulating fuel sources and that photoreceptors are the main consumers of glucose in the retina. However, the claims regarding the ability of photoreceptors to utilize lactate as a fuel source, that lactate exported specifically from photoreceptors is taken up by RPE and further utilized to support the TCA cycle in the RPE are incomplete or inadequate and would benefit from further experimentation to convince the reader of such biological processes. Considering alternative explanations and performing key experiments to confirm or refute these claims would substantially improve the impact of this study.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strengths of this study are its in vivo infusion methodologies and utilization of mouse models that are devoid of photoreceptors or are photoreceptor-specific conditional knockouts to provide convincing evidence that the retina utilizes circulating glucose to a significant degree and photoreceptors are the main consumers of glucose in the retina. These in vivo studies are complemented by ex vivo experiments in retinal explants.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the in vivo infusion methodologies are a clear strength, not utilizing these techniques or other in vivo methodologies with the genetic models that lack photoreceptors or photoreceptor-specific proteins and not providing in vivo metabolomics data from these infusions in the RPE is a major weakness. Also, some circulating fuel sources may not get into the retina in appreciable amounts, impacting some of the authors' claims. Another major weakness is that for many of the claims noted by the authors, alternative explanations have not been considered nor have the proper experiments been conducted to fully support or refute these claims. For example, the authors claim it is photoreceptors that utilize lactate upon knockout of Glut1. However, other cells in the retina, such as Muller glia, may be the ones actually catabolizing lactate based on prior studies and enzyme expression patterns and their kinetics to support photoreceptors via the production of other metabolites from lactate. This alternative has not been considered nor have experiments been conducted to refute this possibility. Additionally, the authors claim lactate exported from photoreceptors is being taken up by RPE. The models used to support this claim lack photoreceptors, or their ability to take up glucose. None of the models specifically address lactate export from photoreceptors. Finally, the authors claim lactate exported from photoreceptors can be oxidized to TCA cycle intermediates in the RPE in vivo. No experiments specifically addressed the downstream path of lactate exported by photoreceptors in RPE TCA cycle metabolism in vivo, so this conclusion is also not well supported. Hence, the claims need to be significantly amended with an acknowledgment of potential alternatives or with some key experiments performed.</p>

<p>Hass et al. use in vivo and ex vivo mouse models to explore and validate the use of glucose and lactate by the outer retina. While the authors' conclusions are not totally novel, their work uses powerful in vivo models to validate, strengthen, and support their conclusions. This data is an important step forward in the field's understanding of retinal metabolism.</p>
<p>They performed in vivo metabolite tracing with 5 different fuel sources and found that glucose was the primary fuel for TCA in the retina. While performing these experiments they measured the circulating levels of the tracer metabolites to ensure steady-state labeling which aids in the interpretation of the results. Showing the levels of the labeled tracer in the retina would be a nice addition to establishing if the tracer is getting into the target tissue.</p>
<p>To support their conclusions that the photoreceptors are the primary consumers of glucose in the retina, the authors used multiple mouse models either with photoreceptor degeneration or a retina lacking the primary glucose transporter. While the photoreceptor degeneration mouse model has some caveats that make interpreting the data challenging, the glucose transporter KO models are a powerful tool to show the changes in metabolite levels between the retina and RPE in a retina. These retinas are not degenerated and have more subtle metabolic rearrangements. Therefore decreases in glucose consumption and lactate export can confidently be attributed to the changes in the photoreceptor metabolism. This model also allowed the authors to show that when glucose uptake is limited the photoreceptors can use lactate.</p>
<p>The authors show in vivo data to support that the RPE uses lactate from the photoreceptors as a fuel source. They do very short-term tracing in vivo to show that the RPE has reduced lactate levels and TCA labeling in a mouse model lacking photoreceptors. There is no deficiency when the RPE is measured ex vivo. These data clearly show that the adjacent photoreceptor activity is impacting RPE metabolism.</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written, and thorough and does a very good job detailing and explaining methods and concepts that are not straightforward. The authors address (and do not bury) confusing data that does not necessarily support their conclusions (for example glycolytic intermediates in Figure 3C being elevated. The authors even perform additional experiments to clarify artifacts they observed in the tracing of the degeneration model due to short-term ischemia.</p>

<p>This work addresses the metabolic interplay between photoreceptors and the adjacent supporting layer of the vertebrate retina, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Prior work from the Hurley lab and others provided evidence, mainly in acutely dissected mouse retina and in cell culture, for the idea that although glucose enters the retina via the RPE, the photoreceptors use most of this glucose via glycolysis, producing lactate that is used by other cells such as Müller cells and RPE cells. In the current study, they build on this by showing that these same principles hold true in vivo, using organism-level stable isotope tracing, as well as in intact retina preparations. They also use several mutant mice that lack photoreceptors, or that lack glucose transporters in either rods or the whole retina, to examine the contribution of photoreceptors to retinal glucose uptake. While many of the concepts were introduced in earlier work, it is an important expansion of this work to show these same mechanisms function in vivo. The authors also use other labeled fuels, lactate, and palmitate, to characterize their use in the presence or absence of glucose transport.</p>
<p>The paper presents a nice combination of in vivo experiments (with a steady infusion of labeled metabolites into the circulation of a living mouse) with ex vivo experiments that allow the monitoring of lactate production and temporal control of labeling.</p>
<p>Overall, the work provides convincing evidence that in the eye of a living mouse, photoreceptors are the main consumers of glucose in the retina, and the main producers of lactate. It seems less clear that the incorporation of labeled glucose into TCA metabolites in the RPE is dependent on the photoreceptor processing of glucose to lactate. Figure 5D is cited as the evidence that &quot;much less m+3 lactate reaches the RPE-choroid in AIPL-/- mice than in controls,&quot; and indeed there is much less labeled lactate; but the downstream labeling of citrate is not substantially affected. It is also hard to discern whether these in vivo experiments provide evidence that photoreceptor-derived lactate suppresses glucose oxidation in RPE cells (as shown in vitro in Kanow et al., 2017).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful reading and review of our manuscript. These reviews make clear that, for this work to be complete, we must make progress on the following fronts:</p>
<p>(1) Expand the discussion to better incorporate alternate explanations of our data</p>
<p>(2) Improve data visualization and experimental support or an experimental refutation for the following concepts</p>
<p>a. Photoreceptor-derived lactate exported specifically from photoreceptors is utilized in the RPE TCA cycle</p>
<p>b. Photoreceptors can utilize lactate as a fuel source when starved of glucose</p>
<p>To address these concerns, we will focus our efforts on infusing <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose into rodΔglut1 mice. Lactate is not made without glucose, so this experiment should indicate whether glucose utilization in photoreceptors provides lactate to the RPE, and whether that lactate is used in the TCA cycle.</p>
<p>The reviewers also noted that changes in <sup>13</sup>C labeling of RPE TCA cycle intermediates downstream of lactate is not obvious (between C57BL6J mice and AIPL1<sup>-/-</sup>). We think that at least in part, this is a consequence of the way we presented the data. We will improve how we display our data so that the differences of incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C in TCA cycle intermediates in control and AIPL1<sup>-/-</sup> RPE is clearer.</p>
