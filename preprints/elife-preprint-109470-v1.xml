<abstract>
<p>Genetic nurture effects and assortative mating (AM) occur across a range of human behaviors and can bias estimates from traditional genetic models. These influences are typically studied univariately, within the same trait. However, estimation of cross-trait genetic nurture effects and cross-trait AM remains underexplored due to the absence of suitable approaches. To address this, we developed a multivariate extension of the SEM-PGS model for datasets with genotyped and phenotyped parents and offspring, enabling joint estimation of within-trait and cross-trait genetic and environmental influences. By integrating haplotypic polygenic scores (PGSs) into a structural equation modeling framework, the model simultaneously estimates sametrait and cross-trait direct effects, genetic nurture, vertical transmission, and AM. We also provide the first formal description of how copaths can be used to model multivariate AM, and we derive the corresponding parameter expectations in matrix form. Forward-time Monte Carlo simulations under varying conditions of <inline-formula id="ID1">

The precision of estimates was adequate with large sample sizes (<italic>N<sub>trio</sub> &gt;</italic> 16<italic>k</italic>) and improved as PGS predictive power increased. In addition, our simulation results show that failing to model cross-trait effects biases within-trait estimates, underscoring the importance of incorporating cross-trait effects.

<p>Individuals within a family are phenotypically more similar to each other than to a random group of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kendler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Polderman et al., 2015</xref>). This resemblance has long been recognized and arises from multiple sources, including shared rearing environment, parental influences, cultural values, and genetic inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdellaoui et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engzell &amp; Tropf, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Polderman et al., 2015</xref>). Quantifying the reasons for similarity in specific traits remains challenging because genetic influences are deeply intertwined with environmental factors. For example, in nuclear families, parent-offspring covariance is caused by direct additive genetic effects of the genotype, half of which is shared between parent and offspring, by environmental influences shared between parent and offspring, and by vertical transmission (VT), in which parental phenotypes causally influence offspring through the rearing environment. <italic>Genetic nurture</italic> refers to the influence of parental genetic effects—including alleles not transmitted to offspring—on parental traits that in turn affect offspring outcomes through VT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balbona et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kong et al., 2018</xref>). Because parental phenotypes often reflect both genetic and environmental factors, VT also induces a covariance between direct genetic effects and the familial environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cloninger, 1980</xref>), further increasing parent-offspring covariance. Additional covariance can also arise from assortative mating (AM), which increases the similarity between parents’ and extended family members’ genetic and environmental influences. Disentangling these processes is challenging because they often generate overlapping patterns of phenotypic covariance among family members.</p>
<p>Human genetic researchers have a long history of using structural equation modeling (SEM) to disentangle the sources of familial resemblance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cloninger, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lyu et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">M. Neale &amp; Cardon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wright, 1934</xref>). SEM is a statistical framework used to test a hypothesized causal model using observed data. SEM finds the variances and covariances among variables that are implied by a hypothesized data-generating mechanism and compares these to observed data, typically using maximum likelihood methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kaplan, 2008</xref>). By operationalizing constructs such as genetic and environmental factors as latent variables within an SEM, complex intrafamilial processes can be explicitly modeled. This approach makes it possible to partition variation in traits into genetic and environmental components, to model parental influences such as VT, and to test and account for processes like AM or gene-environment (G-E) covariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Keller et al., 2009</xref>). More broadly, SEM is valuable because it forces explicit specification of causal assumptions, directs attention to effect sizes rather than significance tests, and allows for complex extensions—such as the modeling of recursive relationships or incorporating multivariate data—that would otherwise be mathematically intractable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balbona et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Heath et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">M. Neale &amp; Cardon, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Classical twin designs have traditionally been used to partition phenotypic variation into additive and dominant genetic effects, shared environmental influences, and unique environmental influences, but their estimates can be biased when both non-additive genetic and shared environmental influences simultaneously influence the trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Keller &amp; Coventry, 2005</xref>), or when VT, genetic nurture, G-E covariance, or AM are present but not explicitly modeled. Family designs incorporating additional relatives, such as adoption and extended twin family designs, have improved estimation of these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lyu et al., 2025</xref>). Adoption studies can isolate direct genetic effects and VT, but additional biases can be introduced if prenatal effects, selective placement, and/or ongoing contact between biological parents and adoptees are not appropriately accounted for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Horn et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Rutter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Shih et al., 2004</xref>). Extended twin family designs allow estimation of genetic nurture and AM alongside direct genetic effects, using data from twins’ parents, spouses, and children to account for and mutually estimate these various influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Heath et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Maes et al., 1997</xref>). A hallmark of extended twin family models is the use of non-linear constraints, which describe and constrain recursive relationships between parameters in a way that keeps the overall model internally consistent and identified (e.g., AM and G-E covariance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Keller et al., 2009</xref>). This feature illustrates one of the key advantages of using SEM for modeling familial effects, as it allows recursive processes—such as cases where A influences B, which in turn influences A—to be represented explicitly and estimated within a coherent framework. However, extended twin family designs require large samples to estimate latent effects with precision; obtaining such samples is difficult, and the models rely on strong assumptions about the sources of phenotypic covariance; violations of these assumptions can lead to biased estimates. The growing availability of genomic data offers a complementary and potentially less assumption-dependent alternative: by combining parent and offspring phenotypes with measured parental polygenic scores (PGSs)—the sum of trait-associated alleles weighted by their effect sizes from independent genome-wide association studies (GWASs)—it is possible to directly model the relative contributions of genetic sharing and VT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balbona et al., 2021</xref>). This general approach also facilitates genetically informed research in large, publicly available family genomic datasets, which are more widely available than extended twin family data.</p>
<p>A number of models incorporating PGSs into family models have now been developed and tested across a range of traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">McAdams et al., 2023</xref>). For example, PGSs were incorporated in twin designs to investigate G-E covariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dolan et al., 2021</xref>) and to test causal influences between traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Castro-de-Araujo et al., 2023</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Demange et al. (2022)</xref> used parental PGSs as measured genetic predictors to estimate the environmental, non-genetic effects of parents’ cognitive and non-cognitive skills on their offspring’s educational outcomes, thereby controlling for genetic transmission. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kong et al. (2018)</xref> provided the first empirical evidence for genetic nurture, showing that parental PGSs based on non-transmitted alleles, estimated using haplotype-based PGSs from both parents, predict offspring traits via the environment provided by the parent. Building on this approach, the SEM-PGS model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balbona et al. (2021)</xref> quantifies and accounts for confounding from AM and estimates the total effect of VT, defined as the environmental influence of a parental trait on an offspring trait. Thus, genomic data from large family samples, along with increasingly predictive PGSs, provide information that enables estimation of quantities previously inaccessible or allows them to be estimated in novel ways.</p>
<p>A key limitation of existing PGS-family models is that, with few exceptions—such as the MR-DoC2 model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Castro-de-Araujo et al. (2023)</xref>, which estimates bidirectional causation—they are univariate, focusing on a single phenotype. The lack of multivariate models creates two challenges. First, it limits the ability to investigate cross-trait effects. In intergenerational transmission, for example, one might ask how parental mental health influences offspring educational attainment, accounting for direct genetic effects, genetic nurture, AM, and G-E covariance of each trait. Univariate approaches cannot address such questions adequately; modeling them as univariate problems, as has sometimes been done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kong et al., 2018</xref>), ignores pleiotropy as well as within- and cross-trait AM and VT, and can therefore produce seriously biased cross-trait estimates, as we show below. Second, ignoring cross-trait effects can also bias within-trait estimates. For instance, when estimating the genetic nurture effect of parental BMI on offspring BMI, failing to account for parental educational attainment—which also affects offspring BMI—may upwardly bias the estimated genetic nurture pathway. Given the well-documented phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations between traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium et al., 2013</xref>) and the long tradition of multivariate research in behavioral genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hart et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">McAdams et al., 2014</xref>), it is essential to develop PGS-family models that can estimate and account for cross-trait influences, as univariate models are inherently vulnerable to bias from unmodeled pathways. To address this gap, we introduce the multivariate SEM-PGS model—an extension of our prior univariate SEM-PGS framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balbona et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kim et al., 2021</xref>)—designed to estimate cross-trait familial influences both within and across generations. Below, we present the structure of the model and introduce novel multivariate path-tracing rules. We then use simulations to demonstrate the importance of accounting for multivariate influences and to evaluate the statistical properties of the model’s estimates under two different approaches to fitting the model.</p>

<title>Multivariate SEM-PGS Model</title>
<p>The multivariate SEM-PGS model jointly estimates and accounts for within- trait and cross-trait effects—including direct genetic effects, VT, genetic nurture, and AM—within a unified structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. For clarity of presentation, we focus on a model involving two traits throughout this paper. While extending the model to include three or more traits is mathematically straightforward, given that expectations are derived using matrices rather than scalar equations, such extensions substantially increase model complexity and the number of parameters to be estimated. This added complexity makes interpretation and communication of results much more challenging. Nevertheless, the qualitative conclusions drawn from the bivariate simulations generalize to higher-dimensional models.</p>

<title>Multivariate Path-Tracing Rules</title>
<p>We derived the expected variance-covariance equations using multivariate pathtracing rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Vogler, 1985</xref>). Multivariate path-tracing in SEM is based on the well-known univariate rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cloninger, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wright, 1934</xref>), with some additional rules regarding matrix transposition that are necessary to obtain the correct expectations. The ‘copath’ concept was introduced in univariate SEM to model selection processes such as AM, in which two variables covary without sharing a common antecedent cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cloninger, 1980</xref>). Formal path-tracing rules for copaths in multivariate SEM have not yet been described and require special considerations. Here, we review the multivariate path-tracing rules and extend them to incorporate copaths. Our focus is on the multivariate case, which builds directly on the univariate rules. Readers unfamiliar with the univariate path-tracing rules are encouraged to review them first, as this background will clarify the logic and interpretation of the multivariate extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balbona et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Multivariate path tracing rules:</bold> To aid comprehension of the rules, we first introduce two heuristic definitions: <italic>upstream variable</italic> and <italic>downstream variable</italic>. For variables connected by a single-headed arrow, the variable the arrow points to is defined as downstream, and the variable from which the arrow originates is defined as upstream, as this convention is intuitively consistent with how causation flows from one variable to the next. Unlike “exogenous” and “endogenous” terms in SEM, which are qualities of variables themselves, “upstream” and “downstream” are relative terms that refer to how variables relate to one another: a variable may be upstream of one variable and downstream of another. With these definitions in mind, we list below the multivariate path tracing rules for all components in an SEM model:

It is untransposed when traversing from the downstream variable to the upstream variable (against the direction of the arrow). If a path coefficient matrix is a full matrix, the upstream variable should be placed along the columns of the matrix, and the downstream variable should be placed along the row of the matrix.

<list-item><p><underline>Rules for covariance matrices</underline>: A covariance matrix is represented by a double-headed arrow in path diagrams.Variables connected by double-headed arrows are not truly upstream or downstream of one another—they occupy the same level in a causal pathway. However, because covariance matrices can sometimes be full rather than symmetric (due to them being a subsection of a larger symmetric variance-covariance matrix), a transposition rule is needed. Thus, as with other matrices, a full covariance matrix is transposed when traversing from the upstream variable to the downstream variable. As long as users apply a consistent convention when arbitrarily designating such variables as upstream or downstream, the path-tracing rules described here will yield the correct variance-covariance expectations. For example, one possible approach, and the one we recommend, is to consistently assign the parental variables as upstream of offspring ones and female spouses upstream of male spouses. As with other path coefficient matrices, upstream variables should be placed along the columns and downstream variables along the rows.

<p>This matrix can be partitioned into four 2 × 2 covariance submatrices. The two <bold>V</bold><italic><sub>y</sub></italic> matrices along the diagonal represent the within-person phenotypic variance-covariance matrices between the paternal and two maternal phenotypes, respectively, and are symmetric. In contrast, the two off-diagonal mate submatrices are transpositions of one another and are full matrices, because their own off-diagonal elements correspond to conceptually different constructs. Moreover, given the equation for mate covariance, <italic>COV</italic>(<bold>Y</bold><italic><sub>p</sub></italic>,<bold>Y</bold><italic><sub>m</sub></italic>) = <bold>V</bold><italic><sub>Yp</sub></italic><bold><italic>μ</italic>V</bold><italic><sub>Ym</sub></italic>, and the fact that both <bold>V</bold><sub><italic>Y</italic></sub> matrices are symmetric, it follows that <bold>μ</bold> must also be a full matrix.

<title>Parameters and Their Interpretations</title>
<p>Using multivariate path-tracing rules, we derived the expectations of all the variance and covariance listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> in the Supplement. In this section, we outline the conceptual meaning of key estimated parameters.</p>
<p>Direct additive genetic effects are modeled through the path coefficients <bold><italic>δ</italic></bold> and <bold>a</bold>. Both are diagonal matrices, as pleiotropy between the two traits in the base population is captured in the off-diagonal elements of the <bold>k</bold> and <bold>j</bold> matrices, while the increase in additive genetic (co)variance induced by AM is quantified in the <bold>g</bold>, <bold>h</bold>, and <bold>i</bold> matrices. The coefficient <bold><italic>δ</italic></bold> indexes the additive genetic effects of haplotypic PGSs on <italic>Y</italic> , whereas <bold>a</bold> indexes residual additive genetic effects not captured by haplotypic PGSs. For almost all traits currently, <bold>a</bold> » <bold><italic>δ</italic></bold>. Information for estimating <bold><italic>δ</italic></bold> is easily estimable from the covariance between the haplotypic PGSs and <bold>Y</bold>, after correcting for the effects of AM and genetic nurture. Information for estimating <bold>a</bold> can come from the residual covariance between <bold>Y</bold><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> and <bold>Y</bold><sub><italic>p/m</italic></sub> after accounting for all other parameters estimated in the model, though because other factors besides additive direct and indirect genetic effects, VT, and AM can increase parent-offspring covariance, it may be preferable to obtain this parameter from external sources such as RDR regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Young et al., 2018</xref>). The total additive genetic variance of a trait is then derived by tracing all paths that begin with <bold><italic>δ</italic></bold> and <bold>a</bold> and return to the phenotype (<bold>Y</bold><sub><italic>p/m</italic></sub>).</p>
<p>The <bold>k</bold> matrix represents the variance-covariance of the haplotypic PGSs in the base population (before AM). Similarly, <bold>j</bold> is defined as the genetic variance of the haplotypic latent genetic score (LGS) in the base population. The values of <bold>k</bold> depend on the scaling of the haplotypic PGSs. Below are several ways to fix the value of <italic>k<sub>ii</sub></italic> - the diagonal entries of trait <italic>i</italic> in the <bold>k</bold> matrix:

<p>However, unlike <bold>k</bold>, <bold>j</bold> is the variance of a latent construct and can take any arbitrary value. The simplest choice is to set <italic>j<sub>ii</sub></italic> = <italic>k<sub>ii</sub></italic> and we recommend doing so because this allows the estimates of <bold>a</bold> and <bold><italic>δ</italic></bold> to be comparable. <italic>k</italic><sub>12</sub> and <italic>j</italic><sub>12</sub> are freely estimated parameters that represent the scaled genetic covariance between the two haplotypic PGSs (<italic>k</italic><sub>12</sub>) or the two haplotypic LGSs (<italic>j</italic><sub>12</sub>) , respectively, after accounting for AM and G-E covariance. In the version of the model described here, the coefficients <bold><italic>δ</italic></bold> and <bold>a</bold> for parents are constrained to equal those for offspring. This assumption may be violated when the measured phenotype reflects a different construct, or when its genetic architecture differs across age or cohort (e.g., substance use)—a point we return to in the Discussion. We also assume <italic>k</italic><sub>12</sub> = <italic>j</italic><sub>12</sub>, implying that the correlation of allelic effects between traits is the same for variants captured and not captured by the PGS. This assumption is probably typically met, but could fail, for instance, if the genetic correlation between traits differs for rare versus common variants, given that common variant effects are currently better captured by PGSs.</p>
<p>The VT effect is modeled by the path coefficient matrix <bold>f</bold> . VT represents the direct influence of parental phenotypes on offspring phenotypes. Most often this reflects the impact of parental traits on offspring traits through parental behavior, though other pathways (e.g., in utero effects) are also possible. <bold>f</bold> is a full matrix: the effects of parental trait 1 on offspring trait 2 can be different than the effects of parental trait 2 on offspring trait 1. The estimation of <bold>f</bold> depends most strongly on the ratio <?math-size 1.5?><inline-formula id="ID59">

</inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balbona et al., 2021</xref>). Put simply, when the association of non-transmitted alleles with offspring outcomes grows relative to that of transmitted alleles, this pattern indicates VT, because the nontransmitted alleles can affect offspring only indirectly by shaping parental behavior and environments. By leveraging parental PGSs based on transmitted and non-transmitted alleles in this way, <bold>f</bold> can be estimated without confounding from shared parent-offspring genes. Embedding this approach within the SEM framework further reduces bias from AM and from genetic variance not captured by the PGS.</p>
<p><italic>Genetic nurture</italic> refers to parental genetic effects—including non-transmitted alle- les—that influence offspring outcomes indirectly via the parental environment, a process arising through VT(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balbona et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kong et al., 2018</xref>). Our model quantifies genetic nurture through two mediated pathways, <bold>ϕ</bold> and <bold><italic>ρ</italic></bold>. Specifically, <italic><bold>ϕ</bold></italic> represents the effect of full PGSs (the sum of two haplotypic PGSs) on offspring outcomes as mediated through parental traits, while <bold><italic>ρ</italic></bold> represents the corresponding effect of full LGSs.

<p>Here, <italic><bold>ϕ</bold></italic> and <italic><bold><italic>ρ</italic></bold></italic> represent genetic nurture that stems from founder-generation additive genetic effects—the “pure” genetic nurture effect not distorted by AM. Because <bold>f</bold> is a full matrix, both <italic><bold>ϕ</bold></italic> and <italic><bold><italic>ρ</italic></bold></italic> are also full, allowing asymmetric cross-trait genetic nurture in which the genetic nurture effect of trait 1 on trait 2 can differ from that of trait 2 on trait 1. The <bold><italic>ϕ</italic></bold> and <italic><bold><italic>ρ</italic></bold></italic> are defined in a way that is independent of the influence of AM, so they target different estimands compared to other available methods, such as <italic>η</italic> and regression coefficients in regression-based methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">McAdams et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Young et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted above, we model AM using a copath <italic><bold>μ</bold></italic>. AM refers to nonrandom mating, in which individuals preferentially pair with others who share similar or dissimilar traits at rates exceeding chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Vandenberg, 1972</xref>). The copath was introduced as an elegant way to model AM in path diagrams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cloninger, 1980</xref>), but has rarely been applied in multivariate family models—with only one exception we are aware of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Maes et al., 1997</xref>). In this paper, we formally lay out the multivariate copath rules for SEM and use them to model multivariate AM. Copaths provide a path tracing framework that links the expected covariance between parental phenotypes and their haplotypic PGSs to the observed data.

<p>AM increases the genetic variance in the population and the genetic covariance between relatives and mates. In our model, this is captured with the <bold>g</bold>, <bold>h</bold>, and <bold>i</bold> parameters. Specifically, <bold>g</bold> generally represents the increase in the genetic (co)variance of haplotypic PGSs between two traits under AM. We used different subscripts “t” and “c” to denote trans-individual (i.e., between mate) and cis-individual (within-person) haplotypic PGS covariances, respectively. For example, <bold>g</bold><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is a full matrix representing the AM-induced covariance between maternal and paternal haplotypic PGSs. <bold>g</bold><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is a full matrix for the same reason that <italic><bold>μ</bold></italic> is full. In contrast, <bold>g</bold><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> is a symmetric matrix representing (a) the AM-induced increase in the covariance between the two haplotypic PGSs within-person or, equivalently, (b) the AM-induced increase in their variance. Although <bold>g</bold><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> is the covariance matrix between two distinct variables, <bold>T</bold><sub><italic>p/m</italic></sub> and <bold>NT</bold><sub><italic>p/m</italic></sub> , and would be expected to be full according to our previously described rules, it must be symmetric for biological reasons. This symmetry arises from the randomness of haplotype formation during meiosis, as haplotypes are defined relative to the offspring genotype. Analogous to <bold>g</bold>, <bold>h</bold><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> and <bold>h</bold><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> represent increases in latent genetic covariance for trans- and cis- covariances, respectively. Finally, unlike the matrices <bold>g</bold><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> and <bold>h</bold><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, <bold>i</bold><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> is the full within-individual covariance matrix between <?math-size 1?><inline-formula id="ID62">

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of the Multivariate SEM- PGS model, focusing on two questions. First, we assessed bias by testing whether the model’s median estimates were systematically different from the true simulated parameters. Second, we evaluated the precision of these estimates as a function of sample size and PGS effect size. To address the first question, we simulated evolutionary processes across generations using an R implementation of the GeneEvolve software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tahmasbi &amp; Keller, 2017</xref>). Unlike methods that draw phenotypes directly from a multivariate normal distribution, GeneEvolve uses a forward-time simulation approach by generating a baseline population that evolves according to predefined mating and reproductive rules. Thus, GeneEvolve simulates the underlying causal processes instead of relying on model-implied covariance matrices, thereby providing an independent way to validate our derived equations and to examine how parameter estimates behave when model assumptions deviate from the true causal processes. To address the second question regarding estimate precision, we simulated two traits and their haplotypic PGSs directly from the model-implied multivariate normal distribution. The covariance matrix, Σ, for this distribution was derived from multivariate path-tracing from our model diagram. Because the forward-time simulations already established that the model produced unbiased estimates, we did not need to revisit bias here. Instead, this approach isolates estimation precision by avoiding the additional stochasticity inherent to forward-time simulators, which can inflate the variance of parameter estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2025</xref>). All R scripts for this article are available on our GitHub repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Xuanyu-Lyu/BiSEMPGS">https://github.com/Xuanyu-Lyu/BiSEMPGS</ext-link>).</p>

</inline-formula>, reflecting the VT process. We created phenotypic scores of offspring by summing genetic scores, family environmental scores, and residual environmental scores (<italic><bold>ϵ</bold></italic>). The algorithms for mating and reproduction iterated through several generations. We used PGSs and phenotypic scores from the final generation as inputs for model fitting.</p>
<p>A key challenge in forward-time simulations is modeling cross-trait AM and its genetic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Border &amp; Malik, 2023</xref>). To impose the target mate correlation matrix (<bold>r</bold><sub><italic>mate</italic></sub>) across two traits, we first split the generation’s phenotypic data into males and females and constructed a four-dimensional template of correlated scores, <italic>X</italic><sub>sim</sub> = (<italic>m</italic><sub>1</sub> , <italic>m</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>), by drawing from <italic>N</italic> (<bold>0</bold>, <bold>Σ</bold>). The off-diagonal symmetric entries of <bold>Σ</bold> were set to the empirical correlations between the two traits in that generation, while the 2-by-2 block linking males and females was defined by the user-specified <bold>r</bold><sub><italic>mate</italic></sub> . We then computed Euclidean distance matrices between observed, standardized phenotypes {<italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>Y</italic><sub>2</sub>} and their corresponding template vectors for males and females, and greedily paired individuals using a duplicate-removal/matching routine that minimized total distance, thereby aligning the realized cross-partner correlation structure with <bold>Σ</bold>. This template-guided matching roughly approach achieved both within-trait and cross-trait AM patterns specified by <bold>r</bold><sub><italic>mate</italic></sub> while preserving the observed phenotype distributions within each sex.Nevertheless, this approach consistently produced <bold>r</bold><sub><italic>mate</italic></sub> values slightly (e.g., &lt; .01) below the target correlation in each generation. This discrepancy resulted in small deviations in the estimated <italic><bold>μ</bold></italic> and <bold>g</bold><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> values from their true population values (see details in Results). To address this limitation, we also fit the model using data generated directly from a covariance matrix derived from mathematical expectations.</p>

<title>Multivariate Normal Simulations</title>
<p>We used multivariate normal simulations to assess the precision of parameter estimates. These simulations were performed by sampling PGSs and phenotypic scores from the model-implied covariance matrix derived from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This task was not straightforward because, while some parameters can be pre-defined, others are nonlinear functions of multiple parameters. Such dependencies arise from the recursive interrelationships among variables: for example, AM and VT alter G-E covariance across generations, which in turn modifies genetic variances, further feeding back into G-E covariance. Therefore, to find the model-implied covariance, we implemented an iterative algorithm that specified baseline values and then simulated how parameters evolved across generations under the evolutionary processes represented in our model. Our models assumed equilibrium—that is, a population state in which phenotypic and genetic variances remain constant across generations due to a balance between variance-increasing forces (AM and VT) and variance-reducing forces such as recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bulmer, 1971</xref>). Thus, parameter values were retained once they stabilized across generations, indicating equilibrium. Specifically, in the multivariate SEM-PGS model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>), <bold>f</bold>, <bold>r<sub>mate</sub></bold>, <bold>V<sub>G</sub></bold>, <bold>V<sub>E</sub></bold>, <inline-formula id="ID77">

<p>We fit models using OpenMx with the NPSOL optimizer to address the non-linear constraints in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">M. C. Neale et al., 2016</xref>). We used the median estimate across 500 models run on forward-time simulated data to evaluate bias, and the median absolute deviation (MAD) on 500 models run on multivariate normally distributed data to evaluate precision. We report median and MAD as primary statistics because they are robust to outliers, which complex SEM models with non-linear constraints can occasionally produce, even with large sample sizes. Based on our experience, approximately 3-4% of models yielded outlier estimates when <italic>N<sub>trio</sub></italic> = 8<italic>k</italic>, decreasing to around 1% when <italic>N<sub>trio</sub></italic> = 64<italic>k</italic>. Because the number of estimates in the bivariate SEM-PGS model is very large, we limited those presented to keep the paper manageable and accessible. Specifically, we report two sets of results: eight within-trait estimates for trait 1 and eight cross-trait estimates between traits 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We show the bias of parameter estimates as a function of <italic>N<sub>trio</sub></italic> and their precision as a function of both <italic>N<sub>trio</sub></italic> and <inline-formula id="ID89">

To evaluate the effect of fixing <bold>a</bold> on the precision of other parameter estimates, we fitted each simulated MVN dataset in two ways: (1) with the latent genetic path coefficient <bold>a</bold> fixed to its true value, and (2) with <bold>a</bold> freely estimated. As a follow-up, we performed a sensitivity analysis investigating the bias introduced by fixing <bold>a</bold> to incorrect values.

<p>Finally, we investigated the effect on parameter estimates when a univariate model is applied to a truly bivariate data-generating phenotypic architecture. We simulated two scenarios (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>): (1) a phenotypic architecture characterized by strong within-trait and weak cross-trait effects; and (2) a phenotypic architecture dominated by weak within-trait and strong cross-trait effects. In both scenarios, the genetic correlation in the founder generation was set to zero to simplify interpretation. To quantify the bias, we fit a univariate SEM-PGS model on trait 1. For each condition, we generated 500 replicate datasets with <italic>N<sub>trio</sub></italic> = 64,000.</p>

<title>Estimate Bias Using a Univariate Model When the Phenotypic Architecture Is Truly Bivariate</title>

<title>A Novel Tool for Gene-Environment Interplay</title>
<p>By integrating parental and offspring phenotypes with transmitted and nontransmitted PGSs for multiple traits in a SEM framework, the multivariate SEM-PGS model introduces a novel approach to studying genetic and environmental processes within families. Unlike traditional family designs that rely on assumptions about the sources of phenotypic resemblance, this framework uses directly observable relationships between phenotypes and transmitted and non-transmitted PGSs to provide empirical evidence of VT and AM. Moreover, recent family-based models that utilize PGSs have estimated direct and indirect genetic effects for single traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balbona et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kong et al., 2018</xref>), but have not properly accounted for cross-trait influences. For instance, parental traits may often influence different offspring traits (i.e., cross-trait VT, such as parental education influencing offspring BMI) and parents may assort across different traits (e.g., across different psychiatric disorders). In this manuscript, we have demonstrated that within-trait estimates may also reflect unmodeled cross-trait effects, and not modeling these cross-trait influences, or modeling them in a univariate framework, can lead to incorrect inference.</p>
<p>Through forward-time simulations, we confirmed that the multivariate SEM-PGS model provides unbiased estimates of direct genetic effects (<bold>a</bold> and <bold><italic>δ</italic></bold>), VT effects (<bold>f</bold>), genetic nurture effects (<bold><italic>ϕ</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>ρ</italic></bold>), G-E covariance <italic><bold>w</bold></italic> and <italic><bold>v</bold></italic>, AM effects (<italic><bold>μ</bold></italic>), and other parameters when its assumptions are met.

First, it requires large family-based datasets with genomic information; at present, only a few resources, such as the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), meet these criteria. However, the number of such datasets is expected to grow in the coming decade, given the distinct advantages of family-based genomic data over individual-level data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davies et al., 2024</xref>). Second, the model is currently limited to traits with sufficiently high <inline-formula id="ID114">
<alternatives>
<mml:math display="inline" id="I114"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup>

</alternatives>
</inline-formula> . While this threshold is already met for many traits, the expansion of large-scale GWASs will likely increase the range of traits for which the model can be applied.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that fitting a univariate SEM-PGS model to data with an underlying bivariate causal structure introduces bias in multiple estimates, particularly when there are strong cross-trait effects. For instance, a significant indirect genetic effect estimate for <bold>f</bold> in a univariate analysis of depressive symptoms could be an artifact from an unmodeled trait that is genetically correlated with depression. While these indirect effects are themselves real, the parameters must be interpreted with the caveat that they may represent integrated effects from multiple pathways. This same caution applies to the interpretation of multivariate SEM-PGS results, as it is practically infeasible to account for all potential inter-generational transmission pathways with a limited number of measured phenotypes. By the same token, our results suggest that attempting to estimate cross-trait effects using a univariate model can also lead to biased estimates, and such models should be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>Building on our previous univariate model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balbona et al., 2021</xref>), the present framework provides a more refined parameterization of genetic nurture. In the univariate setting, the G-E covariance (<italic><bold>w</bold></italic>) and genetic nurture (the effect of parental genes on offspring mediated through parental phenotype) are conceptually distinct but numerically identical. This equivalence arises because the same set of genes that influence the parental phenotype, and thereby affect the offspring phenotype through VT, also influence the offspring phenotype directly. This equivalence does not hold once cross-trait effects are introduced. For example, when parental trait 1 influences offspring trait 2 through VT, the genes that shape parental trait 1 are not identical to the genes directly influencing offspring trait 2. In such cases, genetic nurture still contributes to cross-trait G-E covariance, but it is no longer reducible to either of the within-trait G-E covariance terms or even to the cross-trait covariance term itself. In a multivariate context, therefore, G-E covariance and genetic nurture are related but not synonymous.</p>
<p>To capture this distinction, we introduce two parameters in the multivariate SEM-PGS model, <bold>ϕ</bold> and <italic><bold><italic>ρ</italic></bold></italic>, that explicitly represent genetic nurture pathways. These parameters separate genetic nurture effects arising from both within-trait and cross-trait influences, and they are defined so as to be independent of AM. This framework clarifies the interpretation of genetic nurture in multivariate models and differentiates our approach from earlier measures such as <italic>η</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kong et al. (2018)</xref> and the regression-based <italic>α</italic> estimates summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Young et al. (2022)</xref>, both of which can be conflated with AM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4-2">
<title>Model Assumptions</title>
<p>Like all statistical models, the current model relies on several assumptions regarding genetic effects, AM, and environmental influences to provide accurate estimates. First, as currently implemented when estimating <bold>a</bold> within the model itself rather than using external estimates to fix it, the model assumes that the residual parent-offspring covariance after</p>
<p>accounting for VT, AM, and direct PGS effects is purely due to additive genetic factors, and uses this residual covariance to estimate <bold>a</bold>. However, in truth, this residual covariance is unlikely to be purely genetic in origin; for example, shared environmental influences can also contribute. As a result, estimating <bold>a</bold> directly within the model can lead to biased estimates of other quanities. Unbiased estimates of <bold>a</bold> can instead be obtained from external methods such as Relatedness Disequilibrium Regression (RDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Young et al., 2018</xref>) or sibling-based regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Visscher et al., 2006</xref>), including multivariate extensions of these approaches. For example, in trio datasets with parental genotypes and offspring phenotypes, RDR can be used to estimate founder-generation genetic variance, from which <bold>a</bold> can be derived by imposing an additional constraint on the total additive genetic variance in the base population: <bold>VA</bold><sub><italic>Base</italic></sub> = (<bold>a</bold><sup>2</sup>+<bold><italic>δ</italic></bold><sup>2</sup>)(<bold>a</bold><sup>2</sup>+<bold><italic>δ</italic></bold><sup>2</sup>+<bold>V</bold><sub>ϵ</sub>). Fixing <bold>a</bold> in this way reduces the standard errors of other parameters, enabling analyses in smaller samples and with weaker PGSs. However, for this approach to provide valid standard errors of estimates, the uncertainty in the external estimate of <bold>a</bold> should be incorporated into the SEM-PGS model. One strategy (a parametric bootstrap approach)is to draw <bold>a</bold> repeatedly from a normal distribution with mean equal to its point estimate and standard deviation equal to its standard error, refitting the model at each draw. This propagates uncertainty from the independent method into the SEM-PGS framework. Alternatively, this same principle could be implemented in a Bayesian framework by placing a prior on <bold>a</bold> informed by its external estimate. Our sensitivity analyses suggest that small misspecifications of <bold>a</bold> have limited impact on most estimates, but cross-trait VT and G-E covariance parameters are more vulnerable. It is important to note that, if parental phenotypes are included in the model, an additional latent factor (e.g., a shared environmental factor across both generations) should also be specified to absorb any residual parent-offspring covariance, ensuring that the model fits well. Alternatively, it is possible to simply omit parental phenotypes altogether when fixing <bold>a</bold> and still achieve unbiased estimates of all other parameters. Overall, future SEM-PGS models should aim to better estimate <bold>a</bold> internally (e.g., by incorporating sibling or extended relative information), but in the meantime, we believe that drawing on external approaches such as RDR will generally yield nearly unbiased estimates.</p>
<p>Second, the model assumes that genetic effects are consistent between parents and offspring. Specifically, it posits that <italic><bold>δ</bold><sub>p/m</sub></italic> = <italic><bold>δ</bold><sub>o</sub></italic> and <bold>a</bold><sub><italic>p/m</italic></sub> = <bold>a</bold><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> . The model also implicitly assumes a genetic correlation of unity between parental and offspring phenotypes. This assumption may be reasonable for traits such as height or weight, but may be violated in practice when social traits are measured at different ages or when the factors influencing the phenotype differ across cohorts. To address this limitation, we are working on extending the model by using informatio on additional relatives to allow parental genetic effects to differ from offspring genetic effects.</p>
<p>Third, the model assumes equivalence in genetic correlation between latent and observed genetic variables (<italic>k</italic><sub>12</sub> = <italic>j</italic><sub>12</sub>). This assumption is generally plausible, since measured causal alleles are likely to resemble unmeasured (latent) alleles in their cross-trait genetic correlations. However, this assumption might be violated if common variants (more likely captured by PGSs) and rare variants differ in their contributions to cross-trait genetic correlations.</p>
<p>Fourth, the model assumes the absence of dominance or epistasis effects. This assumption is common in most statistical genetic models, as estimating dominance or epistasis at the level of PGSs is challenging and rarely attempted. However, since dominance and epistasis genetic effects are statistically orthogonal components to additive genetic effects, ignoring them is only likely to inflate <bold>V</bold><sub><italic>ϵ</italic></sub>, which alters the interpretation of <bold>V</bold><sub><italic>ϵ</italic></sub> but should not bias or otherwise alter interpretations of other parameter estimates.</p>
<p>Fifth, in its present form, it assumes that VT effects are identical for both father and mother (<bold>f</bold><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = <bold>f</bold><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>). This assumption may not hold true for certain traits where VT from mothers differs from fathers. It would be simple to reparameterize the model to allow for sex-different VT paths, although doing so would reduce estimates’ precision.</p>
<p>Finally, the SEM-PGS model makes two assumptions about AM. One is that assortment is primarily phenotypic, even though in practice it may also arise through social homogamy or genetic homogamy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>). Because these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, misclassifying the source of AM can bias parameter estimates by leaving residual spousal similarity unaccounted for. For example, treating social homogamy as phenotypic assortment could lead to underestimation of environmental influences such as <bold>V</bold><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> and <bold>w</bold>. In our simulations, however, misspecifying social or genetic homogamy as phenotypic assortment produced only limited bias in the final parameter estimates. Furthermore, a major advantage of incorporating genomic data is that the type of AM can be tested empirically before fitting the full bivariate SEM-PGS model. This is done by comparing the observed spousal phenotypic correlation (<bold>g</bold>) to the correlation implied by haplotypic PGSs: if the latter exceeds the observed correlation, it suggests genetic homogamy, whereas if the observed correlation is larger, it implies social homogamy. The SEM-PGS framework has sufficient data to estimate these correlations and can be extended to model each contribution directly by adding latent AM factors. We have previously implemented such modifications in the Cascade model, which is based on extended twin family data, and adapting them here would be straightforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Keller et al., 2009</xref>). Alternatively, a shared environmental factor between parents could be added to the model to soak up residual spousal covariance not captured by that implied from the spousal PGS covariance.</p>
<p>Another assumption is that AM has reached equilibrium, meaning that the level of assortment in the parental generation matches that in the offspring generation. Again, an advantage of using genomic data is that this assumption can be evaluated by comparing the within-trait increase in the covariance of within-individual haplotypic PGSs (<bold>g</bold><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>), which reflects AM in the grandparental generation and before, to the covariance of cross-individual haplotypic PGSs (.5(<inline-formula id="ID115">

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, we introduced the multivariate SEM-PGS model, a flexible statistical framework that integrates within- and cross-trait direct genetic effects, genetic nurture, G-E covariance, VT, and AM into a single structural equation modeling approach. A key innovation is the development of multivariate path-tracing rules, which enable rigorous modeling of cross-trait AM. Simulations demonstrated that the model yields unbiased estimates and increasing precision with larger trio samples and more predictive polygenic scores, while a complementary strategy of borrowing information from external methods highlights its adaptability. We provide practical suggestions for fitting the model in the Supplement, but emphasize that the exemplar specification presented here should be adapted to the unique properties of different datasets. Although the framework rests on assumptions and requires relatively large family-genomic samples, it offers a general foundation that can be tailored for different data and questions. By providing tools to disentangle complex intergenerational pathways, the multivariate SEM-PGS model advances the study of how genetic and environmental influences combine to shape human traits and lays the groundwork for future extensions to more nuanced and biologically informed models.</p>

<title>Parameter Expectations</title>
<p>This section provides a step-by-step guide to deriving the expected values of all estimated parameters. Throughout, symbols in the equations correspond to the matrices defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>. To simplify notation, we write [<italic>N</italic>]<italic>T<sub>p/m</sub></italic> to indicate any of <italic>NT<sub>p</sub></italic>, <italic>T<sub>p</sub></italic>, <italic>NT<sub>m</sub></italic>, or <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> , where subscripts <italic>p</italic> and <italic>m</italic> refer to paternal and maternal haplotypes, respectively, and where <italic>NT</italic> stands for the haplotypic PGS not transmitted and <italic>T</italic> for the haplotypic PGS transmitted to offspring. The “<italic>L</italic>” in <italic>LNT</italic> and <italic>LT</italic> stands for “latent” (as opposed to the observed haplotypic PGSs). Finally, subscripts “<italic>LO</italic>” in, e.g., <italic>itLO</italic> stand for “latent to observed&quot;. For each parameter, we first show the relevant path-tracing chain (given in parentheses for convenience). For example, <italic>Y<sub>p/m</sub></italic> → [<italic>N</italic>]<italic>T<sub>p/m</sub></italic> denotes the path tracing starts with <italic>Y<sub>p/m</sub></italic> and finishes at [<italic>N</italic>]<italic>T<sub>p/m</sub></italic> , which means <italic>Y<sub>p/m</sub></italic> is the downstream variable and [<italic>N</italic>]<italic>T<sub>p/m</sub></italic> is the upstream variable. We then present the corresponding mathematical derivation. This approach is intended to make the logic of each step transparent, so that readers can see how expectations arise from simple path-tracing rules and so that the model can be altered depending on the data and questions at hand.</p>

<title>Assuming Equilibrium AM</title>
<p>We define the Ω parameters as “shortcuts” or shorthand covariances to facilitate the derivation of other parameter expectations. Specifically, they represent the covariance between haplotypic PGSs and parental phenotypes. We show both non-transposed and transposed forms, as each is useful for deriving subsequent expectations.</p>

<p>Unlike <italic>g</italic> and <italic>h</italic>, the covariance between the the haplotypic PGSs and the haplotypic LGS, <italic>i</italic>, is a full matrix (the covariance between the PGS of trait 1 and the LGS of trait 2 is conceptually different than the covariance between the PGS of trait 2 and the LGS of trait 1) and so requires special attention regarding when it is transposed. For <italic>i<sub>t</sub></italic> , we adopt the convention (arbitrarily but consistently with <italic>μ</italic> in the model) that the paternal variable (<italic>L</italic>[<italic>N</italic>]<italic>T<sub>p</sub></italic> and [<italic>N</italic>]<italic>T<sub>p</sub></italic>) is downstream and the maternal (<italic>L</italic>[<italic>N</italic>]<italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> and [<italic>N</italic>]<italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>) variable is upstream, and denote the order in the <italic>i</italic> subscripts. For <italic>i<sub>c</sub></italic> , we adopt a convention that LGSs are the downstream and PGSs are the upstream.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors develop a multivariate extension of SEM models incorporating transmitted and non-transmitted polygenic scores to disentangle genetic and environmental intergenerational effects across multiple traits. Their goal is to enable unbiased estimation of cross-trait vertical transmission, genetic nurture, gene-environment covariance, and assortative mating within a single coherent framework. By formally deriving multivariate path-tracing rules and validating the model through simulation, they show that ignoring cross-trait structure can severely bias both cross- and within-trait estimates. The proposed method provides a principled tool for studying complex gene-environment interplay in family genomic data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It has become apparent in recent years that multivariate processes play an important role in genetic effects that are studied (e.g., Border et al., 2022), and these processes can affect the interpretation of these studies. This paper develops a comprehensive framework for polygenic score studies using trio data. Their model allows for assortative mating, vertical transmission, gene-environment correlation, and genetic nurture. Their study makes it clear that within-trait and cross-trait influences are important considerations. While their exposition and simulation focus on a bivariate model, the authors point out that their approach can be easily extended to higher-dimensional applications.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) My primary concern is that the paper is very difficult to follow. Perhaps this is inevitable for a model as complicated as this one. Admittedly, I have limited experience working with SEMs, so that might be partly why I really struggled with this paper, but I ultimately still have many questions about how to interpret many aspects of the path diagram, even after spending a considerable amount of time with it. Below, I will try to point out the areas where I got confused (and some where I still am confused). If the authors choose to revise the paper, clarifying some of these points would substantially broaden the paper's accessibility and impact.</p>
<p>(1a) Figure 1 contains a large number of paths and variable names, and it is not always apparent which variables correspond to which paths. For example, at a first glance, the &quot;k + g_c&quot; term next to the &quot;T_m&quot; box could arguably correspond to any of the four paths near it. Disentangling this requires finding other, more reasonable variables for the other lines and sifting through the 3 pages of tables describing the elements of the figure.</p>
<p>(1b) More hand-holding, describing the different parameters in the model, would help readers who don't have experience with SEMs. For example, many parameters show up several times (e.g., delta, a, g_c, i_c, w) and describing what these parameters are and why they show up several times would help. Some of this information is found in the tables (e.g., &quot;Note: [N]T denotes either NT or T, as both share the same matrix content&quot;), though I don't believe it is explained what it means to &quot;share the same matrix content.&quot;</p>
<p>(1c) Relatedly, descriptions of the path tracing were very confusing to me. I was relieved to see the example on the bottom of page 10 and top of page 11, but then as I tried to follow the example, I was again confused. Because multiple paths have the same labels, I was not able to follow along which exact path from Figure 1 corresponded to the elements of the sum that made up Theta_{Tm}. Also, based on my understanding of the path-tracing rules described, some paths seemed to be missing. After a while, I think I decided that these paths were captured by the (1/2)*w term since that term didn't seem to be represented by any particular path in the figure, but I'm still not confident I'm right. In this example, rather than referring to things like &quot;four paths through the increased genetic covariance from AM&quot;, it might be useful to identify the exact paths represented by indicating the nodes those paths go through. If there aren't space constraints, the authors might even consider adding a figure which just contains the relevant paths for the example</p>
<p>(1d) The paper has many acronyms and variable names that are defined early in the paper and used throughout. Generally, I would limit acronyms wherever possible in a setting like this, where readers are not necessarily specialists. For the variables, while the definitions are technically found in the paper, it would be useful to readers if they were reminded what the variables stood for when they are referred to later, especially if that particular variable hasn't been mentioned for a while. As I read, I found myself constantly having to scroll back up to the several pages of figures and tables to remind myself of what certain variables meant. Then I would have to find where I was again. It really made a dense paper even harder to follow.</p>
<p>(1e) Relatedly, on page 13, the authors make reference to a parameter eta, and I don't see it in Figure 1 or any of the tables. What is that parameter?</p>
<p>(2) This point may be related to me misunderstanding the model, but if LT_p represent the actual genetic factors for the two traits for variants that are transmitted to the child, and T_p represents the PGS of for transmitted variants, shouldn't their be a unidirectional arrow from LT_p to T_p (since the genetic factor affects the PGS and not the other way around) and shouldn't there be no arrow from T_p to Y_0 (since the entire effect of the transmitted SNPs is represented by the arrow from LT_p to Y_0)? If I'm mistaken here, it would be useful to explain why these arrows are necessary.</p>
<p>(3) Some explanation of how the interpretation of the coefficients differs in a univariate model versus a bivariate model would be useful. For example, in a univariate model, the delta parameter represents the &quot;direct effect&quot; of the PGI on the offspring's outcome (roughly corresponding to a regression of the offspring's outcome onto the offspring's PGI and each parent's PGI). Does it have the same interpretation in the bivariate case, or is it more closely related to a regression of one of the outcomes onto the PGIs for both traits?</p>
<p>(4) It appears from the model that the authors are assuming away population stratification since the path coefficient between T_m and T_m is delta (the same as the path coefficient between T_m and Y_0). Similarly, I believe the effect of NT_m on Y_0 only has a genetic nurture interpretation if there is no population stratification. Some discussion of this would be valuable.</p>

<p>(1) Summary and overall comments:</p>
<p>This is an impressive and carefully executed methodological paper developing an SEM framework with substantial potential. The manuscript is generally very well written, and I particularly appreciated the pedagogical approach: the authors guide the reader step by step through a highly complex model, with detailed explanations of the structure and the use of path tracing rules. While this comes at the cost of length, I think the effort is largely justified given the technical audience and the novelty of the contribution.</p>
<p>The proposed SEM aims to estimate cross-trait indirect genetic effects and assortative mating, using genotype and phenotype data from both parents and one offspring, and builds on the framework introduced by Balbona et al. While I see the potential interest of the model, it is still a bit unclear in which conditions I could use it in practice. However, this paper made a clear argument for the need for cross-traits models, which changed my mind on the topic (I would have accommodated myself with univariate models and only interpreted in the light of likely pleiotropy, but I am now excited by the potential to actually disentangle cross-traits effects).</p>
<p>The paper is written in a way that makes me trust the authors' thoroughness and care, even when I do not fully understand every step of the model. I want to stress that I am probably not well-positioned to identify technical errors in the implementation. My comments should therefore be interpreted primarily from the perspective of a potential user of the method: I focus on what I understand, what I do not, and where I see (or fail to see) the practical benefits.</p>
<p>For transparency, here is some context on my background. I have strong familiarity with the theoretical concepts involved (e.g., genetic nurture, gene-environment covariance, dynastic effects), and I have worked on those with PGS regressions and family-based comparison designs. My experience with SEM is limited to relatively simple models, and I have never used OpenMx. Reading this paper was therefore quite demanding for me, although still a better experience than many similarly technical papers, precisely because of the authors' clear effort to explain the model in detail. That said, keeping track of all moving parts in such a complex framework was difficult, and some components remain obscure to me.</p>
<p>(2) Length, structure, and clarity:</p>
<p>I do not object in principle to the length of the paper. This is specialized work, aimed at a relatively narrow audience, and the pedagogical effort is valuable. However, I think the manuscript would benefit from a clearer and earlier high-level overview of the model and its requirements. I doubt that most readers can realistically &quot;just skim&quot; the paper, and without an early hook clearly stating what is estimated and what data are required, some readers may disengage.</p>
<p>In particular, I would suggest clarifying early on:</p>
<p>• What exactly is estimated?</p>
<p>For example, in the Discussion, the first two paragraphs seem to suggest slightly different sets of estimands: &quot;estimate the effects of both within- and cross-trait AM, genetic nurture, VT, G-E covariance, and direct genetic effects.&quot; versus &quot;model provides unbiased estimates of direct genetic effects (a and δ), VT effects (f), genetic nurture effects (ϕ and ρ), G-E covariance w and v, AM effects (μ), and other parameters when its assumptions are met.&quot; A concise and consistent summary of parameters would be helpful.</p>
<p>• What data are strictly required?</p>
<p>At several points, I thought that phenotypes for both parents were required, but later in the Discussion, the authors consider scenarios where parental phenotypes are unavailable. I found this confusing and would appreciate a clearer statement of what is required, what is optional, and what changes when data are missing.</p>
<p>• Which parameters must be fixed by assumption, rather than estimated from the data?</p>
<p>Relatedly, in the Discussion, the authors mention the possibility of adding an additional latent shared environmental factor across generations. It would help to clearly distinguish:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the baseline model,</p>
</list-item><list-item><p>the model actually tested in the paper, and</p>
</list-item><list-item><p>possible extensions.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>Making these distinctions explicit would improve accessibility.</p>
<p>This connects to a broader concern I had when reading Balbona et al. (2021): at first glance, the model seemed readily applicable to commonly available data, but in practice, this was not the case. I wondered whether something similar applies here. A clear statement of what data structures realistically allow the model to be fitted would be very useful.</p>
<p>I found the &quot;Suggested approach for fitting the multivariate SEM-PGS model&quot; in the Supplementary Information particularly helpful and interesting. I strongly encourage highlighting this more explicitly in the main manuscript. If the authors want the method to be widely used, a tutorial or at least a detailed README in the GitHub repository would greatly improve accessibility.</p>
<p>Finally, while the pedagogical repetition can be helpful, there were moments where it felt counterproductive. Some concepts are reintroduced several times with slightly different terminology, which occasionally made me question whether I had misunderstood something earlier. Streamlining some explanations and moving more material to the SI could improve clarity without sacrificing rigor.</p>
<p>(3) Latent genetic score (LGS) and the a parameter</p>
<p>I struggled to understand the role of the latent genetic score (LGS), and I think this aspect could be explained more clearly. In particular, why is this latent genetic factor necessary? Is it possible to run the model without it?</p>
<p>My initial intuition was that the LGS represents the &quot;true&quot; underlying genetic liability, with the PGS being a noisy proxy. Under that interpretation, I expected the i matrix to function as an attenuation factor. However, i is interpreted as assortative-mating-induced correlation, which suggests that my intuition is incorrect. Or should the parameter be interpreted as an attenuation factor?</p>
<p>Relatedly, in the simulation section, the authors mention simulating both PGS and LGS, which confused me because the LGS is not a measured variable. I did not fully understand the logic behind this simulation setup.</p>
<p>Finally, I was unsure whether the values simulated for parameter a in Figures 8-9 are higher than what would typically be expected given the current literature, though this uncertainty may reflect my incomplete understanding of a itself. I appreciated the Model assumptions section of the discussion, and I wonder if this should not be discussed earlier.</p>
<p>(4) Vertical transmission versus genetic nurture</p>
<p>I am not sure I fully understand the distinction between vertical transmission (VT) and genetic nurture as defined in this paper. From the Introduction, I initially had the impression that these concepts were used almost interchangeably, but Table 3 suggests they are distinct.</p>
<p>Relatedly:</p>
<p>• Why are ϕ and ρ not represented in the path diagram?</p>
<p>• Are these parameters estimated in the model?</p>
<p>The authors also mention that these parameters target different estimands compared to other approaches. It would be helpful to elaborate on this point. Relatedly, where would the authors expect dynastic effects to appear in this framework?</p>
<p>(5) Univariate model and misspecification</p>
<p>In the simulations where a univariate model is fitted to data generated under a true bivariate scenario, I have a few clarification questions.</p>
<p>What is the univariate model used (e.g., Table 5)? Is it the same as the model described in Balbona et al. (2025)? Does it include an LGS?</p>
<p>If the genetic correlation in the founder generation is set to zero, does this imply that all pleiotropy arises through assortative mating? If so, is this a realistic mechanism, and does it meaningfully affect the interpretation of the results?</p>
<p>(6) Simulations</p>
<p>Overall, I found the simulations satisfying to read; they largely test exactly the kinds of issues I would want them to test, and the rationale for these tests is clear.</p>
<p>That said, I was confused by the notation Σ and did not fully understand what it represents.</p>
<p>In the Discussion, the authors mention testing the misspecification of social versus genetic homogamy, but I do not recall this being explicitly described in the simulation section. They also mention this issue in the SI (&quot;Suggested approach for fitting...&quot;). I think it would be very helpful to include an example illustrating this form of misspecification.</p>
<p>(7) Cross-trait specific limitations</p>
<p>I am wondering - and I don't think this is addressed - what is the impact of the difference in the noisiness and the heritability of the traits used for this multivariate analysis?</p>
<p>Using the example, the authors mention of BMI and EA, one could think that these two traits have different levels of noise (maybe BMI is self-reported and EA comes from a registry), and similarly for the GWAS of these traits, let's say one GWAS is less powered than the other ones. Does it matter? Should I select the traits I look at carefully in function of these criteria? Should I interpret the estimates differently if one GWAS is more powered than the other one?</p>
