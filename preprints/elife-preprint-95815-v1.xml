<title>Abstract</title><p>Erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis are stringently regulated by signaling pathways. However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which signaling pathways regulate key transcription factors controlling erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis remain partially understood. Herein, we identified heat shock cognate B (HSCB), which is well known for its iron-sulfur cluster delivery function, as an indispensable protein for friend of GATA 1 (FOG1) nuclear translocation during erythropoiesis of K562 human erythroleukemia cells and cord-blood-derived human CD34+CD90+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as well as during megakaryopoiesis of the CD34+CD90+ HSCs. Mechanistically, HSCB could be phosphorylated by phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) to bind with and mediate the proteasomal degradation of transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3 (TACC3), which otherwise detained FOG1 in the cytoplasm, thereby facilitating FOG1 nuclear translocation. Given that PI3K is activated during both erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, and that FOG1 a key transcription factor for these processes, our findings elucidate an important, previously unrecognized iron-sulfur cluster delivery independent function of HSCB in erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis respectively refer to the processes through which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differentiate into mature red blood cells (RBCs) and megakaryocytes/platelets. Given the physiological significance of RBCs, megakaryocytes and platelets, it is not surprising that erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis are tightly regulated by a myriad of molecular mechanisms. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a fundamental cytokine promoting erythropoiesis via binding with erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kuhrt and Wojchowski, 2015</xref>). Converging evidence indicates that the EPO/EPOR signaling is crucial for the proliferation and survival of colony-forming unit erythroid cells (CFU-Es) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nandakumar et al., 2016</xref>). Although the EPO/EPOR signaling was dispensable for in vivo production of early committed erythroid progenitors, <italic>Epo</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>EpoR</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited embryonic death due to deficient definitive erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wu et al., 1995</xref>). These studies highlight the indispensability of EPO/EPOR signaling during erythropoiesis. Thrombopoietin (TPO) and its receptor MPL constitute the primary regulator of megakaryopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hitchcock et al., 2021</xref>). Studies indicated that TPO alone could induce the production of megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-MKs), while addition of other cytokines including stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin 3 (IL3) and IL11 markedly increased the size, but not the number, of these colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kaushansky et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kaushansky et al., 1994</xref>). The biological significance of TPO/MPL signaling pathway was also evidenced by the development of thrombocytopenia in Mpl-deficient mice as well as in human subjects carrying <italic>MPL</italic> and <italic>THPO</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gurney et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Noris and Pecci, 2017</xref>). Both EPOR and MPL belong to the type-I family of cytokine receptors. They do not possess kinase activity <italic>per se</italic>, but can transphosphorylate Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2), which in turn activates several downstream signaling cascades, including the JAK2/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and rat sarcoma (RAS)/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eggold and Rankin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hitchcock et al., 2021</xref>), all of which contribute more or less to both erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.</p>
<p>The essence of differentiation is the generation of cells with specific functions, which is realized by the differentiation stage-dependent transcriptional activation and suppression of innumerable genes. This is why there is a generally accepted notion that transcription factors (TFs) are the main drivers of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lambert et al., 2018</xref>). Each of the differentiation processes of erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis is controlled by a combination of key TFs, including GATA1, friend of GATA1 (FOG1), KLF1, TAL1, MEIS1, etc., for the erythroid lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dore and Crispino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kwon et al., 2021</xref>), and GATA1, FOG1, TAL1, MEIS1, FLI1, etc., for the megakaryocytic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dore and Crispino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kwon et al., 2021</xref>). Since cell signaling is the dominant way by which erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors (or their common progenitors) sense differentiation signals, it is crucial to understand how these key erythroid and megakaryocytic TFs are regulated by signaling pathways, especially those downstream of EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling. However, to date, research on this topic remains scarce. A study deepened our understanding about this issue by demonstrating that the PI3K-AKT pathway can phosphorylate GATA1 at serine 310 in erythroid cells, thereby augmenting its transcription activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). However, given that the proper functioning of GATA1 in regulating target gene expression relies on its binding with a specific cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gutierrez et al., 2020</xref>), how EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling pathways regulate the activity of GATA1 binding partners, such as FOG1, warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Heat shock cognate B (HSCB or HSC20) is widely known for its function during the delivery of nascent iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs) to recipient proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Maio et al., 2014</xref>). The biogenesis of ISCs starts with the assembly of nascent ISCs on a multi-protein complex composed of iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme (ISCU), nitrogen fixation 1 homolog (NFS1), LYR motif containing 4 (LYRM4 or ISD11), and acyl carrier protein (ACP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Maio et al., 2020</xref>). After the ISCs are synthesized, ISCU binds with an ISC delivery chaperone/cochaperone complex comprising HSCB and HSPA9 to transfer the nascent ISCs to target Fe-S proteins or secondary ISC carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Maio et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, Crispin et al. described a female patient who suffered from congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA) due to heterozygous variations that resulted in decreased expression of HSCB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Crispin et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to the anemic phenotype, the proband also developed moderate thrombocytopenia and mild neutropenia. Consistent with the proband’s clinical presentations, <italic>Hscb<sup>fl/–</sup></italic> mice with a <italic>Vav1-Cre</italic> transgene also exhibited reduced RBC and platelet counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Crispin et al., 2020</xref>). Based on these findings, we speculated that HSCB may be implicated with hematopoiesis, especially erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. To test this hypothesis, herein we explored the function of HSCB during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Our findings indicated that HSCB can be phosphorylated by PI3K to promote FOG1 nuclear translocation during human erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. This study describes a previously unrecognized iron-sulfur cluster delivery independent function of HSCB, thereby providing new insights into human erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.</p>

<title>HSCB exerted an ISC delivery independent function during erythropoiesis of HSCs</title>
<p>First, we investigated if HSCB is implicated in erythropoiesis by inhibiting its expression in CD34+CD90+ HSCs via a mixture of shRNAs. We also knocked down the expression of human <italic>ISCU</italic> and <italic>NFS1</italic> genes in these cells to determine the impact of ISC biogenesis deficiency on erythropoiesis. The high-purity CD34+CD90+ HSC population was first obtained (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">supplemental Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>) and divided into five groups of Control, shNC, shHSCB, shISCU and shNFS1. HSCs in the Control group were untransfected, whereas those in the other four groups were transfected with the corresponding shRNA plasmids. The HSCs in these groups induced for erythropoiesis for 17 days to yield erythrocytes at day 17 of differentiation (Ery 17 days) and collected for analyses (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">supplemental Figure 1</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> demonstrates the efficiency of shRNA knockdown maintained throughout the experimental period. The activities of aconitase and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which depend on intact ISC biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Cameron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Castro et al., 2019</xref>), decreased significantly in the shHSCB, shISCU and shNFS1 groups compared with the shNC group (all P values were less than 0.05 or 0.01 in Student’s t test, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>), demonstrating that ISC biogenesis was strongly inhibited in these groups. Since heme biosynthesis is regulated by ISC biogenesis at several nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), we further explored whether heme biosynthesis was also inhibited in the shHSCB, shISCU and shNFS1 groups. Indeed, these three groups exhibited significantly lower heme contents (all P values were less than 0.05 or 0.01 in Student’s t test, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) and paler cell pellets (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">supplemental Figure 2B</xref>) than the shNC group. Surprisingly, among the groups subjected to shRNA plasmids transfection, only the shHSCB group displayed significantly inhibited erythropoiesis, as evidenced by the reduced proportion of CD71+CD235a+ progenitors (P&lt;0.001, Student’s t test, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E–F</xref>) and the decreased mRNA expression levels of erythroid marker genes <italic>HBB</italic>, <italic>ALAS2</italic> and <italic>GYPC</italic> (all P values were less than 0.01 or 0.001 in Student’s t test, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). We then purified the CD71-CD235a-subpopulation from the shHSCB group of Ery 17 days via cell sorting and characterized the differential status of these cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, the majority of CD71-CD235a-cells from the shHSCB group were CD34+CD38+CD45RA-IL3RA-, exhibiting a surface marker expression pattern (CD34+CD38+CD45RA-IL3RA-CD71-CD235a-) resembling that observed on CD34+CD90+ HSCs induced for erythropoiesis for 2 days (E 2-day HSCs) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">supplemental Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These findings revealed that HSCB knockdown detained the erythropoiesis of HSCs at an early stage and that HSCB might be involved in key events regulating early erythropoiesis at this specific stage. Therefore, E 2-day HSCs were characterized in several following experiments to explore the molecular mechanisms through which HSCB deficiency impeded HSCs erythropoiesis. Altogether, these data indicated that HSCB knockdown impaired both heme biosynthesis and erythropoiesis in erythroid progenitors, while knockdown of ISC assembly proteins markedly reduced heme production but did not significantly affect erythropoiesis, suggesting an ISC delivery independent function of HSCB during early erythropoiesis of CD34+CD90+ HSCs.</p>

<title>HSCB deficiency inhibited the erythropoiesis of K562 cells</title>
<p>K562 erythroleukemia cells are widely employed to study the molecular events implicated with human erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nandakumar et al., 2016</xref>). To verify the function of HSCB in erythropoiesis and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, we established <italic>HSCB</italic>-knockout K562 cells (CRISPR HSCB) and induced erythroid differentiation of these cells with EPO (EPO+CRISPR HSCB). After FBS deprivation treatment (see the Materials and Methods section for details), untransfected K562 cells without EPO treatment, those only treated with EPO and those first transfected with the negative control CRISPR plasmid and then treated with EPO respectively constituted the Untreated, EPO and EPO+CRISPR NC groups. As revealed by <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A–C</xref>, compared with the Untreated group, the EPO and EPO+CRISPR NC groups exhibited significantly higher levels of erythrocyte membrane proteins GYPA and SPTA1 (all P values were less than 0.05 or 0.01 in Student’s t test), significantly increased heme contents (all P values were less than 0.01 or 0.001 in Student’s t test) and elevated mRNA expression levels of erythroid-specific genes <italic>HBB</italic>, <italic>ALAS2</italic> and <italic>GYPC,</italic> indicating that the EPO treatment successfully induced the erythropoiesis of K562 cells. In the EPO+CRISPR HSCB group, however, the protein levels of GYPA and SPTA1, heme content and mRNA levels of <italic>HBB</italic>, <italic>ALAS2</italic> and <italic>GYPC</italic> all decreased markedly compared with those of the EPO+CRISPR NC group (all P values were less than 0.01 or 0.001 in Student’s t test), demonstrating that HSCB knockout hindered the erythropoiesis of K562 cells induced by EPO. Erythropoiesis is underpinned by transcriptional changes mainly driven by nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dore and Crispino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nandakumar et al., 2016</xref>). To explore why HSCB silencing inhibited the erythropoiesis of K562 cells induced by EPO, we compared the nuclear proteomic profiles of the EPO+CRISPR NC and EPO+CRISPR HSCB groups via performing tandem mass tag-based mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) on the nuclear fractions. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, 9 downregulated and 2 upregulated differentially-expressed nuclear proteins (DENPs, see the Materials and Methods section for the definition) were identified in the EPO+CRISPR HSCB group. Among these 11 DENPs, only NAA30, LYAR and FOG1 were <italic>bona fide</italic> nuclear proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). We further tested whether these 3 DENPs were indeed differentially expressed in the nuclear fractions of K562 cells and E 2-day HSCs after HSCB silencing. Western blotting (WB) analyses revealed that FOG1 was the only nuclear protein expressed at significantly different levels in both K562 cells and E 2-day HSCs upon HSCB deficiency (P values were less than 0.05 or 0.01 in Student’s t test, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F–G</xref>). We also tested the nuclear abundance of GATA1 in these cells but observed no significant changes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F–G</xref>). These data confirmed that the nuclear abundance of FOG1 was decreased in HSCB-deficient EPO-induced K562 cells and E 2-day HSCs.</p>

<p>Given the importance of FOG1 during human erythropoiesis, we determined whether the decreased nuclear abundance of FOG1 was responsible for the inhibited erythropoiesis in HSCB-deficient EPO-induced K562 cells and CD34+CD90+ HSCs. We overexpressed human FOG1 protein in the EPO+CRISPR HSCB K562 cells and the shHSCB CD34+CD90+ HSCs to respectively establish the EPO+CRISPR HSCB+FOG1 OE and shHSCB+FOG1 OE groups. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A–E</xref>, FOG1 overexpression counteracted the inhibitory effects of HSCB silencing on the erythropoiesis of K562 cells and CD34+CD90+ HSCs because, except for the heme contents, the EPO+CRISPR HSCB+FOG1 OE and shHSCB+FOG1 OE groups exhibited comparable levels of all the parameters evaluated relative to their corresponding control groups. Interestingly, the total protein level of GATA1 was not significantly affected by HSCB deficiency or FOG1 overexpression in EPO-induced K562 cells and CD34+CD90+ HSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). These data verified that HSCB deficiency hindered the erythropoiesis of K562 cells and CD34+CD90+ HSCs by reducing the nuclear abundance of FOG1. To gain more insights into the molecular mechanisms by which HSCB deficiency decreased FOG1 nuclear abundance, we also measured cytoplasmic FOG1 protein levels in EPO+CRISPR HSCB K562 cells and the shHSCB group of E 2-day HSCs. We observed that these cells expressed significantly higher cytoplasmic levels of FOG1 than their corresponding controls (all P values were less than 0.01 or 0.001 in Student’s t test, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating that HSCB deficiency prohibited FOG1 nuclear translocation. These findings were further confirmed by immunofluorescence assays on K562 cells, in which the red fluorescence of FOG1 in the EPO+CRISPR NC group was mostly observed in the nuclei and that in the EPO+CRISPR HSCB group was mainly found in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Collectively, these observations indicated that HSCB deficiency impaired the erythropoiesis of K562 cells and HSCs by prohibiting FOG1 nuclear translocation.</p>

<title>HSCB deficiency prohibited FOG1 nuclear translocation by enhancing its interaction with TACC3</title>
<p>Nuclear translocation of a specific protein is ultimately regulated by protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cautain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wing et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, to further explain how HSCB deficiency prohibited FOG1 nuclear translocation, we next sought to identify differential binding proteins (DBPs, see the Materials and Methods section for the definition) through affinity purification-MS analyses. We identified two DBPs, namely MYO1E and TACC3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Their binding affinities with FOG1 increased significantly after HSCB expression was silenced (P values were less than 0.05 in Student’s t test,). We focused only on TACC3 because MYO1E did not bind with FOG1 in either the shNC or shHSCB group of E 2-day HSCs (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">supplemental Figure 3</xref>). We first performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments to test whether FOG1 indeed exhibited increased binding affinities with TACC3 in EPO-induced K562 cells and E 2-day HSCs after HSCB silencing. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B–C</xref>, the interaction between FOG1 and TACC3 was only detectable in HSCB-deficient cells, confirming that HSCB deficiency promoted the interaction between FOG1 and TACC3. KHS101, a TACC3 inhibitor, can both reduce the activity of TACC3 and decrease its protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Polson et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether KHS101 treatment could decrease the protein level of TACC3 in these cells and thereby alleviate the inhibitory effect of HSCB deficiency on their erythropoiesis. Indeed, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D–H</xref>, KHS101 treatment enhanced FOG1 nuclear translocation [as reflected by the significantly increased relative nuclear FOG1 (N-FOG1) to cytoplasmic FOG1 (C-FOG1) ratios in the KHS101 treatment groups (P values were less than 0.05 or 0.01 in Student’s t test,)] and restored erythropoiesis in EPO+CRISPR HSCB K562 cells and shHSCB HSCs. Altogether, these data exhibited that HSCB deficiency prohibited FOG1 nuclear translocation by promoting its interaction with TACC3, and that reducing TACC3 abundance by KHS101 treatment alleviated the inhibitory effect of HSCB deficiency on the erythropoiesis of K562 cells and CD34+CD90+ HSCs.</p>

<title>HSCB facilitated FOG1 nuclear translocation by binding with and mediating the proteasomal degradation of TACC3 upon activation of the EPO/EPOR signaling</title>
<p>To further understand how HSCB facilitated FOG1 nuclear translocation and why HSCB deficiency enhanced the protein level of TACC3, we transfected an HSCB-overexpressing plasmid into K562 cells and treated the transfected K562 cells with EPO to establish an EPO+HSCB OE group. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, EPO treatment significantly reduced the protein level of TACC3 and promoted FOG1 nuclear translocation (all P values were less than 0.05 or 0.01 in Student’s t test). HSCB overexpression further decreased the protein level of TACC3 and enhanced FOG1 nuclear abundance. However, after the EPO+HSCB OE K562 cells were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, the protein level of TACC3 and the nuclear abundance of FOG1 returned to those in untreated K562 cells. Co-IP assays revealed that TACC3 interacted with HSCB when the K562 cells were treated with EPO, whereas it interacted with FOG1 in the untreated and EPO+HSCB OE+MG132 K562 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These data indicated that, upon EPO treatment, HSCB could bind with and mediate the proteasomal degradation of TACC3, thereby preventing TACC3 from binding with FOG1 in K562 cells. We further characterized the protein expression profiles of HSCB, cytoplasmic/nuclear FOG1 and TACC3, as well as their physical interactions, at different stages during erythropoiesis of CD34+CD90+ HSCs. The cells were induced for erythropoiesis for 0, 2, 4, 10, 17 and 24 days and harvested for analyses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D–F</xref>, the nuclear abundance of FOG1 and the interaction between HSCB and TACC3 all gradually increased from day 0 to day 4, resembling the changing trend of the number of EPOR+ cells. These findings were consistent with those observed in K562 cells and further highlighted that the EPO/EPOR signaling was indispensable for HSCB to bind with and mediate the proteasomal degradation of TACC3 to facilitate FOG1 nuclear translocation (hereinafter defined as HSCB functionalization).</p>

<title>Phosphorylation of HSCB by PI3K was necessary for its functionalization during human erythropoiesis</title>
<p>To determine which downstream cascade of EPO/EPOR signaling was important for HSCB functionalization, we treated K562 cells with EPO plus ruxolitinib, wortmannin and lonafarnib to respectively inhibit the activities of JAK2, PI3K and RAS upon activation of the EPO/EPOR signaling. As shown in <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">supplemental Figure 4</xref>, treatments with ruxolitinib, wortmannin and lonafarnib respectively decreased the phosphorylation levels of STAT5, AKT and MEK1/2 in EPO-induced K562 cells, confirming that these treatments were effective. Among the inhibitors, ruxolitinib and wortmannin significantly ameliorated the protein level of TACC3 and diminished the nuclear translocation of FOG1 (all P values were less than 0.05 or 0.001 in Student’s t test, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that JAK2 and PI3K activities are both necessary for HSCB functionalization in EPO-induced K562 cells. Since PI3K functions downstream of JAK2 in the EPO/EPOR signaling, we then focused only on PI3K to investigate its role in HSCB functionalization. Consistent with the WB findings, our co-IP assays demonstrated that inhibition of PI3K activity by wortmannin abolished the interaction between HSCB and TACC3 and thereby allowed TACC3 to bind with FOG1 in EPO-induced K562 cells and E 2-day HSCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Further analysis of protein phosphorylation status via co-IP assays revealed that EPO treatment enhanced the overall phosphorylation level of cytosolic HSCB, but not that of TACC3, in K562 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Additionally, wortmannin treatment reduced the overall phosphorylation level of cytosolic HSCB, but not that of TACC3, in EPO-induced K562 cells and E 2-day HSCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). We then identified the physical interaction between cytosolic HSCB and PIK3R1, which is the P85-alpha subunit of PI3K, via co-IP experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). These data indicated that HSCB phosphorylation by PI3K was indispensable for its functionalization by the EPO/EPOR signaling. In line with these findings, wortmannin treatment significantly inhibited the erythropoiesis of both K562 cells and CD34+CD90+ HSCs (all P values were less than 0.01 or 0.001 in Student’s t test, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E–I</xref>).

As displayed in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A–C</xref>, the CD34+CD90+ HSCs transfected with the shHSCB plasmid (shHSCB group) and those treated with wortmannin (Wortmannin group) exhibited significantly reduced proportions of CD41a+CD42b+ cells and lower mRNA expression levels of megakaryocyte-specific genes <italic>VWF</italic> and <italic>GP1BA</italic> (all P values were less than 0.001 in Student’s t test), while the megakaryopoiesis of CD34+CD90+ HSCs transfected with the shHSCB plasmid and treated with KHS101 (shHSCB+KHS101) was undisrupted.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>FOG1 is a binding partner of GATA1 exerting a vital function during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, as FOG1-deficient mice displayed megakaryopoiesis failure and impaired erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tsang et al., 1998</xref>). A previous study suggested that FOG1 was needed for the formation of megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MEPs), while GATA1 was required for the development of committed erythroid progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mancini et al., 2012</xref>). Given the biological significance of FOG1, it is crucial to understand how FOG1 is regulated by erythroid and megakaryocytic signals to ensure its timely activation or expression during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Herein, we have established a PI3K-HSCB signaling axis that facilitated FOG1 nuclear translocation upon activation of the EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling pathways during human erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>).</p>
<p>Although heme biosynthesis depends on an intact ISC assembly machinery, deficiencies in proteins of the ISC assembly complex, namely ISCU, NFS1, and LYRM4 have not been associated with erythropoietic consequences in both human subjects and cell models (Ye and Rouault, 2010). In contrast, however, deficiencies in proteins responsible for ISC transfer, such as GLRX5, HSPA9 and HSCB, have been tightly linked with sideroblastic anemia phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ducamp and Fleming, 2019</xref>). This could be due to that ISC biogenesis deficiencies are tolerable in erythrocytes, while the proteins responsible for ISC transfer possess moonlighting functions during erythropoiesis. Our research was initially inspired by the findings that a CSA proband carrying heterozygous HSCB mutations developed moderate thrombocytopenia and mild neutropenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Crispin et al., 2020</xref>). It is not surprising that mutations in proteins responsible for ISC transfer can cause anemia because two of the eight enzymes catalyzing heme biosynthesis, namely aminolevulinate dehydratase and ferrochelatase, were identified to be iron-sulfur proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dailey et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). However, it was not clear why the HSCB-deficient proband also exhibited moderately reduced numbers of platelets. Therefore, we tested whether HSCB is implicated with erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis of human CD34+CD90+ HSCs. Our results indicated that HSCB knockdown detained the erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis of HSCs at early stages because most of the resultant progenitors were CD34+CD38+CD45RA-IL3RA-CD71-CD235a- or CD34+CD38+CD45RA-IL3RA-CD41a-CD42b-, corresponding to common myeloid progenitors or MEPs as per previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Edvardsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kwon et al., 2021</xref>). Further analysis of the underlying mechanisms revealed that HSCB deficiency mainly impaired FOG1 nuclear translocation. The only known function of HSCB is to deliver nascent ISCs to recipient proteins. Interestingly, knockdown of proteins responsible for ISC assembly did not significantly affect erythropoiesis of HSCs, thus highlighting an ISC delivery independent function of HSCB during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. HSCB is a chaperone expressed in both mitochondria and cytosol. In this study, we were able to detect two bands for HSCB with western blotting, among which the upper and lower bands respectively represent cytosolic and mitochondrial HSCB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al. 2020</xref>). As revealed by <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, the sub-cellular distribution of HSCB was neither significantly altered during erythropoiesis of CD34+CD90+HSCs nor significantly affected by ruxolitinib and wortmannin treatments in K562 cells. Therefore, it seems that the sub-cellular localization of HSCB does not change during erythropoiesis or correlate with its phosphorylation status. However, whether the phosphorylation status of HSCB affects its ISC delivery function warrants further investigation. Additionally, since HSCB can bind with a wide array of intracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Maio et al., 2017</xref>), we speculate that the protein may be involved in many biological processes other than nascent ISC delivery. In this context, we hope our study may inspire more research efforts on ISC delivery independent functions of HSCB.</p>
<p>TACC3 belongs to a family of TACC-domain-containing proteins associated with mitotic spindles and centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ding et al., 2017</xref>). The protein participates in cell division by regulating the organization of spindle and microtubule nucleation during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ding et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, TACC3 has attracted increasing research interest because it was found aberrantly expressed in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Saatci et al., 2023</xref>). In addition to its association with tumorigenesis, TACC3 has also been implicated with erythropoiesis. According to a previous study, TACC3 could inhibit FOG1 nuclear translocation to suppress the erythropoiesis of mouse MEL and G1ER cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Garriga-Canut and Orkin, 2004</xref>). Herein we found that TACC3 exerted a similar function in human erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitor cells because, in the absence of HSCB, the protein could bind with and prevent the nuclear translocation of FOG1. Then we observed that treatment with KHS101, a small-molecule inhibitor that could decrease the activity and protein abundance of TACC3, alleviated the inhibitory effect of TACC3 on erythropoiesis upon HSCB deficiency. These data clarified the mechanism through which HSCB deficiency inhibited FOG1 nuclear translocation and consequently impaired erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. In sight of the functions of TACC3 during cell division and erythropoiesis/megakaryopoiesis, it is possible that TACC3 plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, which of course warrants further investigation. Furthermore, given that KHS101 could decrease TACC3 protein level to facilitate FOG1 nuclear translocation, this small-molecule reagent may have the potential to treat diseases caused by reduced activity or protein level of FOG1.</p>
<p>The precise mechanisms through which EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling pathways regulate lineage-specific transcription events during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis remain incompletely understood. In a previous research, expression of a constitutively activated Stat5a mutant in Jak2<sup>−/−</sup> and EpoR<sup>−/−</sup> mouse fetal liver cells was found to rescue their proliferation defects independently of EPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Grebien et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, the authors also observed that transplantation of Jak2<sup>−/−</sup> fetal liver cells expressing the Stat5a mutant into irradiated mice was able to maintain erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis of the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Grebien et al., 2008</xref>). These data verified the important function of Stat5a as a downstream effector of the Epo/EpoR signaling pathway during murine erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis. However, since STAT5 possesses a variety of target genes, why the protein is specifically required for erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis warrants further investigation. Another early study demonstrated that wortmannin could impede EPO-induced K562 cell erythropoiesis but did not inhibit erythropoiesis of the cells triggered by hemin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kubota et al., 1996</xref>). Since wortmannin is an inhibitor for PI3K, this study revealed that PI3K plays a large part in EPO-induced erythropoiesis of K562 cells. Later, it was demonstrated that the PI3K-AKT signaling cascade could directly activate GATA1 to stimulate erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we confirmed the importance of PI3K activity during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis and established a novel molecular mechanism. Our data indicated that PI3K could bind with and phosphorylate HSCB to promote its interaction with TACC3 to induce TACC3 degradation, thereby facilitating FOG1 nuclear translocation during erythropoiesis of K562 human erythroleukemia cells and HSCs, as well as during megakaryopoiesis of HSCs. Interestingly, the nuclear and cytoplasmic GATA1 expression levels were not regulated by this PI3K-HSCB axis, as revealed by the data presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, as well as the TMT-MS counts provided in Supplemental Dataset 5. These new findings explain how EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling pathways simultaneously activate GATA1 and FOG1 to ensure that this duo can function in a concerted and timely manner during human erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. In addition to the EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling pathways, PI3K is also activated by the SCF-c-KIT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lennartsson and Ronnstrand, 2012</xref>). Since the c-KIT and MRL receptors are expressed early on HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lennartsson and Ronnstrand, 2012</xref>), it is conceivable that the timely activation of GATA1 and FOG1 during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis also requires the participation of other differentiation stage-specific mechanisms regulating the abundance of these proteins. This idea can be supported by our findings on HSCs induced for erythropoiesis for different periods of time. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, while the levels of cytoplasmic TACC3 and FOG1 exhibited no significant changes from Day 2 to Day 4 of erythropoiesis, the level of N-FOG1 increased by more than three folds during the same period, suggesting that the functionalization of FOG1 is determined not only by the activation of the PI3K-HSCB axis, but also by the overall expression level of this protein. Additionally, although we failed to detect nuclear FOG1 in uninduced CD34+CD90+ HSCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), we did detect a faint band of FOG1 in the cytoplasmic fraction. Given that HSCB was already expressed in uninduced CD34+CD90+ HSCs, why the SCF-c-KIT-PI3K pathway failed to promote FOG1 nuclear translocation in these cells warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>This study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, we utilized the K562 cell line as one of the cell models in this study because it has the potential to differentiate into erythroid, megakaryocyte and macrophage lineages and thus may represent a useful tool in studying the molecular mechanisms underlying early-stage erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nandakumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sutherland et al., 1986</xref>). However, although K562 cells have been widely utilized to study erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andersson et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cao et al., 2020</xref>), and the capability of EPO to induce K562 erythropoiesis has been demonstrated by this study and previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hoffman et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kubota et al., 1996</xref>), this human erythroleukemia cell line might not faithfully represent the normal physiological processes of erythropoiesis. Fortunately, all our major conclusions can be successfully recapitulated in primary cells. A second limitation is that we did not focus on LYAR in this study because the difference in nuclear abundance of this protein between the shNC and shHSCB groups of E 2-day HSCs did not reach a statistically significant level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F–G</xref>). However, given the established function of LYAR during late erythropoiesis, it will be intriguing to explore whether this protein is also implicated with HSCB functionalization during human erythropoiesis. Finally, since we did not have access to biological samples from the patient harboring the <italic>HSCB</italic> mutation and that HSCB-deficient mice had almost no erythroid cells in their bone marrow, we were not able to further validate our findings in in vivo models.</p>
<p>In spite of these limitations, our study established a PI3K-HSCB axis that acted downstream of the EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling pathways to induce proteasomal degradation of TACC3, which otherwise detained FOG1 in the cytoplasm, in K562 cells and HSCs. This work elucidates an essential iron-sulfur cluster delivery independent function of HSCB in translating differentiation signals into downstream transcriptional events during human erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.</p>

<title>Culturing and treatment of K562 cell line and HSCs</title>
<p>Human K562 erythroleukemia cells were purchased from Procell Life Science&amp;Technology Co., Ltd. (China) and maintained in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco medium (IMDM, PM150510, Procell, China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, 085-150, Wisent Bioproducts, Canada), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (PB180120, Procell, China) in a 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. For induction of erythropoiesis, K562 cells were cultured in IMDM without FBS (FBS deprivation treatment) for 24 hours and then treated with 5 U/mL human recombinant EPO (GP20193, GlpBio, USA) for 48 hours. After the FBS deprivation treatment, K562 cells were incubated for 48 hours with 300 nM ruxolitinib (GC14191), 200 nM wortmannin (GC12338), 2 μM lonafarnib (GC10330) dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and 10 μM MG132 (GC10383, all from GlpBio, USA) dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for inhibiting the activities of JAK2, PI3K, RAS and proteasome, respectively, and with only DMSO for the “vehicle” treatment. To reduce the protein level of transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3 (TACC3), K562 cells were treated with 5 μM KHS101 (GC13582, GlpBio, USA) dissolved in PBS.</p>
<p>Cord-blood-derived CD34+ human HSCs were originally obtained from healthy female donors aged between 24-27 years and were commercially available at Precision BioMedicals Co., Ltd., China (903410). The CD34+ HSCs population was first expanded by incubating the cells in StemSpan™ Serum-Free Expansion Medium (SFEM) II (09655) plus StemSpan™ CD34+ Expansion Supplement that contains recombinant human fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, SCF, IL3, IL6 and TPO (02691, all from STEMCELL Technologies, Canada) for 7 days in a 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. After that, CD34+CD90+ HSCs were purified by cell sorting (described below). The HSCs were cultured for 2, 4, 10, 17 or 24 days in StemSpan™ SFEM II plus StemSpan™ Erythroid Expansion Supplement that contains recombinant human SCF, IL3 and EPO (02692, STEMCELL Technologies, Canada) for induction of erythropoiesis, or for 3 or 14 days in StemSpan™ SFEM II plus StemSpan™ Megakaryocyte Expansion Supplement that contains SCF, IL-6, IL-9 and TPO (02696, STEMCELL Technologies, Canada) for induction of megakaryopoiesis. The concentration of the HSCs or the subsequent erythroid/megakaryocytic progenitors was maintained below 1×10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL during all the aforementioned experiments. The levels of PI3K activity and TACC3 protein expression were reduced by culturing the cells with 100 nM wortmannin (GC12338) and 4 μM KHS101 (GC13582, all from GlpBio, USA), respectively.</p>

<title>Nuclear proteomics analysis</title>
<p>Briefly, 500 μg of nuclear extracts were subjected to tandem mass tag-based mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) performed by CapitalBio Technology, China to characterize nuclear proteomic changes. Nuclear extracts of equal protein amounts were first subjected to proteolysis with trypsin (V5113, Promega) at 37°C for 16 hours. The resulting peptide fragments were then desalted with C18 Cartridge columns (WAT023590, Waters), freeze-dried, and reconstituted in a 40-μL 0.1% formic acid solution. Equal amounts of peptide fragments from each experimental group were then labelled utilizing the TMTpro 16plex Isobaric Label Reagent (A44520, Thermo Fisher) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The labelled fragments were fractionated through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the C18 Cartridge columns and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays using a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Each assay involved a full-spectrum scan (Resolution 120,000, scan range 350–1500 m/z, AGC target 3e6, maximum IT 50 ms) and target MS/MS scans (Resolution 45,000, AGC target 5e4, maximum IT 80 ms).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the paper entitled &quot;PI3K/HSCB axis facilitates FOG1 nuclear translocation to promote erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis&quot;, the authors sought to determine the role of HSCB, a known regulator of iron-sulfur cluster transfer, in the generation of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes. They utilized a human primary cell model of hematopoietic differentiation to identify a novel mechanism whereby HSCB is necessary for the activation of erythroid and megakaryocytic gene expression through regulation of the nuclear localization of FOG-1, an essential transcription co-regulator of the GATA transcription factors. Their work establishes this novel regulatory axis as a mechanism by which cytokine signaling through EPO-R and MPL drives the lineage-specification of hematopoietic progenitors to erythrocytes and megakaryocytes, respectively.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>The major impact of this work is in a greater understanding of how cytokine signaling through EPO/TPO functions to promote lineage specification of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. While the major kinase cascades downstream of the EPO/TPO receptors have been elucidated, how those cascades affect gene expression to promote a specific differentiation program is poorly understood. For this work, we now understand that nuclear localization of FOG is a critical regulatory node by which EPO/TPO signaling is required to launch FOG-dependent gene expression. However, these cytokine receptors have many overlapping and redundant targets, so it still remains to be elucidated how signaling through the different receptors promotes divergent gene expression programs. Perhaps similar regulatory mechanisms exist for other lineage-specifying transcription factors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use two different cellular models of erythroid differentiation (K562 and human primary CD34+ cells) to elucidate the multi-factorial mechanism controlling FOG-1 nuclear localization. The studies are well-controlled and rigorously establish their mechanism through complementary approaches. The differentiation effects are established through cell surface marker expression, protein expression, and gene expression analyses. Novel protein interactions discovered by proteomics analyses were validated through bi-directional co-IP experiments in multiple experimental systems. Protein cellular localization findings are supported by both immunofluorescence and cell fractionation immunoblot analyses. The robustness of their experimental findings gives great confidence in the likelihood that the methods and findings can be reproduced in future work based on their conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The one unexplained step in this intricately described mechanism is how HSCB functions to promote TACC3 degradation. It appears that the proteasome is involved since MG-132 reverses the effect of HSCB deficiency, but no other details are provided. Does HSCB target TACC3 for ubiquitination somehow? Future studies will be required to understand this portion of the mechanism.</p>
<p>One weakness of the study design is that no in vivo experiments are conducted. The authors comment that the HSCB mouse phenotype is too dramatic to permit studies of erythropoiesis in vivo; however, a conditional approach could have been pursued.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that a previous study had already shown that TACC3 regulates the nuclear localization of FOG-1, so this portion of the mechanism is not entirely novel. However, the role of HSCB and the proteasomal degradation of TACC3 is entirely novel to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Liu et al. identified an important pathway regulating the nuclear translocation of the key transcriptional factor FOG1 during human hematopoiesis. The authors show that heat shock cognate B (HSCB) can interact with and promote the proteasomal degradation of TACC3, and this function is independent of its role in iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis. TACC3 represses the activity of FOG1 by sequestering it in the cytoplasm. Therefore, HSCB can promote the nuclear translocation of FOG1 through down-regulating TACC3. The authors further show that the phosphorylation of HSCB by PI3K downstream of the EPO signaling pathway is important for its role in regulating the nuclear translocation of FOG1. The data are solid and the manuscript is overall well written. The findings of this manuscript provide new knowledge to the fields of hematopoiesis and cell biology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study uses a multi-pronged approach that combines techniques from a number of fields to convincingly demonstrate the pathway regulating the nuclear translocation of FOG1 during hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study only uses cell models. The significance of this work may be broadened by further studies using animal models.</p>
