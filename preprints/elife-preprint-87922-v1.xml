<title>Abstract</title><p>Identification of novel essential bacterial genes is important for not only the understanding of their cell biology but also the development of new antimicrobials. Here we report a previously unrecognized core component of the <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> divisome. Our results reveal that the protein, termed Aeg1 interacts with multiple cell division proteins, including FtsN, which is required for components of the divisome to localize to the midcell. We demonstrate that the FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> and FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> mutants effectively bypassed the need of Aeg1 by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic>, so did the activation variants FtsW<sub>M254I</sub> and FtsW<sub>S274G</sub>. Our results suggest that Aeg1 is a cell division protein that arrives at the division site to initiate cell division by recruiting FtsN, which activates FtsQLB and FtsA to induces the septal peptidoglycan synthase FtsWI. The discovery of the new essential cell division protein has provided a new target for the development of antibacterial agents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that causes a wide variety of nosocomial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), including urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal and skin/wound infections and secondary meningitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The challenge posed by this pathogen is compounded by the emergence of isolates that are resistant to almost all of the available antibiotics, including some of the last resort for treatment of infections caused by bacterial pathogens, including colistin, tigecycline, and carbapenems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified <italic>A. baumannii</italic> as a pathogen for which new antibiotics are urgently needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Meeting this challenge requires the discovery of antimicrobials of new mechanisms of action or other mitigation strategies that enable reduction of disease burden caused by this pathogen.</p>
<p>Historically, the discovery of antibiotics was largely based on the search for secondary metabolites produced by soil-dwelling microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The majority of clinically used antibiotic classes originate from soil bacteria, including lactams, aminoglycosides, polymyxins, and glycopeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Unfortunately, natural products discovery is now plagued by problems of so-called ‘dereplication problem’, wherein rediscovery of molecules or their close relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). As a result, there has not been a novel antibiotic discovered in over 30 years using traditional methods of screening environmental samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The overuse of these merely variants of existing compounds has further accelerated the problem associated with antibiotic resistance. Thus, identification of novel therapeutic targets in the pathogen may serve as an effective alternative to the problem.</p>
<p>A better understanding of gene function associated with <italic>A. baumannii</italic> pathogenesis and biology will provide us strategies to develop antibiotics with potentially novel mechanisms of action. One extensively explored avenue in this regard is the identification of previously unrecognized essential genes by methods enabled by new DNA sequencing technologies, including insertion sequencing (INSeq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), and high-throughput insertion tracking sequencing (HITS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Application of these methods has identified genes believed to be required for bacterial viability under various conditions in such important pathogens as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to candidate genes identified by other methods, putative essential genes obtained by In-seq were deduced from sequencing results of surviving mutants, some of which can be false positives or negatives due to unsaturated mutant libraries or polar effects on downstream genes of the insertion sites. Using In-seq Wang et al identified 453 candidate essential genes for the growth of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strain ATCC 17978 on rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Among these, genes annotated as hypotheticals with orthologs in other taxonomically distant microorganisms are of particular interest because their potential role in cellular processes that can be explored as targets for the development of novel antimicrobials. We thus set out to determine a subgroup of the predicted essential genes by a conditional gene deletion strategy based on the arabinose inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). From ten genes examined, three were found to be essential for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> viability on rich medium. Further study revealed that one of these genes codes for a novel bacterial cell division protein.</p>

<title>Identification of genes required for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> viability</title>
<p>Analysis of strains of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, including the model strain 17978 by In-seq technologies have led to the identification of at least 453 genes potentially required for bacterial growth on rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Whereas many of these genes are involved in known cellular processes fundamental for cell viability such as DNA replication, transcription and translation, some code for proteins of unknown activity, are thus of great interest as potentially new antimicrobial targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). To determine the function of the candidate essential genes annotated as hypotheticals, we first confirmed their essentiality by a conditional gene deletion method. To this end, we employed a set of plasmids that allow inducible gene expression in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Each of the gene of interest was expressed from the arabinose-inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), and the corresponding gene was deleted from the chromosome by the standard allele exchange method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>)</bold>. Chromosomal deletion mutants harboring the arabinose-inducible gene were tested for essentiality by spotting serially diluted cells onto solid medium with or without arabinose (ara) <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>)</bold>. If the gene of interest is essential, the bacterium should fail to grow on plates without ara.</p>

<p>Our initial analysis of 10 genes (<bold><xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref></bold>) identified <italic>A1S_0137</italic>, <italic>A1S_2249</italic>, and <italic>A1S_3387</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) that met the criteria of being required for growth on LB agar (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). These genes were thus designated as <italic><underline>A</underline>. baumannii</italic> <underline>e</underline>ssential <underline>g</underline>enes (Aeg) and Aeg1 (<italic>A1S_3387</italic>) was chosen for detailed study.</p>
<p>Sequence analysis revealed that Aeg1 has orthologs in a number of Gram-negative bacteria, including <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> members of the <italic>Moraxellaceae</italic> family and some strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, with sequence similarity ranging from 80% to identical <bold>(<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>).</bold> Aeg1 is predicted to harbor a single transmembrane domain composing of 23 residues close to its amino terminal end <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>)</bold>. To determine the importance of the putative membrane spanning region in its function, we employed a dual inducible system with two compatible plasmids that use promoters that respond to ara and isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), respectively. Strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1, P<sub>TAC</sub>::Aeg1) was able to grow on medium containing 1% ara or 0.5 mM IPTG <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>)</bold> indicating that the chromosomal deletion can be complemented by either of the constructs when expression of Aeg1 was induced. Importantly, expression of the Aeg1 mutant lacking the predicted membrane anchoring region was unable to restore the growth of the strain (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>), suggesting that association with membrane is essential for its activity.</p>

<title>Depletion of Aeg1 caused cell filamentation in <italic>A. baumannii</italic></title>
<p>We next examined the morphology of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> lacking Aeg1 by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Cultures of strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) were induced by ara for 14 h, cells diluted into fresh LB with or without ara were allowed to grow for 18 h. We found that cells of cultures grown in medium containing 1% ara exhibited a short rod cell shape similar to that of the wild-type strain (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). In medium without ara most cells of strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) displayed an elongated morphology which is in sharp contrast to those of wild-type cells grew under identical conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). Quantitative analysis indicated that in medium supplemented with ara, more than 95% of the cells of strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) were shorter than 5 μm. Incubation in medium without ara for 18 h caused more than 96% of the cells to become elongated with cell lengths ranging from 5 μm to over 10 μm (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). The phenotype can be partially reversed after growing the elongated cells in medium containing 1% ara for 4 h and the morphology of almost all cells were restored to that of wild-type bacteria after 8 h incubation in inducing conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). These results indicate that depletion of Aeg1 causes cell elongation, which suggests that this protein is involved in cell division.</p>

<title>Mutations in the cell division gene <italic>ftsA</italic> bypasses the requirement of Aeg1</title>
<p>To explore the cellular process participated by Aeg1, we sought to isolate suppressor mutants that can survive in standard medium under conditions the gene is not expressed. To this end, cells of strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) grown in medium supplemented with ara were exposed to the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), and the treated cells were plated on LB agar without ara. A few colonies were obtained from approximately 6x10<sup>8</sup> cells and two independent mutants M1 and M2 were chosen for further analysis. In spotting assays using diluted cells, each of these two mutants derived from strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) was able to grow on medium without ara at rates comparable to those of wild-type bacteria (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>)</bold>. We then performed whole genome sequencing analysis of these two mutants, which revealed that M1 and M2 had 320 and 328 substitution mutations, respectively.

<p>Because depletion of Aeg1 caused cell elongation, we first examined mutated genes whose functions are known to be involved in cell division. An E202K mutation caused by a G to A substitution in the first position of the codon was found in the cell division protein FtsA in both M1 and M2 (<bold><xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref></bold>). We thus verified the suppression phenotype by introducing a plasmid expressing FtsA or FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> into strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) and examined the growth of the resulting bacterial strains under different induction conditions. Expression of FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> allowed strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) to gain the ability to grow in the absence of ara. In contrast, although the protein was expressed at a comparable level, FtsA cannot suppress the growth defect caused by Aeg1 depletion (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>). Consistent with the growth phenotypes, expression of FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> in strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) under conditions in which the complementation gene was not expressed displayed a morphology similar to that of wild-type bacteria (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have found that several mutations in FtsA bypassed the requirement of a number of essential cell division proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>, including ZipA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), FtsK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), and FtsN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Among these, FtsA<sub>Q28</sub><sub>6W</sub> (FtsA*) was the first gain-of-function mutation found in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which allowed the survival of mutants lacking ZipA (Δ<italic>zipA</italic>) or FtsK (Δ<italic>ftsK</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Additionally, FtsA<sub>I143L</sub> and FtsA<sub>E124A</sub> weakly bypassed the requirement of FtsN. These mutations also rescued the FtsL<sub>L86F/E87K</sub> mutant when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). We thus examined whether similar mutations in FtsA of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> can bypass the need of Aeg1 by constructing substitution FtsA mutants D124A, V144L and Q285W, which correspond to E124A, I143L, and Q286W in its <italic>E. coli</italic> counterpart, respectively (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref></bold>) and tested them in strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1). Whereas FtsA<sub>Q28</sub><sub>5W</sub> cannot detectably suppress Aeg1 depletion, expression of FtsA<sub>D124A</sub> or FtsA<sub>V144L</sub> partially resecured the growth of strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) in medium without ara (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>). Despite multiple attempts, we were unable to detect the expression of these FtsA mutants by immunoblotting using antibody specific to the Flag epitope fused to these alleles (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, lower panels</bold>), suggesting that the low activity exhibited by these mutants may result from low protein levels.</p>
<p>The observation that mutations in genes involved in cell division bypass the need of Aeg1 suggests that this protein participate in the same cellular process. We thus analyzed the cellular localization of Aeg1 in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> by introducing a plasmid that expresses Aeg1-mCherry from the P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter. Fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that Aeg1 localized at the septum of dividing cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>), which validated the genetic evidence for its role in cell division.</p>

<p>To further explore the possibility that Aeg1 is a component of the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> divisome, we determined its interactions with known cell division proteins using the Cya-based bacterial two-hybrid method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>).

<p>We next analyzed the localization of Aeg1 and core divisome proteins during cell division of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> by taking advantage of the elongated morphology of Aeg1-depleted cells, which may allow better resolution of observation via fluorescence microscopy. To this end, we coexpressed the mCherry-Aeg1 fusion with GFP fusion of ZipA, FtsK, FtsL, FtsB, or FtsN in the Δ<italic>aeg</italic>1 mutant from the ara- and IPTG-inducible promoter, respectively.

IPTG (0.5 mM) and ara (1%) were added to induce the expression of fusion proteins for 3 h before samples were processed for microscopic analysis. Consistent with results from the protein interaction experiments using the bacterial two-hybrid assay, Aeg1 colocalized with ZipA, FtsK, FtsL, FtsB, and FtsW (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>).

<title>Aeg1 is an essential core cell division protein in <italic>A. baumannii</italic></title>
<p>The interaction map between Aeg1 and core divisome proteins prompted us to postulate that the absence of Aeg1 prevented these proteins from localizing to the midcell. To test this hypothesis, we introduced plasmids that direct the expression of GFP fusion of each of the divisome proteins into strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::mCherry-Aeg1). Each of the resulting strains was grown in LB broth with ara overnight prior to being diluted into fresh medium without ara for 18 h to induce the elongation morphology.

<p>During the formation of the divisome, FtsN was believed to be the last protein being recruited to the septum where it converts FtsQLB and FtsA into their active forms, which subsequently activate the septal peptidoglycan synthase FtsWI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). If the interaction between Aeg1 and FtsN is critical for the ability of the latter to switch on FtsQLB and FtsA, constitutively active mutants of FtsQLB or Fts A should suppress the need of Aeg1 for cell viability. To test this hypothesis, we expressed HA-FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> and HA-FtsL<sub>Q70K</sub> of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (equivalent to mutants of their <italic>E. coli</italic> counterparts that allow the bypass of the requirement of FtsN) (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) in strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) on medium without ara. Although the expression of HA-FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> was not detectable with the HA-specific antibody, induction of this mutant completely restored the growth of the Δ<italic>aeg1</italic> mutant in the absence of Aeg1 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). In contrast, a similarly constructed plasmid that directs the expression of HA-FtsB<sub>D68H</sub> cannot bypass the requirement of Aeg1 under the same conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). Similarly expressed HA-FtsL<sub>Q70K</sub> detectably rescued bacterial growth without Aeg1 at a level considerably lower than that of FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>). The low or undetectable activity exhibited by FtsL<sub>Q70K</sub> and FtsB<sub>D68H</sub> may result from the low protein levels in strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1). Nevertheless, these results support our hypothesis that Aeg1 functions upstream of FtsN, probably by functioning as its activator or recruiting factor.</p>
<p>It is known that expression of mutants FtsI<sub>K211I</sub>, FtsW<sub>M269I</sub>, and FtsW<sub>E289G</sub> driven by a strong promoter can bypass the need of FtsN in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). The ability of FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> and FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> to suppress the growth defect of the Δ<italic>aeg1</italic> mutant prompted us to examine whether constitutively active alleles of FtsW or FtsI have the same effects. Overexpression of FtsW<sub>M254I</sub> and FtsW<sub>S274G</sub> of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> detectably rescued the growth of the strain in which Aeg1 had been depleted (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>). FtsI from <italic>A. baumannii</italic> does not have a residue corresponding to K211 of its <italic>E. coli</italic> counterpart (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref></bold>), we thus did not test the effect of this mutation. Therefore, our results demonstrate that Aeg1 may collaborate with FtsN to activate at least a part of FtsQLB and FtsA for subsequently activation of FtsWI during cell division. Together with results that the variant FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> suppressed the growth defect caused by <italic>aeg1</italic> depletion (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>), these observations support a model in which the Aeg1-FtsN complex is involved in the activation of FtsQLB and FtsA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Powerful In-seq DNA sequencing technologies based on saturated transposon insertion libraries have allowed the identification of genes essential for bacterial viability under specific conditions, including commonly used rich media such as LB broth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Using a conditional gene deletion method, we have revealed that from 10 putative essential genes identified by this method, three previously annotated as hypotheticals are essential for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> viability, suggesting that assignment of essentiality to genes identified by methods of this kind need to be individually verified.</p>
<p>Our assignment of <italic>aeg1</italic> as an essential gene is consistent with a recent study which revealed its essentiality (termed <italic>advA</italic>) by transposon insertion sequencing, which also observed cell elongation upon the depletion of this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), Our results provided at least two additional lines of evidence to support the notion that Aeg1 is a core cell division protein in <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. First, random suppression mutations that bypassed the requirement of Aeg1 mapped to a classic cell division gene and mutations in some cell division genes known to circumvent the need of specific cell division proteins rescued the growth defect caused by Aeg1 depletion. Second, Aeg1 interacts with at least a subset of proteins involved in cell division (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>In the process of bacterial cell division, over 30 distinct proteins are assembled into a complex typically referred to as “divisome” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Ten of these are normally essential for both cell division and survival, and they are now mainly suggested to be the core of the divisome in various bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). These essential division proteins are mostly named Fts (filamentation temperature sensitive), which stems from the fact that inactivating one of these Fts proteins causes cells to become filamentous, which eventually failed to survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Among these, the FtsQLB complex not only serves as a scaffold for recruitment of subsequent divisome proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), but also plays a an important role in regulating the activity of the divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The constriction control domain (CCD) of FtsL was previously defined as a critical component for switching the conformation of FtsLB from an off to an on state in order to activate FtsWI by enabling the interaction between FtsI<sup>peri</sup> and the AWI (activation of FtsWI) region of FtsL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Division obstruction caused by Aeg1 depletion can be effectively circumvented by suppression mutations (FtsB<sub>E65A</sub>) in its CCD domain and by activation mutations (M254I and S274G) of FtsW <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>),</bold> suggesting that Aeg1 functions upstream of these proteins.</p>
<p>In addition to FtsQLB-mediated activation of FtsI in the periplasm, the constitutively active form of FtsA (FtsA*) acting on FtsW in the cytoplasm, these two events functions synergistically to activate FtsWI for sPG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). FtsA is a member of the actin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), which interacts with FtsN via a unique IC domain positioned between the IA and IIA domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Little is known about the function of the IA and IIA domains of FtsA. That the E202K mutation in the IIA domain bypasses the requirement of Aeg1 by <italic>A. baumannii</italic> <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>) suggests that Aeg1 and FtsA work together to activate FtsW.</p>
<p>The maturation of the core divisome is facilitated by the recruitment in a nearly sequential order of the late-division proteins FtsK, FtsQ, FtsL/FtsB, FtsW, FtsI, and FtsN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Once the latest division protein, FtsN, is recruited, division-specific peptidoglycan synthesis conferred by the FtsWI complex is activated to build the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). More recent studies suggest that by binding to FtsA, a small amount of FtsN is recruited to the division site earlier than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) where it induces a conformational switch in both FtsA and the FtsQLB subcomplex on both sides of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Furthermore, binding between FtsA and FtsN is regulated by ZipA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Our observation of strong binding of Aeg1 to ZipA and FtsN <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref>)</bold> prompted us to propose a model in which Aeg1 participates in cell division by anchoring to the division site together with ZipA where it recruits FtsN, which in turn signals to both the cytoplasmic or periplasmic branches of peptidoglycan synthesis involving FtsA and the FtsQLB complex, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>). The placement of Aeg1 as one of the early arrivals in the hierarchical sequential assembly of the divisome is consistent with the fact that the requirement of Aeg1 can be bypassed by constitutively active mutants of FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>), FtsB (FtsB<sub>E65A</sub>), FtsL (FtsL<sub>Q70K</sub>) and of FtsW (FtsW<sub>M254I</sub> and FtsW<sub>S274G</sub>) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>In the early stages of Z-ring assembly, anchor proteins FtsA and ZipA tether FtsZ to the inner face of the plasma membrane. In the initial phase of cell division, a small amount of FtsN is recruited to the divisome in a FtsA-dependent manner <bold>(left, recruitment phase)</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). The Aeg1-ZipA-FtsN complex acts as a dynamic scaffold for recruiting downstream of Fts proteins. Once more FtsN is recruited to the divisome, it will activate both FtsA and the FtsQLB complex, which in turn activates FtsI in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Note that constitutively active form of FtsA (FtsA*) acts on FtsW in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) so did the hyperactive mutants FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> or FtsB<sub>E65A</sub>.

<p>To assess interactions between Aeg1 and <italic>A. baumannii</italic> Fts proteins, we employed the <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> adenylate cyclase (Cya)-based bacterial two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The coding region of Aeg1 was fused to the T25 fragment of Cya and testing Fts proteins were individually fused to the T18 fragment on pUT18C-Flag, which allows the detection of the fusion protein with the Flag-specific antibody (<bold>Table S4</bold>). Interaction was evaluated in the cya<sup>-</sup> <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BTH101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) by the ability of the testing strains to hydrolyze X-Gal. Quantitative measurement of β-galactosidase activity with performed with ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) using an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Testing bacterial strains were cultured in 2 mL LB broth containing 0.5 mM IPTG for 18 h, and 0.2 mL cells were harvest and resuspended in 1 mL Z-buffer (60 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 40 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM KCl, and 7 mL of 2-mercaptoethanol per liter). After adding 50 µL 1% (m/v) SDS and 100 μL of chloroform, cells were lysed by 30 s vortex and 50 μL of ONPG (40 mg/mL) was added. The reaction was terminated with 500 µL of 1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> after ONPG hydrolysis had occurred as determined the presence of the yellow color product. β-galactosidase activity is defined as in Miller units using the following equation: (OD<sub>420</sub>×1000)/ [(time of incubation in min)x(volume of cell suspension in mL)x(cell density of the culture in OD<sub>600</sub>)]. All assays were done in triplicate.</p>

<title>Antibodies and immunoblotting</title>
<p>HA-specific antibody (1:1000) was purchased from Santa Cruz (Cat #sc-7392), and rabbit anti-ICDH (1:2000) was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). To prepare protein samples, we diluted (1:100) saturated bacterial cultures into fresh LB broth. When OD<sub>600</sub> of the cultures reached 0.6, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Approximately 1x10<sup>9</sup> cells were collected, resuspended in 100 μL SDS sample buffer and were boiled for 5 min. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were first blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h followed by incubation with appropriate primary antibodies for 14 h. Washed membranes were incubated with the appropriate IRDye-labeled secondary antibodies and signals were detected using an Odyssey CLx system (LI-COR).</p>

<title>Fluorescence imaging</title>
<p>To determine the cellular localization of Aeg1 and its colocalization with members of the divisome, we constructed pJL03::Aeg1-mCherry, which expressed the fusion from the P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). GFP chimera of Fts proteins were expressed from pJL05 driven by the P<sub>TAC</sub> promoter inducible by IPTG. Each of the GFP-Fts fusion was introduced into strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::mCherry-Aeg1). All strains were maintained in media containing 1% ara to ensure their viability.</p>
<p>To visualize the localization of the fusions, bacterial strains were grown to saturation in LB broth containing ara and the cells washed twice with PBS were diluted to a density of approximately 5x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. The cultures were split into two 2-mL subcultures, the one used to determine how the absence of Aeg1 impacted the cellular localization of Fts proteins received only IPTG but not ara. Cultures were incubated in a shaker for an additional 6 h, and 100 μL cells were withdrawn and fixed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT. After washing twice with PBS, samples were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1:5000) (Invitrogen, cat#H3570) and mounted on slides for observation with an Olympus IX-83 fluorescence microscope.</p>

<title>Bioinformatics analysis</title>
<p>Aeg1 homologs were identified using tBLASTn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>) using the Aeg1 protein (<italic>A1S_3387</italic>) from strain ATCC17978 (GenBank: CP000521.1) as the query sequence. Clustal omega (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/</ext-link>) was used to perform multiple sequence alignments. The homology comparison of Fts proteins between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>A. baumannii</italic> was also performed using Clustal omega. Jalview was used for editing and viewing sequence alignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). TMHMM 2.0 were used to predict protein topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>).</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study identifies several gain-of-function division protein variants that can suppress the lethality caused by depletion of Aeg1/AdvA in Acinetobacter baumannii, but characterization and description of AdvA in its localization patterns and interactions with other divisome proteins are <bold>inadequate</bold>. Since a role of AdvA in cell division has been shown before, the claim that a &quot;novel cell division protein&quot; has been identified is incorrect. The evidence provided also does not support the claim that AdvA plays a critical role in the assembly of the A. baumannii divisome.</p>

<p>The authors prepared several Acinetobacter baumannii strains from which an essential protein of known or unknown function can be depleted. They chose to study one of the proteins (AdvA) in more detail. AdvA is a known essential cell division protein that accumulates at cell division sites together with other such proteins. No clear homologs are present in model bacteria such as E.coli, and the precise role(s) of AdvA is still unclear. The authors rename AdvA here as Aeg1. The authors searched for suppressors of lethality caused by AdvA-depletion and recovered an allele of ftsA (E202K) that is capable of doing so. Based on similar superfission alleles previously recovered in other division genes in E.coli, they test several mutant genes and find that certain alleles in ftsB, L and W can also suppress lethality of AdvA-minus cells.</p>
<p>In addition, the authors perform bacterial two-hybrid assays and protein sublocalization studies of AdvA and of other division proteins, but the results of these studies are either not new (confirming previous work) or not convincing.</p>

<p>In this study the authors confirm that one of the genes classified as essential in a Tn-mutagenesis study in A. baumannii is in fact an essential gene. It is also present in other closely related Gram negative bacteria and the authors designated it Aeg1. Depletion of Aeg1 leads to cell filamentation and it appears that the requirement for Aeg1 can be suppressed by what appear to be activation mutations in various genes. Overall, it appears that Aeg1 is involved in cell division but many of the images suffer from poor quality - it may be due to conversion to PDF. One of the main issues is that depletion of Aeg1 is carried out for such long times (18 hr) (Fig. 2, 4 and 5). Depleting a cell division protein for such long times may have pleiotropic effects on cell physiology. A. baumannii grows quite fast and even with a small inoculum, cells will probably be in stationary phase. If Aeg1 is that essential cells should be quite filamentous 2-3 hours after Ara removal when they are still in exponential phase. Also, it would be better to see the recovery to small cells if cells are not grown such a long time before Ara is added back. Overall, Aeg1 is potentially interesting but studies are needed to define its place in the assembly pathway. What proteins are at the division site when Aeg1 is depleted and what proteins are required for Aeg1 to localize to the division site. These experiments should be done when cell are depleted of proteins for only 1 -2 hours.</p>
