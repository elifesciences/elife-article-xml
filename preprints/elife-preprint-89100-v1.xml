<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Internalization from the cell membrane and endosomal trafficking of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are important regulators of signaling in normal cells that can frequently be disrupted in cancer. The adrenal tumour pheochromocytoma (PCC) can be caused by activating mutations of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, or inactivation of TMEM127, a transmembrane tumour suppressor implicated in trafficking of endosomal cargos. However, the role of aberrant receptor trafficking in PCC is not well understood. Here, we show that loss of TMEM127 causes wildtype RET protein accumulation on the cell surface, where increased receptor density facilitates constitutive ligand-independent activity and downstream signaling, driving cell proliferation. Loss of TMEM127 altered normal cell membrane organization and recruitment and stabilization of membrane protein complexes, impaired assembly, and maturation of clathrin coated pits, and reduced internalization and degradation of cell surface RET. In addition to RTKs, TMEM127 depletion also promoted surface accumulation of several other transmembrane proteins, suggesting it may cause global defects in surface protein activity and function. Together, our data identify TMEM127 as an important determinant of membrane organization, including membrane protein diffusability and protein complex assembly, and provide a novel paradigm for oncogenesis in PCC where altered membrane dynamics promotes cell surface accumulation and constitutive activity of growth factor receptors to drive aberrant signaling and promote transformation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Internalization of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) from the cell membrane and trafficking through endosomal compartments is a critical mechanism regulating the magnitude and duration of downstream signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Schmid, 2017</xref>). RTKs internalized by clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) transition through successive early and late endosomes for eventual degradation in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sorkin and Fortian, 2015</xref>). In cells where endocytosis or trafficking are impaired, RTKs may accumulate inappropriately at the cell surface or in aberrant subcellular compartments, contributing to cell transformation and oncogenic growth. Despite the importance of CME and RTK cargo transition through compartments, the trafficking proteins required for transitions and their roles in these processes remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>RET (Rearranged during Transfection) is a receptor tyrosine kinase required for development of the kidneys, nerves and neuroendocrine cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mulligan, 2019</xref>). Under normal conditions, RET is activated by binding of its glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands and GPI-linked GDNF family receptor α (GFRα) coreceptors, which together recruit RET complexes to lipid rafts, leading to downstream signalling through multiple pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mulligan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Pierchala et al., 2006</xref>). Activated RET at the cell membrane is internalized via CME to early endosomes where signaling persists, and subsequently trafficked through the endolysosomal system for down regulation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Crupi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>). Activating mutations of RET or over expression of the wildtype (WT) protein are established drivers in several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mulligan, 2019</xref>). Constitutively active RET mutants give rise to the inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), which is characterized by the adrenal tumour pheochromocytoma (PCC), while activating mutations or increased RET expression are found in a subset of sporadic PCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Le Hir et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mulligan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Takaya et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Takaya et al., 1996b</xref>).</p>
<p>PCC has also been associated with inactivating mutations of TMEM127, a multipass integral membrane protein broadly expressed at low levels and localized to the plasma membrane, endosomes and lysosomes in normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Deng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Qin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Qin et al., 2010</xref>). TMEM127 functions are poorly understood but it has been suggested to facilitate endosomal transition and cargo trafficking and has been shown to modulate endolysosomal function in renal cell carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Deng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Qin et al., 2010</xref>). Loss of function mutations of <italic>TMEM127</italic> have been identified in both familial and sporadic PCC, leading to loss of TMEM127 protein or mislocalization to the cytosol in tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Neumann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Qin et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Both RET and TMEM127 have been predicted to confer PCC susceptibility through altered kinase signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mulligan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Neumann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Qin et al., 2010</xref>), however, their relationship has not been explored. The importance of endolysosomal trafficking in regulating the intensity and duration of RET pro-proliferative signals, suggested that loss of TMEM127-mediated endosomal transition could alter RET trafficking, promoting accumulation or signaling from aberrant subcellular compartments and contributing to transformation. In this study, we have investigated the effects of TMEM127 depletion on RET regulation and function and more broadly on cellular processes that could contribute to PCC pathogenesis. Here, we show that loss of TMEM127 leads to cell surface accumulation and constitutive activation of RET and that this accumulation is due to alterations in membrane organization and composition that reduce efficiency of CME and decrease internalization of RET as well as other transmembrane proteins, suggesting a global impairment of membrane trafficking. As a result of changes in membrane dynamics, TMEM127 depletion increased RET half-life and led to constitutive RET-mediated signalling and cell proliferation that was blocked by RET inhibition. Our data further demonstrate that TMEM127 loss increases membrane protein diffusability, and impairs normal membrane transitions and the stabilization and assembly of membrane protein complexes, allowing inappropriate accumulation of actively signaling RET molecules at the cell membrane, and that mis-localized RET is the pathogenic mechanism in TMEM127-mutant PCC.</p>

<title>Loss-of-function mutations disrupt TMEM127 localization and reduce early endosome formation</title>
<p>WT-TMEM127 has previously been shown to localize to endosomal compartments, while loss-of-function PCC-associated TMEM127 mutants reduce protein expression or may be aberrantly localized in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Flores et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Qin et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we assessed colocalization of transiently expressed TMEM127 with the early endosome marker EEA1 in human retinal pigment epithelial ARPE-19 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. We showed that WT-TMEM127 localized robustly to EEA1-positive endosomes but that colocalization was significantly reduced for two transmembrane domain TMEM127 mutants (C140Y, S147del), which did not show appreciable localization to EEA1 puncta (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Interestingly, the total numbers of EEA1 puncta in cells were modestly reduced in the presence of TMEM127-S147del and significantly reduced for TMEM127-C140Y (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting a systemic disruption of endosomal formation or stability in response to loss of TMEM127 function in these cells. In ARPE-19 cells transiently expressing RET and TMEM127, GDNF stimulation promoted colocalization of RET with WT but not mutant TMEM127 in EEA1 positive endosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). RET and EEA1 colocalization was reduced but not eliminated in the presence of TMEM127 mutants, suggesting TMEM127 loss may limit RET localization to early endosome compartments.</p>

<title>TMEM127 depletion promotes cell surface RET accumulation</title>
<p>As human PCC cell lines are not available, we generated a CRISPR-Cas9 TMEM127-knockout (KO) and control (Mock-KO) in human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, which endogenously expresses RET and TMEM127 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), to explore the effects of TMEM127 loss of function on RET localization and functions. We confirmed that these TMEM127-KO cells had similarly reduced EEA1 positive endosomes to our transient models, described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). Interestingly, we observed notably increased levels of RET protein in TMEM127-KO compared to control Mock-KO cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), which was consistent with accumulation of a fully mature glycosylated RET form that is found primarily on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Takahashi et al., 1991</xref>). This accumulation was not due to changes in <italic>RET</italic> gene transcription, since TMEM127-KO cells had significantly less RET mRNA in qRT-PCR assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>), suggesting a possible feedback loop modulating RET transcription. Transient re-expression of WT-TMEM127 in these cells reduced RET protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). Using a surface protein biotinylation assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Reyes-Alvarez et al., 2022</xref>) to specifically detect plasma membrane proteins, we showed that cell surface RET was significantly increased, by approximately 5 fold, in TMEM127-KO compared to Mock-KO cells. Taken together, the accumulation of RET on the cell surface and reduced RET in early endosomes suggested that TMEM127 loss might disrupt RET internalization.</p>

<title>TMEM127 depletion promotes RET accumulation through impaired internalization</title>
<p>We assessed RET internalization in response to GDNF over time in TMEM127-KO and Mock-KO cells using a biotinylation internalization assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Reyes-Alvarez et al., 2022</xref>)). Consistent with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Crupi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>), minimal RET internalization was detected by 5 min of GDNF treatment in Mock-KO cells and increased over time, with significantly greater internalization detected by 30 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In TMEM127-KO cells, RET internalization was similar at all time points and did not increase over time with longer GDNF treatments, with significantly less internalization observed after 30 min compared to Mock-KO controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Recycling of internalized RET to the cell surface in biotinylation assays was also reduced in TMEM127-KO compared to Mock-KO cells with a smaller proportion of the internalized RET being returned to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure S2A, B</xref>) suggesting RET surface accumulation was not due to enhanced recycling. Our data show that RET internalization into TMEM127-KO cells is not GDNF responsive and remains at a low constitutive rate despite high levels of RET protein accumulating on the cell surface, suggesting that TMEM127 depletion may impair cellular internalization mechanisms, such as CME.</p>

<title>RET localization with cell-surface clathrin and internalization are reduced in TMEM127-depleted cells</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that, in response to ligand, RET is recruited to clathrin clusters assembling on the plasma membrane and internalized into endosomal compartments via clathrin coated pits (CCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Crupi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Crupi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>). To further explore the surface accumulation of RET and impairment of RET internalization in TMEM127-depleted cells, we assessed RET colocalization with cell-surface clathrin by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aguet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Crupi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Crupi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hyndman et al., 2017</xref>). In Mock-KO cells, GDNF treatment significantly increased colocalization of RET and plasma membrane clathrin structures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>) and caused a significant loss of cell surface RET intensity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting activated RET is being recruited to CCPs and then moving out of the TIRF field as it is internalized into the cell. In contrast, when normalized for the increased total RET intensity on the cell surface, RET-clathrin colocalization in untreated TMEM127-KO cells was significantly less than in untreated Mock-KO cells and was not increased by GDNF treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>), suggesting impaired recruitment of RET to cell-surface clathrin irrespective of ligand stimulation. The overall intensity of cell surface clathrin puncta was not affected by GDNF treatment but was significantly less in TMEM127-KO cells compared to Mock-KO (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). A decrease of clathrin fluorescence intensity in plasma membrane clathrin structures could suggest a decrease in the number of clathrin subunits incorporated per CCP, and thus reflect a change in clathrin assembly or size. Alternatively, as TIRF intensity decays exponentially with distance from the coverslip, a reduction of clathrin intensity in the TIRF image could also indicate an increase in membrane curvature. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used concomitant widefield epifluorescence microscopy to assess clathrin fluorescence intensity at puncta detected within the TIRF images above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), as this form of microscopy is not sensitive to changes in fluorescence intensity by the extent of CCP curvature generation. Clathrin fluorescence intensity in epifluorescence images was robustly reduced in clathrin puncta from TMEM127-KO cells, indicating less clathrin and smaller clusters, not more deeply invaginated structures.</p>

<p>We further assessed numbers and sizes of CCPs in TMEM127 KO cells by imaging EGFP-tagged clathrin with structured illumination microscopy (SIM). Because over 60% of CCPs have been measured to be less than 200 µm in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wu et al., 2001</xref>), the approximate diffraction limit of a light microscope, super-resolution techniques are needed to fully resolve these structures for accurate quantitation. Therefore, we used a technique called dual iterative SIM (diSIM, SIM<sup>2</sup>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Löschberger et al., 2021</xref>)) that combines a lattice illumination pattern with deconvolution and standard SIM processing to resolve lateral structures as small as 60-100 nm in the ∼525 nm emission range. Initial visual inspection of diSIM images of TMEM127-KO and Mock-KO cells expressing EGFP-tagged clathrin light chain (EGFP-CLC) suggested TMEM127-KO cells had fewer and smaller CCPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). We further quantified the 2D area of over 6500 CCPs in and near the plasma membranes closest to the coverslip in TMEM127-KO and Mock-KO cells. Here, we found TMEM127-KO cells had a 2D CCP area approximately half of Mock-KO cells (0.008 µm<sup>2</sup> vs. 0.016 µm<sup>2</sup>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). An area of 0.008 µm<sup>2</sup> corresponds to a diameter of approximately 90 nm, within the resolving power of the diSIM technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Löschberger et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, we also quantitated the number of CCPs per cell on a single plane near the lower membrane of TMEM127-KO and Mock-KO cells. The added resolving power of diSIM gave us confidence in reaching a more accurate count (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Here we found a significant decrease in CCPs in TMEM127-KO cells relative to Mock-KO cells (213 vs. 289). diSIM provides a clear indication that knockout of TMEM127 alters the size and quantity of CCPs in a cell.</p>
<p>Together, our data indicate that TMEM127 depletion led to smaller clathrin clusters or CCPs, suggesting that TMEM127 regulates CCP formation, assembly, and/or turnover. In contrast, we observed a significant 1.3-fold increase in intensity of cell surface RET puncta in TMEM127-KO cells relative to Mock-KO cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), consistent with the cell surface accumulation of RET, but did not observe a decrease in RET puncta in response to GDNF stimulation suggesting impaired internalization. As fewer CCPs are present in TMEM127-KO cells, some of these intense RET puncta are likely not in CCPs but may represent other organization of the receptor at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, we saw a similar increase in surface EGFR puncta intensity in TMEM127-KO cells, with a 1.4-fold increase over Mock-KO cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), demonstrating that protein accumulation at the cell surface is not exclusive to RET in these cells. We extended this observation using surface biotinylation assays and showed that multiple classes of transmembrane proteins including RTKs (RET, EGFR), cell adhesion molecules (N-Cadherin, Integrin Beta-3) and carrier proteins (Transferrin Receptor-1) accumulate on the cell membrane in TMEM127-KO compared to Mock-KO cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>), suggesting a global effect caused by impaired surface protein internalization. Together, these data suggest that loss of TMEM127 impairs normal membrane processes including formation of clathrin clusters or CCPs and recruitment of cargo, resulting in altered cell membrane composition and accumulation of multiple cell surface proteins.</p>

<p>CCPs undergo a multistage initiation, stabilization, and maturation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Clathrin assemblies must reach a minimum threshold for nucleation of CCPs to initiate. These assemblies can result in either small short-lived (&lt;15 s) abortive CCPs that spontaneously disassemble without cargo uptake, or longer lived productive CCPs that effectively recruit cargo for internalization and delivery to the endolysosomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>). We examined CCP dynamics over time in live-cells using TIRFM and automated detection to identify diffraction-limited EGFP-CLC objects, and assessed the rates of assembly, initiation, and maturation of CCPs in Mock-KO and TMEM127-KO cells. Here, we show that TMEM127-KO cells have significantly increased stochastic assemblies of transient small subthreshold clathrin-labelled structures (sCLS) that are unable to recruit sufficient clathrin to form bona fide CCPs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, C</xref>). As a result of this increase in transient structures, we show a resultant decrease in the initiation of bona fide CCPs in TMEM127-KO cells compared to Mock-KO cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, D</xref>). Further, as indicated by the reduced clathrin puncta intensity at the membrane and reduced area of CCPs detected by dSIM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, F</xref>), the CCPs that do form in TMEM127-KO cells are smaller, potentially limiting their ability to recruit cargo, such as RET, leading the cargo proteins to accumulate on the cell surface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-D</xref>). Interestingly, although there are relatively fewer CCPs formed in TMEM127-KO cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), a smaller fraction of these had lifespans less than 15 s, suggesting CCPs that are able to overcome early assembly defects due to TMEM127 loss are able to mature to productive CCPs more efficiently (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). The overall increase in sCLS and decrease in CCPs, suggests that TMEM127 depletion may reduce the potential for clathrin to form or stabilize CCPs capable of internalization and compromise the maturation of productive CCPs, thereby leading to impaired internalization of RET and other cell surface proteins.</p>
<p>The defect in cargo recruitment to CCPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>) and CCP assembly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-G</xref>, 5A-E) in TMEM127-KO cells could reflect changes specific to cargo engagement within CCPs or broader changes in membrane dynamics, such as protein and lipid mobility. To determine if loss of TMEM127 resulted in broader impacts on membrane dynamics, we examined the mobility of EGFR using single-particle tracking, using strategies we recently developed and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sugiyama et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, labeling of EGFR with a Fab antibody fragment for single particle tracking in the absence of ligand stimulation allows study of EGFR mobility that is largely clathrin independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sugiyama et al., 2023</xref>). TMEM127-KO cells exhibited a similar distribution of the population of EGFR in immobile, confined, and mobile cohorts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting that TMEM127 does not disrupt capture of a minor subset of EGFR within tetraspanin nanodomains that occurs in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sugiyama et al., 2023</xref>). However, consistent with broader disruption of membrane dynamics upon loss of TMEM127, we observed an increase in the diffusion coefficient of the confined and mobile fractions, in particular the latter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). This predicts that loss of TMEM127 may broadly impact membrane dynamics, suggesting that defects in receptor recruitment to CCPs and perturbations of CCP assembly that may lead to accumulation of membrane proteins at the cell surface in TMEM127-KO cells may result in part from broad alterations in membrane dynamics and/or receptor mobility that impact the formation of CCPs and their recruitment of diverse cargo.</p>

<title>Clathrin adaptor recruitment is not TMEM127 dependent</title>
<p>Recruitment of RET to CCPs requires interaction with the clathrin adaptor AP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Crupi et al., 2015</xref>). We used proximity ligation assays (PLA) to identify and quantify direct protein interactions <italic>in situ</italic> to assess association of endogenous AP2 with RET and clathrin in SH-SY5Y cells. In untreated Mock-KO cells, RET-AP2 interaction was minimal but was significantly increased by GDNF treatment, as indicated by increased PLA puncta (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting RET recruitment as cargo to CCPs. Association of RET and AP2 was significantly greater in TMEM127-KO cells, consistent with the higher RET protein levels at the cell membrane, and was further increased by GDNF treatment, suggesting that the RET-AP2 association was not TMEM127 dependent. We saw robust association of clathrin and AP2 in untreated Mock-KO cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). GDNF treatment significantly reduced association, consistent with maturation of productive CCPs and subsequent uncoating of clathrin coated vesicles and delivery of cargo to endosomes. In comparison, TMEM127-KO cells had significantly greater constitutive association of AP2 and clathrin and this was not affected by GDNF. We did not detect association of AP2 with TMEM127 under any condition using PLA (not shown), suggesting TMEM127 is not closely associated with clathrin labelled structures. Together, our data suggest that, in TMEM127-KO cells, AP2-clathrin complexes accumulate but are unable to efficiently support the formation and/or assembly of CCPs to facilitate internalization of cargo proteins. This is consistent with the observation that TMEM127-KO cells have significantly higher sCLS nucleation rates, while exhibiting decreased formation of bona fide CCPs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, D</xref>). It follows that the increased proximity of RET and AP2 in TMEM127-KO cells may reflect increased cell surface levels of RET that may engage with endocytic adaptors, but that these interactions infrequently lead to formation or stabilization of bona fide CCPs. These data suggest that TMEM127 depletion does not directly affect ability of adaptors to associate with clathrin or cargo but may reflect an integral membrane defect that alters normal membrane protein movement and abilities to assemble or stabilize larger membrane protein complexes.</p>

In GDNF-treated Mock-KO cells, RET was rapidly degraded, with a half-life under 2 hours and less than 9% RET protein remaining after 12 hours (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).

<title>RET accumulation promotes increased GDNF-dependent downstream signalling</title>
<p>Overexpression or cell surface accumulation can frequently cause constitutive activation of growth factor receptors, conferring ligand insensitivity for modulating the intensity and duration of their downstream signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Du and Lovly, 2018</xref>). We assessed RET activation and signaling over time in Mock-KO and TMEM127-KO cells in response to GDNF. In Mock-KO cells, RET and its downstream signaling intermediates AKT, ERK and the mTOR substrate S6 were minimally phosphorylated in the absence of GDNF and showed significantly increased phosphorylation over time in response to GDNF treatment (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A, B</xref>), consistent with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Crupi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, RET, AKT, ERK and S6 were constitutively phosphorylated in TMEM127-KO cells.

Phosphorylation of AKT, ERK and S6 was not significantly increased by GDNF treatment in TMEM127-KO cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A, B</xref>). Further, we showed that the constitutive phosphorylation of RET, AKT, ERK, and S6 in TMEM127-KO cells could be blocked by RET inhibition using the multikinase inhibitor Vandetanib, and selective RET inhibitors Selpercatinib, and Pralsetinib (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>), which are clinically approved for treatment of RET-associated cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mulligan, 2019</xref>).

<p>Oncogenic activating RET mutations are drivers of proliferation and tumour growth in PCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mulligan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Neumann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Toledo et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we assessed whether RET constitutive activation caused by cell surface accumulation in response to TMEM127 loss could also promote these processes. We showed that GDNF treatment significantly increased proliferation of Mock-KO cells over a 3-day period (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). TMEM127-KO cells proliferated significantly faster than Mock-KO cells, irrespective of GDNF treatment (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>), consistent with increased RET accumulation leading to ligand independent RET activity and proliferation. To confirm that proliferation was RET-mediated and explore the impact of RET inhibition in TMEM127-KO cells, we assessed proliferation in the presence and absence of the selective RET inhibitor Selpercatinib at a concentration sufficient to block RET phosphorylation (0.1 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Selpercatinib significantly reduced GDNF-dependent proliferation of Mock-KO cells. In TMEM127-KO cells, RET inhibition abrogated the increase in proliferation, seen above, and further significantly reduced viability (∼20%) compared to Mock-KO cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). Vehicle alone (DMSO) did not affect proliferation under any conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Our data demonstrate that proliferation of TMEM127-KO cells was RET-dependent and suggest a previously unrecognized sensitivity of TMEM127-depleted cells to RET inhibition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The RET receptor and the TMEM127 integral membrane protein are established PCC susceptibility genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dahia, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Neumann et al., 2019</xref>). RET oncogenic mutations give rise to PCC in patients with MEN2 and are found in up to 5% of sporadic PCC, where they promote constitutive RET activation and downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Horton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Le Hir et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mulligan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Takaya et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Takaya et al., 1996b</xref>). In contrast, TMEM127 acts as a tumour suppressor and loss of function mutations have been linked primarily to increased mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Deng et al., 2018</xref>). Although RET and WT-TMEM127 localize to similar endosomal compartments, we show that colocalization is lost in the presence of PCC-associated mutants that disrupt TMEM127 membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Qin et al., 2010</xref>). Endosomes are reduced in size and number in the absence of WT-TMEM127, suggesting defects in the process required for vesicle formation and internalization and trafficking of proteins from the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<p>Using a CRISPR TMEM127-KO in the neural crest-derived neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, we noted significantly increased levels of endogenously expressed RET protein, which appeared primarily as the higher molecular weight fully glycosylated form found at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Takahashi et al., 1991</xref>). Using surface biotin labelling and TIRFM in fixed and live cells we showed that RET internalization was impaired, and that WT RET accumulated on the cell surface in the absence of TMEM127, escaping degradation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Notably, accumulation of surface receptors was not unique to RET as we also saw increased intensity of EGFR puncta and increased membrane levels of other receptors and adhesion molecules in the absence of TMEM127, consistent with a global defect of membrane dynamics that could also block internalization of membrane proteins. As a result of increased density in the plasma membrane, RET is constitutively active, promoting ligand independent stimulation of multiple downstream signaling pathways. Importantly, treatment with selective RET inhibitors abrogated these signals including mTOR signaling, suggesting that, in this model, the increase in mTOR signaling seen in response to TMEM127 loss is a direct response to RET activity.</p>

<caption><title>TMEM127 loss drives transformation through altered RET location and activity in PCC</title>
<p>TMEM127 depletion alters membrane diffusion and impairs formation of productive clathrin coated pits (CCP) for internalization of membrane receptors. CCPs are fewer, smaller, and less able to recruit cargo, resulting in accumulation of transmembrane proteins, including RET on the cell surface. As a result, RET downstream signaling is enhanced and degradation is reduced leading to increased cell proliferation. The selective RET inhibitor Selpercatinib abrogates RET-mediated signals and blocks cell proliferation.</p></caption>

<p>As both RET and TMEM127 have been previously shown to internalize through clathrin mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Crupi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Crupi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Flores et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>) we assessed the impact of TMEM127 depletion on membrane clathrin distribution and its effects on cargo internalization. Despite increased RET puncta intensity on the cell surface, RET localization to clathrin puncta was reduced and was not responsive to GDNF, consistent with impairment of clathrin mediated internalization of RET (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). The formation of CCPs is a multistep process involving recruitment of clathrin adaptors and stepwise assembly of clathrin labelled structures at the cell membrane for recruitment of cargo proteins and assembly of productive CCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>). Transient small clathrin labelled structures (sCLSs) are unstable and may not recruit sufficient clathrin or cargo to achieve a threshold size and progress further to initiate bona fide CCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>). Once sufficient clathrin is recruited for initiation, CCPs may mature to pinch off clathrin coated vesicles from the membrane, but a subset fails to mature and are aborted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kadlecova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>). Our single particle tracking studies suggest that mobility of membrane cargo proteins like EGFR, is enhanced in TMEM127 KO cells, which may decrease capture of cargo at stochastic clathrin assemblies and limit their progression to successful nucleation and initiation of bona fide CCPs. Consistent with this, our data indicate that TMEM127-depletion increased the frequency of the sCLSs but significantly reduced their ability to reach the clathrin threshold size and initiate bona fide CCPs. CCPs that did form were smaller, contained less clathrin, and were able to recruit less RET cargo than in Mock-KO cells. TMEM127 loss did not impair RET-AP2 or AP2-clathrin association, suggesting that key protein interactions required for internalization were largely intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">von Zastrow and Sorkin, 2021</xref>). However, we saw decreased capture of RET within bona fide CCPs, formation of CCPs was reduced, and those that formed smaller in TMEM127 deficient cells, suggesting that altered membrane dynamics, increasing the diffusability of membrane proteins and impairing capture of sufficient cargo-adaptor complexes into nascent CCPs, could be limiting the recruitment of sufficient cargo and coalescence of CCPs, consistent with previous studies that link membrane tension and CCP formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Djakbarova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Saleem et al., 2015</xref>). Together, our data suggest that accumulation of RET and other transmembrane proteins at the cell surface in the absence of functional TMEM127 is due to reduced efficiency of clathrin recruitment to CCP, limiting capacity for cargo internalization and reducing CME, and that this correlates with the global disruption of membrane protein composition and organization in other domains, such as membrane rafts.</p>
<p>As a result of impaired internalization in TMEM127 deficient SH-SY5Y cells, RET protein accumulates on the cell surface and degradation is reduced, leading to sustained downstream pro-proliferative signals. We showed that these pathways can be blocked using selective RET inhibitors, suggesting that targeting RET may be a valuable therapeutic strategy in the subset of PCC tumours where RET mutations have not been recognized but RET expression is detected. However, TMEM127 mutations also act as drivers in other cancers, notably renal cell carcinoma, where RET is not highly expressed. In these cancers, we would predict that TMEM127 loss has similar effects on membrane dynamics, membrane protein accumulation and CCP formation to those seen in our model and that accumulation of other growth factor receptors, such as MET, on the cell surface will lead to transformation (Marona et al., 2019; Rhoades Smith and Bilen, 2019). Notably, aberrant accumulation of membrane proteins in response to TMEM127 depletion may have other pathological implications. Consistent with our data showing RET accumulation on the cell surface, TMEM127 KO mice have increased insulin sensitivity and upregulation of insulin dependent AKT signaling (Srikantan et al., 2019), which may suggest excess surface accumulation of insulin receptors and resulting enhanced signaling in the liver in this model. Interestingly, in Salmonella infected but not normal antigen presenting cells, TMEM127 may have roles in recruitment of protein complexes that promote downregulation of MHCII and suppression of T-cell activation, while depletion of TMEM127 in infected cells increases MHCII surface expression and reduces innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alix et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that TMEM127 may have roles as an adaptor, but only under specific conditions. Under normal cellular conditions, our data suggest a more generalized role as a facilitator of diverse membrane protein complexes regulating localized membrane diffusion and promoting stability of complex assemblies to regulate membrane organization.</p>
<p>Together, our data suggest a novel paradigm for oncogenic transformation in TMEM127 mutant tumours. We predict that altered membrane dynamics blocks normal internalization and degradation of key wildtype growth promoting receptors, which then act as oncogenes to drive tumorigenesis in a cell type-specific fashion. Further, we predict that these oncogenes will provide valuable alternative therapeutic targets that have not been previously explored in TMEM127-mutant cancers.</p>

<p>This study highlights new insights into the mechanism of pheochromocytoma pathogenesis that remains poorly understood. In the context of hereditary syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN-2), where RET mutation is the major driver of thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal pathologies, including pheochromocytoma, this mechanistic dissection of RET and TMEM127 is fundamentally sound. While the significance was deemed <bold>important</bold>, the strength of the evidence was found to be <bold>solid</bold>, although additional validation work would strengthen the findings.</p>

<p>In this study, authors have investigated the effects of TMEM127 depletion on RET regulation and function that could potentially contribute to PCC pathogenesis. They have demonstrated that the loss of TMEM127 leads to cell surface accumulation and constitutive activation of RET due to membrane organization, leading to reduced efficiency of endocytosis, decreased internalization of RET, and a global impairment of membrane trafficking. TMEM127 depletion has contributed to increased RET half-life, constitutive RET-mediated signaling, increased membrane protein diffusibility, impaired normal membrane transitions, and inappropriate accumulation of actively signaling RET molecules at the cell membrane. Collectively, these findings have shown that the mis-localized RET is the pathogenic mechanism in TMEM127-mutant pheochromocytoma.</p>
<p>Experimental design and mechanistic studies are thorough and sound. The methodological weakness lies in the lack of pheochromocytoma cell line utility to reproduce novel findings observed in generated cell lines. This may represent a significant challenge that could undermine the inferred value of these potentially paradigm-changing findings. 3-dimensional patient-derived pheochromocytoma organoid in vitro model and/or patient-derived organoid xenograft in vivo model may aid in reconciling these exciting new findings and factoring in that the pheochromocytoma is a hormonally active tumor.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the authors have successfully achieved all proposed aims supported by their conclusions.</p>
<p>These findings carry potentially significant clinical impact and may offer new therapeutic venues in patients with pheochromocytoma.</p>

<p>Summary: Walker et al have proposed that the tumor suppressor TMEM127 converges with RET activation to drive adrenal phenochromocytoma. RET is a common oncogene both in familial and sporadic forms of this cancer, and TMEM127 has also been observed as a loss of function mutation in sporadic disease. The authors hypothesize that loss of the TMEM127 might signal stabilization of RET on the cell surface, mimicking an activating mutation. Through a nice set of experiments, they show that TMEM127 loss impairs endosome function and promotes RET surface accumulation. This expression was resistant to GDNF, suggesting that recycling via endosome recirculation was impaired such that the half-life of RET on the cell surface was extended. RET interaction with clathrin-coated pits was also disrupted, as the CCPs themselves were significantly smaller, and plasma membrane organization was affected by the impaired endosome recycling. Notably, a number of proteins were found to be accumulating on the cell surface via the purported mechanism, EGFR, TFR1, N cadherin, integrin beta 3. The authors applied a RET inhibitor to cells, showing decreased cellular proliferation.</p>
<p>Strengths: In summary, this is an interesting finding, that is preliminary in nature and is incompletely validated currently. It is certainly worth further investigation as a central feature linking TMEM127 mutations and pheochromocytoma through a common pathway of RET activation by fixing this factor in an active state on the cell surface.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Although this is a provocative finding, and the authors test the interaction in a number of ways, there are several factors that limit the enthusiasm for this work as currently presented. The work is limited to one isogenic cell line with limited validation.</p>
