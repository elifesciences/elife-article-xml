<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Anti-cancer treatments can result in various adverse effects, including infections due to immune suppression/dysregulation and drug-induced toxicity in the lung. One of the major opportunistic infections is <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> pneumonia (PCP), which can cause severe respiratory complications and high mortality rates. Cytotoxic drugs and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can induce interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Nonetheless, the differentiation of these diseases can be difficult, and the pathogenic mechanisms of such diseases are not yet fully understood. To better comprehend the immunophenotypes, we conducted an exploratory mass cytometry analysis of immune cell subsets in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with PCP, cytotoxic drug-induced ILD (DI-ILD), and ICI-associated ILD (ICI-ILD) using two panels containing 64 markers. In PCP, we observed an expansion of the CD16<sup>+</sup> T cell population, with the highest CD16<sup>+</sup> T proportion in a fatal case. In ICI-ILD, we found an increase in CD57<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing immune checkpoints (TIGIT<sup>+</sup> LAG3<sup>+</sup> TIM-3<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup>), FCRL5<sup>+</sup>B cells, and CCR2<sup>+</sup> CCR5<sup>+</sup> CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes. These findings uncover the diverse immunophenotypes and possible pathomechanisms of cancer treatment-related pneumonitis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The advancements in anti-cancer therapy have revolutionized cancer management and have led to improved patient outcomes. However, these therapies can also lead to various adverse effects, including infections due to immune suppression/dysregulation and drug-induced toxicity, with the lungs being a commonly affected organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Conte et al., 2022</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Morelli et al., 2022</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Skeoch et al., 2018</xref>). One of the major opportunistic infections in cancer patients or those receiving immunosuppressive treatment is <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> pneumonia (PCP), which can cause severe respiratory complications and high mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Thomas and Limper, 2004</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Asai et al., 2022</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Apostolopoulou and Fishman, 2022</xref>). However, the precise immune reactions during PCP development and mechanisms of lung injury remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>While both cytotoxic drugs and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can induce interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), the mechanisms underlying these complications may differ between the two classes of drugs. In particular, ICI-associated ILDs are considered a type of immune-related adverse events (irAE)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Postow et al., 2018</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ando et al., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms that cause drug induced-ILDs are predominantly unidentified. Further, despite various diagnostic approaches, including radiology and molecular testing, there is a need for useful biomarkers to distinguish PCP, cytotoxic drug induced (DI)-ILD, and ICI-ILD.</p>
<p>Mass cytometry, also known as cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), is a cutting-edge technology that uses inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to detect metal ions tagged to antibodies that bind to specific cellular proteins, allowing for a detailed and multi-dimensional characterization of cellular composition and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Spitzer and Nolan, 2016</xref>). This technique provides a unique advantage over traditional flow cytometry, which is limited by spectral overlap and the number of parameters that can be analyzed simultaneously. Mass cytometry has been used to study a variety of biological systems, including immune-mediated diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Matsubara et al., 2021</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hata et al., 2023</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Couloume et al., 2021</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chedid et al., 2022</xref>). Through high-throughput analysis of large numbers of single cells, mass cytometry can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular heterogeneity and signaling pathways involved in these diseases, allowing for the identification of potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to use mass cytometry to analyze bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples to distinguish pulmonary involvement in patients with malignancy undergoing chemotherapy and to identify potential biomarkers for DI-ILD, ICI-ILD, and PCP. By characterizing the cellular and molecular changes in BAL from patients with these complications, we aim to improve our understanding of their pathogenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Eligible for enrollment in the study were patients newly diagnosed with PCP, DI-ILD, and ICI-ILD who had undergone BALF collection at Kyushu University Hospital between January 2017 and April 2022. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kyushu University Hospital (reference number 22117-00). Diagnostic criteria for PCP, DI-ILD, and ICI-ILD were in accordance with those previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Skeoch et al., 2018</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Asai et al., 2022</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Apostolopoulou and Fishman, 2022</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Delaunay et al., 2019</xref>).

<p>Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected from patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), cytotoxic drug-related interstitial lung disease (DI-ILD), and immune-checkpoint inhibitor-related ILD (ICI-ILD). Subsequently, BALF cells were analyzed using mass cytometry with a T cell panel (35 markers) and B cell/myeloid cell panel (32 markers) following CD45 barcoding for sample identification. The study found that there was a significant increase in the expansion of CD16<sup>+</sup> T cells in patients with PCP, with the highest CD16 expression observed in a fatal case of PCP.</p></caption>

<p>Metal-tagged antibodies were obtained from Standard Biotools or purchased in a purified form (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and then labeled with metals using the Maxpar Antibody Labeling Kit (Standard Biotools) as instructed by the manufacturer. The cell labeling was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hata et al., 2023</xref>). Cryopreserved BALF cells were thawed in PBS and then stained with Cell-ID Cisplatin-198Pt (Standard Biotools #201198, 1:2000 dilution) in PBS before being incubated with FcR blocking reagent (Myltenyi, #130-059-901) and barcoded with each metal-labeled CD45 antibody (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). After washing, CD45-labeled cells were mixed and stained with APC-conjugated FCRL5 antibodies (for panel #2), followed by staining with the antibody cocktail (Panels #1 and #2, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The antibody amount was determined through preliminary experiments with metal minus one. Cells were then washed, fixed with 1.6% formaldehyde, and resuspended in Cell-ID Intercalator 103Rh (Standard Biotools #201103A) in Fix and Perm buffer (Standard Biotools) at 4°C overnight. For acquisition, cells were resuspended in MaxPar Cell Acquisition Solution (Standard Biotools #201240) containing one-fifth EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (Standard Biotools #201078) and acquired at a rate of 200-300 events/second on a Helios mass cytometer (Standard Biotools). Files were converted to FCS, randomized, and normalized for EQ bead intensity using the Helios software. Concatenating fcs files in the same group into one file was conducted by FlowJo v10.8 (BD Biosciences). Cytobank Premium (Cytobank Inc.) was used to perform manual gating, visualization of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (viSNE), Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis, and Citrus analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bruggner et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>To select live cells, cisplatin-positive cells and doublets were excluded, and CD45<sup>+</sup> cells were further analyzed. For T cells, CD2<sup>+</sup> CD3<sup>+</sup> cells were gated and subjected to UMAP and Citrus algorithms. The UMAP analysis included clustering channels for CD4, CD8a, CD27, CD28, CD45RA, CD45RO, Fas, and used the parameters: numbers of neighbors = 15, minimum distance = 0.01. The Citrus algorithm for T cells included clustering channels for CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8a, CD11a, CD16, CD27, CD28, CD44, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD49d, CD57, CD69, CD226, Fas, IL-2R, PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, OX40, TIGIT, TIM3, CTLA-4, CD223 (LAG-3), BTLA, ICOS, ST2, CCR7, CXCR3, HLA-DR, and used the parameters: association models = nearest shrunken centroid (PAMR), cluster characterization = abundance, minimum cluster size = 5%, cross validation folds = 5, false discovery rate = 1%. The citrus analysis excluded nivolumab-induced ILD cases due to the apparent loss of PD-1 detection caused by competitive inhibition by nivolumab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Yanagihara et al., 2020</xref>). The viSNE analysis for T cells included clustering channels for CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8a, CD11a, CD16, CD27, CD28, CD44, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD49d, CD57, CD69, CD226, Fas, IL-2R, PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, OX40, TIGIT, TIM3, CTLA-4, CD223 (LAG-3), BTLA, ICOS, ST2, CCR7, CXCR3, and HLA-DR, and used the parameters: iterations = 1000, perplexity = 30, theta = 0.5.</p>
<p>For myeloid cells, CD3<sup>−</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells were gated, and UMAP and Citrus algorithms were used. The UMAP analysis included clustering channels for CD11b, CD11c, CD64, CD14, CD16, CD206, HLA-DR, and CCR2, and used the parameters: numbers of neighbors = 10, minimum distance = 0.01. The Citrus algorithm included clustering channels for CD11b, CD11c, CD64, CD14, CD16, CD32, CD36, CD38, CD84, CD86, CD163, CD206, CD209, CD223, HLA-DR, CCR2, CCR5, and ST2, and used the parameters: association models = nearest shrunken centroid (PAMR), cluster characterization = abundance, minimum cluster size = 5%, cross validation folds = 5, false discovery rate = 1%. One case of PCP was excluded from the Citrus analysis due to low cell numbers.</p>
<p>B cells were identified using gating of CD3<sup>−</sup> CD64<sup>−</sup> and CD19<sup>+</sup> or CD138<sup>+</sup> cells. viSNE analysis was performed to cluster B cells using the following markers: CD19, CD38, CD11c, IgA, IgG, CD138, CD21, ST2, CXCR5, CD24, CD27, TIM-1, IgM, HLA-DR, IgD, and FCRL5. The analysis was performed on both individual and concatenated files using the parameters of 1000 iterations, perplexity of 30, and theta of 0.5.</p>
<p>The selection of the dimensionality reduction technique, UMAP or viSNE, was made based on their ability to retain the relationships between global structures and the distances between cell clusters (where UMAP outperformed viSNE) and their ability to present a distinct and non-overlapping portrayal of cell subpopulations, facilitating the identification of inter-group variations (where viSNE performed better than UMAP).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>We utilized a PAMR association model with a stringent threshold of 1% FDR, as described in the <italic>Data Analysis</italic> section, for the Citrus algorithm experiment. The Student’s two-tailed unpaired t-test was employed to conduct a comparative analysis between the two groups. To determine the significance of serum beta-D-glucan and KL-6 among three groups, a statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests. We evaluated the manually gated cell proportions by performing a two-way ANOVA, along with Tukey’s multiple comparison tests. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9 software. Statistical significance was considered to be achieved when the P-value was less than 0.05.</p>

<title>Patient characteristics and clinical parameters</title>
<p>We analyzed 7 cases of PCP, 9 of DI-ILD, and 9 of ICI-ILD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). One of the PCP cases was fatal. Differential cell counts for BALF revealed lymphocytosis in 7 out of 7 cases (100%) of PCP as well as in 8 out of 9 cases (88.9%) of DI-ILD and 7 out of 9 cases (63.6%) of ICI-ILD when the cut-off for the percentage of lymphocytes was set to &gt;20%. Serum levels of beta-D-glucan were significantly higher in patients with PCP than those with DI-ILD or ICI-ILD (196.5 ± 419.8, 3.7 ± 7.1, 0.6 ± 1.4 pg/mL, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of beta-D-glucan for PCP, with values from the DI-ILD group used as a reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The area under the curve was determined to be 0.8929. When the cut-off value was set to 14.70 pg/mL, the sensitivity and specificity of PCP were 85.71% and 87.50%, and the positive likelihood ratio was 6.86. The diagnostic value of beta-D-glucan was consistent with the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tasaka et al., 2007</xref>), where the positive likelihood ratio was 6.57, with a cut-off value of 31.0. The serum levels of KL-6, an indicator of various types of interstitial pneumonitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ishikawa et al., 2012</xref>), tended to be higher in patients with ICI-ILD than PCP or DI-ILD, though insignificant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Four out of 7 (57.1%) in PCP, 1 out of 9 (11.1%) in DI-ILD, and 6 out of 9 (66.7%) in ICI-ILD were positive for KL-6 with a cut-off value of 500 U/mL.</p>

<title>Expansion of CD16<sup>+</sup>T cells in BALF from patients with PCP</title>
<p>First, we investigated whether subsets of T cells (gated CD2<sup>+</sup> CD3<sup>+</sup>) differentially existed in PCP, DI-ILD, and ICI-ILD. T-cell lymphocytosis was observed in all groups (PCP: 62.9 ± 17.5%, DI-ILD: 58.3 ± 24.5%, ICI-ILD: 50.4 ± 29.9%) with a higher tendency of CD4/CD8 ratio observed in DI-ILD compared to PCP and ICI-ILD (PCP: 1.13 ± 0.86, DI-ILD: 6.08 ± 6.06, ICI-ILD: 1.9 ± 1.40)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) To visualize T cell differentiation within the affected lungs, we generated UMAP plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The majority of T cells in the BALF displayed either memory or effector phenotypes, with a limited population of naïve T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>). Specifically, we observed a tendency of a higher abundance of transient memory/ effector memory CD4 T cells and a lower abundance of transient memory/ effector memory CD45RA (EMRA) CD8 T cells in DI-ILD compared to the other two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>We then utilized the Citrus algorithm to classify T cell subpopulations with varying degrees of abundance in an unsupervised manner by analyzing 31 parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">1D</xref>). Our analysis identified 30 clusters of T cells, of which 13 were significantly differentiated between the groups. Interestingly, clusters #26299, #26293, and #26278, characterized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CD16 (FcγRIIIa), and cluster #26286, characterized by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CD16, were abundant in PCP compared to DI-ILD and ICI-ILD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F</xref>). These CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CD16 were also positive for HLA-DR and CXCR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) but negative for CD14, a marker for monocytes (median CD14 expression of these clusters: 0.0–0.1 vs. 7.4–9.5 in monocyte populations). Cluster #26303, prevalent in ICI-ILD, comprised CD8+ CD57+ TIGIT+ LAG3+ but CD16–subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F</xref>). These cells also expressed PD-1 and TIM-3, although the expression was lower than clusters #26299, #26293, and #26278. These CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed CD45RA but no expression of CD45RO and CCR7, indicating EMRA phenotype. Cluster #26281, prevalent in DI-ILD, was marked by CD4<sup>+</sup> with low immune checkpoint expression (PD-1, TIM-3, TIGIT, LAG3, PD-L1, PD-L2, and OX40; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we investigated myeloid cell populations (identified as CD3<sup>−</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup>). We first conducted UMAP to see the major myeloid cell populations.

<title>B cell subpopulations in the lungs of ILDs</title>
<p>In addition to T cells and myeloid cells, we sought to investigate whether there were differential representations of B cells in BALF from PCP, DI-ILD, and ICI-ILD. By utilizing CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>−</sup>CD64<sup>-</sup> and CD19<sup>+</sup> or CD138<sup>+</sup> as gating parameters, we were able to detect the presence of B cells and plasma cells. The frequency of B cells/ plasma cells was found to be relatively higher in patients with PCP compared to the other two groups, although the proportion of B cells and plasma cells remained low in all groups. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). A t-SNE analysis of 17 parameters among B cells/plasma cells revealed the presence of various B cell subpopulations, including IgD<sup>+</sup> naïve B cells, IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells, IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells, IgA<sup>+</sup> B cells, plasmablasts, and plasma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Although not significant, higher levels of IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells were observed in patients with PCP, while individuals with ICI-ILD exhibited a greater presence of plasma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Previous research has suggested that FCRL5<sup>+</sup> B cells contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Owczarczyk et al., 2020</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dement-Brown et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the frequency of these cells in our study and found that FCRL5<sup>+</sup> B cells were more abundant in patients with ICI-ILD compared to those with PCP and DI-ILD, suggesting these FCRL5<sup>+</sup> B cells may have a role in irAE (8.37 ± 6.74%, 1.37 ± 2.30%, 2.29 ± 3.81%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>Marked CD16+ T cell expansion in BALF from a fatal case of PCP</title>
<p>One case of PCP that developed during the use of immunosuppressive drugs after living donor liver transplantation had a fatal course, despite intensive treatment. Upon admission, chest CT images revealed the emergence of diffuse ground glass opacities and infiltration in the bilateral lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The serum levels of beta-D-glucan and KL-6 were highly elevated (1146 pg/mL and 1561 U/mL, respectively). The T cell percentage was 51.3%, and the CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.58, which was not particularly different from other PCP cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Strikingly, 97.5% of T cells expressed CD16 in the BALF from the fatal case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>). Further, not only the proportion but the CD16 intensity was the highest in the fatal case among PCP cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). On the contrary, there did not appear to be any significant differences in myeloid cell fractions, and CD16 expression was not particularly high in the fatal case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The correlation matrix of clinical parameters and mass cytometry parameters revealed that CD16 intensity in T cells may be correlated with disease severity (<italic>r</italic> = 0.748, p = 0.053) and beta-D-glucan (<italic>r</italic> = 0.868, p = 0.011) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Therefore, CD16 expression in T cells is not only a characteristic of PCP but also a potential indicator of disease severity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have here demonstrated the characteristic immune cell subpopulations present in BALF from patients with PCP, DI-ILD, and ICI-ILD. Our analysis revealed an expansion of CD16<sup>+</sup> T cells in patients with PCP, an increase in CD57<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing immune checkpoints, and FCRL5<sup>+</sup> B cells in ICI-ILD.</p>
<p>CD16 is a low-affinity Fc receptor (FcγRIIIa) for IgG, commonly expressed on NK cells as well as on neutrophils and monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ravetch and Bolland, 2001</xref>), with only a small fraction of T cells expressing CD16 in healthy peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Sandor and Lynch, 1993</xref>). On the contrary, CD16<sup>+</sup> T cells are induced in specific conditions, such as chronic hepatitis C infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Björkström et al., 2008</xref>) and COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Georg et al., 2022</xref>). In chronic hepatitis C infection, CD16<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells displayed a late-stage effector phenotype with high levels of perforin with a restricted TCR profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Björkström et al., 2008</xref>). Stimulation of CD16 on CD8 T cells evokes a vigorous response such as degranulation and cytokine production (IFN-γ and TNF-α) similar to that of CD16 stimulation in NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Björkström et al., 2008</xref>). These CD16+ CD8 T cells also express a senescent marker, CD57, which differs from our findings that expanding CD16<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells in PCP did not express CD57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>Georg <italic>et al.</italic> recently discovered that COVID-19 severity was associated with highly activated CD16<sup>+</sup> T cells, which exhibit increased cytotoxic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Georg et al., 2022</xref>). CD16 expression allows T cells to degranulate and exert cytotoxicity in an immune-complex-mediated, TCR-independent manner. Moreover, CD16<sup>+</sup> T cells from COVID-19 patients caused injury to microvascular endothelial cells and induced the release of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Georg et al., 2022</xref>). Georg <italic>et al.</italic> also discovered that severe COVID-19 induced increased generation of C3a, which further activates CD16<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells. The proportions of activated CD16<sup>+</sup> T cells and plasma levels of complement proteins upstream of C3a were found to be associated with fatal outcomes of COVID-19, proving support for the pathological role of exacerbated cytotoxicity and complement activation in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Georg et al., 2022</xref>). Given these findings and the observation of the highest proportion of CD16+ T cells in the fatal case of PCP, we hypothesize that these CD16+ T cells may possess excessive cytotoxicity toward pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, contributing to lung injury in PCP, in addition to targeting <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii.</italic> Based on the therapeutic efficacy of an anti-complement therapy (anti-C5a antibody) for severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Campbell, 2020</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Vlaar et al., 2020</xref>), anti-complement treatments may have the potential to treat severe PCP.</p>
<p>We discovered an increase of CD57<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing immune checkpoints, PD-1<sup>+</sup> TIGIT<sup>+</sup> LAG3<sup>+</sup> TIM-3<sup>+</sup> in ICI-ILDs, which supports our previous findings of increased proportions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells positive for both PD-1 and TIM-3 or TIGIT in ICI-ILD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Suzuki et al., 2020</xref>). A population of PD-1<sup>+</sup> TIM-3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> cells was detected in the peritumoral pleural effusion and ILD lesions of a cancer patient undergoing ICI treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Yanagihara et al., 2017</xref>). Through the application of next-generation sequencing technology to the DNA encoding the complementarity-determining region of the T-cell receptor (TCR), identical T-cell clones were identified in both peritumoral pleural effusion and ILD lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). Similar to ICI-ILD, a recent study identified T cells specific α-myosin drive ICI-related myocarditis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Axelrod et al., 2022</xref>). These results indicate that ICI-activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, with a phenotype of PD-1<sup>+</sup> TIGIT<sup>+</sup> LAG3<sup>+</sup> TIM-3<sup>+</sup>, could potentially trigger ILD by recognizing self-peptides or shared epitopes between tumors and lungs. CD16<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in PCP exhibit high CXCR3 and ST2 expression, and CD57<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing immune checkpoints in ICI-ILD express high CXCR3 (consistent with the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kim et al., 2021</xref>)). Therefore, these CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells could potentially migrate into the lungs via chemokines, such as CXCL4, CXCL9, CXCL10, and IL-33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Van Raemdonck et al., 2015</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Griesenauer and Paczesny, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding CD57 expression in T cells, it is generally considered a senescent marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fehlings et al., 2022</xref>). However, CD57<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the periphery show clonal expansion with the overlap of the TCR repatoire of tumor-infiltrating T cells with favorable response to ICI in patients with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fehlings et al., 2022</xref>), indicating these CD57<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may have a highly active phenotype in ICI-treated individuals.</p>
<p>FCRL5 is a B cell-restricted member of the Fc receptor-like family encoded by the <italic>IRTA2</italic> gene, which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily receptor translocation-associated 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Rostamzadeh et al., 2018</xref>). In both rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Owczarczyk et al., 2011</xref>) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Owczarczyk et al., 2020</xref>), increased expression of FCRL5 was indicative of a positive response to rituximab. Additionally, our recent research revealed an increased FCLR5+ B cells in connective-tissue disease-related ILD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hata et al., 2023</xref>). These findings suggest a potential pathological role of FCRL5 in autoimmunity. Given that ICI-ILD is considered a type of irAE, it is reasonable to hypothesize that FCRL5+ B cells may be one of the immune cells associated with autoimmunity.</p>
<p>Regarding myeloid cells, we found that CD14<sup>+</sup> CCR2<sup>+</sup> CCR5<sup>+</sup> monocyte subpopulations were prevalent in ICI-ILD. Franken <italic>et al.</italic> revealed a decrease in anti-inflammatory resident alveolar macrophages and an increase in pro-inflammatory ‘M1-like’ monocytes (expressing TNF, IL-1B, IL-6, IL-23A, and GM-CSF receptor CSF2RA, CSF2RB) in BALF from ICI-ILD compared with controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Franken et al., 2022</xref>). Taken together with this report, this CD14<sup>+</sup> CCR2<sup>+</sup> CCR5<sup>+</sup> monocytes we found may be an M1-like monocyte.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations, including the absence of data from healthy individuals, a relatively small sample size, and a retrospective design that resulted in missing clinical data for certain cases. Selection bias may also be a factor, as only patients who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage were eligible for enrollment in this study. It is important to note that these findings demonstrate a correlation rather than proof of causation.</p>
<p>In summary, our study has shown distinct immune cell phenotypes in PCP, DI-ILD, and ICI-ILD. Specifically, we have identified an expansion of CD16<sup>+</sup> T cells in PCP, as well as an increase in CD57<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing immune checkpoints, FCRL5<sup>+</sup> B cells, and CCR2<sup>+</sup> CCR5<sup>+</sup> monocytes in ICI-ILD, which may play a pathogenic role. Based on these findings, further confirmatory research may lead to the development of diagnostic methods and novel strategies that target these specific cell populations to treat chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis.</p>

<p>Cytotoxic agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors are the most commonly used and efficacious treatments for lung cancers. However their use brings two significant pulmonary side-effects; namely Pneumocystis jirovecii infection and resultant pneumonia (PCP), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). To observe the potential immunological drivers of these adverse events, Yanagihara et al. analysed and compared cells present in the bronchoalveolar lavage of three patient groups (PCP, cytotoxic drug-induced ILD [DI-ILD], and ICI-associated ILD [ICI-ILD]) using mass cytometry (64 markers). In PCP, they observed an expansion of the CD16+ T cell population, with the highest CD16+ T proportion (97.5%) in a fatal case, whilst in ICI-ILD, they found an increase in CD57+ CD8+ T cells expressing immune checkpoints (TIGIT+ LAG3+ TIM-3+ PD-1+), FCRL5+ B cells, and CCR2+ CCR5+ CD14+ monocytes. Given the fatal case, the authors also assessed for, and found, a correlation between CD16+ T cells and disease severity in PCP, postulating that this may be owing to endothelial destruction. Although n numbers are relatively small (n=7-9 in each cohort; common numbers for CyTOF papers), the authors use a wide panel (n=65) and two clustering methodologies giving greater strength to the conclusions. The differential populations discovered using one or two of the analytical methods are robust: whole population shifts with clear and significant clustering. These data are an excellent resource for clinical disease specialists and pan-disease immunologists, with a broad and engaging contextual discussion about what they could mean.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
• The differences in immune cells in BAL in these specific patient subgroups is relatively unexplored.</p>
<p>
• This is an observational study, with no starting hypothesis being tested.</p>
<p>
• Two analytical methods are used to cluster the data.</p>
<p>
• A relatively wide panel was used (64 markers), with particular strength in the alpha beta T cells and B cells.</p>
<p>
• Relevant biomarkers, beta-D-glucan and KL-6 were also analysed</p>
<p>
• Appropriate statistics were used throughout.</p>
<p>
• Numbers are low (7 cases of PCP, 9 of DI-ILD, and 9 of ICI-ILD) but these are difficult samples to collect and so in relative terms, and considering the use of CyTOF, these are good numbers.</p>
<p>
• Beta-D-glucan shows potential as a biomarker for PCP (as previously reported) whilst KL-6 shows potential as a biomarker for ICI-ILD (not reported before). Interestingly, KL-6 was not seen to be increased in DI-ILD patients.</p>
<p>
• Despite the relatively low n numbers and lack of matching there are some clear differentials. The CD4/CD8+CD16+HLA-DR+CXCR3+CD14- T cell result is striking - up in PCP (with EM CD4s significantly down) - whilst the CD8 EMRA population is clear in ICI-ILD and 'non-exhausted' CD4s, with lower numbers of EMRA CD8s in DI-ILD.</p>
<p>
• The authors identify 17/31 significantly differentiated clusters of myeloid cells, eg CD11bhi CD11chi CD64+ CD206+ alveolar macrophages with HLA-DRhi in PCP.</p>
<p>
• With respect to B cells, the authors found that FCRL5+ B cells were more abundant in patients with ICI-ILD compared to those with PCP and DI-ILD, suggesting these FCRL5+ B cells may have a role in irAE.</p>
<p>
• One patient's extreme CD16+ T cell (97.5% positive) and death, led the authors to consider CD16+ T cells as an indicator of disease severity in PCP. This was then tested and found to be correct.</p>
<p>
• Authors discuss results in context of literature leading them to suggest that CD16+ T cells may target endothelial cells and wonder if anti-complement therapy may be efficacious in PCP.</p>
<p>
• Great discussion on auto-reactive T cell clones where the authors suggest that in ICI-ILD CD8s may react against healthy lung, driving ILD.</p>
<p>
• An observation of CXCR3 in different CD8 populations in ICI-ILD and PCP lead the authors to hypothesise on the chemoattractants in the microenvironment.</p>
<p>
• Excellent point suggesting CD57 may not always be a marker of senescence on T cells - reflective of growing change within the community.</p>
<p>
• Well considered suggestion that FCRL5+ B cells may be involved in ICI-ILD driven autoimmunity.</p>
<p>
• The authors discuss the main weaknesses in the discussion and stress that the findings detailed in the paper &quot;demonstrate a correlation rather than proof of causation&quot;.</p>
<p>
• Figures and legends are clear and pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
• This is an observational study, with no starting hypothesis being tested.</p>
<p>
• Only patients who were able to have a lavage taken have been recruited.</p>
<p>
• One set of analysis wasn't carried out for one subgroup (ICI-ILD) as PD1 expression was negative owing to the use of nivolumab.</p>
<p>
• Some immune cell subsets wouldn't be picked up with the markers and gating strategies used; e.g. NK cells.</p>
<p>
• Some immune cells would be disproportionately damaged by the storage, thawing and preparation of the samples; e.g. granulocytes.</p>
<p>
• Numbers are low (7 cases of PCP, 9 of DI-ILD, and 9 of ICI-ILD), sex, age and adverse event matching wasn't performed, and treatment regimen are varied and 'suspected' (suggesting incomplete clinical data) - but these are difficult samples to collect. These numbers drop further for some analyses e.g. T cell clustering owing to factors such as low cell number.</p>
<p>
• The disease comparisons are with each other, there is no healthy control.</p>
<p>
• Samples are taken at one time point.</p>
<p>
• The discussion on probably the stand out result - the CD16+ T cells in PCP - relies on two papers - leading to a slightly skewed emphasis on one paper on CD16+ cells in COVID. There are other papers out there that have observed CD16+ T cells in other conditions. It is also worth being in mind that given the markers used, these CD16+ T cell may be gamma deltas.</p>
<p>
• The discussion on ICI patient consistently showing increased PD1, could have been greater, as given the ICI is targeting PD1, one would expect the opposite as commented on, and observed, in the methods section.</p>

<p>Yanagihara and colleagues investigated the immune cell composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples in a cohort of patients with malignancy undergoing chemotherapy and with with lung adverse reactions including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) or cytotoxic drug induced interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Using mass cytometry, their aim was to characterize the cellular and molecular changes in BAL to improve our understanding of their pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this regard, the authors identify a correlation between CD16 expression in T cells and the severity of PCP and an increased infiltration of CD57+ CD8+ T cells expressing immune checkpoints and FCLR5+ B cells in ICI-ILD patients.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects of the data analysis need to be clarified and extended.</p>
<p>1. The authors should elaborate on why different set of markers were selected for each analysis step. E.g., Different set of markers were used for UMAP, CITRUS and viSNE in the T cell and myeloid analysis.</p>
<p>2. The authors should state if a normality test for the distribution of the data was performed. If not, non-parametric tests should be used.</p>
<p>3. The authors should explore the correlation between CD16 intensity and the CTCAE grade in T cell subsets such as EMRA CD8 T cells, effector memory CD4, etc as identified in Figure 1B.</p>
<p>4. The authors could use CITRUS to better assess the B cell compartment.</p>

<p>The authors collected BALF samples from lung cancer patients newly diagnosed with PCP, DI-ILD or ICI-ILD. CyTOF was performed on these samples, using two different panels (T-cell and B-cell/myeloid cell panels). Results were collected, cleaned-up, manually gated and pre-processed prior to visualisation with manifold learning approaches t-SNE (in the form of viSNE) or UMAP, and analysed by CITRUS (hierarchical clustering followed by feature selection and regression) for population identification - all using Cytobank implementation - in an attempt to identify possible biomarkers for these disease states. By comparing cell abundances from CITRUS results and qualitative inspection of a small number of marker expressions, the authors claimed to have identified an expansion of CD16+ T-cell population in PCP cases and an increase in CD57+ CD8+ T-cells, FCRL5+ B-cells and CCR2+ CCR5+ CD14+ monocytes in ICI-ILD cases.</p>
<p>By the authors' own admission, there is an absence of healthy donor samples and, perhaps as a result of retrospective experimental design, also an absence of pre-treatment samples. The entire analysis effectively compares three yet-established disease states with no common baseline - what really constitutes a &quot;biomarker&quot; in such cases? The introduction asserts that &quot;y characterizing the cellular and molecular changes in BAL from patients with these complications, we aim to improve our understanding of their pathogenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets&quot; (lines 82-84). Given these obvious omissions, no real &quot;changes&quot; have been studied in the paper. These are very limited comparisons among three, and only these three, states.</p>
<p>Even assuming more thorough experimental design, the data analysis is unfortunately too shallow and has not managed to explore the wealth of information that could potentially be extracted from the results. CITRUS is accessible and convenient, but also make a couple of big assumptions which could affect data analysis - 1) Is it justified to concatenate all FCS files to analyse the data in one batch / small batches? Could there be batch effects or otherwise other biological events that could confuse the algorithm? 2) With a relatively small number of samples, and after internal feature selection of CITRUS, is the regression model suitable for population identification or would it be too crude and miss out rare populations? There are plenty of other established methods that could be used instead. Have those methods been considered?</p>
<p>Colouring t-SNE or UMAP (e.g. Figure 6C) plots by marker expression is useful for quick identification of cell populations but it is not a quantitative analysis. In a CyTOF analysis like this, it is common to work out fold changes of marker expressions between conditions. It is inadequate to judge expression levels and infer differences simply by looking at colours.</p>
<p>The relatively small number of samples also mean that most results presented in the paper are not statistical significant. Whilst it is understandable that it is not always possible to collect a large number of patient samples for studies like this, having several entire major figures showing &quot;n.s.&quot; (e.g. Figures 3A, 4B and 5C), together with limitations in the comparisons themselves and inadequate analysis, make the observations difficult to be convincing, and even less so for the single fatal PCP case where N = 1.</p>
<p>It would also be good scientific practice to show evidence of sample data quality control. Were individual FCS files examined? Did the staining work? Some indication of QC would also be great.</p>
<p>This dataset generated and studied by the authors have the potential to address the question they set out to answer and thus potentially be useful for the field. However, in the current state of presentation, more evidence and more thorough data analysis are needed to draw any conclusions, or correlations, as the authors would like to frame them.</p>
