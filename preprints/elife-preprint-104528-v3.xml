<abstract>
<p>Asymmetric partition of fate determinants during cell division is a hallmark of cell differentiation. Recent work suggested that such a mechanism is hijacked by cancer cells to increase both their phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity and, in turn, their fitness. To quantify fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular elements, imaging-based approaches are used, whose accuracy is limited by the difficulty of detecting cell divisions. Our work addresses this gap, proposing a general method based on high-throughput flow cytometry measurements coupled with a theoretical framework. We applied our method to a panel of both normal and cancerous human colon cells, showing that different kinds of colon adenocarcinoma cells display very distinct extents of fluctuations in their cytoplasm partition, explained by an asymmetric division of their size. To test the accuracy of our population-level protocol, we directly measure the inherited fractions of cellular elements from extensive time-lapses of live-cell laser scanning microscopy, finding excellent agreement across the cell types. Ultimately, our flow cytometry-based method promises to be accurate and easily applicable to a wide range of biological systems where the quantification of partition fluctuations would help account for the observed phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Asymmetric cell division refers to the mechanism by which a mother cell splits into two daughter cells with distinct cellular fates. As first shown by Edwin Conklin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], this process is usually achieved by asymmetric inheritance of intrinsic determinants of cell fate, such as specific proteins or RNA, and plays a crucial role during the development of organisms, favoring cell differentiation and self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Increasing evidence is vouching for a more ubiquitous presence of fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular elements. In fact, asymmetric segregation has been observed in non-differentiating cell populations as different as bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], and tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. In bacterial populations, differential segregation of cellular components has been linked to antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Similarly, Katajisto <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], studying mitochondrial partition in stem-like mammalian epithelial cells, found that asymmetric segregation of older mitochondria enables cells to protect themselves from aging by preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins. In addition, asymmetric centrosome partition has been observed in stem cells from human neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer, controlled by polarity factors and influenced by the segregation of subcellular vesicles during cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. To quantify the strength of fluctuations at division, the common route goes through fluorescence microscopy measurements of either fixed or live cells, where fluorescent dyes are used as a proxy for the cellular element of interest. The partition statistics are then estimated by looking at the fraction of fluorescence intensity inherited by the two daughter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. This approach is, in principle, very informative and a lot of work has been done in recent years to write theoretical models of stochastic gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] that can account for the coupling of noise sources and can even be extended to time-lapse microscopy data of single cell’s growing dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]; however, relying on microscopy data implies the need of the (often manual) identification of hundreds of division events and in some cases even complex experimental set-ups and techniques where cells (usually bacteria) have to be followed for a great number of generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. These are highly time-consuming procedures that dampen the possibility of a wide characterization of the partition statistics of different cell types.</p>
<p>To cope with these limitations, we propose using high-throughput flow cytometry measurements to quantify fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular components in adherent cells. In particular, flow cytometry has already been applied to study asymmetric division in specific cellular systems: Yang <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], sorted budding yeast cells to analyze the differential segregation of proteins between daughters cells, while Peruzzi and coworkers first applied multi-color flow cytometry to show that leukemia cells divide mitochondria and membrane proteins asymmetrically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Here, we generalized the protocol to adherent cell types and probed its accuracy by comparing the measured fluctuations to those observed with extensive time-lapse microscopy experiments on a panel of normal and cancerous epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Our work shows that (i) there is an exact analytical expression linking the inherited cellular component distribution dynamic to the specifics of the partition process. Based on this result, we (ii) proposed an experimental protocol to tag with fluorescent dyes cellular components and measure the dynamics of fluorescent distribution, whose analysis allows accurate estimates of the degree of asymmetry in the partition process. Applying our method to a panel of normal and cancerous human colon cells, we found that (iii) different lines of colon adenocarcinoma display very distinct extents of fluctuations in cytoplasm partition, reflecting in (iv) different degrees of asymmetric division of their size.</p>

<title>A. Modeling cell population dynamics in the presence of partitioning noise</title>
<p>In this section, we propose a theoretical framework that is able to describe the evolution of the fluorescence intensity of a cell population stained with a live fluorescent marker, by uncovering its dependence on the underlying partitioning process to which single cells are subjected. The rationale is that, if cells follow a common division rule, knowing the shape of the mother distribution, it should be able to determine the daughters’ one. By iterating this computation, one can trace the whole proliferation. The specificity of our approach lies in its specific design for live fluorescent markers. The selected component is tagged through a staining procedure with fluorophores that persist in the cell and its daughter cells, as long as the targeted protein is not degraded.</p>
<p>Monitoring the time evolution of the abundance of specific cellular elements over multiple divisions in singlecell experiments, it is observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] that the counts of a component have a qualitatively similar dynamic to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>. Indeed, variations in the number of components are determined by: (i) the production and degradation processes along the duration of the cell growth phase; and (ii) non-identical apportioning of the components between the two daughter cells. Here, we will assume that the number of components varies only due to partition events and look for a quantitative description of the evolution of the element distribution. By neglecting variability in division times and the intercurrent production and degradation of components, we are reducing the dynamics to a progressive dilution. The stability of our model with respect to these assumptions will be studied in the following section and more in detail in the Supplementary Information. Note that it is possible to model the complete growth and division process (see, for instance, refs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]), but it is more difficult to separate the different sources of noise. Here, we start by considering a population of cells characterized by a certain initial distribution, <italic>P(m)</italic><sub>0</sub>, of element m. Each cell <italic>i</italic> of the population divides into two daughter cells that we can label unambiguously as 2<italic>i</italic> and 2<italic>i</italic> + 1, which inherit respectively <italic>m</italic><sub>2<italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>m</italic><sub>2<italic>i</italic>+1</sub> components. The process, exactly at division, must conserve the total number of elements, i.e. <italic>m<sub>i</sub></italic> = <italic>m<sub>2i</sub></italic> + <italic>m</italic><sub>2<italic>i</italic>+1</sub>, and we call the partitioning fraction the quantity <inline-formula id="ID1">

<p>where <italic>μ</italic><sub>0</sub> is the mean of the initial population. It is relevant to notice that independently of the characteristic of ∏(<italic>f</italic>), the mean always halves at each generation. This result is simply understood considering that for each cell that inherits a fraction <italic>f</italic><sup>′</sup> of the compound, its sibling inherits a fraction 1 − <italic>f</italic><sup>′</sup>. Hence, at every division, the compound count is diluted by an average factor of 2 in the population, and partition distributions with different properties lead to the same behavior of <italic>μ<sub>g</sub></italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(f)</xref>). Therefore, no relevant insights on the ∏(<italic>f</italic>) can be obtained from the first moment. We thus moved to consider the second moment, i.e., the variance. Similarly to what is done for the mean, the variance of the inherited fraction of elements can be expressed as:

<p>Finally, with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD10">Equation 10</xref>, we can link the variance of the components distribution for the entire cell population at generation g, to the properties of ∏(<italic>f</italic>). It is interesting to highlight that there is no dependence on the bias asymmetry of the process. The distribution ∏(<italic>f</italic>) is necessarily symmetric, as daughter cells are indistinguishable. Therefore, by bias we refer to a situation where the most probable outcome of the division process is asymmetric. To this order, the only relevant feature shaping the dynamics is the extent of the fluctuations, regardless of their origin. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(e)</xref>, the same ∏(<italic>f</italic>), but with a different variance, shows a different behavior for <inline-formula id="ID8">

<p>As shown by Peruzzi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] for leukemia cells growing in suspension, it is possible to use flow cytometry to follow the evolution of properly marked cellular elements in time. Here, we generalized the protocol considering a panel of colon cell lines, i.e. Caco2, a human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line; HCT116, a human colorectal carcinoma cell line; and CCD-18Co, a normal human colon fibroblast cell line. To measure the degree of asymmetric division, we marked cells’ cytoplasm via a fluorescent dye and followed its dilution through successive generations. As explained in detail in the Materials and Methods section, the experimental procedure we used is based on the following main steps: staining of the selected compound, sorting of the initial population, plating, and acquisition of the distinct populations in the following days. The sorting allows us to obtain an initial population with a narrow peak at a specific fluorescence intensity, and it plays a dual role (a extended discussion can be found in the Supplementary Information): it indirectly induces cell synchronization and enables a clearer reconstruction of the coexisting generations.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate a specific cell population based on cell morphology and fluorescence intensity. The sorted population is divided into distinct wells, one per acquisition, in equal numbers and kept under identical growth conditions to mitigate inoculum-dependent variability among samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref> shows an example of the time course dynamics obtained with HCT116 cells (see Methods for details). Each distribution represents a different acquisition of a whole well at increasing times from plating (0 to 84 hours from the bottom to the top). It is possible to neatly observe the succession of peaks associated with different generations that succeed one another and the average decrease of the fluorescence intensity. Note that different generations can coexist at the same time point. One can spot the flow of cells towards higher generations and the behavior of the peak heights, which grow over time, reach dominance, and then decay. The shift on the y-axis allows us to follow the evolutionary dynamics while being able to see the overlapping of the same generation at different time points. As in each measurement, the distribution of fluorescent intensity, <italic>I</italic>, is a mixture of distributions corresponding to different generations:

</inline-formula>). In particular, Caco2 and CCD18Co cells show a higher level of asymmetry with respect to HCT116. As already stated in the description of the theoretical model, we consider only partitioning noise and neglect other potential sources: (i) production and degradation processes, and (ii) variability in cell cycle length. Since we use non-endogenous live fluorescent dyes, production processes are excluded by definition, while degradation results in a negligible time-dependent decrease in mean fluorescence intensity as the used dyes are optimized to maintain stable fluorescence levels for the duration of the experiment. Indeed, by looking at the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 (c)</xref>, the values of the measured <italic>μ<sub>g</sub></italic> seem to only fluctuate around the theoretical line, but with the same slope, indicating that degradation can be neglected without ma jor consequences. The effects of correlations between the inherited fractions of cellular components and the fluctuations in the duration of the cell cycle are, in principle, more difficult to disentangle. In this respect, it is widely known that cells adjust their growth/division strategy to mitigate size fluctuations at division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. According to the ‘sizer’ model, they divide upon reaching a certain size so that smaller cells, i.e., those that inherit a smaller fraction of their mother’s volume, will have longer division times and vice versa. This results in fluctuations in the cell division times that may be coupled with partitioning noise.</p>
<p>To assess the robustness of our model under such conditions, we performed simulations assuming that cells follow a sizer-like division strategy, while the marked component partition perfectly matches the cell size partition (see Supplementary Information for more details). This scenario maximizes the coupling between the two noise sources. As can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(g)</xref>, the behaviors of the mean value <italic>μ<sub>g</sub></italic> and the variance <italic>σ<sub>g</sub></italic> deviate from the case in which division time is uncoupled with partition noise. However, the values obtained are still within the estimated experimental error (see Supplementary Figure 3). It is worth noticing that the presence/absence of the increase in the mean, <italic>μ<sub>g</sub></italic>, for newer generations may highlight the presence of the coupling between the two noise sources.</p>

<title>C. Validation of the method via live fluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>The flow cytometry-based protocol combined with the developed theoretical model provides insights into the properties of the cell partition function (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To validate our approach, we performed extensive live time-lapse microscopy experiments to measure the partition fraction of a labelled compound during proliferation, providing a direct measure of the ∏(<italic>f</italic>). Specifically, we aimed to follow a growing cell colony over time, detect divisions, evaluate the fluorescence intensity of mother and daughter cells, and calculate the inherited fraction. The detailed experimental procedure is described in the Materials and Methods. Briefly, cells are stained for the cytoplasm and are plated at low density (approximately 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well) on IBIDI cell imaging chambers (<italic>μ</italic>-Slide 4 and 8 wells). After 24 hours (sufficient time for complete cell adhesion to the slide), the wells are washed, the media is renewed, and live imaging acquisition time-lapse is started. Multiple fields are followed in each well, and for each field, we acquire a z-stack bright-field and fluorescence image (a single plane is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) at constant intervals (20 min) for 3 days. The fields are manually selected at the beginning of the acquisition based on cell density and fluorescence intensity. The recorded time lapses have been manually analyzed to identify divisions. A sample outcome of the analysis procedure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>. The total fluorescence of the cells is displayed as a function of time, before and after the division. The mother cell fluorescence decays exponentially over time, and at division, it halves due to components partitioning between the two daughters. In this specific case, we can observe that the fraction of cytoplasm inherited by the two cells is not equal, indicating an asymmetrical division. To compute the partition fraction <italic>f</italic>, we fit the fluorescence intensity of the daughters’ cells vs time with <italic>log</italic> (<italic>I</italic><sub>2<italic>i</italic></sub> (<italic>t</italic>)) = <italic>mt</italic> + <italic>q</italic><sub>2<italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>log</italic>(<italic>I</italic><sub>21+1</sub> (<italic>t</italic>)) = <italic>mt</italic> + <italic>q</italic><sub>21+1</sub>, where <italic>I(t)</italic> is the fluorescence intensity at time <italic>t</italic>, <italic>m</italic> accounts for the decaying process and 2<italic>i</italic> and 2<italic>i</italic> + 1 respectively refer to the two daughter cells. We constrain the slope to be the same between the two cells. The fraction of inherited fluorescence, <italic>f</italic>, is obtained as :

<p>To ensure the highest possible accuracy, we (i) measured the total fluorescence of the mother cell and those of the two daughter cells for at least 2 hours before and after the division event to increase the determination of the fluorescence splitting for each detected mitosis. Moreover, (ii) we removed all dynamics that showed an absolute Pearson correlation value between luminosity and pixel size higher than 0.9 as a function of time (see Supplementary Information). In fact, single cell’s pixel size, which corresponds to the cell size projection on the focal plane, is found to shrink before mitosis and to enlarge after division. Fluorescent intensity is instead proportional to the number of stained cytoplasmic proteins, which are expected to remain constant (except for a constant decay of the fluorescence). Therefore, a high correlation between pixel size and fluorescence intensity indicates a high noise-to-signal ratio. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)(bottom)</xref> displays the strip plot of the obtained partition fraction, <italic>f</italic>, for Caco2, HCT116, and CCD18Co cells, randomly spread on the y-axis, and their corresponding fitted ∏(<italic>f</italic>) distributions (top).

<title>D. Size division bias accounts for cytoplasmic fluctuations</title>
<p>In the above sections, we have proposed and validated a method to evaluate fluctuations in the division of adherent cells. The model makes no assumptions about the shape of the partitioning distribution and, in its general form, accounts only for the effect of its variance in shaping the population dynamics. Indeed, we cannot yet distinguish between divisions which are biased, defined by a partitioning distribution with peak values different from 1/2 (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(C)</xref> for CaCO2 and CCD18Co cells) or symmetric ones (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)</xref> for HCT-116 cells) which though have higher fluctuations. Also, apart from measuring it, we want to propose a qualitative interpretation of the obtained level of asymmetry. We start by recalling that our experimental protocol uses dyes that bind a-specifically to cytoplasmic amines. Thus, (i) it is expected to be uniformly distributed in the cellular cytoplasmic space and (ii) the number of labeled cytoplasmic components can be considered large. With this hypothesis, the least complex model one can assume is a binomial one with parameter <italic>p</italic>, measuring the bias in the process. Via <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD10">equation 10</xref>, we got a direct link between the measurable variance of the population and the second moment of the underlying partition probability distribution, ∏(<italic>f</italic>). Henceforth, we sought for a relationship between the second moment of ∏(<italic>f</italic>) and the parameters of the binomial distribution. To begin with, we can write the partition distribution for the fraction of inherited component, assuming a level of asymmetry <italic>p</italic> (<italic>q</italic> = 1 − p), as:

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref>, we validated the analytical expression against the values obtained via microscopy measurements, showing again good compatibility of the results. CaCO2 cells confirm to be the most asymmetric among the cell lines, and since they are known for their heterogeneity in cell morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], we explored the hypothesis that shape heterogeneity and cytoplasmic asymmetry are linked. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(d)</xref> displays three sample cases of division examined through time-lapse fluorescent microscopy following cytoplasm. Different time frames are overlaid to depict the entire dynamic at once, with time progressing from the bottom left to the top right of each image.</p>
<p>We computed the pixel size ratio between the daughter cells in the last analyzed frame and compared it to the fraction of cytoplasm inherited from the mother cell. Although pixel size is only a rough proxy for cell volume, we observe that the cell inheriting a larger fraction of cytoplasm also appears larger in size. This finding suggests that asymmetry in cytoplasmic partitioning is linked to size fluctuations at birth, where cell size reflects the bias observed in the segregation process.</p>

<p>Cell division is orchestrated by hundreds of molecular interactions, which are intrinsically stochastic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. The presence of such stochasticity results in the in-surgence of variability among the cell phenotypes sharing the same genome, as is the case for cancer cells. In this respect, gene expression noise has been extensively characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], incorporating cell cycle effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], as well as the different strategies that cells evolved to regulate the extent of the noise in these channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Besides such noise sources, proliferating cells are subject to the fluctuations originating from the partition of cellular elements at division. Analysis of this partition noise highlighted that under some circumstances, its contribution exceeds the others in creating heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. In fact, asymmetrically dividing cells can produce daughters that differ in size, cellular components, and, in turn, fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>
<p>In this framework, the origin of such asymmetry may be ascribed to the basal stochasticity of molecular processes taking place at different levels during the division and/or to specific, evolutionarily conserved mechanisms used by cells to control cell fate and generate diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. In fact, asymmetric partitioning of components alters the initial counts of molecules in the following cell cycle, which can lead the system to a different phenotypic state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Here, we show that an accurate determination of partition fluctuations can be obtained via standard flow cytometry measurements of properly marked cell populations. Our approach is easier and faster with respect to the use of microscopy imaging, which requires the acquisition and analysis of extensive recordings of the cells, ultimately limiting the reachable statistics. In addition, it is specifically designed to isolate partitioning noise from other sources via the usage of non-endogenous dyes to target cell components.</p>
<p>Although the need to use live fluorescent dyes to track proliferation surely limits the extent of applicability of our method to markable components, we anticipate that there are numerous contexts in which our approach could give a determining insight. For instance, organelles such as mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and centrosomes can be easily marked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] and their unequal distribution between daughter cells has been observed to provoke functional differences that influence their fate. In this respect, asymmetric division of mitochondria in stem cells is associated with the retention of stemness traits in one daughter cell and differentiation in the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and, although the functional consequences are not yet fully determined, with therapeutic resistance in Cancer Stem Cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Asymmetric inheritance of lysosomes, together with mitochondria, appears to play a crucial role in determining the fate of human blood stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, our approach could be extended to investigate cell growth dynamics and the origins of cell size homeostasis in adherent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we measured the segregation statistics of the cytoplasm of different colon cell types, finding that they are neatly distinct. CaCo2 cells exhibit the highest degree of cytoplasmic partition fluctuations, while HCT116 division is the one with the lowest asymmetry. It is interesting to note that normal colon fibroblasts sit in between, suggesting that the cancer-associated deregulation of the normal cell activities leads to the reactivation of asymmetric cell division in a cancer-specific manner. Indeed, CaCo2 cells are known to display a markedly heterogeneous distribution of phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Notably, comparing the degree of asymmetry in the division of the cytoplasm in the three different analysed cell types, we found that microscopy-derived fluctuations are systematically higher than those measured by flow cytometry. While this could be linked to the different protocols used, it seems more probable that the difference is due to a systematic overestimation of the fluctuations measured by microscopy. Indeed, we identified at least two possible origins of such bias: fluctuations in the fluorescence intensity measures and errors in the segmentation protocol. Regarding the first one, we demonstrated its effect through simple simulations that mimicked the microscopy analysis. While for the second, relying on manual segmentation not only reduces the data but might also introduce biased cell identification errors. Both these effects become important when data filtering is only partially allowed due to the low available statistics. A discussion on this topic is proposed in the Supplementary Information.</p>
<p>We have assessed the stability of our model with respect to perturbations arising from the co-occurrence of multiple noise sources. In particular, we explored the case where fluctuations at division and variability in cell cycle length are dependent. In particular, we investigated a strongly coupled scenario in which division is triggered upon reaching a specific size (sizer strategy) and partitioning fluctuations correspond to size inheritance. We observed that -even under this extreme condition- our approach yields reliable parameter estimates that remain consistent with the experimental error. Moreover, we observed coupling-dependent increase in <italic>μ<sub>g</sub></italic> for newer generations. This observation opens new questions and potential applications for our method.</p>
<p>Finally, to get insights into the possible mechanisms behind the observed asymmetries, we looked for a specific shape of the partition distribution. Following a maximum entropy approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], we started by considering the distribution that employs the fewest assumptions about the system, <italic>i.e.</italic>, we consider independent segregation, which directly maps into binomial partitioning. Indeed, this is a common assumption in segregation models that traces back to the pioneering works of Berk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] and Rigney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Notably, our results indicated biased segregations with colon cancer cells displaying different levels of biases. To explain their origin, we looked at the relative sizes of the daughter cells right after division. The found correlation between daughter sizes and the fractions of inherited fluorescence vouches size as the origin of the observed biased segregation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, by combining experimental data with statistical modeling, we show how it is possible to use flow cytometry data to extract reliable estimates of the strength of fluctuations during cell division. Our approach has the potential to be applied to different cell types, where a quantification of the level of division asymmetries that daughter cells can experience may provide new insights into the mechanisms of asymmetric cell division and its role in cancer heterogeneity and plasticity.</p>

<title>A. Cell Culture</title>
<p>Caco-2, colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA, HBT-37) and maintained in complete culture media DMEM (D6046) containing 20% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin plus glutamine, nonessential amino acids (NEAA), and sodium pyruvate, all 1/100 dilution. HCT116 VIM RFP, colorectal carcinoma cell line, was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA, CCL-247EMT) and maintained in complete culture media McCoy’s 5A (M9309) containing 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, plus glutamin.</p>
<p>CCD-18Co, colon fibroblast cell line, was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA, CRL-1459) and maintained in complete culture media DMEM containing 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin plus glutamin, nonessential amino acids (NEAA), and sodium pyruvate, all 1/100 dilution.</p>
<p>All cells were kept in culture at 37° C in 5% CO2 and passaged according to the experimental protocol. For all experiments, cells were harvested, counted, and washed twice in serum-free solutions and resuspended in room temperature (RT) PBS w/o salts for further staining.</p>
<p>In detail, to detach cells from culture flasks, we used Trypsin EDTA 0.25%. Culture media was removed and the flasks were washed once with PBS, then Trypsin EDTA was added and allowed to work for 1 min in an incubator at 37° C. Once the cells appeared detached, the flasks were mechanically agitated to facilitate the cells’ loss of adhesion. Trypsin was then inactivated with one volume of complete media, and cells were collected, pelleted, and washed a second time in PBS. To determine cell viability, prior to dye staining, the collected cells were counted with the hemocytometer using Trypan Blue, an impermeable dye not taken up by viable cells.</p>

<title>B. Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting</title>
<p>To track cell proliferation by dye dilution for establishing the progeny of a mother cell, cells were stained with CellTrace Violet<sup>TM</sup> (CTV). The CTV dye staining (C34557, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), used to monitor multiple cell generations, was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, diluting the CTV 1/1000 in 0.5-1 ml of PBS for 20 min in a water bath at 37°C, mixing every 10 min. Afterward, 5x complete media was added to the cell suspension for an additional 5 min incubation before the final washing in PBS.</p>
<p>Labeled cells were sorted using a FACSAriaIII (Becton Dickinson, BD Biosciences, USA) equipped with Near UV 375nm, 488nm, 561nm, and 633nm lasers and FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences version 6.1.3). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, version 10.7.1). Briefly, cells were first gated on single cells, by doublet exclusion with morphology parameters area versus width (A versus W), both side and forward scatter. The unstained sample was used to set the background fluorescence. The sorting gate was set around the maximum peak of fluorescence of the dye distribution. In this way, the collected cells were enriched for the highest fluorescence intensity. Following isolation, an aliquot of the sorted cells was analyzed with the same instrument to determine the post-sorting purity and population width, resulting in an enrichment of &lt; 97 % for each sample.</p>
<p>To monitor multiple cell divisions, the sorted cell population was seeded in 12-well plates (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA) at a cell density between [30–70]. 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well, according to the experiment, and kept in culture for up to 84 h. Each well corresponds to a time point of the acquisition, and cells in culture were analyzed every 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84 h by the LSRFortessa flow cytometer. In order to set the time zero of the kinetic, prior to culturing, a tiny aliquot of the collected cells was analyzed immediately after sorting at the flow cytometer. The unstained sample was used to set the background fluorescence as described above.</p>

<title>C. Time-lapse Microscopy</title>
<p>To better investigate the cell proliferation dynamics, we performed time-lapse experiments for up to 3 days. In our previous paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], we verified that cell growth is not affected by different dye combinations. Therefore, in the present work, we used both CellTrace Yellow<sup>TM</sup> (C34573 A, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and CellTrace Far Red<sup>TM</sup> (C34572, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) to stain the cytoplasm for microscopy analysis.</p>
<p>Low passage cells at around 60 % confluency were counted and stained with CellTrace dyes 1/500 and plated on IBIDI cell imaging chambers (<italic>μ</italic>-Slide 4 and 8 wells) at a low cell density of 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well. After overnight incubation, the chamber is transferred to the inverted microscope adapted with an incubator to keep cells in appropriate growing conditions. Brightfield and fluorescent confocal image stacks were acquired with a 20x air objective (Olympus, Shinjuku, Japan) and Zen Microscopy Software (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), every 20 min.</p>
<p>Time-lapse images were analyzed using ImageJ and inhouse Python programs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to develop a simple method to quantify fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular elements. In particular, they propose a flow-cytometry based method coupled with a simple mathematical theory as an alternative to conventional imaging-based approaches.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The approach they develop is simple to understand, and its use with flow-cytometry measurements is clearly explained. Understanding how the fluctuations in the cytoplasm partition varies for different kinds of cells is particularly interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The theory only considers fluctuations due to cellular division events. Fluctuations in cellular components are largely affected by various intrinsic and extrinsic sources of noise and only under particular conditions does partitioning noise become the dominant source of noise. In the revised version of the manuscript, they argue that in their setup, noise due to production and degradation processes are negligible but noise due to extrinsic sources such as those stemming from cell-cycle length variability may still be important. To investigate the robustness of their modelling approach to such noise, they simulated cells following a sizer-like division strategy, a scenario that maximizes the coupling between fluctuations in cell-division time and partitioning noise. They find that estimates remain within the pre-established experimental error margin.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to develop a simple method to quantify fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular elements. In particular, they propose a flow-cytometry based method coupled with a simple mathematical theory as an alternative to conventional imaging-based approaches.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The approach they develop is simple to understand and its use with flow-cytometry measurements is clearly explained. Understanding how the fluctuations in the cytoplasm partition varies for different kinds of cells is particularly interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The theory only considers fluctuations due to cellular division events. Fluctuations in cellular components are largely affected by various intrinsic and extrinsic sources of noise and only under particular conditions does partitioning noise become the dominant source of noise. In the revised version of the manuscript, they argue that in their setup, noise due to production and degradation processes are negligible but noise due to extrinsic sources such as those stemming from cell-cycle length variability may still be important. To investigate the robustness of their modelling approach to such noise, they simulated cells following a sizer-like division strategy, a scenario that maximizes the coupling between fluctuations in cell-division time and partitioning noise. They find that estimates remain within the pre-established experimental error margin.</p>

<list-item><p>Maybe I don't fully understand the reasoning provided by the authors, but it is still not entirely clear to me why microscopy-based estimates are expected to be larger. Fewer samples will increase the estimation uncertainty, but this can go either way in terms of the inferred variability.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for giving us the opportunity to clarify this point. In the previous answer, we focused on the role of the gating strategy, highlighting how the limited statistics available with microscopy reduce the chances of a stronger selection of the events. The explanation for why the noise is biased toward increasing the estimation of division asymmetry relies on multiple aspects: First, due to the multiple sources of noise affecting fluorescence intensity, the experimental procedure, and the segmentation protocol, the measurements of the fluorescence intensity of single cells fluctuate. This variability adds to the inherent stochasticity of the partitioning process, thereby increasing the overall variance of the distribution.</p>
<p>To illustrate this effect, we simulated the microscopy data. We extracted a fraction f from a Gaussian distribution with mean µ = 𝑝 and standard deviation σ = σ<sub>𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒</sub> , i.e. 𝑁(𝑝, σ<sub>𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒</sub>). We then simulated different time frames by adding noise drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean µ = 0 and standard deviation σ = σ<sub>𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒</sub> , i.e., 𝑁(0, σ<sub>𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒</sub>), to f. An equal process was applied to 1 − f. The added noise was resampled so that the two measurements remained independent. Figure 6 shows a sample dynamic where the empty gray circles represent the true fractions. We then fitted the two dynamics to a linear equation with a common slope and obtained an estimate of the partitioning noise.</p>
<p>By repeating this process a number of times consistent with the experiment, we measured the resulting standard deviation of the new partitioning distribution. Figure 7 shows the distribution of the measured standard deviation over multiple repetitions of the simulations. Each histogram is the variance of the partitioning distribution obtained from 100 simulations of the noisy (and non noisy) fluorescence dynamic. By comparing this with the distribution of the standard deviation of the non-noisy dynamics, it is possible to observe that, on average, the added noise leads to a greater estimated variance. The magnitude of this increase depends on the variance of the added noise, but it is always biased toward larger values.</p>
<p>This represents only one component of the effect. The shown distributions and simulations are intended solely to demonstrate the direction of the bias, and not to account for the exact difference between the flow cytometry and microscopy estimates. In the proposed case, where noise and true variance are equal, the resulting difference in division asymmetry is 1.3.</p>
<p>A second contribution arises from the segmentation protocol. As we stated, a major limitation of the microscopy-based approach is the need for manual image segmentation. This reduces the amount of available data and introduces potential errors. Even though different checks were applied, some situations are difficult to avoid. For example, when daughter cells are very close to each other, the borders may not be precisely recognized; cells may overlap; or speckles may remain undetected. In all these cases, it is easier to overestimate the fluorescence than to underestimate it, thereby increasing the chance of an extremal event.</p>
<p>Indeed, segmentation relies on both brightfield and fluorescence images. Errors in defining the cell outline are more likely when fluorescence is low, since borders, overlaps, and speckles are more evident against a darker background. This introduces an additional bias toward higher asymmetry, increasing the number of events in the tail of the partitioning distribution.</p>
<p>Both aspects described above could be mitigated by increasing the available statistics. In particular, by applying stricter selection criteria, such as imposing limits on fluorescence intensity fluctuations, the distribution should approach the expected one.</p>
<p>A similar issue does not arise in flow cytometry experiments. From the initial sorting procedure, which ensures a cleaner separation of peaks, to the morphological checks performed at each acquisition point, the availability of a large number of measured events reduces both measurement noise and segmentation errors.</p>
<p>A discussion on these aspects has been added in the revised version of the Supplementary Materials and in the Main Text.</p>
