<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent advances in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) technology have enabled the structural characterization of biomolecules isolated from their native conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>However, the necessity for high sample concentration restricts its applicability to abundant targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The vitrification step of cryo-EM is a major contributor to this bottleneck. In a conventional plunge vitrification method, 3 µL of aqueous samples greater than 1 mg/mL are typically required to acquire sufficient numbers of particle images on cryo-EM micrographs for 3D structure reconstruction (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. This is because most of the target complexes in the sample solution applied on a cryo-EM grid must be removed by a blotting paper to make a thin ice layer suitable for analysis. Several methods are currently available to lower sample volume/concentration needed (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Jet vitrification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and Spotiton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> require sub-nanoliters of the sample volume, but they still require high-concentration samples. Affinity grids, such as Ni-NTA lipid monolayer grids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, chemically functionalized grids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, antibody-attached grids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and streptavidin monolayer grids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, are amenable for lower concentration samples (∼0.05 mg/mL), but concentrating natively isolated targets to such a level and reproducibly generating the affinity grids remains challenging.</p>
<p>Structural characterization of native chromatin-associated protein complexes is particularly challenging due to their heterogeneity and scarcity: more than 300 proteins directly bind to the histone core surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, while each of these proteins is targeted to only a fraction of nucleosomes in chromatin. For their structural analysis, it is a common practice to assemble nucleoprotein complexes using purified recombinant proteins and a specific short (10 – 1000 bp) linear DNA. However, this reconstitution approach has a limitation since the structure and function of chromatin proteins can be altered by several variances under native conditions, such as DNA sequence, DNA and protein modifications, and short- and long-scale DNA folding. Although isolation of the endogenous chromatin-associated complexes can be achieved through <underline>ch</underline>romatin immuno<underline>p</underline>recipitation (ChIP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> to determine the associated DNA sequences and proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, the amount obtained by this method is too little to apply for conventional structural analysis.</p>
<p>To obtain high-resolution cryo-EM structures of chromatin-associated protein complexes while they are functioning on the native chromosomes, we previously analyzed structural variation of nucleosomes isolated from interphase and metaphase chromosomes formed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. We found that the averaged structures of the nucleosome core particle (NCP) in interphase and metaphase chromosomes are essentially identical to the NCP crystal structure assembled with histone proteins and DNA with strong nucleosome positioning sequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. We also observed that the major structural variation of the nucleosome structures between interphase and metaphase chromosomes was attributable to the binding status of the oocyte-specific linker histone H1.8. We were able to resolve the 3D structure of the H1.8-bound nucleosome isolated from metaphase chromosomes but not from interphase chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The resolved structure indicated that H1.8 in metaphase is most stably bound to the nucleosome at the on-dyad position, in which H1 interacts with both the entry and exit linker DNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. This stable H1 association to the nucleosome in metaphase likely reflects its role in controlling the size and the shape of mitotic chromosomes through limiting chromatin accessibility of condensins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, but it remains unclear why H1.8 binding to the nucleosome in interphase is less stable. Since the low abundance of H1.8-bound nucleosomes in interphase might have prevented us from determining their structure, we sought to solve this issue by enriching H1.8-bound nucleoprotein complexes through adapting ChIP-based methods.</p>
<p>Aiming to reduce sample requirements for single particle cryo-EM analyses to levels lower than those widely used for ChIP-seq (10-50 ng DNA, <xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, here we developed <underline>Mag</underline>netic Isolation and <underline>C</underline>oncentration (MagIC)-cryo-EM, which enables direct cryo-EM analysis of target molecules enriched on superparamagnetic nanobeads. By adapting the ChIP protocol to MagIC-cryo-EM, we successfully determine the ∼4 Å resolution structures of H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes using highly heterogeneous dilute fractions isolated from metaphase and interphase chromosomes. In addition, by combining the particle curation method, <underline>Du</underline>plicated <underline>S</underline>election <underline>T</underline>o <underline>E</underline>xclude <underline>R</underline>ubbish particles (DuSTER), which effectively removes particles with a low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), we revealed structural variations of the H1.8-bound chaperone NPM2 isolated from interphase chromosomes, providing structural insights into the cell cycle regulation of H1.8 stabilization on nucleosomes.</p>

<title>Development and optimization of MagIC-cryo-EM using nucleosomes</title>
<p>Inspired by a report using 200-300 nm superparamagnetic beads directly loaded onto a cryo-EM grid to image viral particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we examined the feasibility of 50 nm streptavidin nanobeads for cryo-EM single-particle analysis using poly-nucleosome arrays as pilot targets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Nanobeads were easily identified on the grid as black dots in the intermediate-magnification montage map (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), facilitating target identification for subsequent high-magnification data collection. In the high-magnification micrographs, poly-nucleosome fibers were observed around the nanobeads as expected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Using nucleosome-like particles selected from 550 micrographs by the machine-learning-based software Topaz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, we successfully determined the 3D structure of the nucleosome at sub-nanometer resolution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This result, however, revealed a notable issue; an intense halo-like scattering covered a ∼30 nm radius around the nanobeads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, blue areas), interfering with the signal from particles that were proximal to the beads.</p>

<p>To reduce the effect of the halo-like scattering surrounding the nanobeads, a protein spacer module was attached to the beads so that the target biomolecules are placed outside the reach of the halo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). After several rounds of optimization using the <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted H1.8-bound nucleosome as a model target, we chose a spacer module comprising an 11-nm triple helical bundle (3HB) protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and four copies of a 60-nm single alpha helix (SAH) protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> for its effectiveness and reasonable production yield (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>).

</fig>
<p>To assess the feasibility of the MagIC-cryo-EM beads for structural analysis of a low-concentration target in heterogeneous samples, we isolated H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes by anti-GFP nanobody coupled to the MagIC-cryo-EM beads from a mixture of H1.8-GFP nucleosomes (1.7 nM, or 0.00047 mg/mL) and a large excess of unbound mono-nucleosomes (53 nM, or 0.012 mg/mL) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). This target concentration was approximately 100 to 1000 times lower than the concentration required for conventional cryo-EM methods, including affinity grid approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The magnetic beads were captured on a cryo-EM grid by neodymium magnets for 5 min in a humidified chamber (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). This magnetic capture step significantly increased the number of beads that were found in the sample holes of the grid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-I</xref>), thereby mitigating the sample loss caused by filter paper blotting to generate a thin ice layer.</p>
<p>High-magnification micrographs of MagIC-cryo-EM beads show that the spacer module successfully placed nucleosome-like particles outside the halo-like scattering surrounding the nanobeads (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). The local enrichment of target molecules around MagIC-cryo-EM beads offers a substantial advantage in data collection efficiency over available cryo-EM methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, in which target molecules are disseminated across the grids and are difficult to identify. In contrast, the magnetic beads are easily identified in the Medium-Magnification Montage (MMM) map (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), enabling the selection of target-rich areas prior to high-magnification data collection. Indeed, approximately 100 H1.8-GFP nucleosome particle images per bead were efficiently collected even with a sample concentration as low as 0.00047 mg/mL of H1.8-GFP nucleosomes in the heterogeneous sample (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref> right panel).</p>
<p>After removing junk particles using decoy classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>), an H1.8 density-containing nucleosome class was isolated via <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction and heterogeneous refinement using cryoSPARC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Among the nucleosome-containing particles, 55.7 % of them were classified as a nucleosome with H1.8 at the on-dyad position (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>), yielding a final 3D structure at 3.6 Å resolution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). This high fraction of H1.8-bound nucleosome particles indicated that the MagIC-cryo-EM beads efficiently isolated the target molecules. Notably, this method only required 5 ng of H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes (including 2 ng of DNA) per cryo-EM grid, which is comparable to or even lower than the requirements of widely used ChIP-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>MagIC-cryo-EM application for ChIP to assess structural features of H1.8 in chromosomes</title>
<p>We next adapted MagIC cryo-EM to ChIP protocols to elucidate the cell-cycle-specific mechanism that controls H1.8 stability on interphase and metaphase nucleosomes. We previously reported the cryo-EM structure of <italic>Xenopus</italic> H1.8 bound to the metaphase nucleosome at the on-dyad position, whereas no H1.8-containing structures were reconstructed from interphase chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, left). Despite the high accumulation of H1.8 in the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), the amount of nucleosome-associated H1.8 in interphase is reduced to approximately 30% of that in metaphase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.

By enriching H1.8-bound nucleosomes from interphase and metaphase chromosomes using MagIC-cryo-EM, we intended to examine if H1.8 in interphase preferentially associates with nucleosomes at more unstable binding positions, such as at off-dyad positions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, positioning model), or if there is an interphase-specific mechanism (by chaperones, for example) that dissociates H1.8 from nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, chaperone model), although the amount H1.8-bound NAP1, the known histone H1.8 chaperone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, did not differ between metaphase and interphase egg extracts (Fig. S3A).</p>

<p>To distinguish between these models, we applied MagIC-cryo-EM to enrich H1.8 bound nucleosomes from chromosomes assembled in interphase and metaphase <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. Sperm nuclei were incubated in egg extracts supplemented with H1.8-GFP to obtain replicated interphase chromosomes and metaphase chromosomes, which were crosslinked and fragmented to generate soluble nucleoprotein complexes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We confirmed that H1.8-GFP is functional as it rescued the chromosome elongation phenotype caused by H1.8 immunodepletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3B-D</xref>). Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was conducted to separate different H1.8-containing complexes, including mono-nucleosome fractions and oligo-nucleosome fractions, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and S4). As we had predicted that more H1.8 proteins would associate with nucleosomes in metaphase than in interphase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, we increased the quantities of egg extract and sperm nuclei by 2.5 fold to prepare comparable amounts of H1.8-bound interphase nucleosomes as compared to metaphase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, fractions 4-11). To prevent the dissociation of H1.8 from nucleosomes during DNA fragmentation, the MNase concentration and the reaction time were optimized to generate DNA fragment lengths with 180–200 bp (Fig. S4B), which is adequate for linker histone association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. To ensure that most nucleosomes isolated through MagIC-cryo-EM were bound by H1.8, we selected the fractions enriched with H1.8-bound mono-nucleosomes (fraction 5 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>), as oligo-nucleosomes (abundant in fractions 6-11) might include H1.8-free nucleosomes. These fractions contain highly heterogeneous protein mixtures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), in which H1.8-GFP is a minor constituent with an estimated concentration at 1-2 nM (corresponding to 0.00025-0.0005 mg/ml of H1.8-bound mono-nucleosomes) (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4C</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis of these fractions also showed heterogeneity as they included several DNA-binding proteins, such as PCNA (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2 and Table S5</xref>).</p>
<p>H1.8-GFP-bound mono-nucleosomes in fraction 5 (from metaphase and interphase chromosomes) were captured by GFP nanobody-MagIC-cryo-EM beads and applied to grids for cryo-EM analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis of the captured MagIC-cryo-EM beads confirmed selective enrichment of H1.8 over other nonhistone proteins found in fraction 5 (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). To quantitatively assess the population of the H1-bound structural modes of interphase and metaphase nucleosomes, we employed <italic>in silico</italic> mixing 3D classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Micrographs of interphase and metaphase MagIC-cryo-EM were mixed and used for particle picking and decoy classification to isolate the nucleosome-containing classes (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>). Subsequently, particles were classified into three nucleosome-containing 3D models (A, B, C), which were generated by <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and S5A). Further 3D classification on the class A, which has weak H1.8 density, yielded three new nucleosome-containing structures, A1, A2, and A3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and S5A). Then, the populations of interphase and metaphase particles in each class were assessed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Only class A1 had an apparent H1.8 density at the on-dyad position of the nucleosome, with 27% and 23% of the nucleosome particles assigned to this class coming from interphase and metaphase conditions, respectively. Although class A2 had linker DNA densities on both sides of the entry/exit sites of the nucleosome in a closed conformation, it did not have a clear H1.8 density. This suggested that the structures of H1.8 in the particles assigned to this class were not uniform, and that the H1.8 density was averaged out during the cryo-EM processing. Class A3, to which 3-4 % of the nucleosome particles were assigned, had ambiguous extra densities outside of the on-dyad position (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, red arrows), possibly representing H1.8 bound to non-dyad positions. Overall, the relative distributions of these 5 classes were largely similar between interphase and metaphase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), and the structures of H1.8-bound nucleosomes in interphase and metaphase were indistinguishable (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). The structures of GFP-tagged H1.8-bound nucleosomes isolated from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract chromosomes are essentially identical to the endogenous H1.8-bound nucleosome structure we previously determined <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Therefore, although the usage of GFP-tagged H1.8 and MagIC-cryo-EM potentially affect the structure of the H1.8-bound nucleosome, we consider these influences to be minimal. Altogether, the results suggest that differential positional preferences of H1.8 on the nucleosome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, positioning model) are unlikely to drive the reduced H1.8 association to interphase nucleosomes.</p>

<title>MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER reconstructed cryo-EM structure of interphase-specific H1.8-containing complex, NPM2</title>
<p>Although we could not discern structural differences of H1.8-bound mono-nucleosomes from metaphase and interphase samples, we noticed that substantial portions of H1.8 were enriched in sucrose fractions 3 and 4 isolated from interphase chromosomes but not from metaphase chromosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). As these interphase-specific H1.8 fractions were lighter than mono-nucleosome-containing fractions, we thought that they may contain regulatory proteins that preferentially dissociate H1.8 from nucleosomes in interphase, in line with the chaperone model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>To characterize these interphase-specific fractions, we sought to determine their structural features using MagIC-cryo-EM. However, our initial attempt failed to reconstitute any reasonable 2D classes of the interphase-specific H1.8-containing complex (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6A</xref>), even though Topaz successfully picked most of the 60∼80 Å particles that are visible on motion-corrected micrographs and enriched around the MagIC-cryo-EM beads (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6A</xref>). This was likely due to their small size; most of the particles did not have a high enough S/N to be properly classified during the 2D classifications as they were masked by background noise from the ice and/or spacer proteins (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6B</xref>).</p>
<p>To solve this issue, we devised the particle curation method DuSTER that does not requires the successful 2D classifications (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The principle of DuSTER is based on our realization that low S/N ratio particles were not reproducibly recentered during 2D classification (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7</xref>). On the particles that were successfully recognized during 2D classification, picked points were shifted to the center of the particles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, black arrows). However, on the low S/N ratio particles that could not be recognized during 2D classification, picked points were shifted outside the center of the particles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, green arrows). To assess the reproducibility of the particle recentering during 2D classification, two independent particle pickings were conducted by Topaz so that each particle on the grid has up to two picked points (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, second left panel). Some particles that only have one picked point will be removed in a later step. These picked points were independently subjected to 2D classification. After recentering the picked points by 2D classification, distances (<italic>D</italic>) between recentered points from the first picking process and other recentered points from the second picking process were measured. DuSTER keeps recentered points whose <italic>D</italic> are shorter than a threshold distance (<italic>D<sub>TH</sub></italic>). By setting <italic>D<sub>TH</sub></italic> = 20 Å, 2D classification results were dramatically improved in this sample; a five-petal flower-shaped 2D class was reconstructed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). This step also removes the particles that only have one picked point. Although approaches to utilize the reproducibility of 2D class assignments have been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, the advantage of DuSTER is that it can be applied to small particles that cannot even be properly classified in 2D classification.</p>

<p>Repetitive rounds of particle curation using the picked point locations recentered by 2D classification (referred to as 2D DuSTER) successfully reconstituted 2D classes of 60∼80 Å complexes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, and S8). As expected, the particles rejected by DuSTER have a generally weak contrast (Fig S9A). Although higher contrast images can be generated by increasing the defocus (the distance between the target particles and the lens focus), the selected particles were evenly distributed in all defocus ranges between 1.5 ∼ 3.5 µm (Fig S9B), demonstrating that DuSTER did not merely select any random high contrast particles. By selecting these 2D classes, an initial 3D model was built (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8 and S10</xref>). Using this 3D model, particle curation was revised with 3D DuSTER. In the 3D DuSTER, three 3D maps were used as the initial models for the cryoSPARC heterogenous refinement to centering the particles accurately (<italic>D<sub>TH</sub></italic> = 15 Å) (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S10A</xref>). 3D DuSTER enabled the reconstruction of 3D structure of the interphase-specific H1.8-containing complex, a pentameric macromolecule with a diameter of approximately 60 Å (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and S12).</p>
<p>To determine the identity of this complex, MagIC-cryo-EM beads used for isolating the complex were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Among the proteins detected by MS, NPM2 aligned well with the MagIC-cryo-EM result. Western blotting confirmed that NPM2 was preferentially enriched in interphase chromatin fractions compared to metaphase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), while NPM2 interacts with H1.8 in chromosome-free egg extracts both in interphase and metaphase (Fig. S3A). The native PAGE of the chromatin fractions indicated that NPM2 forms various complexes, including NPM2-H1.8, on the interphase chromatin fractions (Fig. S4D). In addition, the crystal structure and AlphaFold2 (AF2)-predicted models of <italic>Xenopus</italic> NPM2 matched the MagIC-cryo-EM structure of the interphase-specific H1.8-bound complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Structural variations of NPM2 bound to H1.8</title>
<p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs, NPM2 replaces sperm protamines with core histones upon fertilization, thereby promoting nucleosome assembly on sperm DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.

However, no subnanometer-resolution structure of NPM2 or NPM1 with post-translational modifications or with substrates is currently available.</p>
<p>By further analyzing our cryo-EM structure representing the H1.8-bound state of NPM2, we identified two structural variants, classified as open and closed forms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, S11, and S12J-K). Due to its structural similarity to a flower, we call the highly acidic putative substrate-binding surface the petal side, whereas the other more charge neutral surface the sepal side (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and S13). The major structural differences between the two forms are found at C-terminal and N-terminal segments of NPM2 core and at the A1 loop (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, and S13). In the closed form, β8 runs straight from the sepal to the petal sides of each pentamer and has an extended C-terminal segment that protrudes past the petal side of the pentamer. In the open form, however, the C-terminal portion of β8 is bent outward to the rim (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Along with this β8 bending, C-terminal segment, N-terminal segment, and A1 loop are also positioned outward in the open form. The configuration of β1, β8, and A1 loop in the crystal structure of <italic>Xenopus</italic> NPM2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, the AF2-predicted structure of <italic>Xenopus</italic> NPM2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, and the cryo-EM structure of the bacterially expressed human NPM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, which were all determined in the absence of their target proteins, is similar to the closed form (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S13B-D</xref>). Notably, extra cryo-EM densities, which may represent H1.8, are clearly observed in the open form but much less in the closed form near the acidic surface regions proximal to the N terminus of β1 and the C terminus of β8 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Supporting this idea, the acidic tract A1 (aa 36-40) and A2 (aa 120-140), which are both implicated in the recognition of basic substrates such as core histones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, respectively interact with and are adjacent to the putative H1.8 density (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). In addition, the NPM2 surface that is in direct contact with the putative H1.8 density is accessible in the open form while it is internalized in the closed form (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). This structural change of NPM2 may support more rigid binding of H1.8 to the open NPM2, whereas H1.8 binding to the closed form is less stable and likely occurs through interactions with the C-terminal A2 and A3 tracts, which are not visible in our cryo-EM structures.</p>

<p>In the aforementioned NPM2-H1.8 structures, for which we applied C5 symmetry during the 3D structure reconstruction, only a partial H1.8 density could be seen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). One possibility is that the H1.8 structure in NPM2-H1.8 does not follow C5 symmetry. As the size of the NPM2-H1.8 complex estimated from sucrose gradient elution volume is consistent with pentameric NPM2 binding to a single H1.8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>), applying C5 symmetry during structural reconstruction likely blurred the density of the monomeric H1.8 that binds to the NPM2 pentamer. The structural determination of NPM2-H1.8 without applying C5 symmetry lowered the overall resolution but visualized multiple structural variants of the NPM2 protomer with different degrees of openness co-existing within an NPM2-H1.8 complex (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S14</xref>), raising a possibility that opening of a portion of the NPM2 pentamer may affect modes of H1.8 binding. Although more detailed structural analyses of the NPM2-substrate complex are the subject of future studies, MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER revealed structural changes of NPM2 that was co-isolated H1.8 on interphase chromosomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MagIC-cryo-EM offers sub-nanometer resolution structural determination using a heterogeneous sample that contains the target molecule at 1∼2 nM, which is approximately 100 to 1000 times lower than the concentration required for conventional cryo-EM methods, including affinity grid approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. This significant improvement was achieved through the four unique benefits of MagIC-cryo-EM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). First, the on-bead-cryo-EM approach minimizes preparation steps, which can lead to sample loss, such as target isolation, enrichment, and buffer exchange (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Second, sample loss during the grid-freezing process is reduced by magnet-based enrichment of the targets on cryo-EM grids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref> and 6B). Third, magnetic beads are easily identifiable on the grid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). Fourth, the target molecules are accumulated around magnetic beads, ensuring that each micrograph contains more than 100 usable particles independent of input sample concentration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Adapting the ChIP-based method to MagIC cryo-EM, we successfully isolated and reconstructed the H1.8-bound nucleosome and the H1.8-bound NPM2 structures from interphase chromosomes, which have never been accomplished before.</p>
<p>To reconstitute the structure of H1.8-bound NPM2, we needed to devise the particle curation method DuSTER, which greatly helped the structural reconstitution of small particles with low S/N (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). By combining MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER, we were able to determine the sub-nanometer structure and structural variations of the NPM2-H1.8-GFP complex, in which the mass of the ordered region is only 60 kDa. Notably, particle curation by DuSTER does not require human supervision or machine learning, except for determining the distance threshold between repeatedly picked particles. This feature may allow for automating particle curation via DuSTER in the future.</p>
<p>MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER approaches hold the potential for targeting a wide range of biomolecules, including small ones, for two main reasons. First, the target-capturing module could be replaced with various other proteins, such as different nanobodies, single-chain variable fragments (scFv), protein A, dCas9, or avidin, to capture a wide range of biomolecules. Second, the sample requirement for MagIC-cryo-EM is a mere 5 ng per grid, which is comparable to or even lower than the requirements of widely used ChIP-seq <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Coupling next-generation sequencing with MagIC-cryo-EM beads would help the field determine structural features of functionally distinct chromatin regions, such as heterochromatin, euchromatin, transcription start sites, telomeres, and centromeres. The low sample requirement of MagIC-cryo-EM also opens the door to structural analysis using limited specimens, including patient tissues.</p>
<p>Combining MS, MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER, we found that the majority of chromatin-bound H1.8 in interphase existed as a complex with NPM2 rather than with nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). This contrasts to the reports suggesting that NAP1 is the major H1.8-bound chaperone in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, while it is consistent with our previous MS analysis that also detected NPM2, but not NAP1, in fractions enriched with nucleosomes in interphase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Our observation is also in line with a previous report that NPM2 is able to remove linker histones but not core histones from somatic nuclei that are introduced to <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Since the amounts of H1.8-associated NAP1 or NPM2 in the egg cytoplasm did not change between interphase and metaphase (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3A</xref>), a mechanism must exist such that NPM2 interacts with H1.8 on chromatin specifically in interphase and suppresses H1.8-nucleosome interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Two basic patches at the C-terminal tail of NPM2 may contribute to cell cycle-dependent DNA binding as they are flanked with potential Cdk1 phosphorylation sites. NPM2 may maintain nucleosome-bound H1.8 at a low level in interphase during early developmental cell cycles to support rapid DNA replication, while mitotic induction of H1.8 association with nucleosomes tunes condensin loading on chromosomes and ensures proper chromosome size to facilitate chromosome segregation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Structural studies based on <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution previously suggested that NPM2 binds to its substrate as a homo-decamer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, or a homo-pentamer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Our cryo-EM structure strongly suggests that the NPM2 binds to H1.8 as a homo-pentamer. Structure variation analyses suggest that NPM2 subunits can exhibit two structural configurations, open and closed forms, of which H1.8 is stably associated with only the open form. Since the closed form is more similar to the reported crystal structure and AF2-predicted structures (<xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S14B-D</xref>), both of which are determined in the absence of the substrates, our analysis points toward a possibility that substrate binding induces the structural transition of NPM2 to the open form. The conformational changes of the NPM family have been proposed in other studies, such as NMR and negative stain-EM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Our cryo-EM structures of NPM2 indicate the potential mechanisms of NPM2 conformational changes and potential substrate binding sites. Among NPM2 acidic tracts A1, A2 and A3, which are important for substrate recognition, our atomic models visualize A1 and the edge of A2 at the petal side of the structure, where the density corresponding to the predicted H1.8 can be found (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). As the A2 and A3 belong to the disordered C-terminal tail that extends from the petal side of the NPM2 complex, our data suggest that the open form provides a stable association platform by exposing the acidic surface at the petal side for the substrate recognition, while the C-terminal A2 and A3 at the flexible tail may facilitate recruitment and possibly also entrapment of the substrate. Since our structural analysis further suggests that each NPM2 subunit may independently adapt open and closed form within a pentamer, this flexibility in the core domain may enable the association of substrates with diverse sizes and structures to support its molecular chaperone functionality.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>While MagIC-cryo-EM is envisioned as a versatile approach suitable for various biomolecules from diverse sources, including cultured cells and tissues, it has thus far been tested only with H1.8-bound nucleosome and H1.8-bound NPM2, both using anti-GFP nanobodies to isolate GFP-tagged H1.8 from chromosomes assembled in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts after pre-fractionation of chromatin. To apply MagIC-cryo-EM for the other targets, the following factors must be considered: <italic>1) Pre-fractionation.</italic> This step (e.g., density gradient or gel filtration) may be necessary to enrich the target protein in a specific complex from other diverse forms (such as monomeric forms, subcomplexes, and protein aggregates). <italic>2) Avoiding bead aggregation.</italic> Beads may be clustered by targets (if the target complex contains multiple affinity tags or is aggregated), nonspecific binders, and target capture modules. To directly apply antibodies that recognize the native targets and specific modifications, optimization to avoid bead aggregation will be important. <italic>3) Stabilizing complexes.</italic> The target complexes must be stable during the sample preparation. Crosslink was necessary for the H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosome. <italic>4) Loading the optimum number of targets on the bead.</italic> The optimal number of particles per bead differs depending on target sizes, as larger targets are more likely to overlap. For H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes, 500 to 2,000 particles per bead were optimal. We expect that fewer particles should be coated for larger targets.</p>
<p>Regarding the cryo-EM data acquisition, the selection of data collection points is currently performed through the manual picking of magnetic beads on the MMM map. This method does not support image-shift-based data collection and serves as a bottleneck for data collection speed, limiting throughput to approximately 500–1000 micrographs per day. The development of machine learning-based software to automatically identify magnetic beads on MMM maps and establish parameters for image-shift-based multiple shots could substantially enhance data collection efficiency.</p>
<p>The efficiency of magnetic bead capture can be further improved. In the current MagIC-cryo-EM workflow, the cryo-EM grid is incubated on a magnet before being transferred to the Vitrobot for vitrification. However, since the Vitrobot cannot accommodate a strong magnet, the vitrification step occurs without the magnetic force, potentially resulting in bead loss. This limitation could be addressed by developing a new plunge freezer capable of maintaining magnetic force during vitrification.</p>
<p>While DuSTER enables the structural analysis of NPM2 co-isolated with H1.8-GFP, the resulting map quality is modest, and the reported numerical resolution may be overestimated. Furthermore, only partial density for H1.8 is observed. Although structural analysis of small proteins is inherently challenging, it is possible that halo-like scattering further hinders high-resolution structural determination by reducing the S/N ratio. More detailed structural analyses of the NPM2-substrate complex will be addressed in future studies.</p>

The beads were collected by incubation on two pieces of 40 x 20 mm N52 neodymium disc magnets (DIYMAG: D40x20-2P-NEW) at 4 °C for 30 min and then resuspended in 120 µL of EM buffer A. The two pieces of strong neodymium magnets have to be handled carefully as magnets can leap and slam together from several feet apart. Next, 60 µL of 34 nM nucleosome arrays formed on the biotinylated 19-mer 200 bp 601 DNA were mixed with the beads and rotated at 20 °C for 2 h. To remove unbound nucleosomes, the biotin-poly-nucleosome-bound nano-magnetic beads were collected after 40 min of incubation on the N52 neodymium disc magnets and then resuspended in 300 µL EM buffer containing 10 µM biotin. A 100 µL portion of the biotin-poly-nucleosome-bound nano-magnetic beads solution was incubated on the N52 neodymium disc magnets for 30 min and then resuspended in 20 µL EM buffer A. Finally, 3 µL of biotin-poly-nucleosome-bound nano-magnetic beads solution was added onto a glow-discharged Quantifoil Gold R 1.2/1.3 300 mesh grid (Quantifoil).

Picked particles were extracted using CryoSPARC v3 (extraction box size = 200 pixel). 2D classification of extracted particles was done using 100 classes in CryoSPARC v3. Using 2D classification results, particles were split into the nucleosome-like groups and the non-nucleosome-like groups. Four 3D initial models were generated for both groups with ab initio reconstruction in CryoSPARC v3 (Class similarity = 0). One nucleosome-like model was selected and used as a given model of heterogeneous reconstruction with all four of the “decoy” classes generated from the non-nucleosome-like group. After the first round of 3D classification, the particles assigned to the “decoy” classes were removed, and the remaining particles used for a second round of 3D classification using the same settings as the first round. These steps were repeated until more than 90 % of particles wer classified as a nucleosome-like class. To isolate the nucleosome class that has visible H1.8 density, four to six 3D references were generated with ab initio reconstruction of CryoSPARC v3 using purified nucleosome-like particles (Class similarity = 0.9). Refined particles were further purified with the heterogeneous refinement using an H1.8-visible class and an H1.8-invisible class as decoys. The classes with reasonable extra density were selected and refined with homogeneous refinement. The final resolution was determined with the gold stand FSC threshold (FSC = 0.143).</p>

To prevent the spontaneous cycling of egg extracts, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide was added to the CSF extract. H1.8-GFP was added to the CSF extract at a final concentration of 650 nM, equivalent to the concentration of endogenous H1.8 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. For interphase chromosome preparation, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> sperm nuclei (final concentration 2000/µL) were added to 5 mL of CSF extracts, which were then incubated for 90 min at 20 °C after adding 0.3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to release the CSF extracts into interphase. For metaphase sperm chromosome preparation, cyclin B Δ90 (final concentration 24 µg/mL) and 1 mL of fresh CSF extract were added to 2 ml of the extract containing interphase sperm nuclei prepared using the method described above. To make up for the reduced H1.8-nucleosome formation in interphase, we used 5 ml of egg extracts for preparing interphase chromosomes and 2 mL of extracts for metaphase chromosomes. The extracts were incubated for 60 min at 20 °C, with gentle mixing every 10 min. To crosslink the <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts chromosomes, nine times the volume of ice-cold buffer XL (80 mM PIPES-KOH [pH 6.8], 15 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 30 % glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium butyrate, 2.67 % formaldehyde, 0.001% digitonin) was added to the interphase or metaphase extract containing chromosomes, which was further incubated for 60 min on ice. These fixed chromosomes were then layered on 3 mL of fresh buffer SC (80 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.4], 15 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 1.17 M sucrose, 50 mM glycine, 0.15 mM spermidine, 0.5 mM spermine, 1.25x cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium butyrate, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) in 50 ml centrifuge tubes (Falcon, #352070). The tubes were spun at 3,300 (2,647 rcf) rpm at 4 °C for 40 min using a JS 5.3 rotor in an Avanti J-26S centrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Pellets containing fixed chromosomes were resuspended with 10 mL of buffer SC, layered on 3 ml of fresh buffer SC in 14 mL centrifuge tubes (Falcon, #352059), and spun at 3,300 (2,647 rcf) rpm at 4 °C for 40 min using a JS 5.3 rotor in an Avanti J-26S centrifuge (Beckman Coulter).

To digest chromatin, MNase concentration and reaction time were tested on a small scale and optimized to the condition that produce 180-200 bp DNA fragments. After the optimization, 0.6 and 0.3 U/µL of MNase were added to interphase and metaphase chromosomes, respectively.</p>

The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Cytiva) from the SDS-PAGE gel using TE42 Tank Blotting Units (Hoefer) at 15 V, 4 °C for 4 h.

The images were taken with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor). The existence of the H1.8-GFP bound nucleosomes was confirmed by native PAGE. 15 µL of each sucrose gradient fraction was applied for a 6 % x0.5 TEB native PAGE gel.

<p>For the MS analysis, 20 µL of the resuspended solution containing the MagIC-cryo-EM beads isolating interphase-specific H1.8-GFP containing complex was incubated at 95 °C for 10 minutes to reverse the crosslink. The 20 µL each of the sucrose gradient fractions 4 and 5 (interphase and metaphase) was also incubated at 95 °C. The samples were then applied to an SDS-PAGE (4 %–20 % gradient gel, Bio-Rad).

In brief, the cut gel was destained using a solution of 30 % acetonitrile and 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate in water. Gel pieces were then dehydrated using 100 % acetonitrile. Disulfide bonds were reduced with dithiothreitol, and cysteines were alkylated using iodoacetamide. Proteins were digested by hydrating the gel pieces in a solution containing sequencing-grade trypsin and endopeptidase LysC in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Digestion proceeded overnight at 37 °C.

Although the tool was originally designed to remove duplicate particles at closed distances, we used this tool to keep the recentered points whose <italic>D</italic> are shorter than <italic>D<sub>TH</sub></italic>. All particles from two individual particle sets after the 2D classification were applied to the ‘Remove Duplicate Particles’ tool in CryoSPARC v4 using the ‘Remove Duplicates Entirely’ option (Minimum separation distance: 20Å). Although the tool was originally designed to remove duplicate particles at closed distances, we used this tool to keep the recentered points whose <italic>D</italic> are shorter than <italic>D<sub>TH</sub></italic>. The particles whose recentered points whose <italic>D</italic> are shorter than <italic>D<sub>TH</sub></italic> and were the particles used in further downstream processing, were sorted as ‘rejected particles’. These particles were applied to the Particle Sets Tool in CryoSPARC v4 to split them into two individual particle sets. 2D DuSTER, including particle re-centering, particle extraction, and particle splitting steps, was repeated seven times. After seven rounds of 2D DuSTER, the particles were manually curated by removing the 2D classes with unreasonable sizes or shapes for the interphase-specific H1.8-GFP containing complex. The 2D images of removed classes are shown in <xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8</xref>. After manual curation, the particles were further cleaned by an additional four rounds of 2D DuSTER. The particles were further cleaned by the Class Probability Filtering Tool in CryoSPARC v4. 2D classification was performed twice for one of the cleaned particle sets. The particles whose 2D class probability scores were lower than 0.3 in both replicates of 2D classification were removed. The redundant 2D classifications were necessary to prevent unintentional loss of high S/N particles.The duplicated class probability filtering was repeated six times. Using the filtered particles, 2D classification was performed twice. The high-resolution classes with reasonable protein-like features were manually selected from both 2D classification results. To prevent unintentional contamination of low S/N particles, the 92,382 particles that were selected in both 2D classification runs were used for ab initio 3D reconstruction (C5 symmetry applied).

<p>The pipeline for the particle cleaning using 3D DuSTER is described in <xref rid="d1e1284" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S10</xref>. After seven rounds of 2D DuSTER for the particles picked by Topaz, decoy 3D classification was employed to remove nucleosomes and GFP complexed with GFP-nanobody. The nucleosome 3D model was generated by ab initio 3D reconstruction using the particles assigned to nucleosome-like 2D classes. The 3D model of GFP complexed with GFP-nanobody was modeled from the crystal structure of the complex (PDB ID: 3k1k) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> using EMAN2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>.

Using these models and the initial 3D model of NPM2-H1.8-GFP, heterogeneous 3D refinement was performed twice in CryoSPARC v4. To prevent unintentional loss of high S/N particles, particles that were assigned to the nucleosome and GFP complexed with GFP-nanobody class in both heterogeneous 3D refinement results were removed. By using the Remove Duplicate Particles and Particle Sets tools in CryoSPARC v4, the particles in picked particle set 2 that corresponded to the particles cleaned by decoy classification were selected.

Using the same procedure as 2D DuSTER, the particles that were reproducibly centered in each particle set were selected (Minimum separation distance: 15 Å). 3D DuSTER was repeated six times. To conduct 3D DuSTER more comprehensively, 3D refinements were performed for each picked particle set three times. Particle curation based on the distance was performed for all nine combinations of these 3D refinement results, and this comprehensive 3D DuSTER was repeated once again. Using the particles in picked particle set 1 after 3D DuSTER, 2D classification was performed twice. The noise classes were manually selected from both 2D classification results. To prevent unintentional loss of high S/N particles, particles that were assigned to the noise class in both 2D classification runs were removed. This duplicated 2D classification and manual selection was repeated twice. During the 2D classification, 2D classes that represent GFP-nanobody were found.

<p>This study follows up on Arimura et al's powerful new method MagIC-Cryo-EM for imaging native complexes at high resolution. Using a clever design embedding protein spacers between the antibody and the nucleosomes purified, thereby minimizing interference from the beads, the authors concentrate linker histone variant H1.8 containing nucleosomes. From these samples, the authors obtain <bold>convincing</bold> atomic structures of the H1.8 bound chromatosome purified from interphase and metaphase cells, finding a NPM2 chaperone bound form exists as well. Caveats previously noted have been addressed nicely in the revision, strengthening the overall conclusions. This is an <bold>important</bold> new tool in the arsenal of single molecule biologists, permitting a deep dive into structure of native complexes, and will be of high interest to a broad swathe of scientists studying native macromolecules present at low concentrations in cells.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Arimura et al describe MagIC-Cryo-EM, an innovative method for immune-selective concentrating of native molecules and macromolecular complexes for Cryo-EM imaging and single-particle analysis. Typically, Cryo-EM imaging requires much larger concentrations of biomolecules than those that are feasible to achieve by conventional biochemical fractionation. This manuscript is meticulously and clearly written and the new technique is likely to become a great asset to other electron microscopists and chromatin researchers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Previously, Arimura et al. (Mol. Cell 2021) isolated from Xenopus extract and resolved by Cryo-EM a sub-class of native nucleosomes conjugated containing histone H1.8 at the on-dyad position, similar to that previously observed by other researchers with reconstituted nucleosomes. Here they sought to analyze immuno-selected nucleosomes aiming to observe specific modes of H1.8 positioning (e.g. on-dyad and off-dyad) and potentially reveal structural motifs responsible for the decreased affinity of H1.8 for the interphase chromatin compared to metaphase chromosomes. The main strength of this work is a clever and novel methodological design, in particular the engineered protein spacers to separate captured nucleosomes from streptavidin beads for clear imaging. The authors provide a detailed step-by-step description of MagIC-Cryo-EM procedure including nucleosome isolation, preparation of GFP nanobody attached magnetic beads, optimization of the spacer length, concentration of the nucleosomes on graphene grids, data collection and analysis, including their new DUSTER method to filter-out low signal particles. This tour de force methodology should facilitate the consideration of MagIC-Cryo-EM by other electron microscopists, especially for analysis of native nucleosome complexes.</p>
<p>
In pursuit of biologically important new structures, the immune-selected H1.8-containing nucleosomes were solved at about 4A resolution; their structure appears to be very similar to the previously determined structure of H1.8-reconstituted nucleosomes. There were no apparent differences between the metaphase and interphase complexes suggesting that the on-dyad and off-dyad positioning does not explain the differences in H1.8 - nucleosome binding. However, they were able to identify and solve complexes of H1.8-GFP with histone chaperone NPM2 in a closed and open conformation providing mechanistic insights for H1-NPM2 binding and the reduced affinity of H1.8 to interphase chromatin as compared to metaphase chromosomes.</p>
<p>MagIC technique still has certain limitations resulting from formaldehyde fixation, use of bacterial-expressed recombinant H1.8-GFP, and potential effects of magnetic beads and/or spacer on protein structure, which are explicitly discussed in the text. Notwithstanding these limitations, MagIC-Cryo-EM is expected to become a great asset to other electron microscopists and biochemists studying native macromolecular complexes.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>In the revision, Arimura et al. have constructively addressed the reviewer's concerns, by discussing possible limitations and including additional information on proteomic analysis and H1.8-NPM2 structures.</p>
<p>
The revised manuscript and rebuttal letter strengthen my initial opinion that this paper describes an innovative method for immune-selective concentrating of native molecules and macromolecular complexes thus enabling Cryo-EM imaging and structural analysis of native nucleosome complexes at low concentration. This manuscript is meticulously and clearly written and may become a great asset to other electron microscopists and chromatin researchers</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors present a straightforward and convincing demonstration of a reagent and workflow that they collectively term &quot;MagIC-cryo-EM&quot;, in which magnetic nanobeads combined with affinity linkers are used to specifically immobilize and locally concentrate complexes that contain a protein-of-interest. As a proof of concept, they localize, image, and reconstruct H1.8-bound nucleosomes reconstructed from frog egg extracts. The authors additionally devised an image-processing workflow termed &quot;DuSTER&quot;, which increases the true positive detections of the partially ordered NPM2 complex. The analysis of the NPM2 complex {plus minus} H1.8 was challenging because only ~60 kDa of protein mass was ordered. Overall, single-particle cryo-EM practitioners should find this study useful.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The rationale is very logical and the data are convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I have seen an earlier version of this study at a conference. The conference presentation was much easier to follow than the current manuscript. It is as if this manuscript had undergone review at another journal and includes additional experiments to satisfy previous reviewers. Specifically, the NPM2 results don't seem to add much to the main story (MagIC-cryo-EM) and read more like an addendum. The authors could probably publish the NPM2 results separately, which would make the core MagIC results (sans DusTER) easier to read.</p>

<p>The authors have addressed my concerns. Congratulations!</p>

<p>Still, I feel that there are certain limitations and potential artifacts resulting from formaldehyde fixation, use of bacterial-expressed recombinant H1.8-GFP, and potential effects of magnetic beads and/or spacer on protein structure, that should be more explicitly discussed.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the significance of our methods and for constructive comments. To respond to the reviewer's criticism, we revised the “Limitation of the study” section (page 12, line 420) as indicated by the underlines below.</p>
<p>“While MagIC-cryo-EM is envisioned as a versatile approach suitable for various biomolecules from diverse sources, including cultured cells and tissues, it has thus far been tested only with H1.8-bound nucleosome and H1.8-bound NPM2, both using antiGFP nanobodies to isolate GFP-tagged H1.8 from chromosomes assembled in Xenopus egg extracts after pre-fractionation of chromatin. To apply MagIC-cryo-EM for the other targets, the following factors must be considered: 1) Pre-fractionation. This step (e.g., density gradient or gel filtration) may be necessary to enrich the target protein in a specific complex from other diverse forms (such as monomeric forms, subcomplexes, and protein aggregates). 2) Avoiding bead aggregation. Beads may be clustered by targets (if the target complex contains multiple affinity tags or is aggregated), nonspecific binders, and the target capture modules. To directly apply antibodies that recognize the native targets and specific modifications, optimization to avoid bead aggregation will be important. 3) Stabilizing complexes. The target complexes must be stable during the sample preparation. Crosslink was necessary for the H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosome. 4) Loading the optimum number of targets on the bead. The optimal number of particles per bead differs depending on target sizes, as larger targets are more likely to overlap. For H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes, 500 to 2,000 particles per bead were optimal. We expect that fewer particles should be coated for larger targets.”</p>
<p>We would like to note that while the use of bacterially expressed GFP-tagged H1.8 and MagIC-cryo-EM may potentially influence the structure of the H1.8-bound nucleosome, the structures of GFP-tagged H1.8-bound nucleosomes isolated from chromosomes assembled in Xenopus egg extract are essentially identical to the endogenous H1.8bound nucleosome structure we previously determined. In addition, we have shown that GFP-H1.8 was able to replace the function of endogenous H1.8 to support the proper mitotic chromosome length (Fig. S3), which is based on the capacity of H1.8 to compete with condensin as we have previously demonstrated (PMID 34406118). Therefore, we believe that the effects of GFP-tagging to be minimal. This point incorporated into the main result section (page 6, line 215) to read as “The structures of GFP-tagged H1.8bound nucleosomes isolated from Xenopus egg extract chromosomes are essentially identical to the endogenous H1.8-bound nucleosome structure we previously determined. Therefore, although the usage of GFP-tagged H1.8 and MagIC-cryo-EM potentially influence the structure of the H1.8-bound nucleosome, we consider these influences to be minimal.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, the GFP-pulled down H1.8 nucleosomes should be better characterized biochemically to determine the actual linker DNA lengths (which are known to have a strong effect of linker histone affinity) and presence or absence of other factors such as HMG proteins that may compete with linker histones and cause the multiplicity of nucleosome structural classes (such as shown on Fig. 3F) for which the association with H1.8 is uncertain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We addressed the concerns brought by the reviewer as following:</p>
<p>(1) DNA length</p>
<p>As the reviewer correctly pointed out, linker DNA length is critical for linker histone binding, and conventional ChIP protocols often result in DNA over-digestion to lengths of 140–150 bp. To minimize DNA over-digestion and structural damage, we have optimized a gentle chromosomal nucleosome purification protocol that enabled the cryoEM analysis of chromosomal nucleosomes (PMID: 34478647). This protocol involves DNA digestion with a minimal amount of MNase at 4ºC, producing nucleosomal DNA fragments of 180–200 bp. Additionally, before each chromatin extraction, we performed small-scale MNase assays to ensure that the DNA lengths consistently fell within the 180–200 bp range (Fig. S4B). These DNA lengths are sufficient for linker histone H1 binding, in agreement with previous findings indicating that &gt;170 bp is adequate for linker histone association (PMID: 26212454).</p>
<p>This information has been incorporated into the main text and Methods section;</p>
<p>On page 5, line 178, the sentence was added to read, “To prevent dissociation of H1.8 from nucleosomes during DNA fragmentation, the MNase concentration and the reaction time were optimized to generate DNA fragment lengths with 180–200 bp (Fig. S4B), which is adequate for linker histone association (PMID 26212454).”</p>
<p>On page 32, line 1192, the sentence was added to read, “To digest chromatin, MNase concentration and reaction time were tested on a small scale and optimized to the condition that produces 180-200 bp DNA fragments.”</p>
<p>(2) Co-associated proteins with H1-GFP nucleosome.</p>
<p>We now include mass spectrometry (MS) data for the proteins in the sucrose density gradient fraction 5 used for MagIC-cryo-EM analysis of GFP-H1.8-bound chromatin proteins as well as MS of proteins isolated with the corresponding MagIC-cryo-EM beads (Table S2 and updated Table S5). As the reviewer expected, HMG proteins (hmga2.L and hmga2.S in Table S2) were present in interphase sucrose gradient fraction 5, but their levels were less than 2% of H1.8. Accordingly, none of the known chromatin proteins besides histones and the nucleoplasmin were detected by MS in the GFP-nanobody MagIC-cryo-EM beads, including the FACT complex and PCNA, whose levels in the sucrose fraction were comparable to H1.8 (Table S2), suggesting that our MagIC-cryo-EM analysis was not meaningfully affected by HMG proteins and other chromatin proteins. Consistent with our interpretation, the structural features of H1.8bound nucleosomes isolated from interphase and metaphase chromosomes were essentially identical.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for constructive comments. We regret to realize that the last portion of the result section, where we have described a detailed analysis of NPM2 structures, was erroneously omitted from the submission due to MS Word's formatting error. We hope that the inclusion of this section will justify the inclusion of the NPM2 analysis. Specifically, we decided to include NPM2 structures to demonstrate that our method successfully determined the structure that had never been reported. Conformational changes in the NPM family have been proposed in previous studies using techniques such as NMR, negative stain EM, and simulations, and these changes are thought to play a critical role in regulating NPM function (PMID: 25772360, 36220893, 38571760), but there has been a confusion in the literature, for example, on the substrate binding site and on whether NPM2 recognizes the substrate as a pentamer or decamer. Despite their low resolution, our new cryo-EM structures of NPM2 suggest that NPM2 recognizes the substrate as a pentamer, identifies potential substrate-binding sites, and indicates the mechanisms underlying NPM2 conformational changes. We believe that publishing these results will provide valuable insights into the NPM research field and help guide and inspire further investigations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Arimura et al report a new method, termed MagIC-Cryo-EM, which refers to the method of using magnetic beads to capture specific proteins out of a lysate via, followed immunoprecipitation and deposition on EM grids. The so-enriched proteins can be analzyed structurally. Importantly, the nanoparticles are further functionalized with protein-based spacers, to avoid a distorted halo around the particles. This is a very elegant approach and allows the resolution of the stucture of small amounts of native proteins at atomistic resolution.</p>
<p>Here, the authors apply this method to study the chromatosome formation from nucleosomes and the oocyte-specific linker histone H1.8. This allows them to resolve H1.8-containing chromatomosomes from oocyte extract in both interphase and metaphase conditions at 4.3 A resolution, which reveal a common structure with H1 placed right at the dyad and contacting both entry-and exit linker DNA.</p>
<p>They then investigate the origin of H1.8 loss during interphase. They identify a nonnucleosomal H1.8-containing complex from interphase preparations. To resolve its structure, the authors develop a protocol (DuSTER) to exclude particles with ambiguous center, revealing particles with five-fold symmetry, that matches the chaperone NPM2. MS and WB confirms that the protein is present in interphase samples but not metaphase. The authors further separate two isoforms, an open and closed form that coexist. Additional densities in the open form suggest that this might be bound H1.8.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Together this is an important addition to the suite of cryoEM methods, with broad applications. The authors demonstrate the method using interesting applications, showing that the methods work and they can get high resolution structures from nucleosomes in complex with H1 from native environments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The structures of the NPM2 chaperone is less well resolved, and some of the interpretation in this part seems only weakly justified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the significance of our methods and for constructive comments. We regret to realize that the last portion of the result section where we have described detailed analysis of NPM2 structures was erroneously omitted from the submission due to the MS word's formatting error. We hope that inclusion of this section will justify the inclusion of NPM2 analysis. Specifically, we agree that our NPM2 structures are low-resolution and that our interpretations may be revised as higher-resolution structures become available, although we believe that publishing these results will provide valuable insights into the NPM research field and also will illustrate the power of MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER. To respond to this criticism, the revised manuscript now clearly describes the limitations of our NPM2 structures while highlighting the key insights. In page 12 line 452, the sentence was added to read, “While DuSTER enables the structural analysis of NPM2 co-isolated with H1.8-GFP, the resulting map quality is modest, and the reported numerical resolution may be overestimated. Furthermore, only partial density for H1.8 is observed. Although structural analysis of small proteins is inherently challenging, it is possible that halo-like scattering further hinder high-resolution structural determination by reducing the S/N ratio. More detailed structural analyses of the NPM2-substrate complex will be addressed in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) To assess the advantage provided by the new technique for imaging of isolated pure or enriched fractions of native chromatin, the nucleosome structure analysis should be matched by a proper biochemical characterization of the isolated nucleosomes. Nucleosome DNA size is known to greatly affect linker histone affinity and additional proteins like HMG may compete with linker histone for binding. SDS-PAGE of the sucrose gradient fractions (Fig. 3E) shows many nonhistone proteins where H1-GFP appears to be a minor component. However, the gradient fractions contain both bound and unbound proteins. I would suggest that a larger-scale pull-down using the same GFP antibodies and streptavidin beads should be conducted and the captured nucleosome DNA and proteins characterized.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We addressed the concerns brought by the reviewer as following:</p>
<p>(1) DNA length</p>
<p>As the reviewer correctly pointed out, linker DNA length is critical for linker histone binding, and conventional ChIP protocols often result in DNA over-digestion to lengths of 140–150 bp. To minimize DNA over-digestion and structural damage, we have optimized a gentle chromosomal nucleosome purification protocol that enabled the cryoEM analysis of chromosomal nucleosomes (PMID: 34478647). This protocol involves DNA digestion with a minimal amount of MNase at 4ºC, producing nucleosomal DNA fragments of 180–200 bp. Additionally, before each chromatin extraction, we performed small-scale MNase assays to ensure that the DNA lengths consistently fell within the 180–200 bp range (Fig. S4B). These DNA lengths are sufficient for linker histone H1 binding, in agreement with previous findings indicating that &gt;170 bp is adequate for linker histone association (PMID: 26212454).</p>
<p>This information has been incorporated into the main text and Methods section.</p>
<p>On page 5, line 178, the sentence was added to read, “To prevent dissociation of H1.8 from nucleosomes during DNA fragmentation, the MNase concentration and the reaction time were optimized to generate DNA fragment lengths with 180–200 bp (Fig. S4B), which is adequate for linker histone association (PMID 26212454).”</p>
<p>On page 32, line 1192, the sentence was added to read, “To digest chromatin, MNase concentration and reaction time were tested on a small scale and optimized to the condition that produces 180-200 bp DNA fragments.”</p>
<p>(2) Co-associated proteins with H1-GFP nucleosome.</p>
<p>We now include mass spectrometry (MS) data for the proteins in the sucrose density gradient fraction 5 used for MagIC-cryo-EM analysis of GFP-H1.8-bound chromatin proteins as well as MS of proteins isolated with the corresponding MagIC-cryo-EM beads (Table S2 and updated Table S5). As the reviewer expected, HMG proteins (hmga2.L and hmga2.S in Table S2) were present in interphase sucrose gradient fraction 5, but their levels were less than 2% of H1.8. Accordingly, none of known chromatin proteins besides histones and the nucleoplasmin were detected by MS in the GFP-nanobody MagIC-cryo-EM beads, including the FACT complex and PCNA, whose levels in the sucrose fraction were comparable to H1.8 (Table S2), suggesting that our MagIC-cryo-EM analysis was not meaningfully affected by HMG proteins and other chromatin proteins. Consistent with our interpretation, the structural features of H1.8bound nucleosomes isolated from interphase and metaphase chromosomes were essentially identical.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) A similar pull-down analysis with quantitation of NPM2 and GFP (in addition to analysis of sucrose gradient fractions) should be conducted to show whether the immune-selected particles do indeed contains a stoichiometric complex of H1.8 with NPM2.</p>

<p>Proteins isolated using MagIC-cryo-EM beads were identified through mass spectrometry (Fig. 4D). The MS signal suggests that the molar ratio of NPM2 is higher than that of H1.8 or sfGFP. This observation is consistent with the idea that an NPM2 pentamer can bind between one and five H1.8-GFP molecules.</p>

<p>(3) The use of recombinant, bacterial produced H1.8- GFP and just one type of antibodies (GFP) are certain limitations of this work. These limitations as well as future steps needed to use antibodies specific for native antigens, such as histone variants and epigenetic modifications should be discussed.</p>

<p>We clarified these points in the “Limitation of the study” section (page 12, line 420). The revised sections are indicated by the underlines below.</p>
<p>“While MagIC-cryo-EM is envisioned as a versatile approach suitable for various biomolecules from diverse sources, including cultured cells and tissues, it has thus far been tested only with H1.8-bound nucleosome and H1.8-bound NPM2, both using antiGFP nanobodies to isolate GFP-tagged H1.8 from chromosomes assembled in</p>
<p>Xenopus egg extracts after pre-fractionation of chromatin. To apply MagIC-cryo-EM for the other targets, the following factors must be considered: 1) Pre-fractionation. This step (e.g., density gradient or gel filtration) may be necessary to enrich the target protein in a specific complex from other diverse forms (such as monomeric forms, subcomplexes, and protein aggregates). 2) Avoiding bead aggregation. Beads may be clustered by targets (if the target complex contains multiple affinity tags or is aggregated), nonspecific binders, and the target capture modules. To directly apply antibodies that recognize the native targets and specific modifications, optimization to avoid bead aggregation will be important. 3) Stabilizing complexes. The target complexes must be stable during the sample preparation. Crosslink was necessary for the H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosome. 4) Loading the optimum number of targets on the bead. The optimal number of particles per bead differs depending on target sizes, as larger targets are more likely to overlap. For H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes, 500 to 2,000 particles per bead were optimal. We expect that fewer particles should be coated for larger targets.”</p>

<p>In theory, the preferred orientation bias should be reduced in MagIC-cryo-EM, as particles are submerged, and the bias is thought to arise from particle accumulation at the air-water interface.

<p>As depicted in Fig. 3A, we previously identified the preferential binding of H1.8 to metaphase nucleosomes (PMID: 34478647). In this study, to obtain sufficient H1.8bound nucleosomes for MagIC-cryo-EM, we used 2.5 times more starting material for interphase samples compared to M-phase samples. This discrepancy complicates the comparison of H1-GFP binding ratios in western blots. However, in GelCode<sup>TM</sup> Blue staining (Fig. S4A), where both H1-GFP and histone bands are visible, the preferential binding of H1.8 to metaphase nucleosomes can be observed (See fractions 11 in interphase and metaphase).</p>

<p>We have revised the text to address the challenges involved in the structural characterization of native chromatin-associated protein complexes.

</disp-quote>
<p>In our original attempt to analyze nucleosome structures assembled in Xenopus egg extracts without MagIC-cryo-EM, we were not able to detect the density confidently assigned to H1.8 in interphase chromatin samples. To avoid potential confusion, the revised text reads, “We were able to resolve the 3D structure of the H1.8-bound nucleosome isolated from metaphase chromosomes but not from interphase chromosomes(3). The resolved structure indicated that H1.8 in metaphase is most stably bound to the nucleosome at the on-dyad position, in which H1 interacts with both the entry and exit linker DNAs(21–24). This stable H1 association to the nucleosome in metaphase likely reflects its role in controlling the size and the shape of mitotic chromosomes through limiting chromatin accessibility of condensins(25), but it remains unclear why H1.8 binding to the nucleosome in interphase is less stable. Since the low abundance of H1.8-bound nucleosomes in interphase chromatin might have prevented us from determining their structure, we sought to solve this issue by enriching H1.8bound nucleoprotein complexes through adapting ChIP-based methods.”</p>

<p>P6 - What was the rationale to focus on particles with 60 - 80Å dimensions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We observed that 60–80 Å particles were captured by MagIC-cryo-EM beads, as numerous particles of this size were clearly visible in the motion-corrected micrographs surrounding the beads. To clarify this, we revised the sentence to read: 'Topaz successfully picked most of the 60–80 Å particles visible in the motion-corrected micrographs and enriched around the MagIC-cryo-EM beads (Figure S6A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>P7 - Please explain a technical detail about DuSTER: do independent runs of Topaz picks give particle centers than differ by up to ~40Å or is it that 2D classification gives particle centers that differ by up to ~40Å? Is it possible to distinguish these two possibilities by initializing CryoSPARC on two independent 2D classification jobs on the same set of Topaz picks?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Due to the small particle size of NPM2, the former type is predominantly generated when Topaz fails to pick the particles reproducibly. The first cycle of DuSTER removes both former-type particles (irreproducibly picked particles) and latter-type particles (irreproducibly centered particles), while subsequent cycles specifically target and remove the latter type. We have added the following sentence to clarify this (page 7, line 249). The revised sections are indicated by underlines below: “To assess the reproducibility of the particle recentering during 2D classification, two independent particle pickings were conducted by Topaz so that each particle on the grid has up to two picked points (Figure 4A, second left panel). Some particles that only have one picked point will be removed in a later step. These picked points were independently subjected to 2D classification. After recentering the picked points by 2D classification, distances (<italic>D</italic>) between recentered points from the first picking process and other recentered points from the second picking process were measured. DuSTER keeps recentered points whose <italic>D</italic> are shorter than a threshold distance (<italic>D<sub>TH</sub></italic>). By setting <italic>D<sub>TH</sub></italic> = 20 Å, 2D classification results were dramatically improved in this sample; a five-petal flower-shaped 2D class was reconstructed (Figure 4B). This step also removes the particles that only have one picked point.“</p>

In addition, the NPM2 surface that is in direct contact with the putative H1.8 density is accessible in the open form while it is internalized in the closed form (Figure 5C). This structural change of NPM2 may support more rigid binding of H1.8 to the open NPM2, whereas H1.8 binding to the closed form is less stable and likely occurs through interactions with the C-terminal A2 and A3 tracts, which are not visible in our cryo-EM structures.</p>

As the size of the NPM2-H1.8 complex estimated from sucrose gradient elution volume is consistent with pentameric NPM2 binding to a single H1.8 (Figure 3C and Table S3), applying C5 symmetry during structural reconstruction likely blurred the density of the monomeric H1.8 that binds to the NPM2 pentamer. The structural determination of NPM2-H1.8 without applying C5 symmetry lowered the overall resolution but visualized multiple structural variants of the NPM2 protomer with different degrees of openness coexisting within a NPM2-H1.8 complex (Figure S14), raising a possibility that opening of a portion of the NPM2 pentamer may affect modes of H1.8 binding.

<p>We agree that our NPM2 structures are low-resolution and that our interpretations may be revised as higher-resolution structures become available, although we believe that publishing these results will provide valuable insights into the NPM research field and also will illustrate the power of MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER. Conformational changes in the NPM family have been proposed in previous studies using techniques such as NMR, negative stain EM, and simulations, and these changes are thought to play a critical role in regulating NPM function (PMID: 25772360, 36220893, 38571760), but there has been a confusion in the literature, for example, on the substrate binding site and on whether NPM2 recognizes the substrate as a pentamer or decamer. Despite their low resolution, our new cryo-EM structures of NPM2 suggest that NPM2 recognizes the substrate as a pentamer, identify potential substrate-binding sites, and indicate the mechanisms underlying NPM2 conformational changes. We believe that publishing these results will provide valuable insights into the NPM research field and help guide and inspire further investigations.</p>
<p>To respond to this criticism, we have revised the manuscript to clearly describe the limitations of our NPM2 structures while highlighting the key insights. On page 12, line 452, the sentence was added to read, “While DuSTER enables the structural analysis of NPM2 co-isolated with H1.8-GFP, the resulting map quality is modest, and the reported numerical resolution may be overestimated. Furthermore, only partial density for H1.8 is observed. Although structural analysis of small proteins is inherently challenging, it is possible that halo-like scattering further hinders high-resolution structural determination by reducing the S/N ratio. More detailed structural analyses of the NPM2-substrate complex will be addressed in future studies.”</p>
