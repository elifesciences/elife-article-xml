<title>Abstract</title><p>Cell crowding is a common microenvironmental factor that affects various disease processes, but its impact on cell invasiveness into surrounding tissues is not well understood. This study investigates the biomechanical changes induced by cell crowding, focusing on pro-invasive cell volume reduction in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells. DCIS is a non-invasive form of breast cancer characterized by abnormal cell growth confined within the breast duct. While DCIS can undergo invasive transition, it is unclear which DCIS cells are predisposed to this transition. We discovered that cell crowding enhanced the invasiveness of high-grade DCIS cells, which experienced significant cell volume reduction compared to hyperplasia-mimicking or normal cells. Mass spectrometry analyses revealed that cell crowding relocated ion channels, including TRPV4, a calcium-permeant ion channel, to the plasma membrane selectively in high-grade DCIS cells but not in less aggressive or normal cells. Cell crowding inhibited TRPV4 activity in high-grade DCIS cells, decreasing intracellular calcium levels and reducing cell volume. This inhibition also triggered the relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane, effectively priming the inactive channel for activation and mitigating the calcium loss caused by crowding-induced inhibition. Analyses of patient-derived breast cancer tissues validated that TRPV4 is selectively associated with the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS but not in lower-grade DCIS or less aggressive pathologies. The extent of plasma membrane TRPV4 association scaled with cell volume reduction and increased cell invasiveness and motility, suggesting its utility as an active pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway indicator. Additionally, hyperosmotic conditions and pharmacologic TRPV4 inhibition mimicked the pro-invasive volume reduction observed under cell crowding, while TRPV4 activation reversed this effect by inducing cell volume increase. Silencing the TRPV4 gene via shRNA diminished the mechanotransduction capability of high-grade DCIS cells, as demonstrated by reduced intracellular calcium depletion, attenuated cell volume reduction, and decreased motility. In summary, this study uncovers a previously unrecognized pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway initiated by cell crowding, which is specific to high-grade DCIS cells, revealing a potential biomarker for identifying DCIS patients at high risk of invasive transition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The complex interplay between cellular mechanics and invasive behaviors is crucial to understanding various physiological and pathological processes, such as wound healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Numerous studies show that these processes are mediated by mechanotransduction, whereby cells translate mechanical stimuli into cellular activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. While mechanotransduction is traditionally studied concerning fluid stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, matrix stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, and other biomechanical changes such as osmotic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, the role of cell crowding, characterized by increased cell density and spatial constraints, is relatively less explored. A recent report shows that cell crowding plays a role in facilitating wound closure and repair by enhancing cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. As tissues develop, repair, or undergo pathological transformation, cell crowding becomes common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. This challenges individual cells, forcing them to perceive and respond to the mechanical constraints of a crowded environment. Our study used human breast cell line model systems to describe a novel mechanotransduction pathway triggered by cell crowding that induces invasiveness into surrounding tissues. Interestingly, this pathway exhibited unique selectivity, as it specifically associated with a type of non-invasive cancer pathology and was not present in lower-grade or less aggressive pathologies. This suggests that not all cells possess the ability to translate mechanical stimuli, such as cell crowding, into cell invasiveness.</p>
<p>To assess the role of cell crowding in cell invasiveness, we chose in vitro cell lines linked to different pathological states that reflect cell crowding conditions in vivo, including atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. ADH is an intraductal clonal epithelial cell proliferative lesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and represents an intermediate step between normal breast tissue and in situ carcinomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. ADH is associated with high risk as it is reported that an ADH diagnosis is associated with a five-fold increased risk of breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. DCIS is non-invasive form of cancer characterized by proliferating malignant epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Unlike ADH, DCIS is considered a precursor to invasive breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism of how DCIS transitions to invasive cancer is not well understood and therefore, there is currently no reliable and robust method to differentiate which DCIS cells are at high risk of becoming invasive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Both ADH and DCIS conditions can potentially expose cells to crowding in vivo. However, how ADH and DCIS cells respond to such changes in cell density remains unknown. Our study revealed that cell crowding selectively triggered a pro-invasive mechanotransduction program in a specific type of DCIS cell line associated with high-grade comedo-type pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The mechanotransduction program induced by cell crowding involved the inhibition of ion channels, such as transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, a calcium-permeable ion channel, as identified from our mass spectrometry assay. This inhibition prompted the relocation of TRPV4 and other ion channels to the plasma membrane, leading to decreased intracellular calcium levels, subsequent induction of reduced cell volume and cortical stiffening, thereby promoting cell invasiveness and motility.</p>

<title>Cell Crowding Enhances Invasiveness in High-Grade DCIS Cells</title>
<p>Cell crowding reflects a common condition in tumor microenvironments for ADH and DCIS, arising from aberrant cell proliferation within spatially constrained intraductal spaces. We examined the influence of this prevalent environmental factor on the invasiveness of these cells in vitro. To conduct this investigation, we assembled a panel of cell lines derived from the normal breast epithelial cell line MCF10A, including its H-RAS mutation-driven derivatives associated with various pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>: MCF10AT1, MCF10DCIS.com, and invasive cells MCF10CA1a. MCF10AT1 resembles ADH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, MCF10DCIS.com mimics high-grade DCIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, and MCF10CA1a represents a malignant invasive cancer that was observed to form metastatic lesions in a mouse xenograft<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The current classification of DCIS relies on histological factors such as cell growth patterns and cytonuclear features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Comedo-DCIS is a histologic subtype, which is characterized by apoptotic cell death, representing a high-grade DCIS with higher invasive potential than those of lower-grades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. MCF10DCIS.com forms comedo-type DCIS lesions that can spontaneously transition to invasive cancer when xenografted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To compare cell invasiveness under normal cell density and cell crowding conditions in vitro, we opted for a modified 2D matrix degradation assay. This approach allowed us to quantify overall cell invasiveness by normalizing it with the total cell number, thereby accounting for differences in cell densities. We chose this method over transwell, 3D Matrigel, or spheroid assays, where quantifying cell invasiveness as a function of cell density is challenging. By modifying an existing collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, we could determine the invasive cell fraction out of the total cell population by fluorescence imaging of the invasion gel bed and cell nuclei through a low magnification (4X) imaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; for a detailed procedure, see <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>) when cells were at normal density versus under cell crowding conditions.</p>

<caption><title>Cell crowding selectively increases invasiveness in high-grade DCIS cells.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> We used a collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay to assess the effect of cell crowding on invasiveness. Representative images show gelatin-Alexa488 conjugates, where dark areas indicate cell invasion through degradation (green; Gelatin488), and DAPI staining marks cell locations (blue; DAPI) in a two-day invasion assay of MCF10DCIS.com cells under normal density (ND; upper panel) and overconfluent (OC; lower panel) conditions. &quot;Masked&quot; images are thresholded to produce positive masks applied to the âDAPIâ images. Individual cell locations detected in âDAPIâ images are marked with purple circles in âDetected pointsâ images. The total number of cells within the field of view is counted from these points. By overlaying the mask and DAPI images, âMasked DAPIâ images are obtained, and invaded cells are detected and represented by purple circles in âMasked pointsâ images. The invasive cell fraction is calculated by the ratio of the number of invaded cells to the total number of cells (0.24 for ND and 0.59 for OC MCF10DCIS.com cells). These data show that cell invasiveness is enhanced by cell crowding. Scale bar = 100 Î¼m. <bold>(B)</bold> Comparison of âGelatin488â images of MCF10A (normal breast epithelial cells), MCF10AT1 (ADH-mimicking cells), MCF10DCIS.com (high-grade DCIS mimic), and MCF10CA1a (invasive breast cancer cells) between ND and OC conditions. MCF10DCIS.com cell invasion is significantly higher under cell crowding than under ND conditions. <bold>(C)</bold> Invasive cell fractions of these cells between ND (blue circles) and OC (red circles) conditions are compared, showing that cell crowding-induced increases in invasiveness are notable only in MCF10DCIS.com cells. We used the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, a nonparametric and unpaired statistical method, to compare differences between groups. ****: p &lt; 0.0001, ***: p &lt; 0.001, **: p &lt; 0.01, *: p &lt; 0.05, ns: p &gt; 0.05, throughout the manuscript.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>We observed alterations in live cell morphology and invasiveness as they progressed from normal density (ND: 40-70%) to full confluence (100%) and beyond. Our goal was to determine a distinct time window, termed overconfluence (OC), where cell crowding-induced changes level off. The OC time window was achieved as cells cultured for an additional 5-10 days after reaching 100% confluence, with the growth medium replaced twice per day to prevent acidification. We confirmed that the cells remained largely viable under crowding conditions, with minimal cell death (â¼1.58%) similar to that observed in ND cells (â¼0.85%). (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2A-B</xref>). The schematic of the timeline to achieve the OC conditions, and low-magnification (4X) bright-field images at different time points from the ND to OC conditions are shown in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 3A-B</xref>. The time-dependent equilibration of cell invasiveness after the cells reached confluence is demonstrated in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 3C-D</xref> using our quantifiable collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay. Cell crowding mechanosensing significantly increased the invasive cell fraction of MCF10DCIS.com cells from â¼24% (ND cells) to 59% (OC cells). The enhanced invasiveness of MCF10DCIS.com cells under cell crowding was largely reversible. When OC cells were reseeded at normal density for invasion assays, their invasive cell fraction decreased to approximately 15%, slightly lower (p = 0.012) than the initial value of around 24% (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 3C, 3E</xref>). In contrast, other cell types such as normal breast epithelial cells MCF10A and MCF10AT1, which mimic ADH conditions in vivo, did not display invasiveness in ND conditions or enhanced invasiveness in OC conditions, suggesting insensitivity to cell crowding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>).</p>
<p>The invasive cell fraction of ND MCF10CA1a cells was already â¼80%, and the additional increase in invasiveness due to cell crowding was not readily discernible, with a slight increase to â¼82% under crowded conditions. These data suggest a striking and selective mechanosensing effect of cell crowding on cell invasiveness in MCF10DCIS.com cells. To ensure that acidification did not affect the invasiveness of MCF10DCIS.com cells despite the frequent replacement of the cell growth medium, we incubated ND cells for two days with acidified medium from cultures of OC MCF10DCIS.com cells. We observed that medium acidity did not alter cell invasiveness (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 3F</xref>), reinforcing that the increased invasiveness under OC conditions was induced by cell crowding.</p>

<title>Cell crowding reduces cell volume and stiffens MCF10DCIS.com cells</title>
<p>As cells became crowded, we observed a reduction in cell size. Previous reports indicate an inverse relationship between cell volume and cortical stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, leading us to hypothesize that reduced cell volume would be accompanied by increased cortical stiffness. Research on glioma cell invasion underscores the critical role of hydrodynamic cell volume changes in penetration into surroundings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, suggesting that significant cell volume reduction facilitates cell invasion. Additionally, increased cortical stiffness is known to help cells overcome the physical barriers of the dense extracellular matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We thus investigated whether cell crowding selectively induces pro-invasive cell volume reduction and cell stiffening in MCF10DCIS.com cells, thereby priming them for invasion.</p>
<p>To measure the cell volume of individual cells, we used confocal microscopy with a 60X oil immersion objective to obtain z-stack images of live or fixed cells stably expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Using a nanoindenter attached to the confocal microscope (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4A</xref>), we extracted Youngâs modulus of live individual cells to assess changes in cortical stiffness. Cell crowding significantly reduced cell volume (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>) and increased cortical stiffness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) in both MCF10DCIS.com and MCF10A cells. However, the changes in volume and stiffness between ND and OC conditions were more pronounced in MCF10DCIS.com cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4B, C</xref>). The cell crowding-induced alterations in cell volume and stiffness were negligible in MCF10AT1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). In MCF10CA1a cells, cell crowding led to an increase in stiffness, but a decrease in volume was not evident. This was expected because the cell volume was already too small to be accurately measured with the available resolution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). The notable plasticity in cell volume and stiffness changes observed in MCF10DCIS.com cells in response to cell crowding potentially underscores the critical link between this plasticity and mechanosensitive increases in cell invasiveness. We assessed cell volume changes only as an effector event of cell crowding, without measuring cell stiffness, because cell volume reflects the mechanical properties of the entire cell, while Youngâs modulus can vary depending on the location of indentations in the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The observed cell volume changes by cell crowding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) depended on the ND cell volume, as OC cell volumes under crowding conditions were comparable across all cells. Consequently, the ND cell volume and the volume changes from ND to OC conditions exhibited an approximately linear relationship (<italic>R</italic>Â² â¼ 0.97; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4D</xref>). This finding suggests that the ND cell volume could serve as an indicator of relative cell volume plasticity.</p>

<p>To validate the pro-invasive nature of cell volume reduction in MCF10DCIS.com cells, we examined the effect of hyperosmotic cell volume reduction in ND cells using polyethylene glycol (PEG) 300 for 15 minutes. The cell volume reduction effects of this treatment were previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. PEG 300 effectively reduced ND MCF10DCIS.com cell volume in a dose-dependent manner, showing a greater reduction with 148.8 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 than with 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). To assess the impact of PEG-induced cell volume reduction on cell invasiveness, we used collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay and exposed cells to 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 for 2 days. While treatment with 148.8 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 significantly reduced cell viability, cells treated with 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 remained viable for 2 days. Monitoring changes in cell invasiveness revealed that exposure of ND MCF10DCIS.com cells to 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 increased cell invasiveness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), confirming the causal relationship between cell volume reduction and increased cell invasiveness.</p>

<title>Cell crowding induces TRPV4 relocation to plasma membrane in MCF10DCIS.com cells</title>
<p>Cell volume regulation typically depends on osmotic gradients that direct the movement of water across cell membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. This process is facilitated by ion flux modulation, which is controlled by ion channels and ion transporters located on the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Notably, cells capable of achieving minimal cell volumes have been shown to successfully invade neighboring tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Based on this, we speculated that the high cell volume plasticity observed in MCF10DCIS.com cells underlies their ability to penetrate the surrounding tissues. To achieve such efficient cell volume changes, cell crowding-induced mechanotransduction in MCF10DCIS.com cells may involve modulation of the number of ion channels or transporters on the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>To compare the plasma membrane-associated proteins between ND and OC conditions, we employed mass spectrometry and profiled those proteins using the streptavidin-pulled surface-biotinylated cell lysates. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> shows the relative protein densities on the plasma membrane under ND (blue bars) and OC (red bars) conditions in MCF10DCIS.com cells. The figure highlights the top 25 proteins that exhibit over a 5-fold increase in expression on the plasma membrane in the OC condition compared to the ND condition (triangle plots). The gene names of these 25 proteins are presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Suppl. Table 1</xref> provides the corresponding protein names along with the corresponding fold increases). Notably, TRPV4, a member of the transient receptor potential family of ion channels known for its mechanosensitive properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, showed a remarkable 153-fold increase in plasma membrane association in response to cell crowding, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>. Additionally, we observed an increase in plasma membrane association of other ion channels, such as SCN11A (the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.9) with â¼42-fold enrichment, and KCNN4 (the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel 3 SK3) showing â¼6-fold increase, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>. To evaluate the relative plasma membrane association of proteins under OC versus ND conditions, we performed a comparable mass spectrometry analysis of cell-surface biotinylated cell lysates for MCF10A, MCF10AT1, and MCF10CA1a cells. The top 25 gene/protein names showing increased plasma membrane associations in these cells are listed in <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Suppl. Table 2</xref>. Unlike in MCF10DCIS.com cases, there was no cell-crowding-induced relocation of ion channels and ion transporters to the plasma membrane in MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells. However, in MCF10CA1a cells, ion transporters such as ATP2B4 showed a â¼37-fold greater plasma membrane association under crowding conditions. This suggests that plasma membrane relocations of these ion channels and ion transporters in response to cell crowding selectively occurred in MCF10DCIS.com cells and, to an extent, in invasive ductal cancer MCF10CA1a cells.</p>

<p>TRPV4 plays a pivotal role in facilitating the passage of calcium ions (Ca2+) and is integral in detecting various forms of mechanical stresses, including temperature fluctuations and osmotic pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Activation of TRPV4 channels elevates intracellular calcium levels, leading to cell volume increase via osmotic water influx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Nav1.9 primarily contributes to the generation and propagation of action potentials in sensory neurons and is associated with various pain disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. SK3 channels are activated by elevated intracellular calcium levels and serve diverse physiological functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. However, unlike TRPV4, Nav1.9 and SK3 channels are not generally classified as mechanosensors. Consequently, we focused on TRPV4, the mechanosensor channel displaying the most significant increase in the plasma membrane association under cell crowding conditions, to further investigate its role in promoting pro-invasive cell volume reduction in MCF10DCIS.com cells.</p>
<p>To confirm the selective plasma membrane association of TRPV4 in OC MCF10DCIS.com cells suggested by mass spectrometry results, we conducted immunoblots on surface-biotinylated lysates from all four cell types under both conditions. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 5A</xref> showed a notable association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane in OC MCF10DCIS.com cells, which was significantly lower in ND cells. This association was not observed in MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells under any conditions. Interestingly, in MCF10CA1a cells, TRPV4 associated with the plasma membrane under both conditions, with a slight increase in OC conditions. This increase suggests that these cells may also possess mechanosensing abilities, enabling them to respond to cell crowding. Additionally, immunoblots from whole-cell lysates showed consistent TRPV4 expression levels across different cell types and densities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 5B</xref>), indicating that cell crowding influences ion channel trafficking without altering overall expression. This evidence strongly suggests that the relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane is a mechanosensitive response to cell crowding.</p>
<p>To investigate the redistribution of TRPV4 in response to cell crowding, we performed IF imaging with confocal microscopy across all four cell types under both ND and OC conditions. The binding specificity of the TRPV4 antibody was confirmed through IF imaging (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 6A</xref>) and immunoblotting (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 6B</xref>) of MCF10DCIS.com cells treated with TRPV4 shRNA. As expected from the mass spectrometry results, TRPV4 (red) showed only modest localization to the plasma membrane in ND MCF10DCIS.com cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). In contrast, it was prominently associated with the plasma membrane in OC MCF10DCIS.com cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). In MCF10CA1a cells, TRPV4 was also associated with plasma membrane under ND conditions, but cell crowding also increased the association significantly as shown in MCF10DCIS.com cells. Plasma membrane associations were verified using the plasma membrane marker DiIC18(3), which we previously used to visualize the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. IF images showed that TRPV4 successfully colocalized with DiIC18(3) in OC MCF10DCIS.com and OC MCF10CA1a cells (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 7A</xref>). However, the non-interacting protein transferrin receptor (TfR; green) remained similarly distributed in the OC cells compared to the ND cells, indicating that the protein trafficking changes induced by cell crowding are specific to TRPV4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether other ion channels identified through mass spectrometry and a well-known mechanosensory channel PIEZO1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, exhibit similar behavior, we conducted IF imaging on ND and OC MCF10DCIS.com cells targeting KCNN4 and PIEZO1. Unfortunately, due to the absence of specific antibodies, we were unable to examine SCN11. In ND MCF10DCIS.com cells, KCNN4 was observed to be mostly cytosolic, while PIEZO1 was mildly but slightly more associated with the plasma membrane than TRPV4 under ND conditions. However, under OC conditions, both PIEZO1 and KCNN4 also relocated to the plasma membrane, albeit to a lesser extent than TRPV4 (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 7B</xref>). The varying degrees of plasma membrane association of PIEZO1 and KCNN4 are quantified using line analysis, as summarized in <bold>Supple. </bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>.</p>
<p>As expected, in ND MCF10A, MCF10AT1, and MCF10DCIS.com cells, TRPV4 was modestly present at the plasma membrane but was predominantly intracellular, with notable enrichment in the nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). However, in OC MCF10DCIS.com cells, approximately 80% of TRPV4 was located in the plasma membrane based on line analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). In contrast, in OC MCF10A and OC MCF10AT1 cells, TRPV4 remained mostly cytosolic but migrated out of the nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane was observed in both ND and OC MCF10CA1a cells, with an observable increase under OC conditions, further confirming the immunoprecipitation results shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>. Plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 was quantified using line analysis and plotted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>. Refer to <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 8A</xref> for plots of the relative TRPV4 associations with the plasma membrane, cytosol, and nucleus between ND and OC conditions in all four cell types. These IF imaging results underscore the mechanosensitive plasma membrane relocation of ion channels in MCF10DCIS.com, and to an extent, in MCF10CA1a cells, contrasting with the observed insensitivity of MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells to cell crowding.</p>
<p>To assess the relationship between cell crowding-induced cell volume reduction and plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, we investigated whether hyperosmotic conditions, which reduce cell volume without cell crowding, would also result in TRPV4 relocation. We subjected ND cells to the same PEG 300 condition (74.4 mOsm/kg PEG for 15 minutes) used in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> to induce cell volume reduction. In ND MCF10DCIS.com cells, such hyperosmotic cell volume reduction prompted significant plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, a response not observed in MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells, but seen in MCF10CA1a cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Quantitative line analysis confirmed these findings by assessing the relative TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 8B</xref> for plots of the relative TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane, cytosol, or nucleus). We confirmed that the seeming plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 under the hyperosmotic condition was indeed localized at the plasma membrane by using an extracellular domain antibody against TRPV4 in live MCF10DCIS.com cells, both untreated and treated with 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300. As expected, significant antibody binding was observed only in PEG 300-treated cells, where intracellular TRPV4 had relocated to the plasma membrane unlike in untreated live cells (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 9A-B</xref>). This finding underscores the relationship between mechanosensitive cell volume reduction and plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, highlighting that both cell crowding and hyperosmotic stress lead to the same effect, particularly pronounced in MCF10DCIS.com cells.</p>
<p>We investigated whether TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane induced by cell crowding is reversible, as suggested by its impact on invasiveness (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 3F</xref>). To test this, previously OC MCF10DCIS.com cells were reseeded under ND conditions. We then assessed TRPV4 localization via immunofluorescence (IF) imaging to determine if most channels returned to the cytoplasm with only a modest localization at the plasma membrane, and could be relocated to the plasma membrane under mechanical stress, such as hyperosmotic conditions. Consistent with their initial ND state, reseeded ND MCF10DCIS.com cells displayed intracellular TRPV4 distribution (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 10A</xref>). Upon exposure to hyperosmotic stress (74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG300), TRPV4 was again relocated to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 10B</xref>). These findings, quantified through line analysis (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 10C</xref>), demonstrate that the mechanosensing response of MCF10DCIS.com cells is reversible.</p>

<title>Patient tissue analysis shows selective plasma membrane association of TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells</title>
<p>MCF10DCIS.com cells represent a basal cell model for high-grade DCIS cells driven by HRAS mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. However, the majority of patient-derived DCIS cells originate from the luminal cell population and lack the HRAS mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Moreover, there are limited options for patient-derived DCIS cell line models that have not linked to well-defined pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Thus, to seek generality of our finding about the selective association between plasma membrane relocation and high-grade DCIS pathology, we examined 39 breast cancer patient tissue blocks to assess the selectivity in vivo. We designed an early-stage retrospective study by selecting various breast tissue pathologies that range from benign to invasive cancer. Those pathologies include usual ductal hyperplasia, papilloma, columnar changes, ADH, low-to high-grade DCIS, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). We also incorporated normal regions for comparison. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to visualize tissue sections from each patient, excluding samples with prior cancer diagnoses or drug treatments. In total, 97 regions of interest (ROIs) from H&amp;E-stained sections of 39 patient tissue blocks were selected. Two pathologists independently assessed TRPV4 distribution patterns at the single-cell level in corresponding ROIs in the immunohistochemistry (IHC) images (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). A detailed methodology is described in the Methods section and more example images are shown in <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 11</xref>. High-grade DCIS cells, as depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>, clearly demonstrated plasma membrane-associated TRPV4, a feature absent in lower-grade DCIS cells (intermediate-and low-grade). This distinction sets them apart not only from cells with ADH and benign pathologies but also from lower-grade DCIS cells. As demonstrated by the IF images in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> for MCF10CA1a (invasive cell mimic), IDC cells exhibited notable plasma membrane TRPV4, suggesting that they possess a similar pro-invasive mechanotransduction capability to high-grade DCIS cells.</p>
<p>We found that the sensitivity and specificity for plasma membrane TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells were 0.75 Â± 0.19 (15/20) and 0.98 Â± 0.03 (61/62) respectively (95% confidence interval) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). It is important to note that the specificity calculation excluded IDC cases. Notably, even in less aggressive pathologies, a significant amount of TRPV4 was localized in the nuclei, as shown for MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells in the IF images in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>. This underscores our interpretation from the in vitro results in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref> that increased plasma membrane association of TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells results from changes in protein localization through trafficking alterations, rather than differences in expression levels. These initial in vivo results clearly demonstrate the selective and specific association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS cells. Notably, this association is absent in lower-grade DCIS, ADH, benign, and normal cells, thereby confirming our in vitro findings using MCF10A cell derivatives. These results suggest a potentially critical role for TRPV4 in the progression of high-grade DCIS.</p>

<title>Cell crowding inhibits ion channels and triggers their plasma membrane relocations</title>
<p>A calcium-permeant ion channel like TRPV4 is known to influence intracellular calcium dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. While activation of TRPV4 typically elevates calcium levels and this potentially increases cell volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, the impact of its inhibition is less clear, given the multifaceted nature of calcium signaling in cell volume control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. This complexity is compounded by compensatory cellular mechanisms and the involvement of other ion channels in response to altered calcium homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Considering these factors, we hypothesized that cell crowding might inhibit calcium-permeant ion channels that are constitutively active at the plasma membrane, including TRPV4, which would then lower intracellular calcium levels and subsequently reduce cell volume via osmotic water movement. To test this, we employed the Fluo-4 calcium assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> to compare relative intracellular calcium levels of MCF10DCIS.com cells between ND and confluent (Con) conditions through 4X confocal microscopy imaging with 488 nm excitation. For this calcium assay, we opted for confluent conditions instead of OC conditions to collect the Fluo-4 signal from confluent monolayers of MCF10DCIS cells, which demonstrates comparable cell-crowding induced TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 12A</xref>) as observed in the OC condition. This choice was made because more than one layer of cells was occasionally observed in OC conditions, which would yield overestimation of crowding-dependent intracellular calcium levels. The intracellular Fluo-4 signal under Con conditions was significantly lower than that under ND conditions, as shown in the fluorescence images of ND versus Con cells in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>. Time-dependent Fluo-4 images were acquired over 25 minutes. For ND cell images, the average Fluo-4 intensity values were calculated from 10-15 selected cells (highlighted in the white box in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). For Con cell images, intensity values were derived from all cells within the entire 50 Î¼m by 50 Î¼m field of view, as depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>. After background subtraction, the intensity values were plotted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>. The temporal Fluo-4 intensity profiles from both ND and Con cells remained largely constant over the measured 20-minute period. However, Con cells exhibited significantly lower Fluo-4 intensity compared to ND cells, indicating reduced intracellular calcium levels. Lower Fluo-4 intensity in Con cells than in ND cells was not due to limited Fluo-4 reagent in Con samples. Within cell clusters, cells experiencing crowding exhibited notably lower Fluo-4 levels compared to those at the periphery (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 12B</xref>), suggesting that cell crowding had resulted in a decrease in intracellular calcium levels, likely due to the mechanosensitive inhibition of calcium-permeable channels like TRPV4.</p>

GSK101 treatment also leads to a dose-dependent increase in the spike magnitude with higher GSK101 concentrations (0.05 pM: 101L; 0.2 pM: 101H), which is strikingly high in Con MCF10DCIS.com cells. <bold>(N-Q)</bold> TRPV4 activation status-dependent intracellular localization changes. <bold>(N)</bold> IF images of TRPV4 (red) and TfR (green) in ND MCF10DCIS.com cells show that GSK101 does not increase plasma membrane association of TRPV4.

Additionally, cell crowding conditions (Con) led to a decreased Fluo-4 level (at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> baseline in the image in <bold>S</bold> and red time trace in <bold>T</bold>) and a reduction in Fluo-4 level in shRNA-treated MCF10DCIS.com cells (<italic>t</italic>1; <bold>U</bold>) compared to control cases (S, T), as shown in the image and time trace (<italic>t</italic>1; V). <bold>(W)</bold> Relative Fluo-4 time-averaged intensities are plotted for individual control ND (blue) vs. Con (red) cells, and shRNA-treated ND (semi-transparent blue) vs. Con (semi-transparent red) cells.

<p>To investigate whether TRPV4 inhibition was involved in decreased intracellular calcium levels and subsequent relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane, we employed TRPV4-specific pharmacological agents to alter TRPV4 activity and modulate calcium concentrations in ND MCF10DCIS.com cells without applying cell crowding conditions. To inhibit TRPV4 activity, we used TRPV4 inhibitor (GSK2193874; GSK219)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> at 0.2 and 1 nM, which we confirmed to have insignificant effects on cell viability in both ND and OC conditions for two days (<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 13A</xref>). GSK219 treatments immediately caused a modest dip in the Fluo-4 signal, or intracellular calcium level, followed by a recovery, indicating cellular homeostatic activity. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> shows Fluo-4 images taken before and at the signal dip after applying 1 nM GSK219, where the dip in the Fluo-4 signal is not visually apparent. However, the temporal profile of Fluo-4 intensity in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, which corresponds to the time points marked in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> (<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>: baseline and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>: dip), clearly shows the dip at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>, indicated by ÎCa (the vertical dashed line between the dip and baseline). This modest Fluo-4 dip at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> represents the inhibition of activity by GSK219 on a small population of constitutively active TRPV4 channels at the plasma membrane under ND conditions.</p>
<p>In Con cells, 1 nM GSK219 caused a smaller dip in Fluo-4 intensity compared to the one observed in ND cells, with no subsequent changes. This is likely due to fewer constitutively active TRPV4 at the plasma membrane in Con cells than in ND cells. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref> shows Fluo-4 images at the baseline and the dip, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref> presents the temporal Fluo-4 intensity profile, highlighting the two time points. Indeed, the dip in Fluo-4 intensity induced by GSK219 was smaller for Con MCF10DCIS.com cells (mean ÎCa â¼ -39 Â± 9) than for ND cells (mean ÎCa â¼ -49 Â± 18), as illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>. The dose-dependent (0.2 nM and 1 nM GSK219, labeled 219L and 219H) and cell density-dependent (ND and Con) Fluo-4 signal dips are summarized by the ÎCa values plotted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>, showing that the most significant TRPV4 inhibition occurred in ND MCF10DCIS.com cells treated with 1 nM GSK219. These findings suggest that a substantial portion of TRPV4 channels relocated to the plasma membrane under cell crowding was inactive, and some constitutively activeTRPV4 channels already present in the membrane became inactive as a result of cell crowding.</p>
<p>Administering a TRPV4 activator (GSK1016790A; GSK101)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> immediately caused a notably greater spike in Fluo-4 signal in Con cells than in ND cells, evidencing that a large number of TRPV4 channels at the plasma membrane were inactive in Con cells. In Con cells, 0.2 pM GSK101 led to a large Fluo-4 signal spike with ÎCa â¼ +2,348 Â± 597, while in ND cells, ÎCa was just â¼ +324 Â± 130. This difference is depicted in the Fluo-4 images (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref> for ND and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref> for Con) and the time-dependent Fluo-4 intensity plots (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref> for ND and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref> for Con). The dose (101L and 101H representing 0.05 pM and 0.2 pM GSK101) and cell-density (ND and Con) dependent Fluo-4 signal spikes are summarized in the ÎCa values, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>. The results show the significant GSK101 dose-responsive activation of previously inactive TRPV4 in Con MCF10DCIS.com cells, confirming that a large number of inactive TRPV4 channels at the plasma membrane were primed for activation in Con cell.</p>
<p>Based on the differing effects of GSK219 and GSK101 on immediate intracellular calcium responses, along with lower calcium levels in Con cells compared to ND cells, we hypothesized that cell crowding induces TRPV4 inhibition, leading to reduced intracellular calcium levels, which in turn triggers the relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane as a compensatory mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we examined TRPV4 localization changes in response to GSK219 or GSK101 in a dose-dependent manner in both ND and OC MCF10DCIS.com cells using IF imaging (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref> for higher GSK101/219 concentrations; <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 13B</xref> for both concentrations). Indeed, treating ND cells with the TRPV4 inhibitor GSK219 for 1 hour resulted in significant dose-dependent TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane (â¼53 Â± 7% at 0.2 nM and â¼62 Â± 7% at 1 nM), compared to control ND cells (â¼15 Â± 6%), as shown by line analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4P</xref>). These results indicate that TRPV4 inhibition induces its strategic relocation to the plasma membrane, priming it for rapid activation to counteract the effects of channel inhibition.</p>
<p>Confirming our observation of moderate Fluo-4 spikes induced by GSK101 in ND MCF10DCIS.com cells, which implies a small number of constitutively active TRPV4 channels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>), the plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 levels in ND cells remained largely unchanged following GSK101 treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N, 4P</xref>). However, in Con cells, where a large number of inactive TRPV4 channels are likely located at the plasma membrane, GSK101 treatment notably reduced plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 in a dose-dependent manner through internalization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O, 4Q</xref>), consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. These data suggest that plasma membrane TRPV4 levels were largely regulated by the channel activity status. Specifically, channel activation led to the internalization of TRPV4, while channel inhibition promoted the relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane. This relationship was approximately linear as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4R</xref>, where the intracellular calcium differences compared to that of ND cells were negatively associated with plasma membrane fraction of TRPV4 (<italic>R</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> â¼ 0.69).</p>
<p>Contrary to our expectation, GSK219 treatment in Con cells slightly reduced TRPV4 levels at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O, 4Q</xref>). Moreover, higher doses of GSK219 increased nuclear TRPV4 levels in Con cells without affecting cytoplasmic levels (<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 13B</xref>). These findings suggest that further TRPV4 inhibition under crowding conditions triggers a distinct trafficking alteration. Recent studies have implicated nuclear TRPV4 in regulating nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. In light of this study and our findings, TRPV4 may relocate to the nucleus as a compensatory mechanism to maintain nuclear calcium regulation. This relocation could reflect an adaptive response to preserve calcium-dependent transcriptional programs or other nuclear processes essential for cell survival under mechanical stress.</p>
<p>Given the role of TRPV4 in osmoregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> and its significant relocation to the plasma membrane under hyperosmotic conditions (â¼55% plasma membrane association by line analysis; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, <bold>4P</bold>) in ND MCF10DCIS.com cells (â¼15% plasma membrane association by line analysis), we explored the potential involvement of TRPV4 inhibition during this relocation. Using the Fluo-4 assay, we observed an initial calcium spike following 74.4 mOsm/kg PEG 300 in ND MCF10DCIS.com cells due to osmotic water outflow, which was followed by a homeostatic relaxation aimed at restoring calcium levels (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 14A</xref>). This relaxation likely involved the inhibition of ion channels like TRPV4 and other ion transporters, followed by their relocations to the plasma membrane. Indeed, we confirmed the relocation of other ion channels that responded to cell crowding, including KCNN4 and PIEZO1, to the plasma membrane following the same PEG 300 treatment (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 14B</xref> for IF images and line analysis results). The data suggest that the increased association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane under hyperosmotic stress may reflect an adaptive inhibition response to water outflow.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of TRPV4 in mechanotransduction, we used shRNA to silence TRPV4 gene expression, resulting in a â¼50% reduction in TRPV4 protein levels (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 6B</xref>). We then assessed the effects of TRPV4 silencing on intracellular calcium levels in ND and Con conditions, as well as the immediate calcium response to hyperosmotic stress induced by 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300. In ND cells, hyperosmotic stress triggered a significant calcium spike, as shown in the Fluo-4 image (middle; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4S</xref>) and time trace (blue; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4T</xref>). In contrast, TRPV4 silencing in ND cells led to a lower intracellular calcium level (left; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4U</xref>) and a reduced calcium spike in response to hyperosmotic stress (middle; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4U</xref>, and semi-transparent blue; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4V</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of TRPV4 silencing on intracellular calcium levels was less pronounced in Con cells (semi-transparent red; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4V</xref>) compared to the ND counterpart (semi-transparent blue; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4V</xref>). The relative intracellular calcium levels are summarized in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4W</xref>.</p>
<p>Notably, TRPV4 silencing significantly reduced the immediate calcium spike as summarized in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4X</xref>. This calcium spike was attributed to increased calcium concentration due to hyperosmotically reduced cell volume (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 14A</xref>). Thus, TRPV4 may play a critical role in mechanotransduction, enabling cells to sufficiently reduce their volume in response to mechanical stress (large volume plasticity). To further investigate this, we examined the effect of TRPV4 silencing on ND MCF10DCIS.com cell volume reduction in response to hyperosmotic stress. We indeed found that control ND cells underwent a 48% volume reduction in response to 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300, whereas TRPV4-silenced cells only reduced their volume by 27% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Y</xref>). Notably, this reduced cell volume reduction in TRPV4-silenced cells is consistent with the idea that cell volume reduction-induced increased calcium concentration contributes to the calcium spike, reinforcing the concept that TRPV4 augments the ability of cells to mechanotransduce.</p>

<title>Cell crowding-induced inactive TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane indicates channel inhibition-mediated volume reduction and enhanced invasiveness and motility</title>
<p>To elucidate the relationships between TRPV4 inhibition, cell volume reduction, and invasiveness increase under cell crowding, we investigated the effects of TRPV4 inhibitors on these processes. We examined the effects of 2-day treatments with GSK101 and GSK219 on the cell volumes of ND and OC MCF10DCIS.com cells. This duration was chosen to correlate the treatments with changes in cell volume and invasiveness, as observed in response to cell crowding Under ND conditions, activating TRPV4 with GSK101 (0.05 or 0.2 pM for 2 days), which led to only modest calcium spikes and largely unaltered TRPV4 distribution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref>; <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 13B</xref>), did not significantly change cell volume (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Conversely, TRPV4 inhibition by GSK219 treatment (1 nM for 2 days) that induced greater calcium changes (dips rather than spikes) and a significant plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, led to a noticeable cell volume reduction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). 0.2 nM GSK219 treatment had a negligible impact on ND cell volume (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).

<p>Under OC conditions, GSK101 triggered significant, dose-dependent calcium spikes, leading to corresponding increases in cell volume (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In contrast, GSK219 had a minimal impact on intracellular calcium levels and did not alter TRPV4 distribution at the plasma membrane, resulting in a slight reduction in cell volume at 1 nM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Similarly, PEG 300 induced a small change in cell volume, comparable to the 1 nM GSK219 treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). As expected, we observed a significant negative linear correlation between plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 (% PM TRPV4) and cell volume (<italic>R</italic>Â² â¼ 0.59) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). These findings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-B</xref>) demonstrate that increased TRPV4 inhibition and subsequent intracellular calcium reduction in response to cell crowding are associated with decreased cell volume in MCF10DCIS.com cells.</p>
<p>We investigated the connections between TRPV4 activity, plasma membrane association, cell volume changes, and cell invasiveness. Using a collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay, we evaluated changes in invasiveness after 2-day treatments with GSK101 or GSK219. In ND MCF10DCIS.com cells, 0.2 pM GSK101 mildly suppressed cell invasiveness, while 0.05 pM GSK101 had no effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). In contrast, GSK219 increased the invasive cell fraction in a dose-dependent manner under ND conditions, mirroring changes in Fluo-4 signals and plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Under OC conditions, GSK101 increased cell volume and suppressed cell invasiveness dose-dependently (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Conversely, GSK219 and PEG 300, which slightly reduced cell volume, increased cell invasiveness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Representative invasion images are shown in Suppl. Fig. 15A. These results establish a clear relationship between TRPV4 activity, plasma membrane-associated TRPV4, cell volume, and cell invasiveness. Notably, we observed a significant positive linear correlation between plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 and cell invasiveness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>; <italic>R</italic>Â² â¼ 0.69) and a negative association between cell volume and cell invasiveness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>; <italic>R</italic>Â² â¼ 0.89).</p>
<p>Cell invasiveness refers to the ability of cells to penetrate and move within their surrounding tissues or environments. As expected from the increased cortical stiffness of OC MCF10DCIS.com cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), we observed that OC MCF10DCIS.com cells underwent cytoskeletal rearrangements, including the increased formation of stress fibers (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 15B</xref>), which likely enhanced cell motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. To assess how TRPV4 inhibition and activation, which reduced and increased cell volume, respectively, affected the motility of ND MCF10DCIS.com cells and the role of these motility changes on cell invasiveness, we conducted single-cell tracking experiments similar to single molecule tracking methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. We utilized wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) as a nuclear marker, which stained the cell nucleus within 1 hour of incubation with cells. We then analyzed the diffusivity (<italic>D</italic>) and directionality (<italic>v</italic>) of single cell movements. We tracked overall single-cell trajectories for 3 hr with 1 min intervals, marking cell displacement over each interval in different colors, ranging from navy for the slowest to red for the fastest (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Consistent with the trend in cell invasiveness, TRPV4 activation with 1 pM GSK101 significantly reduced single-cell movements, while inhibition with 0.2 nM GSK219 and 74.4 mOsm/kg PEG 300 notably increased these movements. Using the single-cell motility assay, we assessed TRPV4âs role in increasing cell invasiveness through a mechanotransduction mechanism involving cell-volume reduction. Reducing TRPV4 expression (â¼50%) via shRNA diminished the cell volume reduction effect of mechanosensing. We predicted that shRNA would also attenuate the increased cell motility effect of mechanosensing in MCF10DCIS.com cells. Indeed, while shRNA (sh-ctrl; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H, 5I</xref>) did not alter MCF10DCIS.com cell motility, it disabled mechanotransduction capability of the cells as there was no increase in <italic>D</italic> and <italic>v</italic> induced by hyperosmotic stress using 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300 (sh-PEG; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H, 5I</xref>). This result reinforces the critical role of TRPV4 in increasing cell invasiveness through mechanosensing activity inhibition-induced cell volume reduction.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while GSK219 and hyperosmotic conditions promoted increased cell movement (<italic>D</italic>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>), they also reduced cell directionality (<italic>v</italic>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). This reduction in directionality suggests that while the cells become more mobile, their movements are less targeted, potentially indicating a more random or exploratory behavior under mechanical stress. Remarkably, cell movement increased in proportion to the amount of TRPV4 at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref>; <italic>R</italic>Â² â¼ 0.73) and decreased with increased cell volume (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>; <italic>R</italic>Â² â¼ 0.89). Cell movement and invasiveness showed a strong linear correlation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>; <italic>R</italic>Â² â¼ 0.85), suggesting that these behaviors are governed by the same underlying mechanisms. Thus, our motility assay can inform cell invasiveness at the single-cell level.</p>

<title>Mechanosensitive TRPV4 relocation to plasma membrane indicates enhanced invasiveness</title>
<p>We investigated whether the mechanosensitive relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane can reliably predict a cellâs ability to undergo pro-invasive mechanosensitive cell volume reduction. To achieve this, we used changes in cell motility as markers for overall shifts in cell invasiveness, given the strong correlation observed between cell motility and invasiveness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>). Our hypothesis is that cells with such mechanotransduction capability, like MCF10DCIS.com cells, should show increased plasma membrane association of TRPV4 when inhibited with GSK219 or under hyperosmotic conditions, evidenced by increased cell motility (<italic>D</italic>) while demonstrating the opposite effect with GSK101 treatment.</p>

<p>MCF10CA1a cells showed plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4 in response to TRPV4 inhibition (1 nM GSK219; ND 219H), PEG 300 (74.4 mOsm/kg; ND PEG300), and OC conditions. In contrast, treatment with 0.2 pM GSK101 did not affect TRPV4 plasma membrane association (<xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, showing IF images for TRPV4 (red) and DAPI (cyan)). This response was similar to that observed in MCF10DCIS.com cells under OC conditions. The plasma membrane associations of TRPV4 were quantified by line analysis, showing an increase under mechanical stresses (PEG and OC) and TRPV4 inhibition with GSK219, as plotted in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>. As expected, based on the differences in plasma membrane TRPV4 association, MCF10CA1a cells exhibited increased motility (<italic>D</italic>) in response to TRPV4 inhibition (GSK219) and hyperosmotic conditions (PEG). Additionally, their movement became more directional (<italic>v</italic>) with TRPV4 activation (GSK101), similar to the observations in MCF10DCIS.com cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I, 5J</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the negative control MCF10AT1 cells did not exhibit TRPV4 inhibition-dependent plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, as shown by IF images (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 14</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>) and line analysis results (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). In these cells, TRPV4 inhibition (GSK219) decreased diffusivity (<italic>D</italic>), while PEG 300 had no effect. Moreover, movement directionality (<italic>v</italic>) remained unchanged under all treatment conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>The three test group cells, MDA-MB-231 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G, 6H</xref>), ETCC-06 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J, 6K</xref>), and ETCC-10 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6M, 6N</xref>), failed to relocate TRPV4 to the plasma membrane in response to mechanical stresses (PEG and OC), as shown by IF images and quantification. This suggests that these cells lack the pro-invasive mechanosensitive cell volume reduction capability observed in MCF10DCIS.com cells. Consistently, none of these cells showed increased motility (<italic>D</italic>) under hyperosmotic conditions or TRPV4 inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I, 6L, 6O</xref>).</p>
<p>We plotted these results to show cell diffusivity (<italic>D</italic>) scaling with varying plasma membrane associations of TRPV4, where MCF10DCIS.com (green hexagon) and MCF10CA1a (red hexagon) exhibited a positive scaling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6P</xref>). However, the changes in plasma membrane TRPV4 occurred over a narrower range (31 â 79%) for MCF10CA1a compared to MCF10DCIS.com cells (16 -75%), reflecting the larger mechanosensitive cell volume plasticity of MCF10DCIS.com cells. In contrast, MDA-MB-231, ETCC-6, and ETCC-10 cells did not show this scaling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6Q</xref>). Like MCF10AT1 cells, plasma membrane TRPV4 associations in these cells remained at similar percentages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6Q</xref>).</p>
<p>This dichotomy in the presence of a pro-invasive mechanotransduction program is evident in the plots of diffusivity (<italic>D</italic>) increase versus plasma membrane TRPV4 relocation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6R</xref>), where only MCF10CA1a and MCF10DCIS.com cells show a significant increase in both parameters. Furthermore, the relationship between plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 and <italic>D</italic> increase with GSK219 versus GSK101 can be used to assess the presence of a pro-invasive, mechanosensitive cell volume reduction program. Most non-mechanotransducing cells remained close to the baseline value of 1, while mechanotransducing cells showed a significant increase in <italic>D</italic> with GSK219 treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study explored how cell crowding, a common condition in diseases and development, impacts cell invasiveness. We employed novel assays to quantify cell invasion and single-cell motility in cells with breast tissue pathologies, including DCIS and ADH, which experience cell crowding due to abnormal proliferation in confined ducts. Our results revealed a novel mechanotransduction pathway activated by crowding in high-grade DCIS cells, establishing a direct link between crowding and invasiveness. This pathway highlights the intricate interplay between mechanical stimuli, ion channel activation, trafficking changes, cell volume reduction, stiffening, and invasiveness (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). It distinguishes high-grade DCIS cells from normal, hyperplastic, or lower-grade DCIS cells, supporting previous findings that minimal cell volume reduction enables efficient invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>

<caption><title>Cell crowding triggers the activation of a pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway in high-grade DCIS cells but not in less aggressive or normal cells.</title>
<p>This pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway involves cell volume reduction and cortical stiffening driven by ion channel inhibition. Ion channel inhibition leads to the relocation of ion channels to the plasma membrane (PM). Under ND conditions, ion channels are mainly cytoplasmic in both high-grade DCIS and less aggressive/normal cells. However, high-grade DCIS cells have a larger cell volume under ND conditions. Cell crowding induces ion channel inhibition, leading to decreased intracellular calcium and subsequent cell volume reduction, which correlates with increased invasiveness. In contrast, less aggressive and normal cells do not exhibit this response. The inset image shows that mechanosensitive plasma membrane relocation of ion channels (orange) scales with increased invasiveness due to the activation of the cell volume reduction mechanotransduction pathway, while the absence of relocation indicates no mechanosensitive invasive increase.</p></caption>

<p>The correlation between cell volume reduction and increased invasiveness highlights the specialized mechanotransduction abilities of high-grade DCIS cells. Using mass spectrometry, we identified TRPV4 as a crucial component of this pathway, providing insights into how non-invasive breast cancer cells may evolve into invasive phenotypes. By employing Fluo-4 assays and TRPV4 activators and inhibitors, we found that cell crowding triggered TRPV4 inhibition, leading to reduced intracellular calcium and subsequent cell volume reduction in MCF10DCIS.com cells. Notably, TRPV4 inhibition prompted its relocation to the plasma membrane, priming it for activation under suitable signaling conditions, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. TRPV4 inhibition by cell crowding increased invasiveness and motility, while TRPV4 activation had the opposite effect. Reducing TRPV4 protein expression by 50% via shRNA diminished the calcium decrease and volume reduction under mechanical stress, such as cell crowding and hyperosmotic conditions. Consequently, these cells did not exhibit increased motility under hyperosmotic conditions, demonstrating TRPV4âs critical role in pro-invasive cell mechanotransduction via cell volume reduction. Invasive MCF10CA1a cells also demonstrated the modest mechanotransduction capability. In contrast, other invasive breast cancer cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231 cells, exhibited opposing responses to TRPV4 inhibition and activation, highlighting the heterogeneity of TRPV4 roles in invasive cancer progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our discovery of the selective mechanotransduction pathway in high-grade DCIS cells was further validated by analyzing patient-derived breast cancer tissues. We found that TRPV4 was predominantly associated with the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS lesions, but not in lower-grade DCIS or less aggressive pathologies. This selective relocation reinforces TRPV4âs crucial role in the pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway unique to high-grade DCIS cells. The association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane may serve as a valuable biomarker for identifying high-grade DCIS lesions.</p>
<p>Our data indicate that ion channels beyond TRPV4 may contribute to pro-invasive mechanotransduction. Notably, SCN11A and KCNN4 showed increased plasma membrane association under cell crowding conditions, suggesting their roles in modulating ion flux and cell volume and thus contributing to the mechanotransduction response. Although Piezo1 is known to respond to mechanical stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, its lesser plasma membrane relocation compared to TRPV4 under cell crowding and hyperosmotic conditions suggests a lesser role in promoting invasiveness in this case. Further comparisons are needed to determine the dominant ion channel driving mechanotransduction in high-grade DCIS cells. However, it is evident that cell crowding-induced pro-invasive cell volume reduction pathway involves the coordinated action of multiple ion channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We made the intriguing discovery that hyperosmotic conditions, which reducedâ cell volume through osmotic water outflow, mimic the effects of cell crowding by inducing similar pro-invasive cell volume reduction. Treatment with hyperosmotic agents like PEG 300 led to TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane and increased cell invasiveness, highlighting TRPV4âs mechanosensing role in response to external mechanical stimuli. This suggests that the convergence of mechanical stresses, including cell crowding and hyperosmotic stress, is a crucial trigger for pro-invasive cell volume reduction pathways, leading to a unified mechanotransduction signaling cascade.</p>
<p>The studyâs insights have far-reaching implications, unlocking new research paths in cancer and biological sciences. By elucidating mechanosensitive responses to cell crowding, we can shed light on tissue development, wound healing, and physiological processes involving cell density changes. The parallels between cell crowding and hyperosmotic conditions in driving pro-invasive behaviors warrant further investigation into the intricate mechanisms of cytoskeleton reorganization, ion channel and transporter relocation, and enhanced cell invasiveness and motility. Importantly, our findings elucidate the mechanotransduction capability of high-grade DCIS cells that differentiate them from less aggressive cells. This understanding paves the way for developing diagnostic and prognostic strategies that leverage the selective intracellular localization patterns of TRPV4 and other mechanosensitive ion channels, ultimately guiding clinical decisions for patients with high-risk DCIS and other cancers.</p>

<title>Calcium reporter assay</title>
<p>This assay was completed using the Fluo-4 Directâ¢ Calcium Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher F10471), including the assay buffer (Thermo Fisher), 2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent (Thermo Fisher), and preweighed, water-soluble probenecid (Thermo Fisher P36400; 2.5 mM). The 2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent was first prepared by adding 10 mL of the Fluo-4 calcium assay buffer and 200 Î¼L of 250 mM probenecid to the desiccated calcium assay reagent at room temperature (21 Â°C). This mixture was then vortexed and allowed to sit for 15 minutes. While waiting for the 2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent to finish being prepared, the media from the well of a LabTek II Chambered Coverglass with Cover #1.5 Borosilicate Sterile 8-well plate (Thermo Fisher 155409) was removed and replaced with 200 Î¼L of complete media. Once the 2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent was fully prepared, 200 Î¼L of the reagent was added to the well with 200 Î¼L of complete media. The 8-well plate was then placed at 37 Â°C and 5% COâ for 30 minutes. Following 30 minutes at 37 Â°C and 5% COâ, the 8-well plate was removed from the incubator and placed at room temperature for 30 minutes. After incubation in the reagent for 30 minutes at room temperature, the 8-well plate was imaged using the confocal microscope with a 488 nm laser for 30 minutes with 30-second intervals between images and an exposure time of 200 ms. If the sample was treated, the sample was imaged for 35 minutes with 30-second intervals, with the treatment being added after 5 minutes had elapsed. Added treatments all had a final volume of 200 Î¼L and were composed of: 1 nM GSK 2 in 1:1 media:2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent, 0.2 nM GSK 2 in 1:1 media:2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent, 0.2 pM GSK 1 in 1:1 media:2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent, 1:1:1 water:media:2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent, and 0.3 Osm/L PEG 300 in 1:1 media:2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent.</p>

<title>Cell viability assay</title>
<p>MCF10DCIS.com cells were plated in a LabTek II 8-well Chambered Coverglass dish (Thermo Fisher 155409) at a seeding density of 10,000 cells per well. Once the cells in the well reached the desired number of days post-confluence, they were stained using Propidium Iodide Ready Flow Reagent (Thermo Fisher R37169). Specifically, 1 drop of propidium iodide (PI) was added to 500 ÂµL of cell growth medium per well and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature (22Â°C). After staining, the cells were washed twice with complete growth medium. Next, the cells were stained with 1 Âµg/mL WGA-488 (Thermo Fisher w11261) in complete growth medium for 15 minutes at 37Â°C in a 5% COâ atmosphere. Following the incubation with WGA-488, the cells were washed three times with complete growth medium and then incubated for 2 hours at 37Â°C in 5% COâ to allow WGA migration into the nuclei. Finally, the cells were imaged using confocal microscopy at 4X magnification, with laser excitation at 488 nm for WGA-488 and 560 nm for propidium iodide.</p>

<p><bold>(A-B)</bold> Live cells seeded at ND (â¼70%) (n=2) were cultured for 1 (n=4), 3 (n=4), 5 (n=8), 7 (n=8), and 10 (n=8) days post-confluence (denoted as &quot;d&quot;). Cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI, red) to mark dead cells, followed by WGA-488 (green) to label nuclei.

The percentage of dead cells, based on PI-positive signals, is presented in <bold>A</bold>. Both confluent (day 1 and day 3) and OC (day 5â10) MCF10DCIS.com cells showed similar viability to ND cells, with less than 1% cell death (0.85 Â± 0.25%). On average, the fraction of dead cells was 1.58 Â± 0.98%, confirming that cell crowding does not additionally induce cell death. Representative PI/WGA-488/merged images from days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 are shown in <bold>B.</bold> Scale bar = 100 Î¼m.

<caption><title>Time window for cell crowding conditions in vitro.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> MCF10DCIS.com cells were grown to: normal density (ND; 40%â70%), confluence (100%), and overconfluence (OC). The time points for these growth stages were two days before confluence (D-2) for ND, day 0 (D0) for confluence, and days 5â10 after confluence (D5) for OC.

<caption><title>Hyperosmotic stress also induces plasma membrane relocation of ion channels, similar to cell crowding.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Using the Fluo-4 assay, we observed an initial calcium spike (marked as &quot;Rise&quot;) in ND MCF10DCIS.com cells in response to 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300, due to osmotic water outflow. This was followed by a homeostatic relaxation, aimed at restoring calcium levels, which likely involved the inhibition of ion channels like TRPV4, leading to their plasma membrane relocation. Scale bars = 20 Î¼m. <bold>(B)</bold> The same hyperosmotic condition (74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300 for 15 min) led to the relocation of KCNN4 and PIEZO1 to the plasma membrane, similar to the relocations observed under OC conditions. Line analysis results showed the relative relocations of each channel in response to hyperosmotic (PEG) and cell crowding (OC) stresses, compared to ND conditions.</p></caption>

<p>The effects of 2 days of treatment with GSK101 (0.2 pM), GSK219 (1 nM), and PEG 300 (74.4 mOsm/kg) on cells under ND or OC conditions revealed differences in TRPV4 localization (red) in the immunofluorescence (IF) images (cyan: DAPI).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Bu et al examined the dynamics of TRPV4 channel in cell overcrowding in carcinoma conditions. They investigated how cell crowding (or high cell confluence) triggers a mechano-transduction pathway involving TRPV4 channels in high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells that leads to large cell volume reduction (or cell volume plasticity) and pro-invasive phenotype.</p>
<p>In vitro, this pathway is highly selective for highly malignant invasive cell lines derived from a normal breast epithelial cell line (MCF10CA) compared to the parent cell line, but not present in another triple-negative invasive breast epithelial cell line (MDA-MB-231). The authors convincingly showed that enhanced TRPV4 plasmamembrane localization correlates with high-grade DCIS cells in patient tissue samples. Specifically in invasive MCF10DCIS.com cells they showed that overcrowding or over-confluence leads to a decrease in cell volume and intracellular calcium levels. This condition also triggers the trafficking of TRPV4 channels from intracellular stores (nucleus and potentially endosomes), to the plasma membrane (PM). When these over-confluent cells are incubated with a TRPV4 activator, there is an acute and substantial influx of calcium, attesting the fact that there are high number of TRPV4 channels present on the PM. Long-term incubation of these over-confluent cells with the TRPV4 activator results in the internalization of the PM-localized TRPV4 channels.</p>
<p>In contrast, cells plated at lower confluence primarily have TRPV4 channels localized in the nucleus and cytosol. Long-term incubation of these cells at lower confluence with a TRPV4 inhibitor leads to the relocation of TRPV4 channels to the plasma membrane from intracellular stores and a subsequent reduction in cell volume. Similarly, incubation of these cells at low confluence with PEG 3000 (a hyperosmotic agent) promotes the trafficking of TRPV4 channels from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is elegantly designed and the findings are novel. Their findings on this mechano-transduction pathway involving TRPV4 channels, calcium homeostasis, cell volume plasticity, motility and invasiveness will have a great impact in the cancer field and potentially applicable to other fields as well. Experiments are well-planned and executed, and the data is convincing. Authors investigated TRVP4 dynamics using multiple different strategies- overcrowding, hyperosmotic stress, pharmacological and genetic means, and showed a good correlation between different phenomena.</p>
<p>All of my previous concerns have been addressed. The quality of the manuscript has improved significantly.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The metastasis poses a significant challenge in cancer treatment. During the transition from non-invasive cells to invasive metastasis cells, cancer cells usually experience mechanical stress due to a crowded cellular environment. The molecular mechanisms underlying mechanical signaling during this transition remain largely elusive. In this work, the authors utilize an in vitro cell culture system and advanced imaging techniques to investigate how non-invasive and invasive cells respond to cell crowding, respectively.</p>
<p>The results clearly show that pre-malignant cells exhibit a more pronounced reduction in cell volume and are more prone to spreading compared to non-invasive cells. Furthermore, the study identifies that TRPV4, a calcium channel, relocates to the plasma membrane both in vitro and in vivo (patient's samples). Activation and inhibition of TRPV4 channel can modulate the cell volume and cell mobility. These results unveil a novel mechanism of mechanical sensing in cancer cells, potentially offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention targeting cancer metastasis by modulating TRPV4 activity. This is a very comprehensive study, and the data presented in the paper are clear and convincing. The study represents a very important advance in our understanding of the mechanical biology of cancer.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Bu et al examined the dynamics of TRPV4 channel in cell overcrowding in carcinoma conditions. They investigated how cell crowding (or high cell confluence) triggers a mechano-transduction pathway involving TRPV4 channels in high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells that leads to large cell volume reduction (or cell volume plasticity) and proinvasive phenotype.</p>
<p>In vitro, this pathway is highly selective for highly malignant invasive cell lines derived from a normal breast epithelial cell line (MCF10CA) compared to the parent cell line, but not present in another triple-negative invasive breast epithelial cell line (MDA-MB-231). The authors convincingly showed that enhanced TRPV4 plasma membrane localization correlates with highgrade DCIS cells in patient tissue samples.</p>
<p>Specifically in invasive MCF10DCIS.com cells, they showed that overcrowding or overconfluence leads to a decrease in cell volume and intracellular calcium levels. This condition also triggers the trafficking of TRPV4 channels from intracellular stores (nucleus and potentially endosomes), to the plasma membrane (PM). When these over-confluent cells are incubated with a TRPV4 activator, there is an acute and substantial influx of calcium, attesting to the fact that there are a high number of TRPV4 channels present on the PM. Long-term incubation of these over-confluent cells with the TRPV4 activator results in the internalization of the PMlocalized TRPV4 channels.</p>
<p>In contrast, cells plated at lower confluence primarily have TRPV4 channels localized in the nucleus and cytosol. Long-term incubation of these cells at lower confluence with a TRPV4 inhibitor leads to the relocation of TRPV4 channels to the plasma membrane from intracellular stores and a subsequent reduction in cell volume. Similarly, incubation of these cells at low confluence with PEG 3000 (a hyperosmotic agent) promotes the trafficking of TRPV4 channels from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is elegantly designed and the findings are novel. Their findings on this mechanotransduction pathway involving TRPV4 channels, calcium homeostasis, cell volume plasticity, motility, and invasiveness will have a great impact in the cancer field and are potentially applicable to other fields as well. Experiments are well-planned and executed, and the data is convincing. The authors investigated TRVP4 dynamics using multiple different strategies- overcrowding, hyperosmotic stress, and pharmacological means, and showed a good correlation between different phenomena.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A major emphasis in the study is on pharmacological means to relate TRPV4 channel function to the phenotype. I believe the use of genetic means would greatly enhance the impact and provide compelling proof for the involvement of TRPV4 channels in the associated phenotype.</p>
<p>In this regard, I wonder if siRNA-mediated knockdown of TRPV4 in over-confluent cells (or knockout) would lead to an increase in cell volume and normalize the intracellular calcium levels back to normal, thus ultimately leading to a decrease in cell invasiveness.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the positive feedback regarding the design of our study and the novelty of our findings. We also acknowledge the valuable suggestion to complement our pharmacological approaches with genetic manipulation of TRPV4.</p>
<p>In response to the comment regarding siRNA-mediated knockdown or knockout of TRPV4, we fully agree that this would further substantiate our findings. In the revised manuscript, we implemented shRNA targeting TRPV4 to investigate its functional effects on intracellular calcium level changes, cell volume plasticity, and invasiveness phenotypes, assessed through singlecell motility assays under cell crowding or hyperosmotic stress. These results have been incorporated into the revised manuscript, and detailed descriptions of these findings are included below.</p>
<p>Using the shRNA approach that resulted in ~50% reduction of TRPV4 expression</p>
<p>(Supplementary Figure 6A and 6B show TRPV4 expression levels via IF and immunoblots, respectively), we examined the effect of reduced TRPV4 on intracellular calcium levels in MCF10DCIS.com cells under normal density (ND) and stress conditions (confluent; Con and hyperosmotic; PEG) using Fluo-4 AM imaging (Fig. 4S-X). We found that shRNA TRPV4 slightly decreased calcium levels in ND cells, likely due to fewer active calcium channels at the plasma membrane resulting from lower TRPV4 expression (as shown in the summary plot in Fig. 4W). With fewer active calcium channels, cells treated with shRNA TRPV4 exhibited less reduction in intracellular calcium levels under cell crowding conditions compared to control cells. Additionally, hyperosmotic stress using PEG 300 induced smaller calcium spikes in shRNA cells compared to the significant spike observed in control cells. This reduced calcium response to Con and hyperosmotic stress in shRNA cells was reflected in the decreased cell volume reduction by PEG 300 shown in Fig. 4Y. Consequently, shRNA-mediated TRPV4 reduction impaired cell volume plasticity in MCF10DCIS.com cells and abolished the pro-invasive mechanotransduction capability involving cell volume reduction, as evidenced by no increase in cell motility (both cell diffusivity and directionality) under hyperosmotic conditions (Fig. 5H-J). These findings demonstrate the critical role of TRPV4 in conferring pro-invasive</p>
<p>mechanotransduction capability to MCF10DCIS.com cells through cell volume reduction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The metastasis poses a significant challenge in cancer treatment. During the transition from non-invasive cells to invasive metastasis cells, cancer cells usually experience mechanical stress due to a crowded cellular environment. The molecular mechanisms underlying mechanical signaling during this transition remain largely elusive. In this work, the authors utilize an in vitro cell culture system and advanced imaging techniques to investigate how non-invasive and invasive cells respond to cell crowding, respectively.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The results clearly show that pre-malignant cells exhibit a more pronounced reduction in cell volume and are more prone to spreading compared to non-invasive cells. Furthermore, the study identifies that TRPV4, a calcium channel, relocates to the plasma membrane both in vitro and in vivo (patient samples). Activation and inhibition of the TRPV4 channel can modulate the cell volume and cell mobility. These results unveil a novel mechanism of mechanical sensing in cancer cells, potentially offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention targeting cancer metastasis by modulating TRPV4 activity. This is a very comprehensive study, and the data presented in the paper are clear and convincing. The study represents a very important advance in our understanding of the mechanical biology of cancer.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, I do think that there are several additional experiments that could strengthen the conclusions of this work. A critical limitation is the absence of genetic ablation of the TRPV4 gene to confirm its essential role in the response to cell crowding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are deeply grateful for the positive assessment of our study and its contribution to advancing our understanding of mechanical signaling in cancer progression. We also greatly appreciate the suggestion to incorporate genetic ablation experiments to further validate the role of TRPV4 in cell crowding responses.</p>
<p>As noted in our response to Reviewer #1, we employed an shRNA approach to investigate the functional effects of TRPV4 knockdown on intracellular calcium level changes, cell volume plasticity, and invasiveness phenotypes. We assessed these effects using Fluo-4 AM calcium assay, single-cell volume measurements, and single-cell motility assays under cell crowding or hyperosmotic stress. These results have been incorporated into the revised manuscript and are described in detail in our response to Reviewer #1's &quot;weaknesses&quot; comment.</p>
<p>Reducing TRPV4 expression levels by shRNA diminished mechanosensing intracellular calcium changes under cell crowding and hyperosmotic conditions using PEG 300 treatment. Furthermore, a significantly reduced cell volume plasticity was observed under hyperosmotic conditions in shRNA treated cells compared to control cells (Fig. 4S-X). This diminished mechanosensing capability abolished the pro-invasive mechanotransduction effect, as assessed by single cell motility under hyperosmotic conditions (Fig. 5H-J). These findings demonstrate the critical role of TRPV4 in conferring pro-invasive mechanotransduction capability to MCF10DCIS.com cells through cell volume reduction.</p>

<p>The way the results or discussion section is written. It was a little confusing for me to relate to some phenomena. For example, it is not clear how TRPV4 inhibition (due to overcrowding) leads to a decrease in intercellular calcium levels, especially when TRPV4 channels were intercellular (not on the PM) to begin with (in normal density (ND) conditions). Along the same lines, how GSK219 causes a dip in calcium levels in ND cells when TRPV4 channels are primarily intercellular (Figure 4E). If most of the TRPV4 channels that are translocated to the PM in response to cell crowding are in an inactive state, how do they confer enhanced cell volume plasticity relative to non-invasive cell lines?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for raising this important point. We fully agree with your concern and have significantly revised the manuscript to clarify this aspect. Specifically, we have emphasized that a modest level of TRPV4 channels are constitutively active at the plasma membrane in normal density (ND) cells. This is now discussed in detail in the context of Fig. 4:</p>
<p>Page 14: âConsidering these factors, we hypothesized that cell crowding might inhibit calcium-permeant ion channels that are constitutively active at the plasma membrane, including TRPV4, which would then lower intracellular calcium levels and subsequently reduce cell volume via osmotic water movement.â</p>
<p>Page 16-17: ââ¦ However, the temporal profile of Fluo-4 intensity in Fig. 4E, which corresponds to the time points marked in Fig. 4D (<italic>t<sub>1</sub></italic>: baseline and <italic>t<sub>2</sub></italic>: dip), clearly shows the dip at <italic>t<sub>2</sub></italic>, indicated by ÎCa (the vertical dashed line between the dip and baseline). This modest Fluo-4 dip at <italic>t<sub>2</sub></italic> represents the inhibition of activity by GSK219 on a small population of constitutively active TRPV4 channels at the plasma membrane under ND conditions.</p>
<p>In Con cells, 1 nM GSK219 caused a smaller dip in Fluo-4 intensity compared to the one observed in ND cells, with no subsequent changes. This is likely due to fewer constitutively active TRPV4 at the plasma membrane in Con cells than in ND cells. â¦These findings suggest that a substantial portion of TRPV4 channels relocated to the plasma membrane under cell crowding was inactive, and some constitutively active TRPV4 channels already present in the membrane became inactive as a result of cell crowding.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>'Internalization' might be a better word than 'uptake' in the following line in the results section</p>
<p>&quot;...activating TRPV4 under cell crowding conditions triggered channel uptake, indicating that TRPV4 trafficking depended on the channel's activation status.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for this suggestion. As recommended, we replaced âuptakeâ with internalizationâ on page 18:</p>
<p>âHowever, in Con cells, where a large number of inactive TRPV4 channels are likely located at the plasma membrane, GSK101 treatment notably reduced plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 in a dose-dependent manner through internalization (Fig. 4O, 4Q), consistent with previous findings65. These data suggest that plasma membrane TRPV4 levels were largely</p>
<p>regulated by the channel activity status. Specifically, channel activation led to the internalization of TRPV4, while channel inhibition promoted the relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane.â</p>
<p>1. Out of curiosity:</p>
<p>2. Is there any information on what the intercellular TRPV4 channels are doing in the cytosol and in the nucleus? Is there any role of intercellular calcium stores in the proposed pathway?</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate this insightful question. Although we were unable to find studies specifically exploring the roles of cytosolic TRPV4, a recent study (Reference 74) identified a role for nuclear TRPV4 in regulating calcium within the nucleus. We speculate that when TRPV4 activity is severely impaired, such as with additional TRPV4 inhibition under cell crowding conditions, some TRPV4 channels may be redirected to the nucleus. This redistribution could help maintain nuclear calcium homeostasis.</p>
<p>This discussion is included on page 18 of the manuscript:</p>
<p>âThese findings suggest that further TRPV4 inhibition under crowding conditions triggers a distinct trafficking alteration. Recent studies have implicated nuclear TRPV4 in regulating nuclear Ca2+ homeostasis and Ca2+-regulated transcription74. In light of this study and our findings, TRPV4 may relocate to the nucleus as a compensatory mechanism to maintain nuclear calcium regulation. This relocation could reflect an adaptive response to preserve calcium-dependent transcriptional programs or other nuclear processes essential for cell survival under mechanical stress.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>One recommendation is to add some explanation or some minor details for the convenience of the reader. For example:</p>
<p>At normal or lower confluence, cells show an acute large dip in intercellular calcium when an inhibitor is applied implying that there are a few TRPV4 channels on the PM and they are constitutively active.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for highlighting this important point and for the helpful suggestion to improve clarity. We have significantly revised the text associated with Fig. 4 to ensure this point is clear. Specifically, we have added the following explanation on page 16:</p>
<p>&quot;This modest Fluo-4 dip at t2 represents the inhibition of activity by GSK219 on a small population of constitutively active TRPV4 channels at the plasma membrane under ND conditions.&quot;</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Figure 1. The authors frequently change the medium to prevent acidification in overconfluent cultures. A cell viability assay should be performed to ensure that the over-confluent cells remain healthy and viable during the experiments. There are commercial kits that can be easily used to quantify the number of viable cells and the extent of cell toxicity. The number of viable cells would provide a more reliable basis for comparison between normal density and overconfluent conditions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for raising this important point. We have consistently observed that cell crowding does not induce significant cell death in MCF10DCIS.com cells. To address your recommendation, we performed a viability assay using propidium iodide (PI) to selectively stain dead cells and WGA-488 to stain all live cells. Cell death was quantified under normal density (ND) conditions and at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 days post-confluence.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that cells remain similarly viable post-confluence, with minimal cell death</p>
<p>(~1.5%) compared to ND cells (~0.75%). These findings are summarized in Supplementary Figure 2, demonstrating that over-confluent cultures remain healthy and viable during the experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 2. To determine whether the reduction in cell volume is reversible, over-confluent cells can be further diluted back to normal density. Additionally, the reversibility of TRPV4 channel trafficking to the plasma membrane should be assessed under these conditions in IF experiments and cell surface biotinylation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We reseeded the previously overcrowded (OC) cells at normal density and observed that their TRPV4 distribution predominantly returned to being intracellular, with only modest plasma membrane localization, as shown by line analysis (Supplementary Figure 10A-C, page 13). Furthermore, their invasiveness decreased to levels comparable to the original normal density (ND) cells (Supplementary Figure 3C and 3E, page 6). These results demonstrate the reversibility of TRPV4 trafficking changes and the increase in invasiveness under mechanical stress.</p>
<p>Page 6. &quot;The enhanced invasiveness of MCF10DCIS.com cells under cell crowding was largely reversible. When OC cells were reseeded at normal density for invasion assays, their invasive cell fraction decreased to approximately 15%, slightly lower (p = 0.012) than the initial value of around 24% (Suppl. Fig. 3C, 3E).&quot;</p>
<p>Page 13. âWe investigated whether TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane induced by cell crowding is reversible, as suggested by its impact on invasiveness (Suppl. Fig. 3E). To test this, previously OC MCF10DCIS.com cells were reseeded under ND conditions. We then assessed TRPV4 localization via immunofluorescence (IF) imaging to determine if most channels returned to the cytoplasm and could be relocated to the plasma membrane under mechanical stress, such as hyperosmotic conditions. Consistent with their initial ND state, reseeded ND MCF10DCIS.com cells displayed intracellular TRPV4 distribution (Suppl. Fig. 10A). Upon exposure to hyperosmotic stress (74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG300), TRPV4 was again relocated to the plasma membrane (Suppl. Fig. 10B). These findings, quantified through line analysis (Suppl. Fig. 10C), demonstrate that the mechanosensing response of MCF10DCIS.com cells is reversible.â</p>

<p>(3) Figure 3B. A control using intracellular proteins such as GAPDH or Tubulin is missing. Including this control would help exclude the possibility of cell rupture or compromised cell membranes in crowded environments, which is very common in a cell crowding environment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for pointing this out. The control lanes (GAPDH) were already included in the full gel results shown in Supplementary Figure 5. For the immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of surface-biotinylated cell lysates, we did not expect to detect GAPDH; however, some GAPDH signals were still observed. As shown for MCF10DCIS.com cells, less GAPDH was detected under OC conditions, but the immunoprecipitated samples displayed significantly higher levels of TRPV4 on the cell surface compared to ND cells (Supplementary Figure 5A). For the whole cell lysates, TRPV4 protein levels were comparable across different cell lines based on the immunoblot results, with consistent GAPDH signals serving as a loading control (Supplementary Figure 5B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 4. To convincingly demonstrate TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane, IF should be performed under non-permeable conditions (i.e., without detergents like saponin). This approach ensures that only plasma membrane proteins are accessible to antibodies, reducing intracellular background. The same approach should be applied to Piezo1 and TfR.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We observed that under non-permeable conditions, primary antibodies could still access intracellular proteins. To address this issue, we employed extracellular-binding TRPV4 antibodies to selectively detect TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane under hyperosmotic conditions (74.4 mOsm/kg PEG 300) in live MCF10DCIS.com cells, as shown in Supplementary Figure 9. These results clearly demonstrate the plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4 under hyperosmotic conditions, distinguishing it from control conditions. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify high-affinity extracellular-binding antibodies for Piezo1 and TfR. Nevertheless, our findings strongly support the mechanosensing plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Essential Weakness:</p>
<p>Throughout the study, only TRPV4 inhibitors and activators were used to show that TRPV4 relocation is associated with intracellular calcium concentration and cell size changes. It is crucial to use TRPV4 KO or KD cells to confirm that the observed effects are specific to TRPV4 and not due to off-target effects on other proteins. Additionally, fusing a plasma membrane targeting sequence to TRPV4 to make a constitutive plasma membrane-localized construct could demonstrate the opposite effect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for this important comment. As noted in our response to Reviewer #1, we employed an shRNA approach to investigate the functional effects of TRPV4 knockdown on intracellular calcium level changes, cell volume plasticity, and invasiveness phenotypes. We assessed these effects using Fluo-4 AM calcium assay, single-cell volume measurements, and single-cell motility assays under cell crowding or hyperosmotic stress. These results have been incorporated into the revised manuscript and are described in detail in our response to Reviewer #1's &quot;weaknesses&quot; comment.</p>
<p>Reducing TRPV4 expression levels by shRNA diminished mechanosensing intracellular calcium changes under cell crowding and hyperosmotic conditions using PEG 300 treatment. Furthermore, a significantly reduced cell volume plasticity was observed under hyperosmotic conditions in shRNA treated cells compared to control cells (Fig. 4S-X). This diminished mechanosensing capability abolished the pro-invasive mechanotransduction effect, as assessed by single cell motility under hyperosmotic conditions (Fig. 5H-J). These findings demonstrate the critical role of TRPV4 in conferring pro-invasive mechanotransduction capability to MCF10DCIS.com cells through cell volume reduction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor Points:</p>
<p>The introduction section is poorly written; many results currently included in the introduction would be more appropriately placed in the discussion section. The long redundant introduction makes the article hard to read through.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for pointing this out. In the revised introduction, we have significantly reduced references to the results, streamlining the section to make it more concise and focused. This adjustment ensures the introduction is clearer and avoids redundancy, improving the readability of the manuscript.</p>
