<title>Abstract</title><p>Bacteria in biofilms secrete potassium ions to attract free swimming cells. However, the basis of chemotaxis to potassium remains poorly understood. Here, using a microfluidic device, we found that <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> can rapidly accumulate in regions of high potassium concentration on the order of millimoles. Using a bead assay, we measured the dynamic response of individual flagellar motors to stepwise changes in potassium concentration, finding that the response resulted from the chemotaxis signaling pathway instead of the motor response to changes in the proton motive force (PMF). To characterize the chemotactic response to potassium, we exposed the bacteria to a range of potassium concentrations and measured the dose-response curve and adaptation kinetics via a FRET assay, finding that the chemotaxis pathway exhibited a sensitive response and fast adaptation to potassium. We further found that the two major chemoreceptors Tar and Tsr respond differently to potassium. Tar receptors exhibit a biphasic response, whereas Tsr receptors respond to potassium as an attractant. These different responses were consistent with the responses of the two receptors to intracellular pH changes. Therefore, bacteria may sense the change in potassium concentration by sensing the change in intracellular pH. The sensitive response and fast adaptation allow bacteria to sense and localize small changes in potassium concentration. As the ratio of the two major chemoreceptors changes with bacterial growth stages, the differential responses of Tar and Tsr receptors to potassium suggest that cells at different growth stages respond differently to potassium and may have different requirements for potassium.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Potassium is an important ion in the normal physiological process of organisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Potassium ions are a major component in establishing the resting membrane potential and thus ensure proper function of the muscles and nerves. Potassium deficiency can affect many biological functions, such as human heartbeat <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and photosynthesis and respiration of plants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In prokaryotes, such as bacteria, potassium ions play a critical role in maintaining the osmotic pressure, pH value and membrane potential of cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, both the expression of genes and the activities of enzymes are also regulated by potassium ions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Because of its central role in maintaining the normal physiological state of cells, organisms have evolved a series of regulatory systems to control the intracellular concentration of potassium ions, such as Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATP pumps in higher organisms and potassium transport systems in prokaryotes. Most of the studies on potassium have focused on its effects on cell physiology or the dynamics of potassium transport systems. In contrast, studies on the behavioral response to environmental potassium concentration changes and the signaling pathways involved are very limited for bacteria.</p>
<p>Bacteria sense and respond to chemicals via the chemotaxis signaling pathway. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, chemo stimuli are detected by transmembrane receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The sensed signal is then transmitted to the associated cytoplasmic histidine kinase CheA, affecting its autophosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. CheA transfers its phosphoryl group to the response regulator CheY and the methylesterase CheB, yielding CheY-P and CheB-P, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. CheY-P binds to the base of the flagellar motor, increasing the probability of motor rotating clockwise (CW), namely motor CW bias, and thus increasing the cell tumble frequency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The phosphatase CheZ binds to CheY-P and accelerates its dephosphorylation. CheB-P and CheR demethylate and methylate the receptors, respectively, to accomplish robust adaptation in chemotaxis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Conventional stimuli are sensed by <italic>E. coli</italic> directly or indirectly. The former suggests that the ligand can bind to the periplasmic domain of the corresponding receptor directly and modify kinase activity, such as MeAsp and serine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The latter requires the help of binding proteins, such as maltose sensed by the Tar receptor with the help of periplasmic maltose binding protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, and peptides sensed by the Tap receptor with the help of peptide binding proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, the detailed mechanism of bacterial sensing and response to ionic stimuli, such as the chemotactic repellent, nickel ions, is not clear <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The chemotactic response of other ions also remains to be studied.</p>
<p>It was discovered recently that bacteria in biofilms secrete potassium into their surroundings through ion channels on the cell membrane, thereby affecting the behavior of distant free bacteria and attracting them <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. However, how limited changes in potassium concentration regulate the movement of bacteria, especially after long-distance diffusion, is still unclear.</p>
<p>Here, we constructed a linear concentration gradient of potassium ions with a microfluidic device, and found obvious taxis to the region of high concentration for wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic>. To determine the origin of this taxis, we measured the response of motor speed and CW bias to a stepwise increase in potassium concentration. The motor CW bias exhibits an attractant-like response, while the motor speed remains constant, which suggests a constant proton motive force (PMF). The chemotaxis-defective strain did not respond to this stimulus. This confirmed that the CW bias response of motors resulted from the upstream chemotaxis signaling pathway. To further characterize the response of the chemotactic signal to potassium, we directly measured the response of kinase activity to different concentrations of potassium chloride by monitoring the FRET between CheY-eYFP and CheZ-eCFP. We ruled out the possibility of osmotaxis by comparing the responses to 30 mM potassium chloride and 60 mM sucrose. The dose-response curve and step response of kinase activity to potassium suggested a sensitive sensing process and fast adaptation. Further experiments with mutants expressing Tar, Tsr or no receptor suggested that this chemotactic response may result from the increase in intracellular pH. Our findings suggest a new mechanism of chemotactic response to ionic stimuli. Employing a coarse-grained chemotaxis model with parameters extracted from our measurements, we performed stochastic simulation of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in a potassium gradient generated by a biofilm producing an oscillating potassium signal, and demonstrated the delayed periodic attraction of the cells to the biofilm.</p>

<title>Chemotaxis in a linear concentration gradient of potassium</title>
<p>It has been reported that potassium ions work as a communication agent in swarms and biofilms for both <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. A high concentration of potassium chloride (300 mM) could attract swimming cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. To study the chemotactic response of <italic>E. coli</italic> to potassium, we set up a linear concentration profile of potassium chloride with a microfluidic device designed as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, a five-channel diffusion device was constructed. 2% (w/v) agarose was injected into the two resistance channels through port (<bold><italic>b</italic></bold>) to block the passage of cells without influencing the diffusion of potassium. A 100 mM potassium chloride solution, prepared in the potassium-depleted motility buffer, flows through the source channel from port (<bold><italic>a</italic></bold>) to (<bold><italic>a’</italic></bold>), while potassium-depleted motility buffer flows through the sink channel from port (<bold><italic>c</italic></bold>) to (<bold><italic>c’</italic></bold>). Potassium diffuses from the source channel to the sink channel and forms a linear concentration gradient in the observation channel <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The wild-type strain HCB1 was sealed in the observation channel through port (<bold><italic>p</italic></bold>) with a drop of hot agarose (2% w/v). The movements of the cells were recorded by a high-speed CMOS camera. Four movies were recorded. An example video is shown in Movie S1. We calculated the displacement of the mean cell position for each movie. The average results are plotted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>. The shaded area denotes SEM. We also computed the cell density profile along the <italic>y</italic>-axis in the observation channel at the initial time of <italic>t</italic> = 1 s and steady state (<italic>t</italic> = 300 s). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, the green squares and blue dots are experimental data. The error bars denote SEM. We found that the distribution of cells is exponential at steady state, similar to the results of logarithmic chemotactic sensing in a linear MeAsp gradient <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The red solid line denotes the exponential fit, with a fitted decay constant of 0.0085±0.0004 μm<sup>-1</sup>.

<p>According to our results, the wild-type strain exhibited significant movement toward the area of high concentration in a linear concentration gradient of potassium chloride, which was similar to its chemotaxis in a typical attractant concentration gradient <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Thus, <italic>E. coli</italic> could be attracted by potassium and perform a trend movement in a linear gradient field on the order of millimoles. We sought to further investigate the characteristics and mechanisms of this attractant-like response.</p>

<title>The response of the motor rotational signal to potassium</title>
<p>Potassium is important for maintaining cell membrane potential, which is one of the two components of PMF. PMF is the energy source for the flagellar motor. The absolute value of the transmembrane electrical potential will decrease when the concentration of extracellular potassium increases. This may lead to a change in PMF and affect bacterial chemotaxis by directly changing the motor behavior. However, earlier studies found that a sudden change in membrane potential in <italic>E. coli</italic> would result in a reverse change in the transmembrane proton concentration difference, thus keeping PMF virtually constant <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To test whether the chemotactic response of <italic>E. coli</italic> to potassium resulted from possible PMF changes, we monitored the motor response of the wild-type strain (JY26-pKAF131) to a stepwise addition of 30 mM potassium chloride using a bead assay. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, the cell body was attached to a 0.01% poly-l-lysine-coated cover slide. A 1-μm-diameter bead was marked on the truncated filament. We used a high-speed CMOS camera to record the rotation of the bead. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, the typical traces of motor rotational speed (blue line) and CW bias (purple line) were calculated. The positive and negative values of speed denote CCW (counter-clockwise) and CW (clockwise) rotation, respectively. The CW bias is positively correlated with the intracellular concentration of CheY-P <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, and the rotational speed is proportional to the PMF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The stimulus (30 mM KCl) was added at <italic>t</italic> =120 s and removed at <italic>t</italic> = 480 s. The average trace of 83 motors is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>. The moments of addition and removal of stimulus were shifted to <italic>t</italic> = 0, which are marked by the purple dashed line and green dashed line, respectively. The CW bias decreased upon addition of potassium chloride, and then it adapted to a higher level than the pre-stimulus value. Such over adaptation was similar to the response of CW bias to sucrose in osomotaxis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. However, the motor speed remained constant during this process, confirming that the PMF remained constant, which was different from the osmotaxis response of motors. The results suggested that the response of motor CW bias to potassium was not due to PMF change. We performed further experiments with the chemotaxis-defective strain (HCB901-pBES38). The average result of 22 motors exhibited no response to 30 mM potassium chloride for either CW bias or speed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), especially on the time scale of the chemotactic response as seen in the wild-type cells. These results confirmed that the CW bias response of the motor to potassium resulted from the upstream chemotaxis signaling pathway.</p>

<title>The response of the chemotaxis signal to potassium</title>
<p>To directly measure the response of the chemotaxis signal to potassium ions, we monitored the receptor kinase activity <italic>in vivo</italic> by monitoring the FRET between CheY-eYFP and CheZ-eCFP.</p>
<p>Using the FRET setup described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, we measured the chemotactic response of a cell population with the wild-type strain (HCB1288-pVS88). We measured the response of the same sample to potassium chloride at different concentrations and to 100 μM MeAsp (a typical saturated attractant for the Tar receptor in <italic>E. coli</italic>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, potassium (blue solid line) induces a significant chemotaxis response as an attractant. Compared with 100 μM MeAsp, 30 mM KCl resulted in a larger response and faster adaptation. Moreover, the chemotaxis signal exhibits an imprecise adaptation. This is different from the over adaptation exhibited by motor CW bias. To exclude the effect of chloride ion, we quantitatively compared the response of the chemotaxis signal to 10 mM KCl and 5 mM K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, both of which contain 10 mM potassium ion with or without chloride ion. As shown in Fig. S1, they induce similar responses. Thus, the chemotactic response mainly resulted from potassium ions rather than chloride ions.</p>

<p>Earlier studies have shown that changes in osmotic pressure caused by a change in ion concentration on the millimole scale can also lead to chemotactic responses in <italic>E. coli</italic> by altering the interaction between receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Here, we obtained a similar over adaptation in the CW bias response of motors as that of osmotaxis. To determine whether the chemotactic response to potassium was due to changes in osmotic pressure, we compared the response to both 30 mM KCl and 60 mM sucrose, both of which induced the same osmotic pressure. The results are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>. In our measurements, 60 mM sucrose induced a repellent-like response, which is consistent with previous work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, whereas 30 mM KCl induced an attractant response.

<title>Quantitative characterization of the chemotaxis response to potassium</title>
<p>To quantitively describe the response of receptor-kinase activity to potassium ions, we measured the dose-response curve of HCB1288-pVS88 to potassium chloride. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, different concentrations of KCl were added and then removed. The FRET value of the immediate response after adding each concentration of stimulus were recorded. The FRET values were normalized by the pre-stimulus FRET value. The relative kinase activity was obtained by rescaling the FRET values of 1 (the pre-stimulus value) to 0.94 (the value after adding a saturated concentration of stimulus) to the range between 1 to 0, then the relation between relative kinase activity and concentrations of KCl was obtained (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>The chemotactic response to potassium may result from the intracellular pH increase</title>
<p>We showed that the attractant-like response of the chemotaxis signal to potassium does not result from osmotaxis. Moreover, the PMF or motor speed did not change during that process. Considering that the absolute value of the transmembrane potential deceases as the concentration of extracellular potassium ions increases, the intracellular pH will increase to maintain a constant PMF. To confirm this, we monitored the intracellular pH using the pH-sensitive fluorescent protein pHlourin2, by computing the ratio of emitted fluorescence intensities with 405 nm and 488 nm excitations (the ratio increases with pH value) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. The results are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>. The intracellular pH of the wild-type strain (HCB33-pTrc99a_pHlourin2) increases immediately upon addition of 30 mM KCl.

<p>It was reported that Tar and Tsr mediate opposite responses to the changes in intracellular pH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Therefore, we measured the chemotaxis response of strains expressing only the Tar or Tsr receptor via the FRET assay. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, four different concentrations of KCl were added and removed successively, and the kinases activity of the Tsr-only strain exhibited an attractant response. Its imprecise adaptation is apparent as the potassium concentration increases. In contrast, the Tar-only strain exhibited a biphasic response, with kinase activity increasing sharply and then decreasing rapidly below the prestimulus level upon addition of potassium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Such a biphasic response was also observed in the response of the Tar-only strain to 40 mM sodium benzoate at pH of 7.0 (Fig. S2). Note that the cytoplasmic pH deceases upon addition of sodium benzoate at pH of 7.0, so that the response to addition of sodium benzoate is opposite to the response to addition of potassium for the Tar-only strain. Therefore, the different responses of the Tar- and Tsr-only strains to potassium were consistent with the responses to the increase in intracellular pH.</p>
<p>We noted that both major receptors exhibited imprecise adaptation to stepwise addition of potassium. To investigate whether this was due to chemotactic sensing, we monitored the response of the strain with no chemoreceptors to stepwise addition of potassium. Upon addition of potassium, the FRET value decreased and remained at a constant value similar to the adapted level for the strains with chemoreceptors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). This indicated that the imprecise adaptation seen for the wild-type, Tar-only and Tsr-only strains was not due to chemosensing. As the solution pH affects the brightness of fluorescent proteins, we hypothesize that this apparent imprecise adaptation was due to the differential change in eCFP and eYFP brightness when the cytoplasmic pH changed. To test this hypothesis, we bleached the eYFPs of the no-receptor strain (HCB1414-pVS88), eliminating possible FRET between CheY-eYFP and CheZ-eCFP, and compared the response of CFP fluorescence intensity to 30 mM KCl before and after bleaching. As shown in Fig. S3A, the CFP intensity showed similar amount of increase upon addition of KCl (i.e., increase of cytoplasmic pH) before and after YFP bleaching. Thus, such a response did not result from FRET, but from changes in fluorescence intensity due to an increase in intracellular pH. We calculated the ratio of CFP fluorescence intensity <italic>P</italic> = <italic>F<sub>r</sub></italic>/<italic>F<sub>b</sub></italic> = 1.056 without FRET, where <italic>F<sub>r</sub></italic> and <italic>F<sub>b</sub></italic> were the CFP intensity for cells in 30 mM KCl and motility medium, respectively. From this ratio we could calculate the theoretical enhancement in CFP intensity due to pH increase for the wild-type strain (HCB1288-pVS88) after adding 30 mM KCl (red dashed line in Fig. S3B), which we found was similar to the adapted level of the CFP signal. This further proved that the apparent imprecise adaptation in the FRET signal was due to changes in eCFP and eYFP brightness when the cytoplasmic pH changed.</p>

<title>Revised FRET responses by correcting the pH effects on the brightness of eCFP and eYFP</title>
<p>To minimize the impact of pH-changes altering the fluorescent protein brightness on FRET measurements of chemotactic response and adaptation to potassium, we measured the full potassium response curve for the no-receptor mutant (HCB1414-pVS88), as shown in Fig. S4. We characterized the pH effects on CFP and YFP channels at different concentrations of KCl, and the relationship between the ratio of the signal post- to pre-KCl addition and the KCl concentration was established for both channels, as shown in Fig. S4C. The pH-corrected signal after KCl addition for strains with receptors was obtained by dividing the original signal after KCl addition by this ratio at the specific KCl concentration. This procedure was applied to both CFP and YFP channels. The pH-corrected responses for the Tar-only and Tsr-only strains are represented by red dots in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B,C</xref>.</p>
<p>We recalculated the FRET responses to stepwise addition of KCl, with an example depicted by the red dots in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>. The corrected response magnitude to 30 mM KCl is similar to that of 100 μM MeAsp, being 1.06 ± 0.10 times as large, as shown by the red bar in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>. We also calculated the dose-response curve and the adaptation curve from the pH-corrected signals, as shown in Fig. S5. The FRET signal also exhibits over-adaptation, similar to the bead assay, when we recalculated the response by correcting the CFP and YFP channels. The fitted Hill coefficient for the dose-response curve is 0.88 ± 0.14 (mean ± SD), which is close to the response to MeAsp (~1.2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, and the concentration for half-maximal response (<italic>K</italic><sub>0.5</sub>) was 0.33 ± 0.06 mM (mean ± SD).</p>
<p>Our results indicated that the increase in the extracellular concentration of potassium leads to an increase in the intracellular pH. The Tar and Tsr receptors respond to the increase in intracellular pH differently. The wild-type strain exhibits a similar response to the Tsr-only strain due to the larger amount of Tsr than Tar receptors. These responses could be adapted via methylation and demethylation of receptors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Potassium ions play a critical role in many physiological processes of bacteria. Bacteria in biofilms release potassium ions to their surroundings through ion channels on the cell membrane, thus influencing the behavior of surrounding bacteria and attracting distant free bacteria to swim toward them. However, the mechanism of bacterial sensing and response to potassium ions was unclear. Here, we found that <italic>E. coli</italic> senses the concentration change of extracellular potassium ions sensitively via the chemotaxis signaling pathway, and this chemotactic sensing is achieved through changes in intracellular pH.</p>
<p>We found that <italic>E. coli</italic> could quickly converge to the area with a higher concentration of potassium under a linear concentration profile. The measurements of the response of individual motors to stepwise addition and removal of 30 mM KCl via the bead assay demonstrated that the attractant response resulted from the chemotaxis signaling pathway instead of the possible PMF effect on the motor itself. We also demonstrated that the PMF remained unchanged when KCl was added or removed.</p>
<p>To directly measure the chemotactic response of <italic>E. coli</italic> to potassium ions, we measured the response to different concentrations of potassium via FRET between CheY-eYFP and CheZ-eCFP. After correcting the pH effects on the brightness of CFP and YFP proteins, we found that the chemotactic response of wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> to 30 mM KCl was 1.06 ± 0.10 times that to 100 μM MeAsp. The response to 60 mM sucrose was −0.30 ± 0.05 times that to 100 μM MeAsp. This suggested that the attractant response to potassium was independent of the osmolality response. To quantitatively describe the chemotactic response to potassium, we systematically measured the dose-response curve and the step responses. We obtained a Hill coefficient of 0.88±0.14 and a concentration of 0.33±0.06 mM for the half-maximal response. This showed that <italic>E. coli</italic> had a very sensitive response to potassium ions and could sense weak changes in potassium concentration. We also found that <italic>E. coli</italic> adapts quickly to potassium concentration changes in the range of 0.01 mM-100 mM, which promotes cell localization to the peak of a potassium concentration profile.</p>
<p>For other strong attractant stimuli such as high concentrations of MeAsp, the step response typically shows a low plateau before it adapts. However, in the case of potassium, the FRET signal does not typically display an obvious plateau following the stimuli. To observe the low plateau before adaptation, a saturating amount of attractant should be added in a stepwise manner. According to the dose-response curve we measured for potassium, a saturating amount of potassium would be close to 100 mM. In fact, there is a small segment of the low plateau in the step response to 30 mM KCl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> or Fig. S5A). To observe more of this low plateau, we could have used a higher concentration of KCl. However, a stimulation higher than 30 mM KCl will induce substantial physiological changes in the cell, resulting in a significant decrease in fluorescence for both channels (Fig. S7). Therefore, the range of KCl concentration that can be reliably applied in FRET measurements is limited.</p>
<p>While keeping the PMF unchanged, addition of potassium decreases the membrane potential and thus increases the intracellular pH. This was demonstrated by intracellular pH measurements. We also measured the chemotaxis response of mutant strains expressing only Tsr or Tar to different concentrations of potassium. The Tsr-only strain responded to potassium as an attractant, whereas the Tar-only strain exhibited a biphasic response (a repellent-like followed by an attractant-like response). The different responses of Tar and Tsr to potassium were consist with their responses to changes in intracellular pH. We further demonstrated the biphasic response of the Tar-only strain to 40 mM sodium benzoate with pH of 7.0 that induced a decrease in intracellular pH. The differential responses of the Tsr and Tar receptors to potassium may be a strategy by which bacteria adjust their response to potassium at different growth stages during which bacteria express different ratios of Tsr to Tar receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. For the growth stage used in our measurements here, the amount of Tsr was more than that of Tar in the wild-type strain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, so the response to potassium was dominated by Tsr.</p>
<p>The response of the Tar-only strain to potassium warrants further discussion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). This strain shows a repellent response to stepwise addition of low concentrations of potassium, specifically less than 10 mM. This is consistent with previous observations of the response of Tar to changes in intracellular pH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Interestingly, it exhibits a biphasic response to high potassium concentrations of 10 mM and above. This biphasic response might result from additional pH-effects on the activity of intracellular enzymes such as CheRB and CheA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, which may have a different timescale and response from the Tar receptor.</p>
<p>Based on the potassium sensing mechanism we established here, we performed stochastic simulation of bacterial taxis in a biofilm-produced potassium gradient, demonstrating that <italic>E. coli</italic> cells can be periodically attracted by the biofilm. Moreover, we observed a time delay between the positions of the cells and the electric signal of the biofilm. Specifically, we found that the oscillation of <italic>E. coli</italic> cell displacement lags the potassium source by 11.7±0.5 min, 14.7±0.7 min, 14.8±0.9 min and 14.2±1.0 min (mean±SD) for driving periods of 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours, respectively. Remarkably, these values closely resemble the 9 to 35-min lag observed in biofilm experiments for <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, despite the potential variations in the potassium sensing mechanisms among these bacterial species. The potassium sensing mechanism we established here contributed to our understanding of the complex dynamics of electrical signaling in biofilm environments.</p>

<title>Microfluidics</title>
<p>We constructed a 100-μm-depth microfluidic device similar to that described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The design is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. There are two auxiliary channels and three primary channels. The width of the auxiliary channels is 100 μm, while the width of the primary channels is 400 μm. The source and sink channels were used to flow 100 mM KCl and potassium-depleted motility buffer, respectively, and the observing channel was used to observe the motion of cells. The auxiliary channels were filled with 2% agarose gel at a temperature of 68°C and cooled down. In our measurement, we kept the flow at a rate of 5 ml/min in both source and sink channels with a syringe pump (Pump-22; Harvard Apparatus). The potassium ions could diffuse from the source channel to the sink channel and form a linear gradient in the observing channel. Cells of HCB1 were sealed in the observing channel, and their movement was recorded by a fast CMOS camera (Flare 2M360-CL, IO Industries) equipped on a Nikon Ti-E microscope at a magnification of 20×. The chemotaxis migration coefficient (CMC), as an indicator of the mean cell position (49), was calculated as the average of (<italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic> − <italic>x<sub>c</sub></italic>)/194, where <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic> is the <italic>x</italic>-position of the <italic>i</italic>th cell, <italic>x<sub>c</sub></italic> is the <italic>x</italic>-position of the center of the observing channel, and 194 μm is the half-width of the observed region.</p>

<title>Bead assay</title>
<p>We sheared the sticky filaments of the washed cell suspensions by passing them 200 times between two syringes equipped with 23-gauge needles and connected by a 7-cm-long polyethylene tube (0.58 mm inside diameter, no.0427411; Becton Dickinson), and condensed them into 300 μl in potassium-depleted motility buffer. To measure motor rotation, sheared cells were immobilized on a coverslip coated with poly-L-lysine (0.01%, P4707; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) assembled on a flow chamber <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, and allowed to stand for 5 min. Then, 1-μm-diameter polystyrene beads (0.27%, no. 0731; Polysciences) were flowed to replace the suspension and attached to the sheared filament stubs by allowing it to stand for 4 min. The rotation of beads was recorded by a fast CMOS camera (Flare 2M360-CL, IO Industries) equipped on a Nikon Ti-E inverted phase-contrast microscope at a magnification of 40×. The CW bias and rotational speed were calculated with a 20-s time window and 1-s time slide.</p>

<title>FRET assay</title>
<p>The experimental setup used in FRET measurements was the same as that described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The FRET setup was based on a Nikon Ti-E microscope equipped with a 40× 0.60 NA objective. The illumination light was provided by a 130-W mercury lamp, attenuated by a factor of 1024 with neutral density filters, and passed through an excitation bandpass filter (FF02-438/24-25, Semrock) and a dichroic mirror (FF458-Di02-25x36, Semrock). The epifluorescent emission was split into cyan and yellow channels by a second dichroic mirror (FF509-FDi01-25x36, Semrock). The signals in the two channels were then filtered by two emission bandpass filters (FF01-483/32-25 and FF01-542/32-25, Semrock) and collected by two photon-counting photomultipliers (H7421-40, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan), respectively. Signals from the two photomultipliers were recorded at a sampling rate of 1 Hz using a data-acquisition card installed in a computer (USB-1901(G)-1020, ADlink, New Taipei, Taiwan).</p>
<p>The washed cell suspension was concentrated 45 times and flowed into a flow chamber equipped with a poly-L-lysine-coated coverslip, allowing it to stand for 20 min. Then, the chamber was maintained under a constant flow (500 μl/min) of potassium-depleted motility buffer by a syringe pump (Pump-22; Harvard Apparatus). The same flow was used to add and remove stimulus. All data analysis was performed using custom scripts in MATLAB 2018b (MathWorks). The FRET value was calculated as the ratio of YFP to CFP intensities, normalized by the prestimulus value.</p>
<p>For the YFP photobleaching assay, we measured the background of the CFP channel by recording the intensity of the CFP channel for the strain expressing only CheY-eYFP (HCB1288-pVS18). We monitored the response of the CFP signal to 30 mM KCl before and after bleaching YFP. The bleaching was carried out with a YFP filter set (C-FL YFP BP HYQ535, #41028, Chroma) under mercury lamp illumination without attenuation and sustained for 50 minutes. All these measurements were performed under the same conditions.</p>

<title>Intracellular pH measurements</title>
<p>The washed cells of HCB33-pTrc99a_pHluorin2 were immobilized on a coverslip assembled on a flow chamber and coated with poly-L-lysine. Then, a constant flow (500 μl/min) was applied to the cells. The samples were illuminated periodically with two lasers. In each period, the laser with a wavelength of 405 nm was illuminated for 200 ms and stopped for 400 ms, and the laser with a wavelength of 488 nm was illuminated for another 200 ms and stopped for another 400 ms. The emission light passed through the T495lp dichroic mirror and AT495lp longpass filter and was collected by an EMCCD (Andor DU897) equipped on a Nikon Ti-E inverted phase-contrast microscope at a magnification of 100×. The changes in intracellular pH could be characterized by the ratio of emitted fluorescence between the two excitation lasers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper shows that E. coli exhibits a chemotactic response to potassium by measuring both the motor response (using a bead assay) and the intracellular signaling response (CheY phosporylation level via FRET) to step changes in potassium concentration. They find increase in potassium concentration induces a considerable attractant response, with amplitude comparable to aspartate, and cells can quickly adapt (and generally over-adapt). The authors propose that the mechanism for potassium response is through modifying intracellular pH; they find both that potassium modifies pH and other pH modifiers induce similar attractant responses. It is also shown, using Tar- and Tsr-only mutants, that these two chemoreceptors respond to potassium differently. Tsr has a standard attractant response, while Tar has a biphasic response (repellent-like then attractant-like). Finally, the authors use computer simulations to study the swimming response of cells to a periodic potassium signal secreted from a biofilm and find a phase delay that depends on the period of oscillation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The finding that E. coli can sense and adapt to potassium signals and the connection to intracellular pH is quite interesting and this work should stimulate future experimental and theoretical studies regarding the microscopic mechanisms governing this response. The evidence (from both the bead assay and FRET) that potassium induces an attractant response is convincing, as is the proposed mechanism involving modification of intracellular pH. The updated manuscript controls for the impact of pH on the fluorescent protein brightness that can bias the measured FRET signal. After correction the response amplitude and sharpness (hill coefficient) are comparable to conventional chemoattractants (e.g. aspartate), indicating the general mechanisms underlying the response may be similar. The authors suggest that the biphasic response of Tar mutants may be due to pH influencing the activity of other enzymes (CheA, CheR or CheB), which will be an interesting direction for future study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The measured response may be biased by adaptation, especially for weak potassium signals. For other attractant stimuli, the response typically shows a low plateau before it recovers (adapts). In the case of potassium, the FRET signal does not have an obvious plateau following the stimuli of small potassium concentrations, perhaps due to the faster adaptation compared to other chemoattractants. It is possible cells have already partially adapted when the response reaches its minimum, so the measured response may be a slight underestimate of the true response. Mutants without adaptation enzymes appear to be sensitive to potassium only at much larger concentrations, where the pH significantly disrupts the FRET signal; more accurate measurements would require development of new mutants and/or measurement techniques.</p>

<p>Zhang et al investigated the biophysical mechanism of potassium-mediated chemotactic behavior in E coli. Previously, it was reported by Humphries et al that the potassium waves from oscillating B subtilis biofilm attract P aeruginosa through chemotactic behavior of motile P aeruginosa cells. It was proposed that K+ waves alter PMF of P aeruginosa. However, the mechanism was this behaviour was not elusive. In this study, Zhang et al demonstrated that motile E coli cells accumulate in regions of high potassium levels. They found that this behavior is likely resulting from the chemotaxis signalling pathway, mediated by an elevation of intracellular pH. Overall, a solid body of evidence is provided to support the claims. However, the impacts of pH on the fluorescence proteins need to be better evaluated. In its current form, the evidence is insufficient to say that the fluoresce intensity ratio results from FRET. It may well be an artefact of pH change.</p>
<p>The authors now carefully evaluated the impact of pH on their FRET sensor by examining the YFP and CFP fluorescence with no-receptor mutant. The authors used this data to correct the impact of pH on their FRET sensor. This is an improvement, but the mathematical operation of this correction needs clarification. This is particularly important because, looking at the data, it is not fully convincing if the correction was done properly. For instance, 3mM KCl gives 0.98 FRET signal both in Fig3 and FigS4, but there is almost no difference between blue and red lines in Fig 3. FigS4 is very informative, but it does not address the concern raised by both reviewers that FRET reporter may not be a reliable tool here due to pH change.</p>
<p>The authors show the FRET data with both KCl and K2SO4, concluding that the chemotactic response mainly resulted from potassium ions. However, this was only measured by FRET. It would be more convincing if the motility assay in Fig1 is also performed with K2SO4. The authors did not address this point. In light of complications associated with the use of the FRET sensor, this experiment is more important.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This important study reports a novel measurement for the chemotactic response to potassium by Escherichia coli. The authors convincingly demonstrate that these bacteria exhibit an attractant response to potassium and connect this to changes in intracellular pH level. However, some experimental results are incomplete, with additional controls/alternate measurements required to support the conclusions. The work will be of interest to those studying bacterial signalling and response to environmental cues.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper shows that E. coli exhibits a chemotactic response to potassium by measuring both the motor response (using a bead assay) and the intracellular signaling response (CheY phosporylation level via FRET) to step changes in potassium concentration. They find increase in potassium concentration induces a considerable attractant response, with an amplitude larger than aspartate, and cells can quickly adapt (but possibly imperfectly). The authors propose that the mechanism for potassium response is through modifying intracellular pH; they find both that potassium modifies pH and other pH modifiers induce similar attractant responses. It is also shown, using Tar- and Tsr-only mutants, that these two chemoreceptors respond to potassium differently. Tsr has a standard attractant response, while Tar has a biphasic response (repellent-like then attractant-like). Finally, the authors use computer simulations to study the swimming response of cells to a periodic potassium signal secreted from a biofilm and find a phase delay that depends on the period of oscillation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The finding that E. coli can sense and adapt to potassium signals and the connection to intracellular pH is quite interesting and this work should stimulate future experimental and theoretical studies regarding the microscopic mechanisms governing this response. The evidence (from both the bead assay and FRET) that potassium induces an attractant response is convincing, as is the proposed mechanism involving modification of intracellular pH.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors show that changes in pH impact fluorescent protein brightness and modify the FRET signal; this measurement explains the apparent imprecise adaptation they measured. However, this effect reduces confidence in the quantitative accuracy of the FRET measurements. For example, part of the potassium response curve (Fig. 4B) can be attributed to chemotactic response and part comes from the pH modifying the FRET signal. Measuring the full potassium response curve of the no-receptor mutants as a control would help quantify the true magnitude of the chemotactic response and the adaptation precision to potassium.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have now measured the full potassium response curve for the no-receptor mutant (HCB1414-pVS88), as shown in Fig. S4. We characterized the pH effects on CFP and YFP channels at different concentrations of KCl, and the relationship between the ratio of the signal post- to pre-KCl addition and the KCl concentration was established for both channels, as shown in Fig. S4C. The pH-corrected signal after KCl addition for strains with receptors was obtained by dividing the original signal after KCl addition by this ratio at the specific KCl concentration. This was done for both CFP and YFP channels. The pH-corrected responses for the Tar-only and Tsr-only strains are represented by red dots in Fig. 5BC. The recalculated response curve and adaptation curve for the wild-type strain are shown in Fig. S5. The same correction was applied to Fig. 3 as well. We also re-performed the simulations using the corrected dose-response curve and replotted Fig. 6, though the simulation results did not change much.</p>
<p>We have now added a subsection “Revised FRET responses by correcting the pH effects on the brightness of eCFP and eYFP” at line 296 in “Results” to describe this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The measured response may also be impacted by adaptation. For other strong attractant stimuli, the response typically shows a low plateau before it recovers (adapts). However, in the case of Potassium, the FRET signal does not have an obvious plateau following the stimuli. Do the authors have an explanation for that? One possibility is that the cells may have already partially adapted when the response reaches its minimum, which could indicate a different response and/or adaptation dynamics from that of a regular chemo-attractant? In any case, directly measuring the response to potassium in mutants without adaptation enzymes (CheR, CheB) and with the receptors in different methylation levels would shed more light on the problem.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful questions. To observe the low plateau before adaptation, a saturating amount of attractant should be added in a stepwise manner. According to the dose-response curve we measured for potassium, a saturating amount of potassium would be close to 100 mM. In fact, there is a small segment of the low plateau in the step response to 30 mM KCl (Fig. 4C or Fig. S5A). To observe more of this low plateau, we could have used a higher concentration of KCl. However, a stimulation higher than 30 mM KCl will induce substantial physiological changes in the cell, resulting in a significant decrease in fluorescence for both channels (Fig. S7). Therefore, the range of KCl concentration that can be reliably applied in FRET measurements is limited.</p>
<p>The half-time of adaptation at 30 mM KCl was measured to be approximately 80 s, demonstrating a faster adaptation than 0.1 mM MeAsp, which induced a similar magnitude of response. Nevertheless, this is still significantly slower than the time required for medium exchange in the flow chamber, which takes less than 10 s to replace 99% of the medium. Thus, the effect on the measured response magnitude due to adaptation should be small (less than 10%).</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of measuring the response to potassium in mutants without adaptation enzymes (CheR, CheB) and with the receptors in different methylation levels. However, these mutants are typically less sensitive than the wild-type, exhibiting higher values of K0.5 (Sourjik &amp; Berg, PNAS 99:123, 2002), and thus require an even higher KCl concentration to see the low plateau. Consistent with this, we attempted to measure the response to potassium in a cheRcheB mutant (HCB1382-pVS88). As shown in Fig. R1 below, there is no response to up to 30 mM KCl, suggesting that the sensitive region of the mutant is beyond 30 mM KCl.</p>

<p>There seems to be an inconsistency between the FRET and bead assay measurements, the CW bias shows over-adaptation, while the FRET measurement does not.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now demonstrated that the imprecise adaptation shown in the FRET assay primarily resulted from the pH-induced intensity change of the fluorescent proteins. As shown in Fig. S5A&amp;C, the FRET signal also shows over-adaptation, similar to the bead assay, when we recalculated the response by correcting the CFP and YFP channels.</p>

<p>The small hill coefficient of the potassium response curve and the biphasic response of the Tar-only strain, while both very interesting, require further explanation since these are quite different than responses to more conventional chemoattractants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now recalculated the pH-corrected results for the dose-response curve (Fig. S5) and the biphasic response of the Tar-only strain (Fig. 5C). The new Hill coefficient is 0.880.14 (meanSD), which is close to the response to MeAsp (1.2) (ref. 46). We suspected that this Hill coefficient of slightly less than 1 resulted from the different responses of Tar and Tsr receptors to potassium.</p>
<p>The Tar-only strain exhibits a repellent response to stepwise addition of low concentrations of potassium less than 10 mM, and a biphasic response above (Fig. 5C). This biphasic response might result from additional pH-effects on the activity of intracellular enzymes such as CheRB and CheA, which may have a different timescale and response from the Tar receptor. We have now added the penultimate paragraph in “Discussion” to talk about the response of the Tar-only strain.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhang et al investigated the biophysical mechanism of potassium-mediated chemotactic behavior in E coli. Previously, it was reported by Humphries et al that the potassium waves from oscillating B subtilis biofilm attract P aeruginosa through chemotactic behavior of motile P aeruginosa cells. It was proposed that K+ waves alter PMF of P aeruginosa. However, the mechanism was this behaviour was not elusive. In this study, Zhang et al demonstrated that motile E coli cells accumulate in regions of high potassium levels.

Overall, a solid body of evidence is provided to support the claims. However, the impacts of pH on the fluorescence proteins need to be better evaluated. In its current form, the evidence is insufficient to say that the fluoresce intensity ratio results from FRET. It may well be an artefact of pH change. Nevertheless, this is an important piece of work. The text is well written, with a good balance of background information to help the reader follow the questions investigated in this research work.</p>
<p>In my view, the effect of pH on the FRET between CheY-eYFP and CheZ-eCFP is not fully examined. The authors demonstrated in Fig. S3 that CFP intensity itself changes by KCl, likely due to pH. They showed that CFP itself is affected by pH. This result raises a question of whether the FRET data in Fig3-5 could result from the intensity changes of FPs, but not FRET. The measured dynamics may have nothing to do with the interaction between CheY and CheZ. It should be noted that CFP and YFP have different sensitivities to pH. So, the measurement is likely confounded by the change in intracellular pH. Without further experiments to evaluate the effect of pH on CFP and YFP, the data using this FRET pair is inconclusive.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now measured the full potassium response curve for the no-receptor mutant (HCB1414-pVS88), as shown in Fig. S4. We characterized the pH effects on CFP and YFP channels at different concentrations of KCl, and the relationship between the ratio of the signal post- to pre-KCl addition and the KCl concentration was established for both channels, as shown in Fig. S4C.

This was done for both CFP and YFP channels. The pH-corrected responses for the Tar-only and Tsr-only strains are represented by red dots in Fig. 5BC. The recalculated response curve and adaptation curve for the wild-type strain are shown in Fig. S5. The same correction was applied to Fig. 3 as well. We also re-performed the simulations using the corrected dose-response curve and replotted Fig. 6, though the simulation results did not change much.</p>

<p>The data in Figure 1 is convincing. It would be helpful to include example videos. There is also ambiguity in the method section for this experiment. It states 100mM KCl was flown to the source channel. However, it is not clear if 100 mM KCl was prepared in water or in the potassium-depleted motility buffer. If KCl was prepared with water, there would be a gradient of other chemicals in the buffer, which confound the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We apologize for the ambiguity. The KCl solution used in this work was prepared in the potassium-depleted motility buffer. We have now clarified this at both lines 116 and 497. We now provided an example video, Movie S1, with the relevant text added at line 123.</p>

<p>The authors show that the FRET data with both KCl and K2SO4, and concluded that the chemotactic response mainly resulted from potassium ions. However, this was only measured by FRET. It would be more convincing if the motility assay in Fig1 is also performed with K2SO4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The aim of comparing the responses to KCl and K2SO4 was to determine the role of chloride ions in the response and to prove that the chemotactic response of E. coli to KCl comes primarily from its response to potassium ions. It is more sensitive to compare the responses to KCl and K2SO4 by using the FRET assay. In contrast, the microfluidic motility assay is less sensitive in revealing the difference in the chemotactic responses, making it difficult to determine the potential role of chloride ions.</p>

<p>Response: Thank you for the suggestion. We have now added more descriptions at lines 535-546: The FRET setup was based on a Nikon Ti-E microscope equipped with a 40× 0.60 NA objective. The illumination light was provided by a 130-W mercury lamp, attenuated by a factor of 1024 with neutral density filters, and passed through an excitation bandpass filter (FF02-438/24-25, Semrock) and a dichroic mirror (FF458-Di02-25x36, Semrock). The epifluorescent emission was split into cyan and yellow channels by a second dichroic mirror (FF509-FDi01-25x36, Semrock). The signals in the two channels were then filtered by two emission bandpass filters (FF01-483/32-25 and FF01-542/32-25, Semrock) and collected by two photon-counting photomultipliers (H7421-40, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan), respectively. Signals from the two photomultipliers were recorded at a sampling rate of 1 Hz using a data-acquisition card installed in a computer (USB-1901(G)-1020, ADlink, New Taipei, Taiwan).</p>

<p>(1) From the motor measurements the authors find that the CW bias over-adapts to a level larger than prestimulus, but this is not seen in the FRET measurements. What causes this inconsistency? Fig. 2D seems to rule out any change in CheY binding to the motor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now demonstrated that the imprecise adaptation shown in the FRET assay primarily resulted from the pH-induced intensity change of the fluorescent proteins. As shown in Fig. S5A&amp;C, the FRET signal also shows over-adaptation, similar to the bead assay, when we recalculated the response by correcting the CFP and YFP channels.</p>
<p>We now clarified it at line 315.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It would be useful to compare the response amplitude for potassium (Fig. 3C) to a large concentration of both MeAsp and serine. This is a fairer comparison since your work shows potassium acts on both Tar and Tsr. Alternatively, testing a much larger concentration (~10^6 micromolar) at which MeAsp also binds to Tsr would also be useful.</p>

<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now recalculated the response to potassium by correcting the pH-induced effects on fluorescence intensity of CFP and YFP. The response to 30 mM KCl was 1.060.10 times as large as that to 100 μM MeAsp. The aim of the comparison between the responses to potassium and MeAsp was to provide an idea of the magnitude of the chemotactic response to potassium. The stimulus of 100 μM MeAsp is already a saturating amount of attractant and induces zero-kinase activity, thus using a higher stimulus (adding serine or a larger concentration of MeAsp) is probably not needed. Moreover, a larger concentration (~10^6 micromolar) of MeAsp would also induce an osmotactic response.</p>

<p>(3) The fitted Hill coefficient (~0.5) to the FRET response curve is quite small and the authors suggest this indicates negative cooperativity. Do they have a proposed mechanism for negative cooperativity? Have similar coefficients been measured for other responses?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now recalculated the pH-corrected results for the dose-response curve (Fig. S5). The new Hill coefficient is 0.880.14 (meanSD), which is close to the response to MeAsp (1.2) (ref. 46). We suspect that this Hill coefficient of slightly less than 1 results from the differing responses of Tar and Tsr receptors to potassium.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3a) The authors state a few times that the response to potassium is &quot;very sensitive&quot;, but the low Hill coefficient indicates that the response is not very sensitive (at least compared to aspartate and serine responses).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We apologize for the confusion. We described the response to potassium as “very sensitive” due to the small value of K0.5. This has now been clarified at line 236.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3b) Since the measurements are performed in wild-type cells the response amplitude following the addition of potassium may be biased if the cell has already partially adapted. This seems to be the case since the FRET time series does not plateau after the addition of the stimulus. The accuracy of the response curve and hill coefficient would be more convincing if the experiment was repeated with a cheR cheB deficient mutant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for raising these questions. To observe the low plateau before adaptation, a saturating amount of attractant should be added in a stepwise manner. According to the dose-response curve we measured for potassium, a saturating amount of potassium would be close to 100 mM. In fact, there is a small segment of the low plateau in the step response to 30 mM KCl (Fig. 4C or Fig. S5A). To observe more of this low plateau, we could have used a higher concentration of KCl. However, a stimulation higher than 30 mM KCl will induce substantial physiological changes in the cell, resulting in a significant decrease in fluorescence for both channels (Fig. S7). Therefore, the range of KCl concentration that can be reliably applied in FRET measurements is limited.</p>
<p>The half-time of adaptation at 30 mM KCl was measured to be approximately 80 s, demonstrating a faster adaptation than 0.1 mM MeAsp, which induced a similar magnitude of response. Nevertheless, this is still significantly slower than the time required for medium exchange in the flow chamber, which takes less than 10 s to replace 99% of the medium. Thus, the effect on the measured response magnitude due to adaptation should be small (less than 10%).</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of measuring the response to potassium in mutants without adaptation enzymes (CheR, CheB) and with the receptors in different methylation levels. However, these mutants are typically less sensitive than the wild-type, exhibiting higher values of K0.5 (ref. 46), and thus require an even higher KCl concentration to see the low plateau. Consistent with this, we attempted to measure the response to potassium in a cheRcheB mutant (HCB1382-pVS88). As shown in Fig. R1, there is no response to up to 30 mM KCl, suggesting that the sensitive region of the mutant is beyond 30 mM KCl.</p>

<p>(4) The authors show that the measured imprecise adaptation can be (at least partially) attributed to pH impacting the FRET signal by changing eCFP and eYFP brightness.</p>
<p>(4a) Comparing Fig. 5C and D, the chemosensing and pH response time scales look similar. Therefore, does the pH effect bias the measured response amplitude (just as it biases the adapted FRET level)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree with the reviewer that the pH effect on CFP and YFP biases the measured response amplitude. We have now performed the measurement of dose-response curve to potassium for the no-receptor mutant (HCB1414-pVS88), as shown in Fig. S4. The pH effects on CFP and YFP were corrected. The dose-response curve and adaptation curve were recalculated and plotted in Fig. S5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4b) It would help to measure a full response curve (at many concentrations) for the no-receptor strain as a control. This would help distinguish, as a function of concentration, how much response can be attributed to pH impacting the FRET signal versus the true chemotactic response.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have now performed the measurements for the no-receptor strain. The impact of pH on CFP and YFP has been corrected. The pH-corrected results, previously in Fig.3-5, are now presented in Fig. 3, Fig. S5 and Fig. 5, respectively.</p>

<p>(5) The biphasic response of Tar is strange and warrants further discussion. Do the authors have any proposed mechanisms that lead to this behavior? For the 10mM and 30mM KCl measurements there is a repellent response followed by an attractant response for both adding and removing the stimuli, why is this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The Tar-only strain exhibits a repellent response to stepwise addition of low concentrations of potassium less than 10 mM, and a biphasic response above (Fig. 5C). This biphasic response might result from additional pH-effects on the activity of intracellular enzymes such as CheRB and CheA, which may have a different timescale and response from the Tar receptor. We have now added the penultimate paragraph in “Discussion” to talk about the response of the Tar-only strain.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5a) The fact that Tar and Tsr are both attractant (after the initial repellant response in Tar) appears to be inconsistent with previous work on pH response (Ref 52, Yang and Sourjik Molecular Microbiology (2012) 86(6), 1482-1489). This study also didn't see any biphasic response.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The Tar-only strain shows a repellent response to stepwise addition of low concentrations of potassium, specifically less than 10 mM. This is consistent with previous observations of the response of Tar to changes in intracellular pH (refs. 44,45) and also with the work of Yang and Sourjik (new ref. 53), although the work in ref. 53 dealt with the response to external pH change, and bacteria were known to maintain a relatively stable intracellular pH when external pH changes (Chen &amp; Berg, Biophysical Journal (2000) 78:2280-2284). Interestingly, the Tar-only strain exhibits a biphasic response to high potassium concentrations of 10 mM and above. This biphasic response might result from additional pH-effects on the activity of intracellular enzymes such as CheRB and CheA (ref. 56), which may have a different timescale and response from the Tar receptor. We have now added the penultimate paragraph in “Discussion” to talk about the response of the Tar-only strain.</p>

<p>(5b) The response of Tar to the removal of sodium benzoate (Fig. S2) seems to be triphasic, is there any explanation for this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now acknowledged in the legend of Fig. S2 that this response is interesting and warrants further exploration: “The response to the removal of sodium benzoate seems to be a superposition of an attractant and a repellent response, the reason for which deserves to be further explored.”</p>

<p>(6) Fitting the MWC model leads to N=0.35&lt;1. It is fine to use this as a phenomenological parameter, but can the authors comment on what might be causing such a small effective cluster size for potassium response?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now recalculated the pH-corrected results for the dose-response curve (Fig. S5). The new Hill coefficient is 0.880.14 (meanSD), which is close to the response to MeAsp (1.2) (ref. 46). We now refit the MWC model to the pH-corrected dose-response curve, obtaining N of 0.85. We think the small N is due partly to the fact that we are fitting the curve with four parameters: N, Kon, Koff, and fm, while only three features of the sigmoid does-response curve are relevant (the vertical scale, the midpoint concentration, and the slope of the sigmoid). Future experiments may determine these parameters more accurately, but they should not significantly affect the simulation results as long as the wild-type dose-response curve is accurate.</p>

<p>(7) The results of the modeling are closely related to Zhu et. al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 128101. Is the lag time for large T related to the adaptation time?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We used a similar framework of modeling as Zhu et. al. The potassium response was also analogous to the chemotactic response to MeAsp. Thus, the results are closely related to Zhu et al. We have now cited Zhu et al. (Ref. 52) and noted this at line 366.</p>
<p>The lag time for large T is related to the adaptation time. We have now simulated the chemotaxis to potassium for large T with different adaptation time by varying the methylation rate kR. The results are shown in Fig. S8. The simulated lag time decreases with the methylation rate kR, but levels off at high values of kR. Now this has been added at line 603.</p>

</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have now provided Movie S1 to show the cells’ behavior to potassium. As shown in Fig. 3B, the chemotactic response to 60 mM sucrose is very small compared to the response to 30 mM KCl. This implies that a noticeable response to sucrose necessitates higher concentrations of stimulation. However, Jerko et al. [Rosko, J., Martinez, V. A., Poon, W. C. K. &amp; Pilizota, T. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 114, E7969-E7976 (2017).] have shown that high concentrations of sucrose lead to a significant reduction in the speed of the flagella motor. Thus, in a motility assay for sucrose, the osmolarity-induced motility effect may overwhelm the minor repellent-like response.</p>
