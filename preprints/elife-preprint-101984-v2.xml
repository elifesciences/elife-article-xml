<title>Abstract</title><p>The dysfunction of the cellular endolysosomal pathway, such as in lysosomal storage diseases, can cause severe musculoskeletal disorders. However, how endolysosomal dysfunction causes musculoskeletal abnormalities remains poorly understood, limiting therapeutic options. Here, we report that CHMP5, a member of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III protein family, is essential to maintain the endolysosomal pathway and regulate bone formation in osteogenic lineage cells. Genetic ablation of <italic>Chmp5</italic> in mouse osteogenic cells increases bone formation in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, <italic>Chmp5</italic> deletion causes endolysosomal dysfunction by decreasing the VPS4A protein, and CHMP5 overexpression is sufficient to increase the VPS4A protein. Subsequently, endolysosomal dysfunction disturbs mitochondrial functions and increases mitochondrial ROS, ultimately resulting in skeletal cell senescence. Senescent skeletal cells cause abnormal bone formation by combining cell-autonomous and paracrine actions. Importantly, the elimination of senescent cells using senolytic drugs can alleviate musculoskeletal abnormalities in <italic>Chmp5</italic> conditional knockout mice. Therefore, our results show that cell senescence represents an underpinning mechanism and a therapeutic target for musculoskeletal disorders caused by the aberrant endolysosomal pathway, such as in lysosomal storage diseases. These results also uncover the function and mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of cell senescence by affecting the endolysosomal-mitochondrial pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is an evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism essential for diverse cell biological processes. Since it was initially discovered in the early 21st century in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the molecular gear has been extensively dissected in the endocytic pathway, which sorts ubiquitinated membrane proteins and bound cargoes that commit to lysosomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. In addition to the endocytic process, ESCRT proteins also play critical roles in other cell activities, such as exocytosis, viral budding, cytokinesis, pruning of neurons, repair of the plasma membrane, and assembly of the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. In the endocytic pathway, the ESCRT machinery consists of a series of functionally overlapping protein complexes, including ESCRT-0, -I, -II and -III. While the ESCRT-0, -I, and -II complexes are mainly responsible for protein sorting and recruiting ESCRT-III components, the ESCRT-III complex, cooperating with the ATPase VPS4, is the primary executor of membrane severing during the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], which ultimately fuse with the lysosomes for cargo degradation or with the plasma membrane to release cargos into the extracellular space.</p>
<p>Charged multivesicular body protein 5 (CHMP5), the mammalian ortholog of yeast VPS60/MOS10, is a component of the ESCRT-III protein complex and plays an essential role in the late stage of MVB formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. As the yeast <italic>Vps60/Mos10</italic>-null mutation disturbs the endosome-to-vacuole (the lysosome-like structure in yeast) trafficking and affects the sorting of internalized endocytic markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], ablation of <italic>Chmp5</italic> in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) also affects the sorting from late endosomes/MVBs to lysosomes and reduces lysosomal degradation of multiple activated receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Notably, in mouse osteoclasts, CHMP5 suppresses ubiquitylation of the IÎºBÎ± protein and restricts the activity of NFÎºB pathway, without any effect on endolysosomal functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. During Î±Î² T lymphocyte development, CHMP5 promotes thymocyte survival by stabilizing the pro-survival protein of BCL2 and does not have an influence on the endolysosomal system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. These studies suggest that the regulation of the endolysosomal pathway by CHMP5 depends on the cell and tissue context.</p>
<p>The dysfunction of the endolysosomal pathway can cause severe musculoskeletal disorders. A such example is lysosomal storge diseases, which include more than 50 different subgroups of diseases due to mutations in genes that encode lysosomal hydrolases or genes that are responsible for the transport, maturation, and functions of lysosomal hydrolases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Musculoskeletal pathologies, such as joint stiffness/contracture, bone deformation, muscular atrophy, short stature, and decreased mobility, are among the most common, in some cases the earliest, clinical presentations of lysosomal storage diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. These musculoskeletal lesions are particularly refractory to current treatments for lysosomal storage diseases, including enzyme replacement treatment and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Therefore, studies on the mechanisms of musculoskeletal pathologies due to endolysosomal dysfunction are paramount to design and develop novel treatments for these disorders.</p>
<p>In this study, our results uncover the function and mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of cell senescence and bone formation in osteogenic cells. Deletion of <italic>Chmp5</italic> causes endolysosomal dysfunction involving decreased VPS4A protein and subsequently activates cell senescence by increasing intracellular mitochondrial ROS. Senescent cells induce bone formation in both autonomous and paracrine ways. Importantly, senolytic treatment is effective in mitigating musculoskeletal pathologies caused by <italic>Chmp5</italic> deletion.</p>

<title>Ablation of <italic>Chmp5</italic> in mouse osteogenic lineage cells causes aberrant bone formation</title>
<p>In addition to the well-characterized role of the CTSK gene in osteoclasts, this gene has recently been reported to identify periskeletal progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. In particular, the ablation of <italic>Chmp5</italic> in mouse <italic>Ctsk</italic>-expressing cells (hereafter referred to as <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice, homozygous) caused dramatic periskeletal bone overgrowth near the joint compared to <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic> (heterozygous) and <italic>Chmp5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> littermate controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Aberrant periskeletal bone growth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice became distinct around postnatal day 10 (d10), progressed with age, and involved multiple bones and joints throughout the body, including knee, ankle, and foot joints (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A to C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). With age, these animals developed severe skeletal deformities, progressive joint stiffness, reduced motility, and short stature. Despite bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> animals, mechanical tests showed that bone stiffness and fracture stress decreased significantly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), suggesting that bone mechanical properties were impaired in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice.</p>

</fig>
<p>To track CTSK<sup>+</sup> periskeletal progenitors during the bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice, we crossed <italic>Ctsk-Cre</italic>, <italic>Chmp5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, and <italic>Rosa26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic> mice to generate <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup>;Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> reporter animals, in which CTSK<sup>+</sup> periskeletal progenitors and their descendants express membrane-localized green fluorescence protein (GFP). In <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> control mice, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells could be detected in the perichondrium, groove of Ranvier, periosteum, ligament, and enthesis in addition to osteoclasts in the bone marrow, but not in growth plate chondrocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). With <italic>Chmp5</italic> deletion, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells consisted of a major part of cells in periskeletal overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup>;Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). Tartarate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining did not show TRAP<sup>+</sup> osteoclasts in the periskeletal lesion, while obvious TRAP<sup>+</sup> osteoclasts could be detected in the bone marrow (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors directly contribute to the bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p>Next, we sought to confirm the role of CHMP5 in the regulation of bone formation by deleting this gene using another mouse line of osteogenic lineage Cre. We crossed <italic>Chmp5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with the line of <italic>Prrx1</italic>-Cre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], <italic>Col2</italic>-Cre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] or <italic>Osx</italic>-Cre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] mice to delete the <italic>Chmp5</italic> gene in <italic>Prrx1</italic>-expressing limb mesenchymal progenitors (<italic>Chmp5<sup>Prrx1</sup></italic> mice), <italic>Col2</italic>-expressing perichondral progenitors (<italic>Chmp5<sup>Col2</sup></italic> mice) or <italic>Osx</italic>-expressing osteoprogenitors (<italic>Chmp5<sup>Osx</sup></italic> mice) and were unable to obtain postnatal homozygous gene knockout mice, probably due to embryonic lethality after ablating C<italic>hmp5</italic> expression in these osteogenic lineages. Subsequently, we used the <italic>Dmp1</italic>-Cre mouse line that could target postnatal endosteal osteoprogenitors, preosteoblasts, mature osteoblasts, and osteocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice were born in normal Mendelian ratios and were viable. Within three weeks of age, the skeletons of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice began to show a distinct expansion in comparison with <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> littermate controls, which progressed with age and became much more severe at 1 year of age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).

<title>CHMP5 controls skeletal progenitor cell senescence</title>
<p>To gain more insight into the mechanism of regulation of bone formation by CHMP5, we assumed that depletion of <italic>Chmp5</italic> in osteogenic lineage cells also increases cell proliferation, which contributes to the bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5</italic> conditional knockout mice. Unexpectedly, <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors showed a significant decrease in the cell proliferation rate compared to <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic> controls (approximately 58% decrease in the cell number on day 6 of P2 culture, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Because CHMP5 has been reported to regulate thymocyte apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], we performed cell apoptosis analyses for <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic> cells.

<p>Notably, the low apoptotic cell ratio (approximately 5%) could not well match the decrease in cell proliferation rate (approximately 58%) in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors. We further analyzed the RNA-seq data of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> vs. <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic> cells to dig out the mechanism of CHMP5 deficiency on the fate of skeletal progenitors. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed significant enrichment of genes in multiple Reactome molecular pathways associated with cell senescence in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> relative to <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors, including <italic>Hmga1</italic>, <italic>Hmga2</italic>, <italic>Trp53</italic>, <italic>Ets1</italic>, and <italic>Txn1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Meanwhile, GSEA of RNA-seq data also showed significant enrichment of the SAUL_SEN_MAYO geneset (positively correlated with cell senescence) and the KAMMINGA_SENESCENCE geneset (negatively correlated with cellular senescence) in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> vs. <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, Western blot results showed that both the p16 and p21 proteins, two canonical markers of cellular senescence, were upregulated in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> compared to control cells, with a higher degree of upregulation in the p16 protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). However, the mRNA levels of <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> (p16) and <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> (p21) did not show significant changes according to the RNA-seq analysis (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref>). Furthermore, immunostaining for another cell senescence marker Î³H2Ax demonstrated that there were significantly more Î³H2Ax<sup>+</sup>;GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in periskeletal overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic>;<italic>Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice relative to the periosteum of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> control mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Accordingly, C<italic>hmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice showed gross accelerated aging-related phenotypes, including hair loss, joint stiffness/contracture, and decreased motility (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>To further characterize the effect of CHMP5 on skeletal progenitor cell fate, we deleted <italic>Chmp5</italic> in ATDC5 cells, which were shown to be an appropriate model of periskeletal progenitors in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], using CRISPR/CAS9 technology (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3E</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Chmp5</italic> deletion also significantly suppressed the cell proliferation rate of ATDC5 cells and mildly increased cell apoptosis (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3F and G</xref>). However, inhibition of cell apoptosis using the pancaspase inhibitor Q-VD-Oph could not reverse cell number reduction (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3H</xref>), indicating that cell apoptosis was not the main cause of the decrease in the proliferation rate of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors. Instead, cell cycle analysis showed a significant decrease of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient ATDC5 cells in phase S, and a significant proportion of these cells were arrested in G0/G1 or G2/M phases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>), which is a typic characteristic of cell cycle arrest in senescent cells. Taken together, these results at molecular, cellular, and gross levels demonstrate that <italic>Chmp5</italic> deficiency induces skeletal progenitor cell senescence.</p>

<title>Secretory phenotype of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors</title>
<p>A remarkable feature of senescent cells is the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which plays a critical role in mediating the pathophysiological processes of cell senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. In particular, periskeletal overgrowths in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic>;<italic>Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice showed evident integration of many cells lacking evidence of Cre-mediated recombination (GFP<sup>â</sup>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deleted periskeletal progenitors might recruit neighboring <italic>wild-type</italic> cells to facilitate the bone overgrowth. Additionally, the GSEA of RNA-seq data showed a significant enrichment of genes associated with the SASP molecular pathway in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deleted periskeletal progenitors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<p>Functionally, conditioned medium collected from <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors caused a higher proliferation rate of ATDC5 cells than medium from control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).

Simultaneously, CD45<sup>â</sup>;CD31<sup>â</sup>;GFP-skeletal progenitors from periskeletal tissues of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic>;<italic>Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice showed increased proliferation along with enhanced osteogenic differentiation compared to the corresponding cells from <italic>Ctsk-Cre;Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> control mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F, G</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C, D</xref>). Immunostaining for the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 demonstrated an increase in the number of stained cells in the periskeletal lesion of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4E</xref>). Since GFP<sup>+</sup> <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors showed a decreased cell proliferation rate and increased cell senescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), and the GFP-<italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors showed an increased cell proliferation rate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C</xref>), these Ki-67<sup>+</sup> cells in <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4E</xref> should represent GFP- skeletal progenitors in the periskeletal lesion. Together, these results demonstrate that <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors could promote the proliferation and osteogenesis of surrounding <italic>wild-type</italic> skeletal progenitors.</p>
<p>Next, we performed a secretome analysis to characterize secretory profiles of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> vs. <italic>wild-type</italic> periskeletal progenitors. Fifteen proteins were found to increase and five proteins to decrease in the cell supernatant of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4F</xref>). In particular, all 15 upregulated proteins, including NCAM1, CSPG4, SDF4, NME2, TAGLN, OLFML2B, PXDN, COL4A1, FSTL1, TPI1, MFGE8, COL1A2, COL1A1, HSPG2, and COL3A1, have been identified in the osteoblastic cell secretome or in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation or functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Western blot verified upregulation of two of these proteins, COL1A1 and TAGLN, in the cell supernatant of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> vs. <italic>wild-type</italic> periskeletal progenitors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). Notably, the secretome analysis did not detect common SASP factors, such as cytokines and chemokines, in the secretory profile of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors, probably due to their small molecular weights and the technical limitations of the mass-spec analysis. Taken together, these results demonstrate a secretory phenotype and paracrine actions of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors.

<p>Furthermore, to verify the efficacy of senolytic drugs in treating the periskeletal bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice, we used another senolytic drug Navitoclax (ABT-263), which is a BCL-2 family inhibitor and specifically induces apoptosis of senescent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].

<p>The LysoTracker Red DND-99 trace and the immunostaining of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) showed positive staining in many of the enlarged vesicles in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A, B</xref>). The quantification of the number and average size of LAMP1 stained vesicles were further performed in ATDC5 cells with or without <italic>Chmp5</italic> deletion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Next, the number and size of the vesicles stained for the late endosome marker RAB7 also increased markedly in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient relative to <italic>wild-type</italic> skeletal progenitors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E, F</xref>). Meanwhile, many of these accumulated vesicles were double positive for LAMP1 and RAB7 (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C, D</xref>), suggesting that they are terminal compartments in the endocytic pathway. Accordingly, the transmission electron microscopy demonstrated a significant accumulation of MVB-like and lysosome-like structures with different electronic density in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the function of the endocytic pathway, we used a pH-sensitive fluorescent EGF conjugate and traced the degradation of the internalized EGF receptor in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> vs. <italic>wild-type</italic> periskeletal progenitors. <italic>Chmp5</italic> deficiency significantly delayed the degradation of the EGF conjugate in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>), indicating altered function of the endocytic pathway. It should be noted that the early endosomes of EEA1<sup>+</sup> also increased slightly in approximately 10% of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors, while the recycling endosomes of RAB11<sup>+</sup> and the TGN38<sup>+</sup> trans-Golgi network were relatively normal (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6E</xref>). These results demonstrate that CHMP5 deficiency in skeletal progenitors causes the accumulation of late endosomes and lysosomes and disrupts the function of the endolysosomal pathway.</p>
<p>To dissect the molecular mechanism of CHMP5 that regulates the endolysosomal pathway, we performed a proteomic analysis in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>wild-type</italic> periskeletal progenitors. Bioinformatic analyses of proteomic data showed that VPS4A is one of the most significant decreased proteins in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> compared to <italic>wild-type</italic> periskeletal progenitors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). The decrease in the VPS4A protein in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors was verified by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>), while the <italic>Vps4a</italic> mRNA did not show a significant change in the RNA-seq analysis (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6F</xref>). On the other hand, when CHMP5 was overexpressed by transfection of a CHMP5 vector into HEK-293T cells, the level of VPS4A protein increased significantly and <italic>VPS4A</italic> mRNA was not significantly affected (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6G, H</xref>). These results indicate that CHMP5 is essential in maintaining the VPS4A protein. Since VPS4A is a critical ATPase mediating the function of the ESCRT-III protein complex, the reduction of VPS4A protein could be responsible for endolysosomal dysfunction in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deleted skeletal progenitors.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial dysfunction is responsible for cell senescence in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deleted skeletal progenitors</title>
<p>A remaining question is how <italic>Chmp5</italic> deficiency and endolysosomal dysfunction cause skeletal cell senescence.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, our results reveal the role and mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of cell senescence and bone formation in osteogenic cells. In normal skeletal progenitor cells, CHMP5 is essential in maintaining the VPS4A protein, a critical AAA ATPase for the functions of the ESCRT-III protein complex. The deficiency of CHMP5 decreases the VSP4A protein and causes the accumulation of dysfunctional late endosomes (MVB), lysosomes, and mitochondria, which induce skeletal cell senescence and result in increased bone formation through a combination of cell-autonomous and paracrine mechanisms (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>). Strikingly, elimination of senescent cells using senolytic drugs is effective in mitigating abnormal bone formation.</p>
<p>The role of CHMP5 in cell senescence has not been reported. As the mechanisms and functions of cell senescence could be highly heterogeneous depending on inducers, tissue and cell contexts, and other factors such as âtimeâ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], there is currently no universal molecular marker to define all types of cell senescence. In this study, <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors show multiple canonical features of senescent cells, including increased p16 and p21 proteins and Î³H2Ax<sup>+</sup> cells, cell cycle arrest, elevated secretory phenotype, accumulation and dysfunction of lysosomes and mitochondria. Also, <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice show dramatic aging-related phenotypes, including hair loss, joint stiffness/contracture, decreased bone strength, or gradual loss of muscle mass and functions. Importantly, senolytic drugs markedly improve musculoskeletal abnormalities and increase animal motility in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice. These results reveal the role of CHMP5 in controlling the senescence of skeletal cells.</p>
<p>CHMP5 has been reported to regulate VPS4 activity, which catalyzes the disassembly of the ESCRT-III protein complex from late endosomes/MVBs, by binding directly to the VPS4 protein or other protein partners such as LIP5 and Brox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. However, it remains unknown how CHMP5 regulates VPS4 activity. Our results in this study show that CHMP5 is necessary to maintain the VPS4A protein but does not affect the level of VPS4A mRNA, suggesting that CHMP5 regulates VPS4 activity by maintaining the level of the VPS4A protein. However, the mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of the VPS4A protein has not yet been studied. Since CHMP5 can recruit the deubiquitinating enzyme USP15 to stabilize IÎºBÎ± in osteoclasts by suppressing ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], it is also possible that CHMP5 stabilizes the VPS4A protein by recruiting deubiquitinating enzymes and regulating the ubiquitination of VPS4A, which needs to be clarified in future studies. Notably, mutations in the <italic>VPS4A</italic> gene in humans can cause multisystemic diseases, including musculoskeletal abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] (OMIM: 619273), suggesting that normal expression and function of VPS4A are important for musculoskeletal physiology. The roles of VPS4A in regulating musculoskeletal biology and cell senescence should be further explored in future studies.</p>
<p>The upstream signaling that regulates CHMP5 expression in osteogenic cells is unclear. Previous studies showed that muramyl-dipeptide and lipopolysaccharide upregulate CHMP5 expression in human monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Whether the mechanism also occurs in osteogenic cells remains to be determined, especially since many molecular and cellular mechanisms are cell lineage/type dependent. In addition, an earlier study showed that <italic>Rank</italic> haploinsufficiency in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice (<italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup>;Rank<sup>+/â</sup></italic>) could greatly reverse skeletal abnormalities in these animals, including periskeletal overgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Therefore, RANK receptor signaling may function upstream of CHMP5. However, whether RANK is expressed in osteogenic cells needs additional studies to clarify. Otherwise, other epigenetic, transcriptional, translational, or post-translational mechanisms may also play a role in the regulation of CHMP5 expression in osteogenic lineage cells in physiological and pathological contexts.</p>
<p>A previous study using the <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mouse model defined a function of CHMP5 in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation by tuning NF-ÎºB signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. While the evidence on the role of CHMP5 in osteoclastogenesis is robust in that study, our results in the current study provide compelling evidence on the role of CHMP5 in bone formation in osteogenic cells. Furthermore, the function of CHMP5 in restricting bone formation was confirmed in the <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mouse model and in the MC3T3-E1 cell model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Therefore, it is probable that both osteoclast and osteoblast lineage cells contribute to bone deformation in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice. However, the previous study by Greenblatt et al. did not find endolysosomal abnormalities in osteoclasts after <italic>Chmp5</italic> deletion, and in that study cell senescence and mitochondrial functions were not measured. Also, a previous study by Adoro et al. did not detect endolysosomal abnormalities in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient developmental T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Since both osteoclasts and T cells are of hematopoietic origin, and meanwhile osteogenic cells and MEFs, which show endolysosomal abnormalities after CHMP5 deficiency, are of mesenchymal origin, it turns out that the function of CHMP5 in regulating the endolysosomal pathway could be cell lineage-specific, which remains clarified in future studies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is unclear whether the effect of senolytic drugs in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice involves targeting osteoclasts other than osteogenic cells, as osteoclast senescence has not yet been evaluated. However, the efficacy of Q + D in targeting osteogenic cells, which is the focus of the current study, was confirmed in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-E</xref>). Additionally, Q + D caused a higher cell apoptotic ratio in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> compared to <italic>wild-type</italic> periskeletal progenitors in <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), demonstrating the effectiveness of Q + D in targeting osteogenic cells in the <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> model. Furthermore, an alternative senolytic drug ABT-263 could also ameliorate periskeletal bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Together, these results confirm that osteogenic cell senescence is responsible for the bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice and senolytic treatments are effective in alleviating these skeletal disorders.</p>
<p>Notably, aging is associated with decreased osteogenic capacity in marrow stromal cells, which is related to conditions with low bone mass, such as osteoporosis. Rather, aging is also accompanied by increased ossification or mineralization in musculoskeletal soft tissues, such as tendons and ligaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. In particular, the abnormal periskeletal overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice was predominantly mapped to the insertion sites of tendons and ligaments on the bone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>), which is consistent with changes during aging and suggests that mechanical stress at these sites could contribute to the aberrant bone growth. These results suggest that skeletal stem/progenitor cells at different sites of musculoskeletal tissues could demonstrate different, even opposite outcomes in osteogenesis, due to cell senescence.</p>
<p>In addition, there was also a mild increase in apoptotic cells in the population of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors (approximately 5%). Since anti-apoptotic treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-Oph could not reverse the decrease in cell number in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors, cell apoptosis may not be the main cause of the decrease in cell proliferation rate in these progenitors. It should be noted that although senescent cells are generally resistant to apoptosis, the gradual accumulation of dysfunctional lysosomes and mitochondria in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors could result in overload of toxic macromolecules and metabolites, which could activate the apoptotic pathway to eliminate severely damaged cells. Otherwise, CHMP5 may regulate cell senescence and apoptosis through different mechanisms.</p>
<p>In summary, we have revealed the role of CHMP5 in the regulation of cell senescence and bone formation in osteogenic cells. This study also confirms the essential function of CHMP5 in the endolysosomal pathway that involves the regulation of the VPS4A protein. Additionally, mitochondrial functions are impaired with CHMP5 deletion, which is responsible for cell senescence. Future studies should explore the mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of mitochondrial functions. Since <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice recapitulate many cellular and phenotypic features of musculoskeletal lesions in lysosomal storage disease, these animals could be used as preclinical models to investigate the mechanism and test therapeutic drugs for these intractable disorders.</p>

Cas9, gRNA, and targeting vectors were co-injected into fertilized eggs for gene-edited mouse production and pups were genotyped by PCR followed by sequencing analysis.

<p>The sorted <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors were subjected to RNA-seq For library preparation, 100 ng of total RNA from each sample was subjected to rRNA depletion with the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturerâs manual. Subsequently, the rRNA-depleted RNA was used to build the RNA-seq library with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturerâs manual. The index of each RNA-seq library was introduced using NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Each RNA-seq library was analyzed by the fragment analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies) and quantified by the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems) according to the manufacturerâs manual. An equal amount of each RNA-seq library was mixed for sequencing in one lane of Illumnia HiSeq3000 in paired-end 150 base mode (Illumina).</p>
<p>The raw Illumina pair-end reads were first aligned with ribosomal RNA (GenBank ID BK000964.1) with Bowtie2 v2.2.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>].

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work advances our understanding of CHMP5's role in regulating osteogenesis through its impact on cellular senescence. The evidence supporting the conclusion is <bold>convincing</bold> and the revised manuscript is largely improved. This paper holds potential interest for skeletal biologists who study the pathogenesis of age-associated skeletal disorders.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript presents a significant and rigorous investigation into the role of CHMP5 in regulating bone formation and cellular senescence. The study provides compelling evidence that CHMP5 is essential for maintaining endolysosomal function and controlling mitochondrial ROS levels, thereby preventing the senescence of skeletal progenitor cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that the deletion of Chmp5 results in endolysosomal dysfunction, elevated mitochondrial ROS, and ultimately enhanced bone formation through both autonomous and paracrine mechanisms. The innovative use of senolytic drugs to ameliorate musculoskeletal abnormalities in Chmp5-deficient mice is a novel and critical finding, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for musculoskeletal disorders linked to endolysosomal dysfunction.</p>
<p>Comments on the latest version:</p>
<p>My concerns were addressed.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript presents a significant and rigorous investigation into the role of CHMP5 in regulating bone formation and cellular senescence. The study provides compelling evidence that CHMP5 is essential for maintaining endolysosomal function and controlling mitochondrial ROS levels, thereby preventing the senescence of skeletal progenitor cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that the deletion of Chmp5 results in endolysosomal dysfunction, elevated mitochondrial ROS, and ultimately enhanced bone formation through both autonomous and paracrine mechanisms. The innovative use of senolytic drugs to ameliorate musculoskeletal abnormalities in Chmp5-deficient mice is a novel and critical finding, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for musculoskeletal disorders linked to endolysosomal dysfunction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript requires a deeper discussion or exploration of CHMP5's roles and a more refined analysis of senolytic drug specificity and effects. This would greatly enhance the comprehensiveness and clarity of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these insightful comments. In the revised manuscript, we have expanded the discussion of the distinct roles of CHMP5 in different cell types. Specifically, we add the following sentences (Lines 433-439 in the combined manuscript):</p>
<p>âAlso, a previous study by Adoro et al. did not detect endolysosomal abnormalities in Chmp5 deficient developmental T cells [1]. Since both osteoclasts and T cells are of hematopoietic origin, and meanwhile osteogenic cells and MEFs, which show endolysosomal abnormalities after CHMP5 deficiency, are of mesenchymal origin, it turns out that the function of CHMP5 in regulating endolysosomal pathway could be cell lineage-specific, which remains clarified in future studies.â</p>
<p>In addition, we tested another senolytic drug Navitoclax (ABT-263), which is a BCL-2 family inhibitor and induces apoptosis of senescent cells, in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice. Micro-CT analysis showed that ABT-263 could also improve periskeletal bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice (Fig. 5F). Furthermore, we have also discussed the potential off-target effects of senolytic drugs in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we added the following paragraph (Lines 441-451):</p>
<p>âFurthermore, it is unclear whether the effect of senolytic drugs in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice involves targeting osteoclasts other than osteogenic cells, as osteoclast senescence has not yet been evaluated. However, the efficacy of Q + D in targeting osteogenic cells, which is the focus of the current study, was confirmed in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice (Fig. 5C-E). Additionally, Q + D caused a higher cell apoptotic ratio in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> compared to <italic>wild-type</italic> periskeletal progenitors in ex vivo culture (Fig. 5A), demonstrating the effectiveness of Q + D in targeting osteogenic cells in the <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> model. Furthermore, an alternative senolytic drug ABT-263 could also ameliorate periskeletal bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice (Fig. 5F). Together, these results confirm that osteogenic cell senescence is responsible for the bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice, and senolytic treatments are effective in alleviating these skeletal disorders.â</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors try to show the importance of CHMP5 for skeletal development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings of this manuscript are interesting. The mouse phenotypes are well done and are of interest to a broader (bone) field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The mechanistic insights are mediocre, and the cellular senescence aspect poor.</p>
<p>In total, it has not been shown that there are actual senescent cells that are reduced after D+Qtreatment. These statements need to be scaled back substantially.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestive comments. We have added additional results to strengthen the senescent phenotypes of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitor cells, including significant enrichment of the SAUL_SEN_MAYO geneset (positively correlated with cell senescence) and the KAMMINGA_SENESCENCE geneset (negatively correlated with cell senescence) at the transcriptional level by GSEA analysis of RNA-seq data (Fig. S3C), and the increase of Î³H2Ax<sup>+</sup>;GFP<sup>+</sup> cells at periskeletal overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup>;Rosa26<sup>26mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice vs. the periosteum of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>26mTmG/+</sup></italic> control mice (Fig. 3E). These results further advocate for the senescent phenotypes of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the combination of Q + D caused a higher cell apoptotic ratio in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> vs. <italic>wildtype</italic> periskeletal progenitors in ex vivo culture (Fig. 5A), suggesting their effectiveness in targeting periskeletal progenitor cell senescence in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice. Furthermore, we tested an alternative senolytic drug ABT-263, which is an inhibitor of the BCL-2 family and induces apoptosis of senescent cells, in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice, and ABT-263 could also alleviate periskeletal bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice (Fig. 5F). Together, these results demonstrate that osteogenic cell senescence is responsible for abnormal bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient mice and that senolytic drugs are effective in improving these skeletal disorders.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Zhang et al. reported that CHMP5 restricts bone formation by controlling endolysosomemitochondrion-mediated cell senescence. The effects of CHMP5 on osteoclastic bone resorption and bone turnover have been reported previously (PMID: 26195726), in which study the aberrant bone phenotype was observed in the CHMP5-ctsk-CKO mouse model, using the same mouse model, Zhang et al., report a novel role of CHMP5 on osteogenesis through affecting cell senescence. Overall, it is an interesting study and provides new insights in the field of cell senescence and bone.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Analyzed the bone phenotype OF CHMP5-periskeletal progenitor-CKO mouse model and found the novel role of senescent cells on osteogenesis and migration.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There are a lot of papers that have reported that senescence impairs osteogenesis of skeletal stem cells. In this study, the author claimed that Chmp5 deficiency induces skeletal progenitor cell senescence and enhanced osteogenesis. Can the authors explain the controversial results?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Different skeletal stem cell populations in time and space have been identified and reported [2-6]. The present study shows that <italic>Chmp5</italic> deficiency in periskeletal (<italic>Ctsk</italic>-Cre) and endosteal (<italic>Dmp1</italic>-Cre) osteogenic cells causes cell senescence and aberrant bone formation. Although cell senescence during aging can impair the osteogenesis of marrow stromal cells (MSCs), which contributes to diseases with low bone mass such as osteoporosis, aging can also increase heterotopic ossification or mineralization in musculoskeletal soft tissues such as ligaments and tendons [7]. Notably, the abnormal periskeletal bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice was mainly mapped to insertion sites of tendons and ligaments on the bone (Fig. 1A and E), consistent with changes during aging. More broadly, aging can also cause abnormal ossification or mineralization in other body tissues, such as the heart valve [8, 9]. These different results reflect an aberrant state of ossification or mineralization in musculoskeletal tissues and throughout the body during aging. Based on the reviewerâs comment, we have discussed these results in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we add the following paragraph (Lines 453-462 in the combined manuscript):</p>
<p>âNotably, aging is associated with decreased osteogenic capacity in marrow stromal cells, which is related to conditions with low bone mass, such as osteoporosis. Rather, aging is also accompanied by increased ossification or mineralization in musculoskeletal soft tissues, such as tendons and ligaments [7]. In particular, the abnormal periskeletal overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice was predominantly mapped to insertion sites of tendons and ligaments on the bone (Fig. 1A and E), which is consistent with changes during aging and suggests that mechanical stress at these sites could contribute to the aberrant bone growth. These results suggest that skeletal stem/progenitor cells at different sites of musculoskeletal tissues could demonstrate different, even opposite outcomes in osteogenesis, due to cell senescence.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Co-culture of Chmp5-KO periskeletal progenitors with WT ones should be conducted to detect the migration and osteogenesis of WT cells in response to Chmp5-KO-induced senescent cells. In addition, the co-culture of WT periskeletal progenitors with senescent cells induced by H2O2, radiation, or from aged mice would provide more information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the present study, the increased proliferation and osteogenesis of CD45-;CD31-;GFP- periskeletal progenitors were shown as paracrine mechanisms of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors to promote bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice (Figs. 4F, G, and S4C-E). According to the reviewerâs suggestion, we have carried out the coculture experiment and the coculture of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> with <italic>wild-type</italic> skeletal progenitors could promote osteogenesis of <italic>wild-type</italic> cells (Fig. S4B), which further supports the paracrine effect of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors.</p>
<p>In addition, the cause and outcome of cell senescence could be highly heterogeneous, and different causes of cell senescence can cause significantly distinct, even opposite outcomes. Although the coculture experiments of WT periskeletal progenitors with senescent cells induced by H2O2, radiation, or from aged mice are very interesting, these are beyond the scope of the current study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Many EVs were secreted from Chmp5-deleted periskeletal progenitors, compared to the rarely detected EVs around WT cells. Since EVs of BMSCs or osteoprogenitors show strong effects of promoting osteogenesis, did the EVs contribute to the enhanced osteogenesis induced by Chmp5defeciency? Authorâs response:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting question. Although we did not separately test the effect of EVs from <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors on the osteogenesis of WT skeletal progenitors, the CD45-;CD31-;GFP- skeletal progenitor cells from <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice have an increased capacity of osteogenesis compared to corresponding cells from control animals (Figs. 4G and S4D). Also, the coculture of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient with <italic>wild-type</italic> skeletal progenitors could enhance the osteogenesis of <italic>wild-type</italic> cells (Fig. S4B). These results suggest that EVs from <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors could promote osteogenesis of neighboring WT skeletal progenitors. The specific functions of EVs of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors in regulating osteogenesis will be further investigated in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) EVs secreted from senescent cells propagate senescence and impair osteogenesis, why do EVs secreted from senescent cells induced by Chmp5-defeciency have opposite effects on osteogenesis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The question is similar to comments #1 and #3 from this reviewer. First, the manifestations (including the secretory phenotype) and outcomes of cell senescence could be highly heterogeneous depending on inducers, tissue and cell contexts, and other factors such as âtimeâ. Different causes of cell senescence could lead to different manifestations and outcomes, which have been discussed in the manuscript (Lines 381-383). Similarly, as mentioned above, skeletal stem/progenitor cells at different sites of musculoskeletal tissues could also demonstrate distinct, even opposite outcomes, as a result of cell senescence (Line 453-462). Second, CD45-;CD31-;GFP- periskeletal progenitor cells from <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup>;Rosa26<sup>26mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice have an increased capacity of proliferation and osteogenesis compared to corresponding cells from control animals (Figs. 4F, G and S4C-E). Furthermore, the conditioned medium of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors promoted the proliferation of ATDC5 cells (Fig. 4E) and the coculture of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>wild-type</italic> periskeletal progenitors could enhance the osteogenesis of <italic>wild-type</italic> cells (Fig. S4B). Taken together, these results show paracrine actions of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors in promoting aberrant bone growth in <italic>Chmp5</italic> conditional knockout mice. We also refer the reviewer to our responses to comments #1 and #3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The Chmp5-ctsk mice show accelerated aging-related phenotypes, such as hair loss and joint stiffness. Did Ctsk also label cells in hair follicles or joint tissue?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting question. Although we did not check the expression of CHMP5 in hair follicles, which is outside the scope of the present study, the result in Fig. 1E showed the expression of <italic>Ctsk</italic> in joint ligaments, tendons, and their insertion sites on the bone (Lines 108-111). Notably, the periskeletal bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice was mainly mapped to insertion sites of ligaments and tendons on the bone, which have been discussed in the revised manuscript (Lines 456-460).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Fifteen proteins were found to increase and five proteins to decrease in the cell supernatant of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors. How about SASP factors in the secretory profile?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The SASP phenotype and related factors of senescent cells could be highly heterogeneous depending on inducers, cell types, and timing of senescence [10, 11]. Most of the proteins we identified in the secretome analysis have previously been reported in the secretory profile of osteoblasts or involved in the regulation of osteogenesis. Although we were interested in changes in common SASP factors, such as cytokines and chemokines, the experiment did not detect these factors, probably due to their small molecular weights and the technical limitations of the mass-spec analysis. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we add the following sentences (Lines 258-261):</p>
<p>âNotably, the secretome analysis did not detect common SASP factors, such as cytokines and chemokines, in the secretory profile of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors, probably due to their small molecular weights and the technical limitations of the mass-spec analysis.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) D+Q treatment mitigates musculoskeletal pathologies in Chmp5 conditional knockout mice. In the previously published paper (CHMP5 controls bone turnover rates by dampening NF-ÎºB activity in osteoclasts), inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption rescues the aberrant bone phenotype of the Chmp5 conditional knockout mice. Whether the effects of D+Q on bone overgrowth is because of the inhibition of bone resorption?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important question. We have discussed the potential off-target effect of senolytic drugs in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we add the following paragraph (Lines 441451):</p>
<p>âFurthermore, it is unclear whether the effect of senolytic drugs in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice involves targeting osteoclasts other than osteogenic cells, as osteoclast senescence has not yet been evaluated. However, the efficacy of Q + D in targeting osteogenic cells, which is the focus of the current study, was confirmed in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice (Fig. 5C-E). Additionally, Q + D caused a higher cell apoptotic ratio in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> compared to <italic>wild-type</italic> periskeletal progenitors in ex vivo culture (Fig. 5A), demonstrating the effectiveness of Q + D in targeting osteogenic cells in the <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> model. Furthermore, an alternative senolytic drug ABT-263 could also ameliorate periskeletal bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice (Fig. 5F). Together, these results confirm that osteogenic cell senescence is responsible for the bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice and senolytic treatments are effective in alleviating these skeletal disorders.â</p>

<p>(8) The role of VPS4A in cell senescence should be measured to support the conclusion that CHMP5 regulates osteogenesis by affecting cell senescence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The current study mainly reports the function of CHMP5 in the regulation of skeletal progenitor cell senescence and osteogenesis. The roles of VPS4A in cell senescence and skeletal biology will be further explored in future studies. We have discussed this in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we add the following sentence (Lines 407-409):</p>
<p>âThe roles of VPS4A in regulating musculoskeletal biology and cell senescence should be further explored in future studies.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Cell senescence with markers, such as p21 and H2AX, co-stained with GFP should be performed in the mouse models to indicate the effects of Chmp5 on cell senescence in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to the reviewerâs suggestion, we have already performed immunostaining of Î³H2AX and colocalization with GFP in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup>;Rosa26<sup>26mTmG/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>26mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice. The results showed that there are more Î³H2AX+;GFP+ cells in the periskeletal overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup>;Rosa26<sup>26mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice compared to the periosteum of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>26mTmG/+</sup></italic> control animals. Because the Î³H2AX staining could stand as one of the critical results supporting the senescent phenotype of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors. We have added these results to Fig. 3E and put Fig. 3F in the original manuscript into Fig. S3E due to the space limitation in Figure 3. In sum, these results further enrich the senescent manifestations of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) ADTC5 cell as osteochondromas cells line, is not a good cell model of periskeletal progenitors.</p>
<p>Maybe primary periskeletal progenitor cell is a better choice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>ATDC5 cells are typically used as a chondrocyte progenitor cell line. However, our previous study showed that ATDC5 cells could also be used as a reasonable cell model for periskeletal progenitors [12], which was mentioned in the manuscript (Lines 202-204). In addition, the results of ATDC5 cells were also verified in primary periskeletal progenitor cells in this study.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Despite the robust experimental framework and intriguing findings, there are several areas that require further attention to enhance the manuscript's overall quality and clarity:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the tissue-specific roles of CHMP5, particularly in addressing why CHMP5 deficiency results in distinct outcomes in osteogenic cells as opposed to other cell types, such as osteoclasts. Expanding the discussion would greatly enhance the comprehensiveness and clarity of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on the reviewerâs suggestion, we have expanded the discussion of the distinct roles of CHMP5 in different cell types. Specifically, we state (Lines 433-439):</p>
<p>âAlso, a previous study by Adoro et al. did not detect endolysosomal abnormalities in _Chmp5_deficient developmental T cells [1]. Since both osteoclasts and T cells are of hematopoietic origin, and meanwhile osteogenic cells and MEFs, which show endolysosomal abnormalities after CHMP5 deficiency, are of mesenchymal origin, it turns out that the function of CHMP5 in regulating the endolysosomal pathway could be cell lineage-specific, which remains clarified in future studies.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Given that Figures 1 and 2 suggest that the absence of Chmp5 (CHMP5Ctsk &amp; CHMP5Dmp1) leads to disordered proliferation or mineralization of bone or osteoblasts, the manuscript should delve deeper into the potential links between these findings and aging-related processes, such as age-associated fibrosis. Providing clearer explanations and discussion on these connections would help present a more cohesive understanding of the results in the context of aging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this favorable suggestion. A feature of aging is heterotopic ossification or mineralization in musculoskeletal soft tissues, including tendons and ligaments [7]. Notably, the abnormal periskeletal bone formation in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice in this study was mostly mapped to the insertion sites of tendons and ligaments on the bone (Fig. 1A and E), which is consistent with changes during aging and suggests that mechanical stress at these sites could be a contributor to periskeletal overgrowth. We have discussed these results in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we add the following paragraph (Lines 453-462):</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The manuscript would be improved by a more refined analysis in Figures 3 and 5, particularly in relation to the use of senolytic drugs. Furthermore, a detailed discussion of the specificity and potential off-target effects of quercetin and dasatinib treatments in Chmp5-deficient mice would strengthen the therapeutic claims of these drugs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 3, we have added additional experiments and results to strengthen the senescent phenotypes of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors, including significant enrichment of the SAUL_SEN_MAYO geneset (positively correlated with cell senescence) and the KAMMINGA_SENESCENCE geneset (negatively correlated with cell senescence) at the transcriptional level by GSEA analysis of RNA-seq data (Fig. S3F), and an increase of Î³H2AX+;GFP+ cells at the site of periskeletal overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup>;Rosa26<sup>26mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice compared to the periosteum of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>26mTmG/+</sup></italic> control mice (Fig. 3E). These results further enrich the senescent molecular manifestations of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors.</p>
<p>In Figure 5, we used an alternative senolytic drug ABT-263 to treat <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice, and this antisenescence treatment could also alleviate periskeletal bone overgrowth in this mouse model (Fig. 5F). Furthermore, we have also discussed the potential off-target effects of senolytic drugs in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice. Specifically, we add the following paragraph (Lines 441-451):</p>

<p>(4) The manuscript could be further enhanced by providing more details into how CHMP5 specifically regulates VPS4A protein levels. Notably, this is a central aspect of the paper linking CHMP5 to endolysosomal dysfunction.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion. One of the novel findings of this study is that CHMP5 regulates the protein level of VPS4A without affecting its RNA transcription. The mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of VPS4A protein will be reported in a separate study. However, we have discussed the potential mechanism in the manuscript (Lines 399-409). Specifically, we state:</p>
<p>âHowever, the mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of the VPS4A protein has not yet been studied. Since CHMP5 can recruit the deubiquitinating enzyme USP15 to stabilize IÎºBÎ± in osteoclasts by suppressing ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation [13], it is also possible that CHMP5 stabilizes the VPS4A protein by recruiting deubiquitinating enzymes and regulating the ubiquitination of VPS4A, which needs to be clarified in future studies. Notably, mutations in the <italic>VPS4A</italic> gene in humans can cause multisystemic diseases, including musculoskeletal abnormalities [14] (OMIM: 619273), suggesting that normal expression and function of VPS4A are important for musculoskeletal physiology. The roles of VPS4A in regulating musculoskeletal biology and cell senescence should be further explored in future studies.â</p>

<p>(5) The discussion section could be enriched by more thoroughly integrating the current findings with previous studies on CHMP5, particularly those exploring its role in osteoclast differentiation and NF-ÎºB signaling.</p>

<p>The comment is similar to comment #1 of this reviewer. We have expanded the discussion of the distinct functions of CHMP5 in osteoclasts and osteogenic cells (Lines 424-439). We also refer the reviewer to our response to comment #1.</p>

<p>(3) Results</p>
<p>The mouse phenotype experiments are well done.</p>

<p>Cdkn2a and Cdkn1a? These could easily be highlighted in Figure 3B.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Hmga1, Hmga2, Trp53, Ets1, and Txn1 are within the geneset of Reactome Cellular Senescence. Notably, only the protein levels of CDKN2A (p16) and CDKN1A (p21) showed significant changes (Fig. 3D) and the mRNA levels of <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> did not show significant changes according to RNAseq data. We have added the result of <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> mRNA levels to Fig. S3D in the revised manuscript. Also, we add the following sentences in the text (Lines 193-195):</p>

<p>The symptom &quot;joint stiffness/contracture&quot; could also be due to skeletal abnormalities related to Chmp5Ctsk.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Joint stiffness/contracture during aging is mainly the result of heterotopic ossification or mineralization in musculoskeletal soft tissues, including ligaments, tendons, joint capsules, and their insertion sites on the bone. Notably, the periskeletal bone overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice was mainly mapped to the insertion sites of tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules on the bone, which are consistent with changes during aging. These results have been discussed in the revised manuscript (Lines 456-460).</p>

<p>Overall, cellular senescence needs at least Cdkn2a and/or Cdkn1a and another marker, i.e. SenMayo or telomere-associated foci or senescence-associated distortion of satellites.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have run GSEA with the SenMayo geneset and the result is added in Fig. S3F in the revised manuscript. Also, we ran another geneset KAMMINGA_SENESCENCE which includes genes downregulated in cell senescence. Both genesets are significantly enriched in <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors based on RNA-seq data (Fig. S3F).</p>
<p>In addition, we also performed immunostaining for another senescence marker Î³H2AX and the results showed that there are more Î³H2AX+;GFP+ cells in periskeletal overgrowth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup>;Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice compared to the periosteum of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>26mTmG/+</sup></italic> control animals (Fig. 3E).</p>

<p>The existence of vesicles does not necessarily indicate more SASP. Authorâs response:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the secretion of extracellular vesicles is not directly correlated with the SASP. In this study, the increased secretory vesicles around <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> periskeletal progenitors represent a secretory phenotype of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors and have paracrine effects in the abnormal bone growth in <italic>Chmp5</italic> conditional knockout mice as shown in Figs. 4 and S4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The Chmp5-deficient cells COULD promote the proliferation and osteogenesis of other progenitors, but they might as well not. And if this is through the SASP, is completely unresolved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>CD45<sup>-</sup>;CD31<sup>-</sup>;GFP<sup>-</sup> periskeletal progenitor cells from <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup>;Rosa26<sup>26mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice showed an increased capacity of proliferation and osteogenesis compared to the corresponding cells from control animals (Figs. 4F, G, and S4C-E). Also, the conditioned medium of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient skeletal progenitors promoted the proliferation of ATDC5 cells (Fig. 4E). In addition, the coculture of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>wild-type</italic> periskeletal progenitors could enhance the osteogenesis of <italic>wild-type</italic> cells (Fig. S4B). These results demonstrate the paracrine actions of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors in promoting aberrant bone growth in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> and <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice. However, factors that mediate the paracrine effects of <italic>Chmp5</italic>-deficient periskeletal progenitors remain further clarified in future studies.</p>

<p>Figure B: Was the bone's overall thickness quantified?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Fig. 5B, bone morphology in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Ctsk</sup></italic> mice is irregular and difficult to quantify. Therefore, we did not qualify the overall bone thickness in these animals. However, the thickness of the cortical bone was measured by micro-CT analysis in <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice after treatment with Q + D (Fig. 5E). Also, we have added the image of the gross femur thickness of <italic>Chmp5<sup>Dmp1</sup></italic> mice before and after treatment with Q + D in Fig. 5E.</p>
