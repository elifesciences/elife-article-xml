<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In this study, we present an allosteric mechanism for T cell receptor (TCR) triggering upon binding a peptide-MHC complex (pMHC), in which a conformational change in the TCR upon pMHC binding controls the mobility of the CD3 proteins. We found that the TCRβ FG loop serves as a gatekeeper, preventing accidental triggering, while the connecting peptide acts as a hinge for essential conformational changes in the TCR. Atomistic simulations and cell-based experiments with genetically modified connecting peptides demonstrate that rigidified hinge residues result in excessive CD3 dynamics and hypersensitivity to pMHC binding. Our model thus provides a clear connection between extracellular TCR-pMHC binding and changes in CD3 dynamic that propagate from outside to inside the cell.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>T cell receptors (TCRs) specifically recognize peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The TCR is a heterodimer composed of an ɑ and a β chain that forms a complex with three CD3 dimers (CD3γε, CD3δε and CD3ζζ) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The binding of agonistic, but not antagonistic, peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes results in Lck-mediated phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The ITAMs, whose phosphorylation is required for T cell activation, are located on the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3s. Current evidence suggests that the CD3 ITAMs are hidden in the membrane in the resting state, but are exposed to the cytoplasmic kinase Lck upon pMHC binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The effector functions of activated T cells range from killing infected cells to inhibition of immune responses to establishment of memory of specific peptide antigens. Although TCRs have been intensively studied for several decades, the mechanisms linking pMHC engagement to TCR triggering remain elusive. It has been difficult to rationalize how TCR-pMHC binding could result in changes in the cytoplasmic regions, since the TCR chains lack a proper cytoplasmic domain, while the CD3 proteins are too short to interact with the pMHC. The fact that the TCR and CD3 associate non-covalently further complicates the problem.</p>

<p>In the last decade, a number of models of TCR triggering and T cell activation, each emphasizing different aspects of the phenomenon, have been proposed. The relationship between initial pMHC engagement and cytoplasmic signaling is described by the <italic>mechanosensor</italic> model, in which TCRs discriminate agonistic from antagonistic pMHCs via catch bond formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In this model, pMHC binding transfers force from the pMHC-TCR interface to the TCR-CD3 interface via the TCRβ-FG loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In the <italic>kinetic proofreading</italic> model, the binding lifetime of the pMHC-TCR complex enables differentiation of agonistic pMHCs from antagonistic ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The <italic>TCR bending mechanosignal</italic> model argues that TCR-pMHC engagement alters membrane curvature, which, in turn, promotes conformational changes in the receptors that result in TCR triggering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Alternatively, in the <italic>allosteric relaxation</italic> model, TCR-pMHC binding decouples TCR and CD3ζ interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Importantly, each of these models requires a yet unknown coupling between the TCR and CD3 that must ultimately be transmitted to the cytoplasm. The coupling and transmission are crucial because the CD3 chains – not TCRɑβ – contain the ITAMs.</p>
<p>In 2019, the first full-length TCR-CD3 complex structure was determined by single particle cryo-EM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the extracellular domain (EC) of the TCR was bent with respect to the membrane. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations of the TCR showed that the angle between the TCR EC and transmembrane domain (TM) is dynamic, allowing the TCR EC to adopt a range of different conformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In 2022, the structure of a pMHC-bound TCR-CD3 complex revealed that the TCR was unchanged by the binding to a soluble pMHC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We reasoned that, since the static structures of pMHC-bound and unbound TCRs do not reveal an obvious triggering mechanism, the dynamics of the complex might hold clues. To this end, we used extensive multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interplay of TCR, CD3 and pMHC. The resulting picture is one in which CD3 dynamics plays a central role in distinguishing between bound and unbound TCRs.</p>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Description of the simulation systems</title>
<p>To study the dynamics of the TCR under resting and pMHC-engaged conditions, two simulation systems were constructed: a TCR-CD3 system and a TCR-CD3-pMHC system. The TCR-CD3 system consisted of a single TCR-CD3 complex embedded in a POPC bilayer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), while the TCR-CD3-pMHC system was composed of two opposing POPC bilayer slabs with the lower containing a TCR-CD3 complex and the upper containing a pMHC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The simulations were performed before the recently reported TCR-CD3-pMHC structure was published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>; therefore, to model the complex, we created a chimeric TCR in which the TCR transmembrane (TM) region from the De Dong (PDB: 6jxr)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> structure was docked onto the pMHC-TCR complex structure by Newell (PDB: 3qiu)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Harmonic potentials centered on the crystal structure were used to tether the TCR to the pMHC; the potentials were applied in a stepwise manner during 1.5 µs of preparatory simulations to allow the system to incrementally adjust (Figure S1). A pore was created in the pMHC-bound membrane to allow the flow of solvent between the two membrane compartments; this flow was required to permit the distance between the two membranes to fluctuate naturally. For each system, one hundred 10 µs production runs were performed, totaling 1 ms per system.</p>
<p><italic>CD3ε chains manifest a wider range of motion in the TCR-CD3-pMHC than the TCR-CD3 system</italic> Iso-occupancy surfaces were calculated to examine the distribution of the CD3ε chains in the two systems. In the TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations, the CD3ε chains sampled a larger area around the TCR compared to the TCR-CD3 simulations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). In the TCR-CD3 simulations, the iso-occupancy surface of the CD3ε chains had a clear minimum close to the position of the CD3ζ chains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). By contrast, in the TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations, the CD3ε chains completely sampled the region around the TCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the iso-occupancy surface in the TCR-CD3 simulation was not symmetric – the iso-occupancy was particularly low around the CD3ζ chain adjacent to CD3γ (CD3ζ<sup>γ</sup>). This difference was also apparent when the CD3ε chain position was expressed in polar coordinates and the density plotted in a plane parallel to the membrane: The TCR-CD3 simulations indicated an excluded region from 225-315°, which was occupied in the TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations. Taken together, these results indicate that TCR-pMHC binding results in a greater range of CD3ε motion.</p>

<p><italic>TCR-pMHC engagement resulted in fewer contacts between CD3 and the TCRβ variable domain</italic> To understand the difference in the CD3 spatial distributions in the two simulations, we next analyzed contacts between the CD3 and TCRɑ/β chains. In the TCR-CD3 simulations, the TCRβ variable domain was constantly in contact with the CD3γε dimer, but these interactions virtually disappeared in the TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations. In the TCR-CD3 systems, the TCRβ variable domain made on average 7445 (stdev 7215) contacts per simulation with CD3ε<sup>γ</sup> – the CD3ε next to CD3γ. In addition, the TCRβ variable domain made on average 1581 (stdev 2848) contacts per simulation with CD3γ. In the TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations, the number of contacts dropped to 195 (stdev 625) and 3 (stdev 14) for CD3ε<sup>γ</sup>–TCRβ and CD3γ–TCRβ variable domain contacts, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). These observations are consistent with a model in which TCR-CD3 contacts restrict CD3 movement.</p>

<title>The TCR is more extended in the TCR-CD3-pMHC complex</title>
<p>To understand the structural basis for the loss of CD3-TCR contacts and increase in CD3 dynamics upon pMHC binding, we next examined the conformation of the TCR in the two simulations. The TCR adopted a different orientation relative to the membrane in the TCR-CD3 and TCR-CD3-pMHC systems, as measured by the TCR EC tilt, the angle between the TCRβ transmembrane domain (TM) and the extracellular domain (EC) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In the TCR-CD3 system, the TCR EC folded over the CD3 proteins, and the TCR adopted predominantly bent conformations (smaller tilt angles) with a peak in the angular distribution of approximately 104° (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Such TCR bending has been observed in previous TCR-CD3 simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In contrast, in the TCR-CD3-pMHC system, the TCRs had more extended and open conformations (larger tilt angles) with a peak in the angular distribution of approximately 150°, which was close to the initial angle observed in the cryo-EM structures. Thus, upon pMHC binding, the TCR EC tilted away from the CD3 proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, the width of angular distributions was narrower in the TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of approximately 30°, compared to that in the TCR-CD3 simulations (FWHM 40°). These observations were consistent with the decrease in contacts and increase in dynamics in the TCR-CD3-pMHC systems compared with the TCR-CD3 simulations.</p>

<title>The TCR-pMHC complex acts as drawbridge for the CD3 proteins</title>
<p>These observations suggest that the binding status of the TCR affects its conformation, which, in turn, affects CD3ε movement. Upon pMHC binding, the TCR adopts a more extended conformation, which breaks contacts between the TCR variable region and the CD3 proteins, allowing the CD3ε chains to diffuse around the TCR. In this manner, the TCR-pMHC complex acts as a “drawbridge” that releases the CD3 proteins, resulting in their increased movement (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). It is reasonable to hypothesize that, over time, the increase dynamics upon drawbridge formation is transmitted to the ITAMs, ultimately resulting in their phosphorylation.</p>

<caption><title>TCR-pMHC binding acts as a drawbridge for CD3 movement</title>
<p>An unbound TCR clamps the CD3 proteins, which prevents CD3 diffusion around the TCR in the membrane (<italic>left</italic>). Upon pMHC binding (<italic>right</italic>), the TCR becomes extended, which weakens binding to CD3 and allows CD3 diffusion around the TCR. Increased CD3 movement in the membrane facilitates the release of CD3 tails in the cytosol, where the ITAMS are accessible for phosphorylation by Lck.</p></caption>

<title>The TCRβ FG loop acts as a gatekeeper</title>
<p>Changes in the TCR have been observed upon TCR-pMHC binding that have been difficult to rationalize, because they occur far from the TCR-pMHC binding interface. Notably changes in the TCRɑ AB loop, the TCRβ H3 helix, and the TCRβ FG loop were observed by NMR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). In our simulations, we observed an increase in the contacts between the TCRɑ AB loop and the TCRβ H3 helix with CD3 proteins upon TCR-pMHC binding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-D</xref> and Supplemental Figure S5). In unbound conditions the TCRɑ AB loop and the TCRβ H3 helix were out of reach of the CD3 proteins because they were bound by the TCR EC; however, upon TCR-pMHC binding, the CD3 proteins were released and moved to previously inaccessible areas of the TCR.</p>

Moreover, changes in the TCRβ FG loop have been observed upon TCR-pMHC binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In our simulations we observed that when the TCR was not bound by pMHC, the TCRβ FG loop interacted with CD3ε<sup>γ</sup> and blocked its diffusion away from the TCRβ chain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-F</xref>). Upon TCR-pMHC binding, the TCRβ FG loop moved up and no longer interacted with the CD3 proteins, which were subsequently free to diffuse around the TCRβ. TCRɑ lacks an equivalent loop, which explains the asymmetry in the iso-occupancy maps.

<title>Critical role of the connecting peptide in TCR dynamics</title>
<p>If TCR triggering depends on TCR EC movement, a change in TCR chain flexibility would be expected to affect TCR activation. We identified a conserved GxxG motif in the TCRβ connecting peptide (CP) that represents a potential hinge (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Whereas the TCRɑ CP is long and flexible, the TCRβ CP is short, which increases the importance of the two glycine residues in the hinge. Moreover, the TCRɑ and TCRβ CPs are attached to each other by a disulfide bond, which suggests that global changes in the TCR are mediated by these glycine residues. To test whether the CP in TCRβ indeed functions as a hinge, we examined double alanine (AA) or proline (PP) substitutions using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Atomistic simulations with the CHARMM36m forcefield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> of a TCR-CD3 complex in the absence of pMHC were used to assess the effect of the CP on the intrinsic flexibility of the TCR EC.</p>

<p>The atomistic simulations showed that rigidification of the CP by glycine-to-proline mutations increased CD3ε dynamics, whereas a milder mutation of both glycines to alanines did not significantly affect CD3ε dynamics (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, S6A). The mutations also changed the pattern of contacts between the TCR and CD3 chains. Both the proline and the alanine substitutions decreased the net number of interactions between the TCR variable region and CD3δε dimer as compared to wild type, but mutation to proline increased contacts between the TCRβ variable domain and CD3γ (Figure S6B). In line with the TCR-CD3 coarse-grained simulations, the wild-type and mutant TCRs adopted a bent conformation in the atomistic simulations with smaller EC-to-TM angles than that of the cryo-EM structure. The PP mutant adopted even smaller angles than the wild type, and, surprisingly, the bent conformations were decoupled from the CD3 subunits (Figure S6C-D). This suggested that the TCR tilt is not sufficient to describe the interactions between TCR and CD3. In the simulations of Pandey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, the TCR EC not only varied its tilt, but also rotated. Indeed, calculation of the TCR EC rotation showed that the proline mutant had a skewed TCR EC – the PP mutant adopted rotation angles as low as ∼75°; in contrast, rotation angles lower than 100° were almost absent in the wild-type TCR (Figure S6E-F). The skewedness of the proline TCR was also apparent from the TCR and CD3 contacts– the wild-type TCR mostly contacted the CD3δε dimer, whereas the proline mutant interacted mostly with the CD3γε dimer located on the other side of the TCR (Figure S5B). The wild-type TCR restrained CD3δ via contacts between TCRɑ and the CD3δ FG loop, but the proline mutant could not reach CD3δ due to its skewed conformation (Figure S6G-H). These <italic>in silico</italic> mutation simulations were consistent with a model in which the CP functions as a hinge for the drawbridge, and that rigidification of the hinge by proline substitution locks the bridge in a skewed state in which the TCR can no longer properly restrain the CD3 chains, resulting in their increased mobility.</p>

<p>These experiments showed that reporter cells bearing the mutant TCR were more easily activated, which suggests that rigidification of the CP by mutation to proline, and to a lesser extent to alanine, resulted in TCR hypersensitivity. This is in line with the atomistic simulations in which the proline mutant was less able to couple to the CD3 proteins due to rigidification of the CP and skewing of the TCR EC. These experiments provide support for the hypothesis that the TCR CP functions as a hinge and underlie the importance of TCR EC movement and CD3 mobility for TCR triggering.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mechanism of TCR triggering in which TCR-pMHC binding is signaled across the plasma membrane, resulting in phosphorylation of ITAMs on cytoplasmic CD3 tails, is still not fully resolved. It has been difficult to conceptualize how TCR-pMHC binding results in ITAM phosphorylation: the TCRɑβ chains lack a proper cytoplasmic domain and the CD3 proteins are too short to interact with the pMHC. In this study, the behavior of the TCR-CD3-pMHC complex was investigated using extensive multi-scale simulations, resulting in a model in which TCR-pMHC binding allows dynamic movement of the CD3 proteins.</p>
<p>Coarse-grained simulations showed that the TCR adopts a bent conformation when not bound to pMHCs. In this bound state, the TCR EC binds to the CD3 proteins, restricting their movement. The TCRβ FG loop hereby acts as a gatekeeper, preventing accidental TCR triggering by CD3 diffusion when the TCR is unbound. TCR-pMHC binding requires the TCR to elongate, breaking its interactions with the CD3 proteins and allowing them to diffuse freely. The simulations also indicated the importance of the CP, a flexible region linking the TCR’s transmembrane region with its extracellular domain, for the TCR to adopt the necessary conformational changes. The TCRα CP is longer, while the TCRβ CP is much shorter but contains two flexible glycine residues. Together the CPs allow the TCR-pMHC to act like a “drawbridge”, which either blocks the CD3 proteins or lets them pass freely.</p>
<p>Atomistic simulations and experiments provided further support for the crucial role of the TCR CP. The simulations showed that TCR-CD3 complexes in which the two glycines in the CP were replaced with prolines resulted in a skewed TCR that was less effective in retaining the CD3 proteins. This was confirmed by experiments using reporter cells transfected with either wild-type or mutant TCRs. Activation of reporter cells with the proline mutant TCR was found to be more efficient than wild type, suggesting that CD3 mobility is a key step in TCR triggering.</p>
<p>The drawbridge model provides a solution to how TCR-pMHC binding is signaled to the CD3 proteins but does not reveal how increased CD3 mobility upon TCR-pMHC binding results in ITAM phosphorylation. The predominant theory is that the ITAMs are sequestered in the membrane, but that changes in the lipid microenvironment upon TCR-pMHC binding results in their release from the membrane and their exposure to Lck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. It is reasonable to hypothesize that, in the resting state, when the TCR is not bound to pMHC, the CD3 cytosolic tails are sequestered in lipid rafts. Increased CD3 dynamics upon TCR-pMHC binding would likely disrupt these lipid rafts by inducing a disordered phase, dispersing the lipids. If ITAMs in particular associate with certain lipids in these rafts, such as charged lipids, disruption of lipid rafts could result in the release of ITAMs. This hypothesis is supported by two experimental observations: first, lipid rafts are known to be present in the T cell membrane and are involved in T cell signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>; second, cholesterol, which induces liquid-ordered phases and is an important component of lipid rafts, has been shown to decrease TCR triggering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Further work will be needed to elucidate the detailed implications of CD3 dynamics on ITAM phosphorylation, but the overall notion that triggering is associated with greater CD3 dynamics appears sound.</p>
<p>The drawbridge model posits that the TCR is flexible and adopts a bent conformation when not bound to a pMHC. However, this conformation has not yet been directly observed experimentally; rather, in the three reported single particle cryo-EM structures of the TCR-CD3 complex, the TCR exists in an extended conformation, similar to that observed in our TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. One possible explanation for the structural homogeneity observed in the reported single particle cryo-EM structures is that, because of the experimental procedures used in the preparation of the TCR-CD3 complex for structure determination, the physiological environment of the cell membrane had to be removed. In addition, it was also required to stabilize the complex by the use of chemical crosslinking, introduction of antibodies or the use of specialized cryo-grids in order to arrive at a consensus structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. The study by Dong and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, for example, employed 0.1% glutaraldehyde for cross linking transmembrane helices while that of Sušac and co-workers used graphene coated grids and Fabs for TCR stabilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The absence of a native membrane is especially relevant since movement of the TCR-EC was found to be coupled to changes in the transmembrane helices in the previous work by Pandey and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in TCR-CD3 MD simulations reported to date, TCR bending was observed consistently, despite the use of three different forcefields – Amber99SB-ILDN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, and CHARMM36m and the Martini 3 forcefields, in this work. There is, moreover, experimental support for a reversible conformational change in the TCR from single molecule studies of isolated cells using optical tweezers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Similar work on the pre-TCR resulted in a model in which the pre-TCR EC moves due to the scanning motion of the APC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Consistently, changes in chemical shift were observed not only in constant regions, but also in the TCRɑβ variable regions upon titration with CD3γε and CD3δε<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, providing support for the idea that the TCRɑβ variable region interacts dynamically with CD3 proteins.</p>
<p>There is also experimental support for the drawbridge model in the literature. Long-range perturbations have been observed in the TCRβ FG loop, TCRα AB loop, and TCRβ H3 helix upon TCR-pMHC binding using a range of techniques, including NMR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, optical tweezers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and fluorescence measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. These studies have revealed structural changes in the TCR far from the binding interface upon TCR-pMHC binding that have been difficult to rationalize. Our model argues that the long-range interactions are due to changes in the TCR-CD3 interactions. In the unbound state, the CD3 proteins are bound by the TCR EC, but upon TCR-pMHC binding the TCR elongates and the CD3s diffuse around the TCR. The CD3 proteins are thus able to interact with regions like the TCRα AB loop and TCRβ H3 helix of the TCR, which are not accessible in the unbound state. The TCRβ FG loop has thereby a special role as a gatekeeper, blocking the movement of the CD3 proteins by interacting with CD3ε<sup>γ</sup> in the unbound state, but moving out of the way after TCR-pMHC binding, and thus preventing inadvertent TCR triggering. Additional support comes from hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments, which point to a rigidification of the TCR upon TCR-pMHC binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, which is consistent with the narrower angle distribution of the pMHC bound TCR in our simulations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, experimental studies have shown that a decrease in TCR-CD3 interactions occurs upon TCR-pMHC binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and specifically between the TCR and CD3ζ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Consistently, our simulations also show a decrease in TCR-CD3ζ interactions upon TCR-pMHC binding (Figure S3). This decrease in TCR-CD3 association is in line with the increased mobility of the CD3 and an elongated TCR that cannot interact with the CD3 upon TCR-pMHC binding. Lastly, molecular docking studies utilizing NMR data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> resulted in a model in which the CD3δε and CD3γε dimers were positioned on opposite sides of the TCRαβ complex. This model differs qualitatively from the recent cryo-EM structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, providing support for a model based on CD3 mobility and structural heterogeneity.</p>
<p>The drawbridge model is consistent with recent findings that monomeric TCRs can be triggered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> and integrates well with the modern framework of TCR triggering, such as the mechanosensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and kinetic proofreading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The initial encounter between TCR and pMHC is described by the mechanosensing model, which posits that agonistic pMHCs are distinguished through the formation of catch-bonds, special bonds that withstand the shear stress created by the scanning motion of the T cell over the APC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The drawbridge model expands on this by proposing that these catch-bonds must also be strong enough to maintain the TCR in the elongated state. The kinetic proofreading model enhances the specificity of T cell activation by imposing a temporal requirement, such that only TCR-pMHC interactions that persist for a sufficient amount of time result in T cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. This is achieved via a series of reversible biochemical steps, and the elongation of the drawbridge can be seen as part of this process. Successful TCR triggering can only occur when the TCR remains in an elongated state for long enough to allow for the continuous diffusion of the CD3 proteins, which ultimately depends on the stability of the complex formed between the TCR and pMHC. Our molecular dynamics simulations thus link the upstream formation of catch-bonds with the downstream kinetic proofreading process, providing a more comprehensive understanding of TCR triggering.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a wide range of evidence supports a mechanism in which TCR-pMHC binding is coupled to the dynamics of the CD3 EC domains, which is propagated across the plasma membrane. Further work is needed to confirm the flexibility of the TCR headgroup and to investigate how CD3 diffusion results in ITAM phosphorylation. Another interesting direction is the exploitation of this model for manipulation of T cell activation on demand. In this context, it will be interesting to revisit the molecular mechanism of anti-CD3 antibodies, which are used to control T cell activation both in the laboratory and in the clinic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Our aim was to examine a conventional TCR-MHC complex, but the extracellular part of the TCR electron densities of the De Dong et al. structure were fitted to the coordinates of an atypical natural killer TCR. Therefore, a chimeric structure was created by fusing the structure of De Dong et al.

For the CD3 proteins and the transmembrane part of the TCR, the structure of De Dong was used.

The structure by Newell et al. served as the basis for the MHC and the extracellular parts of the TCR.

<title>Positioning of TCR and MHC</title>
<p>TCR and pMHC were carefully positioned on top of each other in preparatory 1.5 µs simulations. The TCR and MHC were embedded in opposing membrane slabs, which were separated by ∼21 nm (GL1-GL1 bead distance) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). A set of distance restraints based upon the Newell structure (PDB: 3qiu)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> was defined between the TCR and pMHC (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). During the 1.5 µs docking simulation, a low force constant of 1 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> nm<sup>−2</sup> was used to prevent any deformations. During the docking simulation, the TCR and pMHC were slowly pulled together by distance restraints resulting in a bound TCR-CD3-pMHC structure (Figure S1). In the production simulations, a higher force constant of 200 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> nm<sup>−2</sup> was used to keep the pMHC properly bound to the TCR. In order to allow solvent flow between the two membrane compartments, which in turn allows the bilayers to move, a pore was created in the bilayer containing the MHC. The pore was created using two cylinder shaped inverted flat bottom position restraints (function type 2, shape <italic>g</italic> = 8 in Gromacs). The first restraint, which was used to create the actual pore, acted on POPC beads with a force constant of 1000 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> nm<sup>−2</sup> and a radius of 2 nm. The second restraint with a force constant of 2000 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> nm<sup>−2</sup> and a radius of 4 nm acting on the MHC backbone beads was used to prevent MHC TM diffusion into the pore. The preparatory simulations were performed for each of the one hundred TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations independently.</p>

<title>Simulation systems</title>
<p>The protein systems were embedded in POPC bilayers using the Insane script<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. The TCR was embedded in a POPC bilayer of 1279 lipids (651 lipids in the extracellular leaflet and 628 lipids in the intracellular leaflet). The pMHC was embedded in a POPC bilayer of 1278 lipids (640 lipids in the extracellular leaflet and 638 lipids in the intracellular leaflet). The TCR-only system was solvated in 90282 water beads (representing 361128 atomistic waters) and 1018 Na<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> beads were added (around 154 mM) and an additional 6 Cl<sup>−</sup> ions to neutralize the system. The TCR-CD3-pMHC system was solvated in 95973 water beads (representing 383892 atomistic waters) and 1079 Na<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> beads were added (around 154 mM) and an additional 12 Na<sup>+</sup> ions to neutralize the system. One hundred independent 10-µs production simulations were performed for both the TCR-CD3 and TCR-CD3-pMHC systems.

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The first 1 µs of each coarse-grained production simulation was discarded as equilibration, and the remaining (9 µs) trajectories were analyzed every 10 ns. The first 250 ns of the atomistic simulations were discarded as equilibration and the remaining (2.25 µs) trajectories were analyzed every 1 ns. The TCR tilt, defined as the angle between the TCRβ EC and TM was calculated for simulation systems between the backbone beads (coarse-grained systems) or Cɑ atoms (atomistic simulations) of asparagine 97 serine 249 and valine 281 of the TCRβ chain. The tilt of the TCR in the cryo-EM structure was calculated between the Cɑ atoms of arginine 114, serine 268 and valine 300. Note that serine 249/268 and valine 281/300 are the corresponding residues in the simulation systems and cryo-EM structure, arginine 114 was chosen for its proximity to asparagine when superimposing the simulated structure and the cryo-EM structure. The rotation of the TCR EC was calculated as the angle between two planes. Plane 1 was defined by the Cɑ atoms used for the tilt TCR EC tilt calculation: asparagine 97 serine 249 and valine 281 of the TCR β chain. Plane 2 was defined by the Cɑ atoms of TCRβ asparagine 97, TCRβ glycine 14 and TCRɑ serine 18. Iso-occupancy maps were calculated using the Volmap tool in VMD. For the iso-occupancy maps both the backbone and the sidechain beads were used. Grid spacing was set to 2 Å and counting of grid occupancy was performed after fitting the trajectories on the backbone beads of the TCR chains. Contacts between the TCR and CD3 chains were calculated with in-house python scripts making use of the MDAnalysis library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. For both coarse-grained and atomistic simulations, beads or atoms were considered in contact when their distance was &lt; 6 Å, and residue contacts were calculated by summing all bead or atom contacts. The following residues were considered to be part of the constant, variable, transmembrane and cytosolic domains for the TCR chains: TCRα variable: 1-106, constant: 107-198, transmembrane: 199-246, cytosolic: 247-249. TCRβ variable: 1-117, constant: 118-245, transmembrane: 246-285, cytosolic: 286-293. The polar plots were calculated by setting the center of geometry of the TCRβ as the origin, and by representing the CD3ε<sup>γ</sup> and CD3ε<sup>δ</sup> chains by their centers of geometry. Centers of geometry were calculated using both backbone and side-chain beads (coarse-grained simulations) or atoms (atomistic simulations). Trajectories were viewed using VMD and ChimeraX and pictures were rendered with ChimeraX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Objective</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated two glycines (G240 and G245) in the TCRβ connecting peptide. We generated three NFAT-GFP reporter T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> that express 3A9 TCR as model systems. One expressed a wild-type (GG) 3A9 TCR connecting peptide and the other two expressed mutated hinge regions at G240 and G245 with either alanine (AA) or proline (PP). T cells were co-incubated with antigen presenting cells and cognate peptide, and cell activation was evaluated by measuring GFP expression using flow cytometry.</p>

Anti-mouse CD3 antibody (clone: 2C11, produced in-lab) was used to coat wells as a positive control. Plates were then incubated for different time points (2 h, 4 h, and 24 h) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Each cell group was run in duplicates or triplicates per independent experiment.</p>
<p>After each time point, cells were stained with APC anti-human CD8a antibody (BioLegend, clone: RPA-T8, #301049) and incubated for 30 minutes on ice. Cells were washed with HBSS (1X, Gibco) twice then stained with 200 ul propidium iodide (PI, BioLegend, #421301). GFP expression level was assessed by the Attune NxT flow cytometer (Invitrogen). Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo v10.8 software. The baseline fluorescence intensity of negative controls without HEL peptide was used to set the gate placement. Lymphocytes gates were selected based on forward and side scatter plots, dead cells were excluded using PI, cells positive for APC anti-human CD8 antibody were selected as T cell gates from which GFP-positive T cells were assessed.</p>

<p>The manuscript entitled: &quot;TCR-pMHC complex formation triggers CD3 dynamics&quot; by Van Eerden et al. mainly uses coarse-grained molecular dynamics to probe the dynamic changes, in terms of CDε spatial arrangements around 226 TCRs, before and after the engagements of MCC/I-Ek. The broader distributions of CDε iso-occupancies after pMHC binding correlate with the decreases of TCR-CD3 contacts and extensions of TCR conformations. Given the observed release of motion restrictions upon antigen recognition, the authors proposed a &quot;drawbridge&quot; model to describe the initial triggering processes from pMHC association to TCR straightening, FG-loop getaway, and CD3 enhanced mobility. In addition, the authors briefly investigated the functional effects of the rigidified connecting peptide (CP) in T-cell activation using in silico and in vitro mutagenesis. The manuscript raises an important and exciting hypothesis about the allostery of TCR-CD3 during TCR triggering; however, due to current not-yet-convincing evidence, both computationally and experimentally, in supporting their conclusions.</p>
<p>1. As mentioned by the authors, the TCR triggering and T cell activation have been illustrated by a number of models, such as mechanosensing and kinetic proofreading, &quot;in which TCRs discriminate agonistic from antagonistic pMHCs.&quot; However, the critical feature of antigen discrimination is lacking in the drawbridge model. So far, the CDε movements qualitatively distinguish on and off states. The simulation of the antagonist or weaker binder would strengthen the manuscript by demonstrating the relevance of CDε mobility in the triggering mechanism. 226 TCR associated with K99E/I-Ek has been resolved in Ref (DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1100197), which can potentially serve as the &quot;intermediate&quot; system to formulate the gradual increase of CDε dynamics.</p>
<p>2. The linkage between conserved motifs in CP and CDε mobility is less apparent to this reviewer. The notion of the rigidified hinge (PP) requires further clarification. Computationally, the details of fine-grained simulations are required to justify the origin of the apparent mobility increase in PP. The direct comparison between Fig. 2 and Fig. 7 can help assess the relevance of CP through the alignment by FG-loop at a fixed direction in polar coordinates. Experimentally, anti-CD3 positive experiments and, ideally, another antagonist on 3A9 TCRs can strengthen the current functional assay. The baseline level of TCR expression (after positive selection) and 0h activation (Fig. S8) is missing.</p>
<p>3. Regarding the section &quot;The TCRβ FG loop acts as a gatekeeper,&quot; besides contact analysis, additional motion analysis, such as RMSF or PCA, can further establish the importance of FG loops.</p>
<p>4. The discussion on anti-CD3 antibody effects and their potential contribution to CD3 mobility is highly recommended.</p>

<p>In this research article a new allosteric mechanism for T cell receptor (TCR) triggering upon peptide-MHC complex binding is presented in which conformational change in the TCR facilitates activation by controlling CD3 dynamics around the TCR. The authors find that the Cb FG loop acts as a gatekeeper and Cb connecting peptide acts as a hinge to control TCR flexibility.</p>
<p>As an initial result, the authors set up two sets of simulations - TCR-CD3 and pMHC-TCR-CD3 in POPC bilayers and identified that the CD3e chains exhibit a wider range of mobility in the pMHC-TCR-CD3 system as compared to the TCR-CD3 system. Next, they examined the contacts between all subunits during the course of both simulations and established that CD3g and CD3eg made far fewer contacts with TCRb in the pMHC-TCR-CD3 simulations. Next, they identified that the TCR is extended in the pMHC-TCR-CD3 simulations with larger tilt angle of 150º and FG loop acts as gatekeeper that allows CD3 movements upon pMHC binding. Finally, Mutations in Cb connecting peptide regions indicated rigidified TCR leading to hypersensitive TCR, proved both by simulations and in vitro experiments.</p>
<p>The following major concerns must be addressed.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>1. The simulations were performed with intracellular regions unfolded and free from the membrane. A more complete system should have the intracellular regions embedded in the membrane. An NMR structure of CD3e is available (Xu et al., Cell, 2008) and could have been modeled into the TCR-CD3 system before the simulation. Prakaash et al., (PLoS, Comput Biol, 2021) studied cytoplasmic domain motions during in their simulation experiments.</p>
<p>2. Comparing Fig. 2C and Fig.7C, the movement of CD3eg is more restricted in Fig.7C. Is this because the simulation time is lower in the mutation experiments?</p>
<p>3. Only TCR-CD3 simulation were performed for PP and AA mutants. A simulation with pMHC (pMHC-TCRmutants-CD3) should be performed to show increased CD3 mobility.</p>
<p>4. Using CD3e antibody, OKT3, for activation instead of pMHC as a separate experiment would add more value to this study. They can look at CD3 mobility and TCR elongation in the system with OKT3 antibody and compare it to the CD3 mobility and TCR elongation with the pMHC system. They can also use OKT3 with AA and PP mutants and perform both simulation and in vitro activation experiments.</p>
<p>5. The activation experimental data is rather underwhelming. The difference between WT and PP in 2hr experiment at 0.016 ug/mL looks exceedingly low. A stronger TCR-pMHC system should be considered for the in vitro activation experiments.</p>
<p>6. There is some concern that the scientific work lacks solid experimental functional data and lack of novelty due to earlier TCR-CD3 simulation studies (Pandey et al., 2021, eLife) that already reported flexibility and elongation of the complex.</p>

<p>The authors first explore structural differences of unbound TCR-CD3 complexes and pMHC-bound TCR-CD3 complexes with coarse-grained simulations. In the simulations with pMHC-bound complexes, the transmembrane (TM) domains of the TCR-CD3 complex and of pMHC are embedded in two opposing membrane patches. In the pMHC membrane patch, a pore is created and stabilised in the simulation setup with the aim to allow water transport in and out of the compartment between the membranes. The authors report a more upright conformation of the TCR extracellular (EC) domain in the simulations in which this EC domain is bound to pMHC, compared to simulations with unbound TCR, and postulate an allosteric signalling model based on these apparent conformational changes and associated changes in TCR-CD3 quaternary arrangements. Subsequently, the authors identify a GxxG motif in the TCRbeta connecting peptide between EC domain and TM domain as putative hinge in allosteric signalling, and explore the effect of double proline and double alanine substitutions in atomistic simulations and experiments.</p>
<p>While these simulation and experimental setups and the addressed questions are of interest in the field, the following weaknesses prevail in my overall assessment of the work:</p>
<p>(1) I am not convinced that the reported coarse-grained simulation results are sound or allow to draw the conclusions stated in the work. In the simulations with a pMHC-bound TCR-CD3 complex, the intermembrane distance in the setup shown in Figure S1 appears excessively large and likely leads to a rather strong force in the membrane-vertical direction and to the reported upright conformation of the TCR EC domain. This upright confirmation thus appears to be a consequence of force from the simulation setup, rather than a consequence of pMHC binding alone as suggested by the authors. While the membrane pore in principle allows water exchange, the relaxation of the intermembrane distance resulting from this water exchange in the 10 microsecond long simulation trajectories is not (but needs to be) addressed. This relaxation eventually would lead to an equilibrated membrane separation, in which essentially no force is exerted on the TCR-pMHC EC complex. However, I suspect that this computationally demanding equilibration is not achieved in the simulations, with the consequence that forces on the TCR-pMHC EC complex in the membrane-vertical direction remain.</p>
<p>In addition, I am not convinced that the Martini force field of the coarse-grained simulations allows a reliable assessment of the quaternary interactions between the TCR and CD3 EC domains. Getting protein structures and interactions right in coarse-grained simulations is notoriously difficult. In simulations with the coarse-grained Martini force field, secondary protein structures are constrained as a standard procedure, and the authors also use a recommended Go-potential procedure, likely to stabilise tertiary protein structures. The quaternary interactions between the TCR EC domain and the pMHC EC domain are modelled by rather strong harmonic constraints to prevent dissociation. While the treatment of the quaternary interactions between the TCR EC domain and the CD3 EC domains in the simulations is not (but needs to be) addressed in detail, I suspect that there are no additional, or only weak constraints to stabilise these interactions. In any case, I think that a faithful representation of these quaternary interactions is beyond the reach of the Martini force field, as is the reported diffusion of the CD3 EC domains around the TCR EC domain, which plays a central role in the allosteric mechanism proposed by the authors (see Fig 2 and 5).</p>
<p>(2) The allosteric model suggested by the authors is motivated in an introduction that appears to omit central controversial aspects in the field, as well as experimental evidence that is not compatible with allosteric conformational changes in the TCR. These aspects are:</p>
<p>- The mechanosensor model is controversial. In original versions of this model, a transversal force has been postulated to be required for T cell activation. However, more recent single-molecule force-sensor experiments reported in J Goehring et al., Nat Commun 12, 1 (2021) provide no evidence for a scenario in which transversal forces beyond 2 pN are associated with T cell activation.</p>
<p>- The role of catch bonds is controversial. Evidence for TCR catch bonds has been mainly obtained in experimental setups using the biomembrane force probe, in which force is applied to TCRs on the surface of T cells, but is not reproduced in experimental setups using isolated TCRs, see e.g. L Limozin et al., PNAS 116, 16943 (2019)</p>
<p>- Ref. 1 of the manuscript prominently discusses the kinetic segregation model of T cell activation, which is not (but needs to be) addressed in the introduction. In this model, exclusion of CD45 from close-contact zones around pMHC-bound TCRs triggers T cell activation. The model is supported by evidence from diverse experiments, see for example M Aramesh et al., PNAS 118, e2107535118 (2021) and Ref. 1. At least part of this evidence is not compatible with mechanosensing or allosteric models of T cell activation.</p>

<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewers for investing their valuable time in assessing our manuscript. We understand the considerable effort involved in the review process, and we will make use of these suggestions in order to make the revised manuscript more complete in terms of explanation, discussion, additional simulations, experiments and analyses.</p>
<p>-Specifically, we will experimentally and computationally investigate how activation via anti-CD3 antibodies relates to our mechanism.</p>
<p>-We will also utilize a weaker pMHC binder in the pMHC-mediated T cell activation experiments.</p>
<p>-We will improve the description of the function of the FG loop and the role of the connecting peptide (CP).</p>
<p>-Furthermore, we will improve our description of and justification for the simulation methodology. We want to emphasize that all potentials have been described, and we will draw attention to these methodological descriptions where needed.</p>
<p>The reviewers also suggested a number of additional simulations that are probably beyond our current capability. These include:</p>
<p>-simulations of TCR in complex with a weaker agonist
-simulations of the proline and alanine TCR mutants in complex with a pMHC.</p>
<p>While we agree that such simulations would provide new insights into the mechanism of TCR triggering, they simply are not feasible at this time. We will give a more detailed explanation for these arguments in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>In addition, I am not convinced that the Martini force field of the coarse-grained simulations allows a reliable assessment of the quaternary interactions between the TCR and CD3 EC domains. Getting protein structures and interactions right in coarse-grained simulations is notoriously difficult. In simulations with the coarse-grained Martini force field, secondary protein structures are constrained as a standard procedure, and the authors also use a recommended Go-potential procedure, likely to stabilise tertiary protein structures. The quaternary interactions between the TCR EC domain and the pMHC EC domain are modelled by rather strong harmonic constraints to prevent dissociation. While the treatment of the quaternary interactions between the TCR EC domain and the CD3 EC domains in the simulations is not (but needs to be) addressed in detail, I suspect that there are no additional, or only weak constraints to stabilise these interactions. In any case, I think that a faithful representation of these quaternary interactions is beyond the reach of the Martini force field, as is the reported diffusion of the CD3 EC domains around the TCR EC domain, which plays a central role in the allosteric mechanism proposed by the authors (see Fig 2 and 5).</p>

<p>(2) The allosteric model suggested by the authors is motivated in an introduction that appears to omit central controversial aspects in the field, as well as experimental evidence that is not compatible with allosteric conformational changes in the TCR. These aspects are:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The mechanosensor model is controversial. In original versions of this model, a transversal force has been postulated to be required for T cell activation. However, more recent single-molecule force-sensor experiments reported in J Goehring et al., Nat Commun 12, 1 (2021) provide no evidence for a scenario in which transversal forces beyond 2 pN are associated with T cell activation.</p>

<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The role of catch bonds is controversial. Evidence for TCR catch bonds has been mainly obtained in experimental setups using the biomembrane force probe, in which force is applied to TCRs on the surface of T cells, but is not reproduced in experimental setups using isolated TCRs, see e.g. L Limozin et al., PNAS 116, 16943 (2019)</p>

<list-item><p>Ref. 1 of the manuscript prominently discusses the kinetic segregation model of T cell activation, which is not (but needs to be) addressed in the introduction. In this model, exclusion of CD45 from close-contact zones around pMHC-bound TCRs triggers T cell activation. The model is supported by evidence from diverse experiments, see for example M Aramesh et al., PNAS 118, e2107535118 (2021) and Ref. 1. At least part of this evidence is not compatible with mechanosensing or allosteric models of T cell activation.</p>
