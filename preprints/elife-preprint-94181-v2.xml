<title>Abstract</title><p>To survive in challenging environments, animals must develop a system to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly. However, the mechanisms that regulate this chronic physiological food evaluation system, which monitors specific nutrients from ingested food and influences food-response behavior, are still not fully understood. Here, we established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> (HK-<italic>E. coli),</italic> a low sugar food, triggers cellular UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immune response. This encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) – Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis, particularly its neuronal function, which subsequently regulates feeding behaviors. Moreover, animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPR<sup>ER</sup> –PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in natural environments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Food is essential for the survival, growth and fitness of all animals. To adapt to fluctuating environments with a wide range of food sources, animals have developed a food evaluation system. This system enables them to identify nutrient-rich food and avoids low-quality or toxic food, thereby maximizing their survival prospects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Various sensory neuron evaluation systems in animals has evolved to evaluate food quality through vision <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, olfactory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup><sup>,,</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and gustatory senses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Besides these sensory systems that facilitate quick feeding decisions, animals may also initiate cellular stress response programs to detect nutrition/toxin and trigger food response behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. This could be one of physiological food quality evaluation systems that monitor the nutritional status of consumed food. However, the signaling events in cellular stress responses involved in evaluating of specific nutrients and the mechanisms that connect these signaling activities to food behaviors are largely unexplored. More specifically, while cellular stress response through UPR<sup>ER</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and PMK-1/p38 MAPK <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> dependent immunity in response to pathogens have been extensively studied, the functions of these cellular stress response in sensing and evaluating specific nutrients from food remain unclear.</p>
<p>Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient that cannot be synthesized by humans due to the loss of a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Animals obtain vitamin C from their diet and possibly also from gut microbes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Vitamin C is an important physiological antioxidant and a cofactor for a family of biosynthetic and gene regulatory monooxygenase and dioxygenase enzymes. It is also required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Vitamin C has been associated with various human diseases including scurvy, immune defect and cardiovascular disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, in animals, having robust food evaluation systems to detect vitamin C levels could significantly impact their survival in the wild. However, the potential involvement of the cellular stress response pathway in this food evaluation system for sensing and assessing vitamin C remains largely unexplored.</p>
<p>In this study, using the low-quality food evaluation assay system we established <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we elucidated the mechanism by which the cellular stress response pathway operates as a physiological food evaluation system. This pathway assesses the deficiency of D-glucose in food and the subsequent vitamin C content in animals through the unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>ER</sup>) – innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis. This mechanism promotes animals to leave low-quality food and is critical for their survival in nature environments.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Low-quality food induces stress response in animals</title>
<p>Our previous studies have shown that Heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>), which lacks certain molecules, is considered a low-quality food that is unable to support animal growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, through metabolic-seq analysis, we identified significant changes in a large numbers of derivatives (Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A, Table S1), including lipids and their derivatives (Figure 1-figure supplement 1B, Table S1), amino acid and their metabolites (Figure 1-figure supplement 1C, Table S1), as well as coenzymes and vitamins (Figure 1-figure supplement 1D, Table S1). Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in carboxylic acids and their derivatives (Figure 1-figure supplement 1E, Table S1) in <italic>E. coli</italic> after being heat-killed (Figure 1-figure supplement 1F, Table S1). This suggests that HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> is nutritionally deficient for <italic>C. elegans</italic> when compared to normal <italic>E. coli</italic> food.</p>
<p>Next, we conducted two behavior assays to facilitate the analysis of the food evaluation process in animals by seeding L1 animals in assay plates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). In the avoidance assay, wild-type animals avoided the HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (HK-OP50) food (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, in the food choice assay, animals initially showed no preference between the two types of food (1-2h), but eventually exhibited a preference for high-quality food (Live <italic>E. coli</italic>) up until the 17h mark (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Figure 1-figure supplement 1G). This suggests that worms depart from the HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> after recognizing it as low-quality food source through ingestion.</p>

<p>In order to investigate the pathways in animals that respond to HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, we performed transcriptomics analysis on worms that were cultured with both HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> and Live <italic>E. coli</italic>. Gene-expression profiling revealed that stress response genes, including those related to biotic stimulus, immune response and response to stress, are up-regulated in animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (HK-OP50) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Table S2). Among these up-regulated genes, we identified 11 out of 62 of UPR<sup>ER</sup> target genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, Figure 1-figure supplement 1H and Table S2). Additionally, about 50%-80% of up-regulated genes overlap with genes responding pathogenic bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, Table S2). Consistent with the results of the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, the UPR<sup>ER</sup> reporter (<italic>Phsp-4::GFP</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and immunity reporter (<italic>Pirg-5::GFP</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> were strongly induced in intestine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-G</xref>) and neurons (Figure 1-figure supplement 2A) by feeding unfavorable food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> OP50), suggesting that UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immune pathways may respond to low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> OP50). As intestinal fluorescence (<italic>Phsp-4::GFP or Pirg-5::GFP)</italic> is easy observation and scoring, the further analyses were done in the intestine.</p>
<p>Moreover, UPR<sup>Mt</sup> reporter (<italic>Phsp-6::GFP</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> was weakly induced under HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> feeding condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 2B), and starved worm did not induce UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immunity (Figure 1-figure supplement 2C-D).</p>
<p>Together, these findings suggest that low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> OP50) triggers a stress response pathway in animals, including UPR<sup>ER</sup> and innate immune pathway. This implies that animals may assess the quality of food through UPR<sup>ER</sup> and innate immune pathway.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Animals evaluate food quality through UPR<sup>ER</sup>-immune-dependent physiological food quality evaluation system</title>
<p>To determine whether the UPR<sup>ER</sup> and innate immune pathways play a role in evaluating low-quality food, we first examined whether the activation of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> by HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> was dependent on the known signaling components of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> branches, including IRE/XBP-1, PERK/ATF-4 and ATF-6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We observed no difference in <italic>Phsp-4::GFP</italic> induction with <italic>atf-4</italic> (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A) or <italic>atf-6</italic> (Figure 2-figure supplement 1B) RNAi-mediated knockdown in animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>. However, knockdown of <italic>ire-1/xbp-1</italic> or mutation of <italic>xbp-1</italic> reduced GFP fluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, 2B). Among the 11 differentially expressed UPR<sup>ER</sup> target genes in animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> from RNA-seq (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), 64% of the genes are IRE-mediated genes (Figure 1 – figure supplement 1H, Table S2). The mRNA level of IRE-1-mediated splicing of <italic>xbp-1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> is also induced in animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (Figure 2-figure supplement 1C). However, UPR<sup>ER</sup> is not affect in animals feeding live-<italic>E. coli</italic> by RNAi of <italic>ire-1, xpb-1, atf-4</italic> and <italic>atf-6</italic> (Figure 2-figure supplement 1D). These data suggest that activation of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> by low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) depends on the IRE-1/XBP-1.</p>

<p>To further analyze whether XBP-1-dependent UPR<sup>ER</sup> activation is critical for animals to leave low-quality food, we tested food avoidance behavior using <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant. The results show that <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutants had a significantly decreased likelihood of leaving of HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, which was rescued by expressing <italic>xbp-1</italic> in neuron rather than intestine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This indicates that XBP-1-dependent UPR<sup>ER</sup> activation in neuron is critical for animals to specific evaluate low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>).</p>
<p>We then investigated which innate immune pathway is involved in evaluating low-quality food. First, we analyzed HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induced genes from RNA-seq. Among these up-regulated genes, 82 out of 409 of PMK-1-dependent genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> were identified (Figure 2-figure supplement 1E, Table S2). Second, we confirmed the induction of several well-known PMK-1 target genes in RNA-seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> (Figure 2-figure supplement 1F) and reporter analysis (Figure 2-figure supplement 1G-H). Moreover, the induction of <italic>Pirg-5::GFP</italic> was abolished in <italic>pmk-1</italic> knockdown animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Third, we found that the phosphorylated PMK-1 (p-PMK-1) level was prominently increased in wild-type N2 animals fed HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> compared to feeding <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Finally, <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants had a decreased likelihood of leaving of HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, which was rescued by expressing <italic>pmk-1</italic> in neurons rather than intestine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Pirg-5::GFP</italic> is not affect in animals feeding live-<italic>E. coli</italic> by RNAi of <italic>pmk-1</italic> (Figure 2-figure supplement 1I).These data suggest that PMK-1 regulated immune pathway evaluates low-quality food, especially the neuronal PMK-1 has a critical function for food quality response.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>XBP-1 and PMK-1 are in the same pathway for evaluating food quality</title>
<p>Next, we explored the connection between UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) and innate immunity (PMK-1 p38 MAPK) in food quality evaluation. We found that <italic>Pirg-5::GFP</italic> induction (Figure 2-figure supplement 1I, 2A) and PMK-1 activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) were decreased in animals with <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutation or knockdown when fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, suggesting that XBP-1 could regulate PMK-1 under this condition. Additionally, <italic>Phsp-4::GFP</italic> induction under HK-<italic>E. coli was</italic> not affected in animals with <italic>pmk-1</italic> RNAi (Figure 2-figure supplement 1D, 2B), indicating that XBP-1-dependent UPR<sup>ER</sup> activation is not regulated by PMK-1. Finally, we constructed a double mutant of <italic>xbp-1</italic> and <italic>pmk-1</italic> and found that the food avoidance phenotype of the double mutant was similar to the <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating that PMK-1 is downstream of XBP-1 in responding to low-quality food.</p>
<p>We then asked whether UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) – Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis is specific to evaluate low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>). We performed behavior assay in N2, <italic>pmk-1</italic> and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant animals by feeding normal <italic>E. coli</italic> food, inedible food (<italic>Saprophytic staphylococci)</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and pathogenic food (<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa-PA14)</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We found that N2, <italic>pmk-1</italic>, and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms did not exhibit avoidance behavior when presented with normal food (OP50). However, both N2 and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms were able to escape from inedible food (N2 was predominantly found on the border areas of the bacterial lawn and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms on border and in), <italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>, whereas <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant worms did not exhibit this avoidance behavior. Notably, N2 and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms exhibited even more pronounced avoidance behavior when exposed to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, whereas <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant worms were more susceptible to infection by this pathogen (Figure 2-figure supplement 2C). These findings suggest that the UPR-Immunity pathway plays a crucial role in helping animals avoid low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) by triggering an avoidance response. In contrast, the Innate immunity pathway, which is mediated by PMK-1/p38 MAPK, appears to play a key role in evaluating unfavorable food sources, such as HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and helping animals avoid these environments.</p>

<title>Sugar deficiency in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> food induces stress response and avoidance behavior in animals</title>
<p>We then investigated which nutrients/metabolites are sensed by animals through the XBP-1-PMK-1 axis for food quality evaluation. First, we hypothesized that the nutrition status is improved in <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant (HK-treatment), which could inhibit UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immune response in animals. We established a system for screening the <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant Keio library (Figure 3 – figure supplement 1A), and identified 20 <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants that did not induce <italic>Phsp-4::GFP</italic> through the UPR<sup>ER</sup> reporter (<italic>Phsp-4::GFP</italic>) after three rounds of screening (Table S3). From these 20 <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants, we identified 9 <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants that did not induce <italic>Pirg-5::GFP</italic> through the immunity reporter (<italic>Pirg-5::GFP</italic>) screening (Figure 3-figure supplement 1B-C, Table S3). Animals fed HK-<italic>yfbR</italic>, which catalyzes carbohydrate derivative metabolic process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, had a decreased ability to leave food (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Table S3), indicating that HK-<italic>yfbR</italic> may be a higher quality food for animals compared to HK-K12.</p>

<p>Secondly, we performed a metabolomics analysis of different quality food (HK-K12, HK-<italic>yfbR</italic> and Live-K12). We found that the level of 13 metabolites were similar between HK-<italic>yfbR</italic> and Live-K12, but significantly changed in HK-K12 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Figure 3-figure supplement 2A, and Table S1). We also found that genes involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis were up-regulated in animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (Figure 3-figure supplement 2B), suggesting that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolism is disordered in animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli,</italic> which may result from changes in sugar/carbohydrate intake. The carbohydrates (D-trehalose, lactose, and D-(+)-sucrose) were also decreased in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that carbohydrate deficiency may induce stress response and avoidance behavior in animals feeding HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>
<p>Thirdly, to determine which carbohydrate inhibits stress response in animals, we supplemented each metabolite to HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> and found that only Lactose, and D-(+)-sucrose inhibited HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induced UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>, Figure 3-figure supplement 2C). Moreover, we found from our metabolomic data that the sugar level, including lactose, and D-(+)-sucrose, and D-(+)-glucose, was also decreased in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Table S1). Since lactose and D-(+)-sucrose are hydrolyzed to produce glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, we wondered whether glucose also inhibits the stress response in animals. We found that D-(+)-glucose supplementation also inhibited HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induced UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), immune response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, 3G and Figure 3-figure supplement 2D) and avoidance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Moreover, sugar supplementation did not affect UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immunity in normal food (OP50) or starved condition (NGM) (Figure 3 – figure supplement 2E-F). While sugar effectively inhibits the HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>-induced UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immune response, it does not fully suppress it to the extent observed with live-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-F</xref>). This implies that additional nutrients present in live-<italic>E. coli</italic> might also contribute to the inhibition of UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immune response.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) is a low-quality food source that cannot support the growth of <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, whereas supplementation with vitamin B2 (VB2) can restore animal growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Here, we found that sugar deficiency in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induces the UPR<sup>ER</sup>-immune response and avoidance behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Given this, we investigated whether sugar supplementation could promote animal growth when fed HK-<italic>E. coli.</italic> To our surprise, supplementing HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> with carbohydrates (D-Glc, D-GlcA) did not support animal development (Figure 3-figure supplement 2G), suggesting that carbohydrates are not essential for supporting animal growth on this food source. However, we did find that carbohydrates are critical for inhibiting the UPR<sup>ER</sup>-immune response induced by sugar deficiency in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>
<p>Together, these findings suggest that HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induces a stress response and avoidance behavior in animals, which can be inhibited by D-(+)-glucose supplementation. This implies that animals may evaluate the sugar deficiency from HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> through the activation of UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immune responses.</p>

<p>Firstly, we observed an increase in the vitamin C level in <italic>C. elegans</italic> when fed with HK-<italic>yfbR</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), a high carbohydrate food compared to HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 1E). However, the VC level in bacteria is the same (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A). The VC level also increased when D-glucose (Figure 4-figure supplement 1B) or D-glucuronate (D-GlcA) was added to HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), which was abolished by knocking down VC biosynthesis genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and Figure 4-figure supplement 1B). This suggests that addition of sugar supplementation promotes VC synthesis in animals fed with HK<italic>-E. coli</italic>.</p>
<p>Secondly, we hypothesized that animals could overcome a low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) environment by inhibiting the stress response through increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. We found that VC or D-glucuronate (D-GlcA) supplementation inhibits HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induced UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), immune response including <italic>irg-5/sysm-1</italic> reporter expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and Figure 4 – figure supplement 1C) and p-PMK-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>), as well as food avoidance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we asked whether inhibition of stress response and avoidance by sugar supplementation depends on the vitamin C biosynthesis pathway. We found that suppression of HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induced UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>), immune response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref> and Figure 4-figure supplement 1D) and food avoidance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>) by D-GlcA/sugar supplementation was abolished in animals with RNAi of VC biosynthesis genes. Food selection behavior assays showed that D-GlcA/sugar supplementation increased the preference for heat-killed bacteria, which was also suppressed by knocking down VC biosynthesis genes (Figure 4-figure supplement 1E). However, VC supplementation still suppressed the UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>), immune response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref> and Figure 4-figure supplement 1D) and food avoidance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>), and increased the food preference (Figure 4 – figure supplement 1E) in animals with or without RNAi of VC biosynthesis genes. This suggests that VC, as the final metabolite synthesized from D-glucose, is critical for evaluating low-quality food response in animals.</p>
<p>Together, these data indicate that the vitamin C biosynthesis pathway is critical for evaluating whether food is of higher quality and can be eaten by animals. It also suggests that animals could improve their VC levels to adapt to bad food environment.</p>

<title>Animals evaluate sugar and vitamin C through neuronal XBP-1 and PMK-1</title>
<p>As D-GlcA/sugar and VC supplementation suppressed HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induced UPR<sup>ER</sup>, immune response and food avoidance behavior, we investigated whether animals evaluate sugar and VC through XBP and PMK-1 dependent pathways. We performed a food selection behavior assay by adding D-Glc, D-GlcA or VC to the NGM, <italic>E. coli</italic> and HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The food selection behavior assays revealed that supplementation with D-Glc, D-GlcA, or VC inhibits the animals’ choice of sugar or VC on <italic>E. coli</italic>-OP50 feeding conditions (Figure 5-figure supplement 1A). This suggests that supplementation with D-Glc, D-GlcA, or VC may alter the metabolites of live bacteria, leading to avoidance by the animals. There was no preference observed on NGM plate (no food condition) supplementation with D-Glc and VC (Figure 5-figure supplement 1B), indicating that the intake of sugar or VC alone does not influence animal preference. However, alone D-GlcA could influence worm physiology which induces preference change (Figure 5-figure supplement 1B). Interestingly, D-Glc and D-GlcA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>) or VC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) supplementation increased the preference for heat-killed bacteria, which was suppressed in <italic>xbp-1</italic> or <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant animals. However, this preference was also rescued in <italic>xbp-1</italic> or <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant animals by expressing XBP-1 or PMK-1 in neurons rather than intestine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-D</xref>), indicating that neuronal XBP-1 and PMK-1 are critical for physiological food elevation system for monitoring the level of sugar and VC under low-quality food condition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To better survive, animals must evolve a system to recognize and evaluate the quality of their food. This includes the sensory neuron evaluation system for immediate response and feeding decision <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, as well as physiological food evaluation system for chronic response to ingested food. In our previous study, we discovered that the TORC1-ELT-2 pathway, acting as master regulators in intestine, evaluates vitamin B2 deficiency in low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli)</italic> and regulates gut digestive activity to impact animal’s food behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. To further identified the mechanism by which animals evaluate low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>), we performed metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses to identify specific nutrition deficiencies in low-quality food and the cellular response pathways that are involved in food evaluation pathway. This study identified a physiological food evaluation mechanism by which animals recognize food quality through UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) – Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) regulated cellular stress response program in neurons that dictates food avoidance and selection behaviors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>One of the cellular stress response pathways, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR<sup>ER</sup>), is activated by various stresses, including infection and nutrition deficiency, which disrupt the homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The activation of UPR<sup>ER</sup>, specifically in the nervous system, has been shown to promote changes in feeding and foraging behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. The p38 PMK-1 pathway is also crucial for regulating the expression of secreted innate immune effectors and is essential for survival during infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Therefore, these two pathways play a critical role in ensuring animals’ survival in changing environments. However, it is still unclear whether UPR<sup>ER</sup> and innate immunity evaluate food quality under physiological conditions. Our study provides evidence that low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) activates both UPR<sup>ER</sup> and p-PMK-1, leading to animals leaving the low-quality food. Previously finding have shown that inhibition of ER function promotes <italic>C. elegans</italic> avoid to the toxic food, which employs the MLK-1/MEK-1/KGB-1 pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Notably, HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induced avoidance behavior is independent of the KGB-1 pathway (Figure 5-figure supplement 1C). Additionally, our study reveals that neuronal UPR<sup>ER</sup> and PMK-1 are essential for evaluating low-quality food, suggesting that the nervous system plays a critical role in assessing food quality.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that XBP1 deficiency in intestinal epithelial cells leads to IRE1a hyperactivation and increased JNK phosphorylation in the epithelial compartment in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. The IRE1-XBP1 axis has been identified as a critical protective branch of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) induced secondary to an innate immune response in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. The p38 MAPK has also been shown to directly act on the phosphorylation of IRE-1 to promote the stress response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Interestingly, IRE-1 has been found to confer cold resistance independently of XBP-1 by activating JNK-1 MAPK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In contrast, our study reveals a new mechanism where the UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) positively regulates Innate Immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) under HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> food conditions, establishing a novel physiological food evaluation system that activates the cellular stress response program.</p>
<p>A previous study has shown that activating innate immunity (PMK-1 MAPK) leads to a reduction in translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Our own previous research has also demonstrated that PMK-1 activation causes a shutdown of food digestion in animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, likely to reduce protein translation and cellular metabolism. To investigate this further, we measured the translation level of animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> and found that total translation ability is significantly reduced in these animals (Figure 5-figure supplement 1D). This finding suggests that activating innate immunity (PMK-1 MAPK) may serve as a mechanism to slow down translation progress, thereby alleviating the pressure on the unfolded protein response (UPR) and preventing excessive UPR<sup>ER</sup> activation.</p>
<p>Vitamin C (VC) is an important physiological antioxidant and a cofactor for a family of biosynthetic and gene regulatory monooxygenase and dioxygenase enzymes. It is also required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, VC helps animals to protect neuron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, defend excessive immune <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and inhibit inflammatory and ER stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> in order to better survive. The synthesis of vitamin C (VC) occurs through the glucuronate pathway, utilizing D-glucose as a precursor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). This led us to investigate whether the vitamin C biosynthesis pathway is involved in evaluating low-quality food by using D-glucose. In this study, we found that animals feeding live <italic>E. coli</italic>, which should produce more VC, exhibit higher glucose levels. However, our results show that animals maintain similar VC levels when fed ideal food (live <italic>E. coli</italic>) compared to low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that animals do not stimulate VC biosynthesis under favorable food conditions. In contrast, when animals are fed low-quality food (HK-OP50), we found that supplementing D-GlcA in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic>-<italic>yfbR</italic> mutation can improve VC levels and inhibit UPR<sup>ER</sup>-immunity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). These data indicate that glucose boosts the animal’s ability to adapt to unfavorable food environments by increasing VC levels, but not in favorable food conditions.</p>
<p>Unlike the sensory neuron evaluation system, which permits rapid feeding decisions through smell and taste, the cellular stress response as physiological food evaluation system describe here requires a slow and multi-step signal transduction process after the ingestion of food. The disruption of cellular homeostasis by ingested of low-quality or toxic food can activate stress response mechanisms that both increase the cellular ability to withstand and adapt to this disruption of homeostasis and promote behavioral strategies to avoid these conditions and lessen their impact on the organism. These cellular stress response mechanisms include heat shock response, unfolded protein response, oxidative stress response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Therefore, this slow physiological food evaluation system is an evolutionary adaptation mechanism for detecting nutrition deficiencies in food that was not detected by quick sensory nervous system.</p>
<p>One limitation of our study is the lack of explanation for why HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> activates UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immunity. We hypothesized that when heat-killed, HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> may lack or contain altered levels of certain metabolites that either activate or inhibit UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immunity, respectively. Additionally, we speculated that <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants killed by heat may lack metabolites that activate UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immunity, or conversely, have increased levels of metabolites that inhibit these pathways. Fortunately, our investigation led to the discovery of the <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant <italic>yfbR</italic>, which inhibits UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immunity by increasing carbohydrates that aid in resisting these stress pathways. Moving forward, we intend to further explore the intricate relationship between HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> and UPR<sup>ER</sup>-immunity. This will be a key focus of our future research efforts.</p>
<p>Collectively, this study uncovers the unexpected function of UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) – Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) as a physiological food evaluation system for evaluating and sensing food quality in animals. It also highlights the utility of the HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (low-quality food) – <italic>C. elegans</italic> interaction as a means to dissect the mechanism of food evaluation system in assessing food. Most importantly, it reveals that animals are capable of altering their nutrient (Vitamin C) levels through in vivo synthesis or food intake to adapt to a poor food environment when better food choices are not available.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this work, the authors aim to better understand how C. elegans detects and responds to heat-killed (HK) E. coli, a low-quality food. They find that HK food activates two canonical stress pathways, ER-UPR and innate immunity, in the nervous system to promote food aversion. Through the creative use of E. coli genetics and metabolomics, the authors provide evidence that the altered carbohydrate content of HK food is the trigger for the activation of these stress responses and that supplementation of HK food with sugars (or their biosynthetic product, vitamin C), reduces stress pathway induction and food avoidance. This work makes a valuable addition to the literature on metabolite detection as a mechanism for evaluation of nutritional value; it also provides some new insight into physiologically relevant roles of well-known stress pathways in modulating behavior.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
-The work addresses an important question by focusing on understanding how the nervous system evaluates food quality and couples this to behavioral change.</p>
<p>
-The work takes full advantage of the tools available in this powerful system and builds on extensive previous studies on feeding behavior and stress responses in C. elegans.</p>
<p>
-Creative use of E. coli genetics and metabolite profiling enabled identification of carbohydrate metabolism as a candidate source of food-quality signals.</p>
<p>
-For the most part, the studies are rigorous and logically designed, providing good support for the authors' model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
-The authors' claim that they can detect induction of hsp-4 and irg-5 expression in neurons (Fig 1-S2A) requires further support. The two tail cells shown are quite a bit larger than would by typically expected for neurons. The rescue they observe by neuronal expression is largely convincing, so it's quite possible that these pathways do indeed function in neurons, but that their level of induction in the nervous system is below reporter detection limits (or is 'swamped out' by much higher levels of expression in the intestine).</p>
<p>
-The authors conclude that &quot;the induction of Pirg-5::GFP was abolished in pmk-1 knockdown animals fed with HK-E. coli&quot; (Fig 2D). Because a negative control for induction (e.g., animals fed with control E. coli) is not shown, this conclusion must be regarded as tentative.</p>
<p>
-The effect sizes in the food-preference assay shown in Figure 5 are extremely small and do not provide strong support for the strong conclusions about the role of stress response pathways in food preference behavior.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Animals can evaluate food quality in many ways. In contrast to the rapid sensory evaluation with smell and taste, the mechanism of slow nutrient sensation and its impact on food choice is unexplored. The authors utilize C. elegans larvae and their bacterial food as an elegant model to tackle this question and reveal the detailed molecular mechanism to avoid nutrient-poor foods.</p>

The strength of this study is that they identified the molecular identities of the critical players in bacterial food and C. elegans using unbiased approaches, namely metabolome analysis, E. coli mutant screening, and RNA sequencing. Furthermore, they strengthened their findings by thorough experiments combining multiple methods such as genetics, fluorescent reporter analysis, and Western blot.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>
The major caveat of this study is the reporter genes; specifically, transcriptional reporters used to monitor the UPRER and immune responses in the intestine of C. elegans. However, their tissue-specific rescue experiments suggest that the genes in the UPRER and immune response function in the neurons. Thus, we should carefully interpret the results of the reporter genes. Another point to be aware of is that although they show that lack of carbohydrates elicits the response to &quot;low-quality&quot; food, carbohydrate supplementation with heat-killed E. coli was insufficient to support animal growth.</p>
<p>Overall, this work provides convincing data to support their model. In the C. elegans field, the behaviors of larvae are not well studied compared to adults. This work will pose an interesting question about the difference between larvae and adults in nutrition sensing in C. elegans and provide a framework and candidate molecules to be studied in other organisms.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Liu et al explores the role of the UPR and immune regulators in the evaluation of nutritional quality in C. elegans. They identify neuronal UPR activation and the MAPK PMK-1 as key responders to low food quality. In particular, the data suggest that these pathways are activated by low levels of vitamin C synthesis that result from the low sugar levels present in heat-killed E. coli.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The results are intriguing and expand our understanding both of physiological food evaluation systems, and of the known roles of stress response pathways in organismal physiology. The authors use a range of techniques, encompassing imaging, metabolomic analysis, gene expression analysis, and behavioural assays, to support their claims.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting the need for further mechanistic analysis in our study. We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the process by which low vitamin C triggers UPR activation.</p>
<p>Our investigation revealed that the vitamin C content in heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) is comparable to that of live <italic>E. coli</italic> or HK-<italic>yfbR</italic> mutant E. coli (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A), indicating that the induction of unfolded protein response (UPR) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> is not solely attributed to low vitamin C levels but rather involves other unidentified factors.</p>
<p>Through metabolomic analysis, we observed significant decreases in sugar levels, including lactose, D-(+)-sucrose, and D-(+)-glucose, in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (Figure 3B, Table S1). Notably, supplementing D-(+)-glucose effectively inhibited UPRER, immune response, and avoidance behavior induced by HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (Figure 3E-H). These findings suggest that the deficiency in sugars in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> triggers a stress response and avoidance behavior in animals, which can be alleviated by D-(+)-glucose supplementation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when comparing heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant <italic>yfbR</italic> (HK-<italic>yfbR</italic>) to HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, we observed significantly higher sugar levels, including lactose and D-(+)-sucrose, in HK-<italic>yfbR</italic> (Figure 3B). This was accompanied by reduced UPRER in animals feeding on HK-<italic>yfbR</italic> (Figure 3-figure supplement 1B), indicating that higher sugar levels may inhibit the induction of UPRER by low-quality food.</p>
<p>Considering that the synthesis of vitamin C (VC) occurs through the glucuronate pathway, utilizing D-glucose as a precursor 1, 2 (Figure 4A), we investigated whether the vitamin C biosynthesis pathway is involved in evaluating low-quality food using D-glucose. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, animals fed live <italic>E. coli</italic> did not exhibit higher glucose levels compared to those fed low-quality food (HK_-E. coli_). Our results indicate that animals maintain similar VC levels when fed ideal food (live <italic>E. coli</italic>) compared to low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) (Figure 4B), suggesting that animals do not stimulate VC biosynthesis under favorable food conditions. However, supplementation of D-GlcA or <italic>E. coli</italic>-<italic>yfbR</italic> mutation in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> significantly improved VC levels when animals were fed low-quality food (HK-OP50) (Figure 4B, 4C). Moreover, VC or D-glucuronate (D-GlcA) supplementation inhibited HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>-induced UPRER (Figure 4D), indicating that glucose boosts the animal's ability to adapt to unfavorable food environments by increasing VC levels, thereby inhibiting UPRER, but not under favorable food conditions.</p>
<p>These findings shed light on the complex interplay between vitamin C, sugar levels, and UPR activation, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying food evaluation and stress response pathways in organisms.</p>
<p>Overall, we are grateful for the reviewer's constructive feedback, which motivates us to continue our efforts to understanding how the UPR response contributes to the complexities of food evaluation and behavioral responses in organisms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In addition, how is the activation of the PMK-1 pathway driven by/coordinated with UPR activation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful inquiry. In our discussion section, we have addressed this question by integrating new data and discussion to provide insights into the coordination between PMK-1 pathway activation and UPR activation.</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that activating innate immunity, specifically the PMK-1 MAPK pathway, results in a reduction in translation3, as well as a shutdown of food digestion in animals4, likely aimed at reducing protein translation and cellular metabolism. To further investigate this relationship, we measured the translation level of animals fed with heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) and found a significant reduction in total translation ability in these animals (Figure 5-figure supplement 1D). This observation suggests that activating innate immunity through the PMK-1 MAPK pathway may serve as a mechanism to slow down translation progress, thereby alleviating the pressure on the unfolded protein response (UPR) and preventing excessive UPRER activation.</p>
<p>By integrating these findings, we propose a model wherein activation of the PMK-1 pathway coordinates with UPR activation to regulate translation and cellular metabolism in response to low-quality food. This coordinated response likely serves to maintain cellular homeostasis and prevent detrimental effects associated with excessive UPRER activation.</p>
<p>These insights contribute to our understanding of the intricate interplay between innate immunity, cellular stress responses, and metabolic regulation in organisms facing nutritional challenges.</p>

<p>(3) The data in some figures is not as convincing as it could be: the magnitude of the effect size is small in the supplementation experiments, and the statistical tests used are not always appropriate to enable multiple comparisons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewers' concerns regarding the data presentation and statistical analyses in some of our figures. In response to this feedback, we have made revisions to improve the robustness and clarity of our statistical methods.</p>
<p>All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software. Specifically, a two-tailed unpaired t-test was employed for the statistical analysis of two groups of samples, while one-way or two-way ANOVA was utilized for the statistical analysis of more than two groups of samples. These adjustments ensure appropriate statistical comparisons and enhance the reliability of our findings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, the authors aim to better understand how C. elegans detects and responds to heat-killed (HK) E. coli, a low-quality food. They find that HK food activates two canonical stress pathways, ER-UPR, and innate immunity, in the nervous system to promote food aversion. Through the creative use of E. coli genetics and metabolomics, the authors provide evidence that the altered carbohydrate content of HK food is the trigger for the activation of these stress responses and that supplementation of HK food with sugars (or their biosynthetic product, vitamin C), reduces stress pathway induction and food avoidance. This work makes a valuable addition to the literature on metabolite detection as a mechanism for the evaluation of nutritional value; it also provides some new insight into the physiologically relevant roles of well-known stress pathways in modulating behavior.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>-The work addresses an important question by focusing on understanding how the nervous system evaluates food quality and couples this with behavioral change. -The work takes full advantage of the tools available in this powerful system and builds on extensive previous studies on feeding behavior and stress responses in C. elegans.</p>
<p>-Creative use of E. coli genetics and metabolite profiling enabled the identification of carbohydrate metabolism as a candidate source of food-quality signals.</p>
<p>-For the most part, the studies are rigorous and logically designed, providing good support for the authors' model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We deeply appreciate the reviewer's insightful assessment of our study's strengths.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>-It is not clear how the mechanism identified here is connected to previously described, related processes. In particular, it is not clear whether this mechanism has a role in the detection of other low-quality foods. Further, the specificity of the ability of sugar/vitamin C to suppress stress pathway induction is unclear (i.e., does sugar/vitamin C have any effect on the activation of these pathways through other means?). Additionally, the relationship of this pathway to the vitamin B2-sensing mechanism previously described by the senior author is unclear. These issues do not weaken confidence in the authors' conclusions, but they do reduce the potential significance of the work.</p>
<p>(1) In particular, it is not clear whether this mechanism has a role in the detection of other low-quality foods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. In response to your inquiry, we investigated whether the UPRER (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis is specific to evaluating low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) or if it plays a broader role in food detection.</p>
<p>We conducted behavioral assays using N2, <italic>pmk-1</italic>, and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant animals fed with normal <italic>E. coli</italic> food, inedible food (<italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>)4, and pathogenic food (<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa-PA14</italic>)5. We found that N2, <italic>pmk-1</italic>, and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms did not exhibit avoidance behavior when presented with normal food (OP50). However, both N2 and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms were able to escape from inedible food (N2 was predominantly found on the border areas of the bacterial lawn and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms on border and in), <italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>, whereas <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant worms did not exhibit this avoidance behavior. Notably, N2 and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms exhibited even more pronounced avoidance behavior when exposed to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, whereas <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant worms were more susceptible to infection by this pathogen (Figure 2-figure supplement 2C). These findings suggest that the UPR-Immunity pathway plays a crucial role in helping animals avoid low-quality food (HK-E. coli) by triggering an avoidance response. In contrast, the Innate immunity pathway, mediated by PMK-1/p38 MAPK, appears to play a key role in evaluating unfavorable food sources, such as HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and helping animals avoid these environments.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your inquiry regarding the specificity of the ability of sugar/vitamin C to suppress stress pathway induction. We aimed to address this question by investigating whether high levels of VC inhibit other stress-induced UPRER pathways.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that both Tunicamycin6 and pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa-PA145, induce UPRER in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In response to your query, we conducted experiments to examine whether VC supplementation inhibits UPRER induced by these stressors. Our findings indicate that VC supplementation does not inhibit UPRER induced by either Tunicamycin or PA14 (Author response image 1).</p>
<p>These results suggest that while sugar/vitamin C may suppress stress pathway induction in the context of low-quality food, its effects may not extend to other stressors that induce UPRER through different mechanisms. This insight helps clarify the specificity of sugar/vitamin C's role in modulating stress pathway activation, contributing to a better understanding of the broader regulatory networks involved in stress response in <italic>C. elegans.</italic></p>

</disp-quote>
<p>In response to your comment, we would like to clarify the relationship of our pathway to the previously described vitamin B2-sensing mechanism we found. Previous studies have demonstrated that heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> (HK-E. coli) serves as a low-quality food source incapable of supporting the growth of <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae, whereas supplementation with vitamin B2 (VB2) can restore animal growth7</p>
<p>This study investigates the role of sugar deficiency in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, which induces the UPRER-immune response and avoidance behavior in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Surprisingly, our findings indicate that supplementing HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> with carbohydrates such as D-Glc and D-GlcA does not promote animal development (Figure 3-figure supplement 2G), suggesting that carbohydrates are not essential for supporting animal growth on this food source. However, we did observe that carbohydrates play a critical role in inhibiting the UPRER-immune response induced by sugar deficiency in HK-<italic>E. coli.</italic></p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-The authors claim that the induction of the innate immune pathway reporter irg-5::GFP is &quot;abolished&quot; in pmk-1(RNAi) animals, but Figure S2K seems to show a clear GFP signal when these animals are fed HK-OP50. Similarly, the claim that feeding WT animals HK-OP50 enriches phospho-PMK-1 levels (Fig 2E) is unconvincing - only one western blot is shown, with no quantification, and there is a smear in the critical first lane.</p>

<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's attention. To address this concern, we have replaced the images with higher resolution, larger ones in Figure 2-figure supplement 1-I.

<p>Thank you, following reviewer’s suggestion, we also repeated some of the western. We now replace the Figure 2E and quantified relative intensity of pPMK-1/tublin. We also provide the uncropped western blots images as source data ( “raw-data WB” file).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-The rationales for some of the paper's hypotheses could be improved. For example, the rationale for screening the E. coli mutant library is that some mutants, when heat-killed, may be missing a metabolite that induces the ER-UPR. A more straightforward hypothesis might be that some mutant E. coli strains aberrantly induce the ER-UPR when *not* heat-killed, because they are missing a metabolite that prevents stress pathway induction. This is not in itself a major concern, but it would be useful for the authors to provide a rationale for their hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the insightful suggestion. We acknowledge the importance of providing a clear rationale for our hypotheses in the paper. In response to this feedback, we have enhanced the discussion section to better elucidate the rationale behind our hypotheses.</p>
<p>One limitation of our study is the lack of explanation for why HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> activates UPRER and immunity. We hypothesized that when heat-killed, HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> may lack or contain altered levels of certain metabolites that either activate or inhibit UPRER and immunity, respectively. Additionally, we speculated that <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants killed by heat may lack metabolites that activate UPRER and immunity, or conversely, have increased levels of metabolites that inhibit these pathways.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our investigation led to the discovery of the <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant <italic>yfbR</italic>, which inhibits UPRER and immunity by increasing carbohydrates that aid in resisting these stress pathways. Moving forward, we intend to further explore the intricate relationship between HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> and UPRER-immunity. This will be a key focus of our future research efforts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-The authors do not provide any explanation for some unexpected results from the E. coli screen. Earlier in the paper, the authors found that innate immune signaling is downstream of ER-UPR activation. However, of the 20 E. coli mutants that, when heat-killed, &quot;did not induce... the UPR-ER reporter,&quot; 9 of them still activate the innate immune response. This seems at odds with the authors' simple model since it suggests that low-quality food can induce innate immune signaling independently of the ER-UPR. Further, only one of the 9 has an effect on behavior, even though failure to activate the innate immune pathway might be expected to lead to a behavioral defect in all of these.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your understanding, and we apologize for any confusion caused by our earlier statement. To provide clarification, our study revealed that out of the 20 <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants examined, none activated the UPRER. Among these mutants, 9 did not induce immunity, and interestingly, one out of these 9 mutants demonstrated the ability to inhibit avoidance behavior.</p>
<p>This diversity in phenotypic outcomes can be attributed to the varied metabolites present in different <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants. To thoroughly evaluate the effects of these mutants, we conducted a comprehensive three-step screening process, utilizing UPRER marker, immunity marker, and avoidance behavior assays.</p>
<p>Through this rigorous approach, we identified the <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant, <italic>yfbR</italic>, which exhibited the desired inhibitory effects on UPRER, immunity, and avoidance behavior.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we conducted a metabolomics analysis of various food qualities (HK-K12, HK-<italic>yfbR</italic>, and Live-K12). Our findings revealed higher sugar levels in</p>
<p>HK-<italic>yfbR</italic> and Live-K12 compared to HK-K12 (Figure 3B, Figure 3-figure supplement 2A, and Table S1), indicating that sugar deficiency might trigger the UPRER, immunity responses, and subsequent avoidance behavior.</p>

<p>-In a number of places, the writing style can make the authors' arguments difficult to follow.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reviewer’s efforts. We changed all of these errors and polish the language of this paper.</p>

<p>-Some of the effect sizes observed by the authors are exceedingly small (e.g, the suppression of hsp-4::gfp induction by sugar supplementation in Figs 3C-E), raising some concern about the biological significance of the effect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your feedback. In response to your concern, we have included additional clarification in the manuscript.</p>
<p>We have added the following statement: “While sugar effectively inhibits the HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>-induced UPRER and immune response, it does not fully suppress it to the extent observed with live-<italic>E. coli</italic> (Figure 3C-F). This implies that additional nutrients present in live-<italic>E. coli</italic> might also contribute to the inhibition of UPRER and immune response.”</p>
<p>This addition helps to address the observation that some effect sizes appear small, providing context and suggesting potential factors that may influence the outcomes.</p>

<p>-In some cases, there is a discrepancy between the fluorescence images and their quantitation (e.g., Figure 3E, where the effect of glucose on GFP fluorescence seems much stronger in the image than in the graph).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Animals can evaluate food quality in many ways. In contrast to the rapid sensory evaluation with smell and taste, the mechanism of slow nutrient sensation and its impact on food choice is unexplored. The authors utilize C. elegans larvae and their bacterial food as an elegant model to tackle this question and reveal the detailed molecular mechanism to avoid nutrient-poor foods.</p>

This suggests that both the UPRER and immune pathways may indeed respond to low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) in multiple tissues of <italic>C. elegans.</italic> While we acknowledge that our tissue-specific rescue experiments suggest a role for these pathways in neurons, the intestinal fluorescence of <italic>Phsp-4::GFP</italic> or <italic>Pirg-5::GFP</italic> is easily observable and scorable.

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) My major overall comment is that the paper would be substantially strengthened by more mechanistic analysis. In particular, how does low vitamin C trigger UPR activation? This is an intriguing finding and it would be important to see it more fully explored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our study revealed that the vitamin C content in HK_-E. coli_ is comparable to that of live E. coli or HK-<italic>yfbR</italic> (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A), suggesting that the induction of unfolded protein response (UPR) in C. elegans by HK-E. coli is not attributed to low vitamin C levels, but rather to unknown factors.</p>
<p>Metabolomic analysis showed that the sugar levels, including lactose, D-(+)-sucrose, and D-(+)-glucose, were significantly decreased in HK-E. coli (Figure 3B, Table S1).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we found that supplementing D-(+)-glucose effectively inhibited UPRER (Figure 3E), immune response (Figure 3F, 3G, and Figure 3-figure supplement 2D), and avoidance behavior (Figure 3H) induced by HK-E. coli. Our findings suggest that the deficiency in sugars in HK-E. coli triggers a stress response and avoidance behavior in animals, which can be alleviated by D-(+)-glucose supplementation.</p>
<p>Notably, when E. coli was heat-killed, we observed that the sugar levels, including lactose and D-(+)-sucrose, were significantly higher in the heat-killed E. coli mutant <italic>yfbR</italic> (HK-<italic>yfbR</italic>) compared to HK-E. coli (Figure 3B). Moreover, we found that UPRER was reduced in animals feeding HK-<italic>yfbR</italic> (Figure 3-figure supplement 1B), indicating that higher sugar levels may inhibit the induction of UPRER by low-quality food.</p>
<p>The synthesis of vitamin C (VC) occurs through the glucuronate pathway, utilizing D-glucose as a precursor 1, 2 (Figure 4A). This led us to investigate whether the vitamin C biosynthesis pathway is involved in evaluating low-quality food by using D-glucose. In this study, we found that animals feeding live E. coli, which should produce more VC, exhibit higher glucose levels. However, our results show that animals maintain similar VC levels when fed ideal food (live E. coli) compared to low-quality food (HK-E. coli) (Figure 4B), suggesting that animals do not stimulate VC biosynthesis under favorable food conditions. In contrast, when animals are fed low-quality food (HK-OP50), we found that supplementing D-GlcA (Figure 4C) or E. coli-<italic>yfbR</italic> mutation (Figure 4B) in HK-E. coli can improve VC levels. Moreover, we found that VC or D-glucuronate (D-GlcA) supplementation inhibited HK-E. coli induced UPRER (Figure 4D). These data indicate that glucose boosts the animal's ability to adapt to unfavorable food environments by increasing VC levels, thereby inhibiting UPRER, but not in favorable food conditions.</p>
<p>In addition,we asked whether high level of VC inhibits other stress induced UPRER. Previous study shown that Tunicamycin6 and pathogenic bacteria-Pseudomonas aeruginosa-PA145 induce UPRER in C. elegans. We found that VC supplementation does not inhibit Tunicamycin or PA14-induced URPER (Author response image 3).</p>

We also demonstrated that 1) the activation of UPRER by low-quality food depends on the IRE-1/XBP-1, 2) activation of immune response (PMK-1) is downstream of XBP-1 in responding to low-quality food.</p>
<p>how is the activation of the PMK-1 pathway driven by/coordinated with UPR activation?</p>
<p>In our discussion part, we added new data and discussion to answer reviewer’s question.</p>
<p>A previous study has shown that activating innate immunity (PMK-1 MAPK) leads to a reduction in translation 3. Our own previous research has also demonstrated that PMK-1 activation causes a shutdown of food digestion in animals4, likely to reduce protein translation and cellular metabolism. To investigate this further, we measured the translation level of animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> and found that total translation ability is significantly reduced in these animals (Figure 5-figure supplement 1D). This finding suggests that activating innate immunity (PMK-1 MAPK) may serve as a mechanism to slow down translation progress, thereby alleviating the pressure on the unfolded protein response (UPR) and preventing excessive UPRER activation.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 2C: The data shows that xbp-1 mutants are significantly more likely to leave heat-killed E. coli. However, no other conditions are examined. Is this avoidance defect specific to heat-killed E. coli, or is it a more general effect of xbp-1 mutants - that is, are other conditions that evoke avoidance also affected by mutation of xbp-1? Is feeding behavior on regular E. coli altered in this background? The finding would be more relevant if the authors could clarify or provide more context for their claims here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We then asked whether UPRER (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis is specific to evaluate low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>). We examined the avoidance behavior phenotype of wild-type and mutant L1 animals by placing them on various food conditions, including normal <italic>E. coli</italic> food, inedible food (<italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>) and pathogenic food (<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa-PA14),</italic> for a 24-hour period. We found that N2, <italic>pmk-1</italic>, and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms did not exhibit avoidance behavior when presented with normal food (OP50). However, both <italic>N2</italic> and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms were able to escape from inedible food, <italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>, whereas <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant worms did not show this avoidance. Notably, <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms exhibited even more pronounced avoidance behavior when exposed to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, whereas <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant worms were more susceptible to infection by this pathogen (Figure 2-figure supplement 2C). These findings suggest that the UPR-Immunity pathway plays a crucial role in helping animals avoid low-quality food by triggering an avoidance response. In contrast, the Innate immunity pathway, which is mediated by PMK-1/p38 MAPK, appears to play a key role in evaluating unfavorable food sources, such as HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and helping animals avoid these environments.</p>

<p>(3) Figure 3C-F: The magnitude of the changes between conditions shown in these panels is small. To what extent does this supplementation represent a full rescue? The findings would be strengthened if figures/images for the control condition (non-HK E. coli) were shown for comparison to allow the reader to assess the extent to which UPR/PMK-1 activation is rescued.</p>

<p>In response to a reviewer's suggestion, we included live-<italic>E. coli</italic> as a control in our study. Notably, our data revealed that the addition of lactose, D-(+)-sucrose, and D-(+)-glucose partially inhibited the HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>-induced unfolded protein response (UPRER) and immune response, suggesting that other nutrients present in live-<italic>E. coli</italic> may also play a role in inhibiting UPRER.</p>
<p>We added this in manuscript: “While sugar effectively inhibits the HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>-induced UPRER and immune response, it does not fully suppress it to the extent observed with live-<italic>E. coli</italic> (Figure 3C-F). This implies that additional nutrients present in live-<italic>E. coli</italic> might also contribute to the inhibition of UPRER and immune response.”</p>

<p>Minor suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) Figure S2: RNAi is usually delivered in a different E. coli strain, HT115. Is this the case with the RNAi knockdowns in Figure S2, and given that diet can influence UPR activation, is it possible that this different diet could change the phenotypes observed?</p>
<p>This should be clarified by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, all RNAi experiments involved bleaching adult animals under RNAi strain culture conditions to obtain L1 animals. Subsequently, L1 animals were transferred to HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 for phenotype analysis. In response to a reviewer's suggestion, we observed that L1 animals obtained from mothers fed <italic>E. coli</italic> strains OP50, HT115, or K12 exhibited similar UPR induction under HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 feeding conditions (Author response image 4). These findings suggest that variations in diet did not alter the UPR phenotypes.</p>

<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The reporter genes of UPRER and immune response were analyzed in the intestine throughout the study. On the other hand, their rescue experiments suggest that these pathways function in the neurons. They should provide the fluorescence data in the neurons at least for Figures 1F and 1G to confirm that the intestinal response matches the neuronal response and mention that further analyses were done in the intestine for easy scoring.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Consistent with the results of the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, the UPRER reporter (<italic>Phsp-4::GFP</italic>)8 and immunity reporter (<italic>Pirg-5::GFP</italic>)9 were strongly induced in intestinal (Figure 1F-G) and neurons (Figure 1-figure supplement 2A) by feeding unfavorable food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>), suggesting that UPRER and immune pathways may respond to low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>). As intestinal fluorescence (<italic>Phsp-4::GFP</italic> or <italic>Pirg-5::GFP</italic>) is easy observation and scoring, the further analyses were done in the intestine.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I have concerns about the interpretation of the p-PMK-1 data. Although the authors described that &quot;p-PMK-1 is prominently increased&quot; in the text (Line 150), it is unclear on the data (Figure 2E). Similarly, the authors' statement &quot;p-PMK-1 is decreased in animals with D-GlcA (F)..&quot; was not fully supported by the data in Figure 4F. The experiment should be repeated and quantified. Moreover, pPMK-1 showed single bands in Figure 2E, but double bands in Figure 3G, 4F, and 4G. The authors should explain why that is the case and which band we should look at for Figures 3G, 4F, and 4G.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As reviewer’s suggestion, we also repeated some of the western. We found that after longer expose, there are two bands for pPMK-1 (Figure 2E, new data; and “raw-data WB” file). The VHP-1 phosphatase is known to inhibit PMK-13. In our previous study, we found that worms treated with <italic>vhp-1</italic>(RNAi), which hyperactivates p-PMK-1 (lower band) 4. In contrast, the two bands are disappeared in <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant (Author response image 5). Thus, the lower band indicates the pPMK-1. We now replace the Figure 2E and quantified relative intensity of pPMK-1/tublin. We also provide the uncropped western blots images as source data ( “raw-data WB” file).</p>

<p>(3) Heat-killed E. coli (HK-E. coli) is low-quality because the lack of sugar cannot support the growth of C. elegans larvae (Qi and Han, Cell, 2018). Thus, animals do not show the UPRER-immune response and avoidance when HK-E. coli is supplemented with sugars such as glucose (Line 225-227). If these sugars are the key, C. elegans larvae should be able to grow better with HK-E. coli supplemented with glucose. Authors should address this possibility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Previous studies have shown that heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) is a low-quality food source that cannot support the growth of <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae7. Here, we found that sugar deficiency in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> induces the UPRER-immune response and avoidance behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Given this, we investigated whether sugar supplementation could promote animal growth when fed HK-<italic>E. coli.</italic> To our surprise, supplementing HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> with carbohydrates (D-Glc, D-GlcA) did not support animal development (Figure 3-figure supplement 2G), suggesting that carbohydrates are not essential for supporting animal growth on this food source. However, we did find that carbohydrates are critical for inhibiting the UPRER-immune response induced by sugar deficiency in HK-<italic>E. coli.</italic></p>
