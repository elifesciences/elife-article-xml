<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Genetic mutations are a recurrent cause of male infertility. Multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagellum (MMAF) syndrome is a heterogeneous genetic disease, with which more than 50 genes have been linked. Nevertheless, for 50% of patients with this condition, no genetic cause is identified. From a study of a cohort of 167 MMAF patients, pathogenic bi-allelic mutations were identified in the <italic>CCDC146</italic> gene in two patients. This gene encodes a poorly characterized centrosomal protein which we studied in detail here. First, protein localization was studied in two cell lines. We confirmed the centrosomal localization in somatic cells and showed that the protein also presents multiple microtubule-related localizations during mitotic division, suggesting that it is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP). To better understand the function of the protein at the sperm level, and the molecular pathogenesis of infertility associated with <italic>CCDC146</italic> mutations, two genetically modified mouse models were created: a <italic>Ccdc146</italic> knock-out (KO) and a knock-in (KI) expressing a HA-tagged CCDC146 protein. KO male mice were completely infertile, and sperm exhibited a phenotype identical to our two MMAF patient’s phenotype with <italic>CCDC146</italic> mutations. No other pathology was observed, and the animals were viable. CCDC146 expression starts during late spermiogenesis, at the time of flagellum biogenesis. In the spermatozoon, the protein is conserved but is not localized to centrioles, unlike in somatic cells, rather it is present in the axoneme at the level of microtubule doublets. Expansion microscopy associated with the use of the detergent sarkosyl to solubilize microtubule doublets, suggest that the protein may be a microtubule inner protein (MIP). At the subcellular level, the absence of CCDC146 affected the formation, localization and morphology of all microtubule-based organelles such as the manchette, the head–tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), and the axoneme. Through this study, we have characterized a new genetic cause of infertility, identified a new factor in the formation and/or structure of the sperm axoneme, and demonstrated that the CCDC146 protein plays several cellular roles, depending on the cell type and the stages in the cell cycle.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>we have made extensive changes to the document and the figures. This MS now contains 16 principal figures and 15 figure supplements.
We have added 7 additional figures (supplement figures) to answer the reviewers' questions and/or comments.
Main figures
-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: we added panel F sperm defect statistics
-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: This figure was recomposed. The WB on testicular extract was suppressed and we present a new WB allowing to compare the presence of CCDC146 in the flagella fraction.
-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (old 8): to avoid the issue of the non-specificity of secondary antibodies, we performed a new set of IF experiments using an HA Tag Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Antibody (anti-HA-AF488-C Ab) on WT and HA-CCDC146 sperm. These results are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">figure 7</xref> panel A (new). The specificity of the signal obtained with the anti-HA-AF488-C Ab on mouse spermatozoa was evaluated by performing a statistical study of the density of dots in the principal piece of the flagellum from HA-CCDC146 and WT sperm. We found a highly significant difference, with a p-value &lt;0.0001, showing that the signal obtained on spermatozoa expressing the tagged protein is highly specific. We finally present new images obtained by ExM showing no staining in the midpiece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">figure 7C</xref> new). Altogether, these results demonstrate unequivocally the presence of the protein in the flagellum.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infertility is a major health concern, affecting approximately 50 million couples worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], or 12.5% of women and 10% of men. It is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the “failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse”. In almost all countries, infertile couples have access to assisted reproductive technology (ART) to try to conceive a baby, and there are now 5 million people born as a result of ART. Despite this success, almost half of the couples seeking medical support for infertility fails to successfully conceive and bear a child by the end of their medical care. The main reason for these failures is that one member of the couple produces gametes that are unable to support fertilization and/or embryonic development. Indeed, ART does not specifically treat or even try to elucidate the underlying causes of a couple’s infertility, rather it tries to bypass the observed defects. Consequently, when defects in the gametes cannot be circumvented by the techniques currently proposed, ART fails. To really treat infertility, a first step would be to gain a better understanding of the problems with gametogenesis for each patient. This type of approach should increase the likelihood of adopting the best strategy for affected patients, and if necessary, should guide the development of innovative therapies.</p>
<p>Male infertility has several causes, such as infectious diseases, anatomical defects, or a genetic disorder including chromosomal or single gene deficiencies. Genetic defects play a major role in male infertility, with over 4000 genes thought to be involved in sperm production, of which more than 2000 are testis-enriched and almost exclusively involved in spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Mutations in any of these genes can negatively affect spermatogenesis and produce one of many described sperm disorders. The characterization and identification of the molecular bases of male infertility is thus a real challenge. Nevertheless, thanks to the emergence of massively parallel sequencing technologies, such as whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS), the identification of genetic defects has been greatly facilitated in recent years. As a consequence, remarkable progress has been made in the characterization of numerous human genetic diseases, including male infertility.</p>
<p>Today, more than 120 genes are associated with all types of male infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], including quantitative and qualitative sperm defects. Qualitative spermatogenesis defects impacting sperm morphology, also known as “teratozoospermia”[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], are a heterogeneous group of abnormalities covering a wide range of sperm phenotypes. Among these phenotypes, some relate to the morphology of the flagellum. These defects are usually not uniform, and patients’ sperm show a wide range of flagellar morphologies such as short and/or coiled and/or irregularly sized flagella. Due to this heterogeneity, this phenotype is now referred to as multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagellum (MMAF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Sperm from these patients are generally immotile, and patients are sterile.</p>
<p>Given the number of proteins present in the flagellum and necessary for its formation and functioning, many genes have already been linked to the MMAF phenotype. Study of the MMAF phenotype in humans has allowed the identification of around 50 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] coding for proteins involved in axonemal organization, present in the structures surrounding the axoneme – such as the outer dense fibers and the fibrous sheath – and involved in intra-flagellar transport (IFT). Moreover, some genes have been identified from mouse models, and their human orthologs are very good gene candidates for MMAF, even if no patient has yet been identified with mutations in these genes. Finally, based on the remarkable structural similarity of the axonemal structure of motile cilia and flagella, some MMAF genes were initially identified in the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). However, this structural similarity does not necessarily imply a molecular similarity, and only around half (10 of the 22 PCD-related genes identified so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]) are effectively associated with male infertility. However, in most cases, the number of patients is very low and the details of the sperm tail phenotype are unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>We have recruited 167 patients with MMAF. Following whole exome sequencing, biallelic deleterious variants in 22 genes were identified in 83 subjects. The genes identified are <italic>AK7</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], <italic>ARMC2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], <italic>CFAP206</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], <italic>CCDC34</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], <italic>CFAP251</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], <italic>CFAP43</italic> and <italic>CFAP44</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], <italic>CFAP47</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], <italic>CFAP61</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], <italic>CFAP65</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], <italic>CFAP69</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], <italic>CFAP70</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], <italic>CFAP91</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], <italic>CFAP206</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], <italic>DNAH1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], <italic>DNAH8</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], <italic>FSIP2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], <italic>IFT74</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], <italic>QRICH2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], <italic>SPEF2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], <italic>TTC21A</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] and <italic>TTC29</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Despite this success, a molecular diagnosis is obtained in half of the patients (49.7%) with this sperm phenotype, suggesting that novel candidate genes remain to be identified. We have pursued our effort with this cohort to identify further mutations that could explain the patient MMAF phenotype. As such, we have identified bi-allelic truncating mutations in <italic>CCDC146</italic> in two unrelated infertile patients displaying MMAF. <italic>CCDC146</italic> is known to code for a centrosomal protein when heterologously expressed in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], but minimal information is available on its distribution within the cell, or its function when naturally present. Moreover, this gene has never been associated with any human disease.</p>
<p>The centrosome, located adjacent to the nucleus, is a microtubule-based structure composed of a pair of orthogonally-oriented centrioles surrounded by the pericentriolar material (PCM). The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in animal cells, and as such regulates the microtubule organization within the cell. Therefore, it controls intracellular organization and intracellular transport, and consequently regulates cell shape, cell polarity, and cell migration. The centrosome is also crucial for cell division as it controls the assembly of the mitotic/meiotic spindle, ensuring correct segregation of sister chromatids in each of the daughter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. The importance of this organelle is highlighted by the fact that 3% (579 proteins) of all known human proteins have been experimentally detected in the centrosome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome">https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome</ext-link>). Centrioles also play essential roles in spermatogenesis and particularly during spermiogenesis. In round spermatids, the centriole pair docks to the cell membrane, whereas the distal centriole serves as the basal body initiating assembly of the axoneme. The proximal centriole then tightly attaches to the sperm nucleus and gradually develops the head-to-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), linking the sperm head to the flagellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. In human and bovine sperm, the proximal centriole is retained and the distal centriole is remodeled to produce an ‘atypical’ centriole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]; in contrast, in rodents, both centrioles are degenerated during epididymal maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Despite the number of proteins making up the centrosome, and its importance in sperm differentiation and flagellum formation, very few centrosomal proteins have been linked to MMAF in humans – so far only CEP135 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], CEP148 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] or DZIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Moreover, some major axonemal proteins with an accessory location in the centrosome, such as CFAP58 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] and ODF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], have also been reported to be involved in MMAF syndrome. Other centrosomal proteins lead to MMAF in mice, these include CEP131 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] and CCDC42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. The discovery that MMAF in humans is linked to CCDC146, known so far as a centrosomal protein, adds to our knowledge of proteins important for axoneme biogenesis.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, we first evaluated the localization of endogenous CCDC146 during the cell cycle in two types of cell cultures, immortalized HEK-293T cells and primary human foreskin fibroblasts. To validate the gene candidate and improve our knowledge of the corresponding protein, we also generated two mouse models. The first one was a <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO model, with which we studied the impact of lack of the protein on the general phenotype, and in particular on male reproductive function using several optical and electronic microscopy techniques. The second model was a HA-tagged CCDC146 model, with which we studied the localization of the protein in different cell types. Data from these genetically modified mouse models were confirmed in human sperm cells.</p>

<title>WES identifies <italic>CCDC146</italic> as a gene involved in MMAF</title>
<p>We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) to investigate a highly-selected cohort of 167 MMAF patients previously described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The WES data was analyzed using an open-source bioinformatics pipeline developed in-house, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. From these data, we identified two patients with homozygous truncating variants in the <italic>CCDC146</italic> (coiled-coil domain containing 146) gene, NM_020879.3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), which contains 19 exons in human. Sperm parameters of both patients are presented in <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—Figure supplement 1</xref>. No other candidate variants reported to be associated with male infertility was detected in these patients. Despite an ubiquitous expression, this gene is highly transcribed in human testes (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—Figure supplement 2A</xref>). The first identified mutation is located in exon 9 and corresponds to c.1084C&gt;T, the second is located in exon 15 and corresponds to c.2112Del (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The c.1084C&gt;T variant is a nonsense mutation, whereas the single-nucleotide deletion c.2112Del is predicted to induce a translational frameshift. Both mutations were predicted to produce premature stop codons: p.(Arg362Ter) and p.(Arg704serfsTer7), respectively, leading either to the complete absence of the protein, or to the production of a truncated and non-functional protein. These variants are annotated with a high impact on the protein structure (MoBiDiC prioritization algorithm (MPA) score = 10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. The two mutations are therefore most-likely deleterious. Both variants were absent in our control cohort and their minor allele frequencies (MAF), according to the gnomAD v3 database, were 6.984×10<sup>-5</sup> and 6.5×10<sup>-06</sup> respectively. The presence of these variants and their homozygous state were verified by Sanger sequencing, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>. Taken together, these elements strongly suggest that mutations in the <italic>CCDC146</italic> gene could be responsible for the infertility of these two patients and the MMAF phenotype.</p>

<title><italic>Ccdc146</italic> knock-out mouse model confirms that lack of CCDC146 is associated with MMAF</title>
<p>Despite a lower expression in mouse testes compared to human (the level of expression is only medium, <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—Figure supplement 2B</xref>), we produced by CRISPR/Cas9 two mouse lines carrying each a frameshift mutation in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> (ENSMUST00000115245). One line (line 1) has a deletion of 4- bp (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—Figure supplement 1AB</xref>) and the other (line 2) an insertion of 250-bp, both in exon 2. We used these lines to address the hypothesis that CCDC146 deficiency leads to MMAF and male infertility. We analyzed the reproductive phenotype of the gene-edited mice from the F2 generation and found that homozygous males reproduced the MMAF phenotype, like the two patients carrying the homozygous variants in the orthologous gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> for line 1 and <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—Figure supplementary 1CD</xref> for line 2).

<p>The <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO mice were viable without apparent defects. The reproductive phenotypes of male and female mice were explored. WT or heterozygous animals and KO females were fertile, whereas KO males were completely infertile (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). This infertility is associated with a 90% decrease in epididymal sperm concentration (from ∼30- to ∼3-million) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) and a significant decrease of testicle weight relative to whole body weight (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting a germ cell rarefaction in the seminiferous epithelia due to high apoptosis level. A study of spermatogenic cell viability by TUNEL assay confirmed this hypothesis, with a significant increase in the number of fluorescent cells in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO animals (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—Figure supplement 2</xref>). Closer examination revealed sperm morphology to be strongly altered, with a typical MMAF phenotype and marked defects in head morphology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) indicative of significantly impaired spermiogenesis. The percentage of abnormal form, flagellum and head anomalies is 100% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, an almost complete absence of motility was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), Comparative histological studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) showed that on sections of spermatogenic tubules, structural and shape defects were present from the elongating spermatid stage in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO mice, with almost complete disappearance of the flagella in the lumen and very long spermatid nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

<title><italic>CCDC146</italic> codes for a centriolar protein</title>
<p>CCDC146 has been described as a centriolar protein in immortalized HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. To confirm this localization, we performed immunofluorescence experiments (IF) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). First, we validated the specificity of the anti-CCDC146 antibody (Ab) in HEK-293T cells by expressing DDK-tagged CCDC146. We observed a nice colocalization of the DDK and CCDC146 signals in both interphase and mitotic cells, showing that both Abs target the same protein (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—Figure supplement 1</xref>), strongly suggesting that the anti-CCDC146 Ab is specific. Next, we focused on the centrosome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In HEK-293T cells, using an antibody recognizing centrin (anti-centrin Ab) as a centriole marker and the anti-CCDC146 Ab, CCDC146 was shown to colocalize with centrioles. This colocalization strongly suggests that CCDC146 is a centriolar protein. However, the signal was not strictly localized to centrioles, as peri-centriolar labeling was clearly visible (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A1d</xref>, overlay). As this labeling pattern suggests the presence of centriolar satellite proteins, we next performed co-labeling with an antibody recognizing PCM1, a canonical centriolar satellite marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Once again, the colocalization was only partial (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—Figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, the presence of CCDC146 was assessed at the basal body of primary cilia in cells cultured under serum-deprived conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly to centrosome staining, CCDC146 was observed on the basal body by also around it (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B1d</xref>). Based on these observations, CCDC146 has a unique localization profile in somatic cells that may indicate specific functions.</p>

<title>CCDC146 co-localizes with multiple tubulin-based organelles</title>
<p>We next evaluated the presence of CCDC146 on centrioles during their duplication (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). For this purpose, we synchronized HEK-293T cells with thymidine and nocodazole, and CCDC146 labelling was observed by IF. Both centrioles pairs were stained by CCDC146 Ab in cells blocked in the G2 phase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Because our immunofluorescence experiments revealed that CCDC146 labeling was not strictly limited to centrosomes, we next assessed the presence of CCDC146 on other tubulin-containing cellular substructures, particularly structures emerging during cell division (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-E</xref>). In non-synchronized cells, the mitotic spindle was labeled at its base and at its ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BC</xref>). The co-labeling intensified in the midzone during chromatid separation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Finally, the separation structure between the two cells, the midbody, was also strongly stained (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). As HEK-293T cells are an immortalized cell line, we therefore verified that this labeling pattern was not due to an aberrant expression profile and that it also reflected the situation in primary cell lines. Identical labeling profiles were observed in freshly-prepared Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF cells) (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—Figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<title>CCDC146 is present in epididymal sperm and its expression peaks at spermatid elongation stage during spermatogenesis</title>
<p>The presence of CCDC146 in the mature epididymal spermatozoa was assessed by WB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). To overcome a lack of specific antibodies recognizing mouse CCDC146 (the commercial Ab works for human CCDC146 only), a mouse strain expressing a HA-CCDC146 knock-in (KI) was created. Because the functional domains of the protein are unknown, and to limit as such as possible the risk of interfering with the structure of the protein, we choose to insert the hemagglutinin (HA) tag, which contains only 9 amino acids (YPYDVPDYA). HA sequence was inserted by the CRISPR/Cas9 system into the coding sequence of the <italic>Ccdc146</italic> gene between the two first codons to produce a tagged protein at the N-terminus domain (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—Figure supplement 1</xref>). This insertion induced no phenotypic changes, and both female and male mice were viable with normal fertility. Interestingly, the protein was retained in epididymal sperm, where one band was observed around 120 kDa (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The theoretical MW of the tagged protein is around 116.2 kDa (115.1 + 1.1); the observed MW was slightly higher, suggesting that the protein migrates at a different weight or some post-translational modifications. The band is specific because it was observed in HA-CCDC146 sperm only and not in WT epdididymal sperm. The protein is therefore present during spermatid differentiation and conserved in mature sperm. To better characterize the presence of CCDC146 in sperm, sperm flagella and heads were purified after mild sonication (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), and protein extracts were analyzed by WB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). In the flagella fraction, the HA Ab revealed a band with an intensity similar to that of the whole sperm at around 120 kDa whereas no staining was observed in head fraction.</p>

<p>From our immunofluorescence analysis of somatic cell lines, it was clear that CCDC146 expression is associated with the cell cycle. In the testis, a wide variety of cell types co-exist, including both somatic and germline cells. The germline cells can be further subcategorized into a wide variety of cells, some engaged in proliferation (spermatogonia), others in meiosis (spermatocytes), or in differentiation (spermatids). To better understand the role of CCDC146 in spermatogenesis, and thus how its absence leads to sperm death and malformation, we initially studied its expression during the first wave of spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Results from this study should shed light on when CCDC146 is required for sperm formation. Expression of <italic>Ccdc146</italic> was normalized with two different housekeeping genes, <italic>Actb</italic> and <italic>Hprt</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Surprisingly, RT-PCR failed to detect <italic>Ccdc146</italic> transcripts on day 9 after birth in proliferating spermatogonia from HA-CCDC146 males. Transcription of <italic>Ccdc146</italic> started on day 18, concomitantly with the initiation of meiosis 2. Expression peaked on day 26, during the differentiation of spermatids.</p>

<title>In sperm, CCDC146 is present in the flagellum, not in the centriole</title>
<p>To attempt to elucidate the function of CCDC146 in sperm cells, we next studied its localization by IF in mouse and human sperm. We focused successively on the anterior segment (head, neck and beginning of the intermediate piece) of the sperm and then on the flagellum.</p>
<p>The IF experiments were first performed on murine epididymal spermatozoa. For this study, we used the mouse model expressing HA-tagged CCDC146 protein. In conventional IF, using an HA Tag Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated Antibody (anti-HA-AF488-C Ab), a punctiform labeling was observed along the whole flagellum (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>) on HA-CCDC146 only. We validated the specificity of the punctiform staining by performing a statistical comparison of the density of dots in the principal piece of WT and HA-CCDC146 sperm (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). This study was carried out by analyzing 58 WT spermatozoa and 65 HA-CCDC146 spermatozoa coming from 3 WT and 3 KI males. We found a highly significant difference, with a p-value &lt;0.0001, showing that the signal obtained on spermatozoa expressing the tagged protein is highly specific. To enhance resolution, ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM), an efficient method to study in detail the ultrastructure of organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], was used. We observed the same punctiform staining all along the axoneme, including the midpiece (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), using another anti-HA Ab (#2). Unexpectedly, the mouse flagellum presented breaks that most likely resulted from the expansion procedure (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Interestingly, strong HA-labeling was observed at the level of these breaks suggesting that CCDC146 epitopes are buried inside the axonemal structure and become accessible mostly on blunt or broken microtubule doublets. The same pattern was observed with a third different anti-HA Ab (#3) (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—Figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In humans, the spermatozoon retains its two centrioles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], and they are observable in the neck, as shown by anti-centrin and anti-tubulin labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A1ac, A2ac and A3ac</xref>). No colocalization of the CCDC146 label with centrin was observed on human sperm centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A1d, A2d and A3d</xref>), suggesting that the protein is not present in or around this structure. However, two unexpected labeling events were observed: sub-acrosomal labeling and labeling of the midpiece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A1b, A2b and A3b</xref>). At the flagellum level, faint staining was observed along the whole length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A4b</xref>). To enhance resolution, U-ExM was also used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8B—Figure supplement 1A</xref>). Once again, no CCDC146 labeling was observed on sperm centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B6</xref> merge), confirming the conventional IF results. Moreover, U-ExM unveiled that the observed CCDC146 midpiece staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) seems in fact associated with isolated structures, which we hypothesize could be mitochondria, now visible by expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B1</xref>). This suggests that the labeling on the midpiece observed in IF corresponds to non-specific mitochondrial labeling. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the same isolated structures were also labeled with anti-POC5 Ab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—Figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, at the flagellum level, clear punctiform labeling was observed along the whole length of the principal piece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B1 and B5</xref>), confirming that the protein is present in the sperm flagellum.</p>

<p>The study of CCDC146 localization was made in two species and with two different Abs. We observed slight differences in the CCDC146 staining between human and mouse. However, the antibodies do not target the same part of the CCDC146 protein (the tag is placed at the N-terminus of the protein, and the HPA020082 Ab targets the last 130 amino acids of the Cter), a difference that may change their accessibility to the antigenic site and explain the difference. Nevertheless, overall, the results are fairly consistent and both antibodies target the flagellum. It should be noted that unlike in humans, in mice, centrioles are no longer present in epididymal spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Therefore, the WB result, showing the presence of the protein in sperm flagella fraction in mouse sperm, demonstrate unequivocally that the protein is located in the flagellum.</p>

<title>CCDC146 labeling associates with microtubule doublets</title>
<p>We next wanted to determine whether CCDC146 staining was associated with the axoneme or accessory structures of the flagellum (outer dense fibers or fibrous sheath), and if yes, whether it was associated with microtubule doublets or the central pair. To do so, we used U-ExM on human sperm and quantified the relative position of each CCDC146 dot observed (outside the axoneme, outer left and right; microtubule doublets left and right and central pair – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A-C</xref>). The different parts of the flagellum were identified from the tubulin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The distribution of localizations was summarized in a bar graph, generated for two distinct sperm cells. Labeling was preferentially located on the right and left doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), indicating that CCDC146 associates more with microtubule doublets. Analysis of protein distribution in mice was not easy, because signal tended to concentrate at breaks. Nevertheless, using U-ExM, on some spermatozoa with frayed microtubule doublets, i.e. with the flagellum taking on the shape of a hair, we could find that isolated doublets carried the punctiform labeling confirming the results of analyses on human spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Taken together, these results from mouse and human sperm demonstrate that CCDC146 is an axonemal protein, probably associated with microtubule doublets.</p>

To determine the CP area, the distance (d) between the center of the flagella and the peak of Tub2 was measured, and all fluorescent dots located in between −d/4 to +d/4 from the center were counted as CP dots.

<title>CCDC146 is solubilized by the sarkosyl detergent</title>
<p>The presence of extensive labeling at axoneme breaks suggests that the antigenic site is difficult to access in an intact flagellum. We therefore hypothesized that CCDC146 could be a MIP. MIPs are generally resistant to solubilization by detergents. However, N-lauroylsarcosine (sarkosyl) can solubilize microtubule doublets, with increasing concentrations destabilizing first the A-tubule, then the B-tubule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Microtubule solubilization allows release of the MIPs contained within the tubules, and the method is recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. To test whether our hypothesis that CCDC146 may be a MIP, we treated spermatozoa from HA-tagged CCDC146 mice with sarkosyl and performed a WB on the supernatant (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>). The protein was effectively solubilized, leading to the appearance of bands at around 120 kDa on an SDS-PAGE gel following migration of extracts from sperm treated with 0.2 and 0.4% sarkosyl concentrations. Interestingly, a second band around 90 kDa was also immunodecorated by anti-HA antibody in the sarkosyl treated sample, a band not present in the protein extracts from WT males. This band may correspond to proteolytic fragment of CCDC146, the solubilization of microtubules by sarkosyl may have made CCDC146 more accessible to endogenous proteases. The other detergents and buffers tested – RIPA, CHAPS or Tris-HCl – barely solubilized CCDC146 or led to no solubilization (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B</xref>). This result confirms the unique action of sarkosyl on CCDC146 and strengthens the hypothesis that the protein is associated with the doublets of microtubules. To confirm the action of sarkosyl on the accessibility of the antigenic site, murine spermatozoa were labeled with an anti-HA antibody after treatment with sarkosyl or no treatment. CCDC146 labeling in the principal piece was significantly increased in the presence of sarkosyl (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C</xref>). The full image panel can be found in <xref rid="fig10s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 10—Figure supplement 1A</xref>. The presence of the protein in the midpiece was difficult to assess because non-specific staining was observed in this area, the non-specific staining being due to secondary antibodies as showed in <xref rid="fig10s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 10—Figure supplement 1B</xref>, where they were used alone. Despite all these results, the CCDC146 localization in the lumen of microtubules requires at this stage more proofs.</p>

<title>KO models show defects in tubulin-made organelles</title>
<p>To better characterize the function of CCDC146 in mouse sperm, we went on to perform a detailed morphological analysis of tubulin-made organelles by IF and scanning microscopy, and examined the morphological defects induced by the absence of CCDC146 at the subcellular level by transmission electron microscopy. This work was performed on immature testicular sperm and on seminiferous tubule sections from adult WT and <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO males. Mouse testicular sperm were used because they still contain centrioles that become disassembled as sperm transit through the epididymis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. We mainly focused our analyses on the centrioles, the manchette, and the axoneme.</p>
<p>The connecting piece between the head and the flagellum, known as the sperm head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), is a complex structure containing several substructures including both centrioles, the capitulum and the segmented columns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. The distal centriole is embedded in the segmented column and the axoneme emerges from the distal centriole. This structure has a specific shape when observed by scanning electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). In <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO sperm, there was a great variability in the morphological defects of the connecting piece, some were almost intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A2</xref>), whereas others were severely damaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A3 and A4</xref>). In WT testicular sperm, IF experiments show that the centrioles, identified by anti-tubulin Ab, are very close to each other and adjacent to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B1</xref>). For <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO males, although some sperm cells presented centrioles with almost normal localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B2</xref>), centriole separation was visible in numerous spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B3, B4</xref>), with the structures located far away from the connecting piece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B5</xref>) or duplicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B6</xref>). These defects were not observed in WT sperm, demonstrating that these defects were caused by the lack of CCDC146. Interestingly, the overall structure of the HTCA under construction in spermatids, observed by TEM, was conserved in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO spermatids, with the presence of both centrioles, containing nine triplets of microtubules, as well as accessory cytoskeletal structures, including the capitulum and the segmented columns (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12A1</xref> for WT and A2 for <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO). The adjunct of the proximal centriole was also normal in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO spermatids (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12B</xref>) and no difference were observed with adjunct of WT spermatids (<xref rid="fig12s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 12—Figure supplement 1</xref>). Remarkably, in a very large proportion of sections, no singlet or doublet of microtubules emerged from the distal KO centriole, suggesting that the process of tubulin polymerization is somehow hampered in these cells (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12A2</xref>). The absence of microtubules at the end of the distal centriole was confirmed by analysis of serial sections of the sperm centrioles (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12C</xref>). Moreover, the defects observed in IF experiments, such as duplication, or defective attachment to the nuclear membrane, were frequently confirmed in TEM images (<xref rid="fig12s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 12—Figure supplement 2</xref>). Such defects were not observed in WT spermatids.</p>

<p>Manchette formation – which occurs from the round spermatid to fully-elongated spermatid stages – was next studied by IF using β-tubulin Ab. Simultaneously, we monitored formation of the acrosome using an antibody binding to DPY19L2 (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref>). Initial acrosome binding at step 3 spermatid was not disrupted (not shown), and we observed no differences in covering of the anterior portion of spermatid nucleus at steps 7-8 spermatids (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13A1/A2</xref>). The development of the manchette in between steps 9-12 spermatids was not hampered, but noticeable defects appeared indicating defective manchette organization– such as a random orientation of the spermatids (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13B1/B2</xref>) and abnormal acrosome shapes (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13C1/C2</xref>). Finally, at steps 13-15 spermatids, the manchette was clearly longer and wider than in WT cells (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13D1/D2</xref> and <xref rid="fig13s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 13—Figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that the control of the manchette dynamic is defective: in KO spermatids, the reduction and disappearance of the manchette is hampered and contrary to WT continue to expand (<xref rid="fig13s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 13— Figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the mean time, the acrosome is strongly remodeled, as shown in <xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16H</xref>, and is detached from the nucleus. This latter morphological defect is associated with a loss of the DPY19L2 staining (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13D2</xref>). In TEM, microtubules of the manchette were clearly visible surrounding the compacting nucleus of elongating spermatids in both WT and KO. The manchette normally anchors on the perinuclear ring, which is itself localized just below the marginal edge of the acrosome and separated by the groove belt (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure 14 A-B</xref> blue arrows) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>].

The perinuclear ring was no longer localized in the vicinity of the acrosome (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure 14 C-F</xref> red arrows) and was often spread into the cytoplasm, providing a large nucleation structure for the manchette (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure 14 D-F</xref>, black double arrows), which explains its width and irregularity.</p>

<p>Finally, the shape of the nucleus presented numerous abnormalities during elongation (<xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16</xref>). The emergence of head defects was concomitant to the implantation of the manchette (<xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16E</xref>, red arrow), with no defects observed on round spermatids at stages III-VIII. Unexpectedly, a distortion was created in the center of the nucleus at the anterior pole, causing the formation of a bilobed compacted nucleus (<xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16E-F</xref>, red arrows) and likeky responsible of the presence of visible vacuoles inside the nuclei (<xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16G-H</xref>, white arrows). Moreover, acrosomes were severely impacted at steps13-15 spermatid, with strong deformations and detachment (<xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16H</xref>, blue arrow heads).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study allowed us to identify and validate the involvement of a new candidate gene in male infertility, <italic>CCDC146</italic>. This gene was first described in mice by our team earlier this year, in the context of a research project on the different types of genetic causes of sperm abnormalities in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. However, no data other than the sperm phenotype (MMAF) was presented in this initial report. In this paper, we present for the first time, the evidence of the presence of mutations in humans and a description of the localization of the protein in somatic and germ cells. We also examined the lesion spectrum at the subcellular level, to obtain a detailed view of the molecular pathogenesis associated with defects in this gene.</p>

<title>Genetic complexity of MMAF</title>
<p>The question of how to interpret and annotate the mutations identified by high-throughput sequencing is an important issue in clinical genetics. The most difficult step is certainly the identification of genes associated with a given disease. Beyond pure genetic data and the pathogenicity of mutations, a fundamental element is the reproduction of the disease when the gene is absent in an animal model. When these two elements are combined – KO photocopying disease and pathogenicity of the identified mutations - the probability of mutation causality in the studied disease is very high. Both mutations are predicted to produce a premature stop codons: p.Arg362Ter and p.Arg704serfsTer7, leading either to the complete absence of the protein in case of non-sense mediated mRNA decay or to the production of a truncated protein missing almost two third or one fourth of the protein respectively. <italic>CCDC146</italic> is very well conserved throughout evolution (Figure supplementary 1), including the 3’ end of the protein which contains a large coil-coil domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In view of the very high degree of conservation, it is most likely that the 3’ end of the protein, absent in both subjects, is critical for the CCDC146 function and hence that both mutations are deleterious. These results combined with the fact that the absence of CCDC146 is deleterious in mice and induces an infertility similar to that observed in the human, enable us to associate <italic>CCDC146</italic> with MMAF syndrome in humans.</p>
<p>It is essential to characterize all genes involved in male infertility. Therefore, the characterization of a new gene involved in MMAF syndrome is not just “one more gene”. First, it further confirms that MMAF syndrome is a heterogeneous recessive genetic disease, currently associated with defects in more than 50 genes. Second, it helps direct the diagnostic strategy to be directed during genome-wide searches. The type of profiling required for MMAF is very different from that performed for instance for cystic fibrosis, where one mutation is responsible for more than 50% of cases. Third, the discovery of all genes involved in MMAF is important in the context of oligogenic heterozygous inheritance of sperm abnormalities in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Indeed, a homozygous deleterious mutation is found in only half of all MMAF patients, suggesting that other modes of inheritance must be involved. Only by establishing an extended list of genes linked to MMAF will it be possible to determine whether oligogenic heterozygous inheritance is a relevant cause of this syndrome in humans. Finally, some of the genes involved in MMAF syndrome are also involved in ciliary diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. By further exploring MMAF-type infertility, we can hope to enhance our understanding of another underlying pathology. Although the vast majority of patients with PCD are diagnosed before 5 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], one study showed that in a cohort of 240 adults with a mean age of 36 years (36 ± 13) presenting with chronic productive cough and recurrent chest infections, PCD was identified for the first time in 10% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. This result suggests that infertility diagnosis can occur before PCD diagnosis, and consequently that infertility management might improve PCD diagnosis and care.</p>

<title>CCDC146 is present in flagellum and absent of in sperm centriole</title>
<p>Several proteomics studies of the sperm centriole identified CCDC146 as a centrosome-associated protein in bovine sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], a species where centrioles are present in ejaculated sperm. Using a different methodological approach, based on IF with conventional and expansion microscopy, we observed no CCDC146 signal in centrioles from testicular mouse and ejaculated human sperm. The same result was obtained with two different types of antibodies: with human sperm, we used a commercial anti-CCDC146 Ab, whereas with mouse sperm we used several anti-HA antibodies. The same IF approach allowed us to clearly identify the sperm centrosome using a number of antibodies such as anti-POC5 and anti-beta tubulin, ruling out a possible failure of our IF protocol. It is worth noting that centrosomal proteins were isolated from whole flagella using several strategies including sequential use of multiple detergents, and that the centrosomal proteins were purified in the last fractions. These results indicate that CCDC146 is in fact barely soluble in conventional buffers, which could explain why it is co-purified with the centrosomal fraction in proteomics studies.</p>
<p>In epididymal mouse sperm, the biochemical analyses showed the presence of the protein in the flagellum only, and not in the head fractions: the detection of the band appeared very quickly at visualization and became very strong after few minutes, demonstrating that the protein is abundant in the flagella. It is important to note that epididymal sperm do not have centrioles and therefore this signal is not a centriolar signal. We also performed a statistical analysis showing that the immuno-staining observed in the principal piece of mouse sperm is very specific (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate unequivocally the intracellular localization of CCDC146 in the flagellum of mouse sperm. In human, we obtained very similar results, with a flagellar localization. Using expansion microscopy, we show that the protein is associated with the microtubule doublets in both mouse sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>) and human sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9 B-D</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, CCDC146 was solubilized with the sarkosyl detergent only, known to destabilize microtubules and generally used to identify microtubule inner proteins (MIP) and the CCDC146 fluorescent signal was enhanced when sperm were treated with this peculiar detergent. Expansion microscopy also revealed a strong signal in mouse sperm at the point of axoneme rupture. Taken together, these elements strongly suggest that CCDC146 is a microtubule associate protein (MAP) and may be a MIP. However more experiments need to be performed to validate the inner localization of CCDC146 because there are other proteins, located in the peri-axonemal structure of the axoneme, that are difficult to solubilize as well.</p>
<p>Finally, in human sperm, staining was observed on acrosome and in the midpiece. Staining on acrosome should always be taken with caution in sperm. Indeed, numerous glycosylated proteins are present at the surface of the plasma membrane regarding the outer acrosomal membrane for sperm attachment, and are responsible to numerous non-specific staining. Moreover this acrosomal staining was not observed in mouse sperm, strongly suggesting that it is not specific.</p>
<p>Concerning the staining in the midpiece observed in both conventional and Expansion microscopy, it also seems to be nonspecific and associated with secondary Abs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—Figure supplement 1B</xref> showing the localization of POC5, a very similar staining of the midpiece was also observed, although POC5 was never described to be present in the midpiece, therefore questioning the specificity of the signal observed with the anti-CCDC146 antibody in the midpiece. POC5 and CCDC146 staining experiments shared the same secondary Ab and the midpiece signal was likely due to it. For midpiece staining observed in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C</xref> and <xref rid="fig10s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 10—Figure supplement 1A</xref> by IF, it is worth to note that a similar staining was observed when secondary Ab were used alone (see <xref rid="fig10s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 10—Figure supplement 1B</xref>). The strong fluorescent signal is clearly due to secondary Abs, likely masking the punctuate staining of the axoneme.</p>

<title>Functional complexity of CCDC146</title>
<p>The results presented in this report show striking differences in localization of CCDC146 between somatic and germ cells. Our results show that the protein displays several subcellular localizations, which vary according to the cell cycle, and the cell nature. In somatic cells, the protein is mostly associated with the centrosome and other microtubular structures – in particular the mitotic spindle – at the end of microtubules and at the level of the kinetochore and the midbody. These observations also identify CCDC146 as a MAP. In contrast, in spermatozoa, our results indicate that CCDC146 is an axonemal protein that seems to be associated with the microtubule doublets. Despite its broad cellular distribution, the association of CCDC146 with tubulin-dependent structures is remarkable. However, centrosomal and axonemal localizations in somatic and germ cells, respectively, have also been reported for CFAP58 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>], thus the re-use of centrosomal proteins in the sperm flagellar axoneme is not unheard of. In addition, 80% of all proteins identified as centrosomal are found in multiple localizations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome">https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome</ext-link>). The ability of a protein to home to several locations depending on its cellular environment has been widely described, in particular for MAP. The different localizations are linked to the presence of distinct binding sites on the protein. For example, MAP6 binds and stabilizes microtubules, through Mc modules, and associates with membranes and neuroreceptors through palmitoylated cysteines. MAP6 can also localize in the microtubule lumen, in its role as MIP, thanks to its Mn modules. Finally, in addition to its associations with subcellular compartments and receptors, the presence of proline-rich domains (PRD) in the MAP6 sequence, allows it to bind to SH3-domain-containing proteins, and thus triggering activation of signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. Another example of a protein with multiple localizations is CFAP21, which is a MIP but also a cytosolic calcium sensor. In the latter capacity, CFAP21 modulates the interaction of STIM1 and ORAI1 upon depletion of calcium stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. These examples illustrate the complexity of function of some multiple-domain proteins.</p>
<p>The fact that CCDC146 can localize to multiple subcellular compartments suggests that it also contains several domains. Interestingly, a PF05557 motif (Pfam mitotic checkpoint protein, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/protein/UniProt/E9Q9F7/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/protein/UniProt/E9Q9F7/</ext-link>) has been identified in the mouse CCDC146 sequence between amino acids 130 and 162. Proteins belonging to the “mitotic spindle checkpoint” monitor correct attachment of the bipolar spindle to the kinetochores. The presence of this motif likely explains the ability of CCDC146 to localize to cell cycle-dependent subcellular compartments containing tubulin. However, the most important structural motifs identified in CCDC146 are the coiled-coil domains. Although coiled-coil domains play a structural role in a variety of protein interactions, their presence in CCDC146 remains mysterious, and how they contribute to its function remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, this motif is compatible with a MIP function for this protein, since several MIP proteins including CCDC11 (FAP53), CCDC19 (FAP45), and CCDC173 (FAP210) are coiled-coil proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. It is worth noting that the ortholog of <italic>CCDC146</italic> in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, <italic>MBO2</italic>, codes for a protein required for the beak-like projections of doublets 5 and 6, located inside the lumen of the tubule B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], in the proximal part of the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagellum. Although no beak-like projections are present in the mammalian axoneme, the location inside the tubule seems to be evolutionarily conserved. A more recent study of MBO2 showed that the protein is also present all along the flagellum of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and is tightly associated with microtubule doublets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. These observations support our results showing association of CCDC146 with this axonemal structure.</p>
<p>The results presented here also show a striking difference in the phenotype induced by the lack of the protein in somatic and male germ cells. This protein is essential for spermatogenesis, and its absence leads to immotile non-functional sperm and to complete infertility in both humans and mice. Conversely, both patients and <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO mice seem to be healthy and present no other conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). CCDC146, despite its wide expression profile in many tissues therefore seems to be dispensable except during spermatogenesis. Nevertheless, because this protein is localized on the tips of the spindle and may be involved in mitotic checkpoints, its absence may lead to late proliferative disorders. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that <italic>CCDC146</italic> is reported to be down-regulated in thyroid cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. The link between infertility and risk of cancer was recently underlined, with mutations found in genes like <italic>FANCM</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Therefore, it would be interesting to monitor aging in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO mice and to study their life expectancy and cancer rates compared to WT mice.</p>

<title>TEM reveals that lack of CCDC146 severely impacts microtubule-based organelles</title>
<p>No morphological defects were observed before the elongating spermatid stage, and in round spermatids, the acrosome started to spread on the nucleus in a normal way (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref>). Morphological defects appeared clearly from the onset of spermatid elongation. This result indicates that the protein is only necessary for late spermiogenesis, from the phase corresponding to flagellum biogenesis. All the organelles composed mainly of tubulin were strongly affected by the absence of the protein. The manchette structure in elongating <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO spermatids was asymmetric, abnormally broad, and ectopic, leading to the formation of aberrantly-shaped sperm heads. So far, manchette defects have been associated with defects in intra-flagellar transport (IFT), and intra-manchette transport (IMT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. CCDC146 was only localized to the sperm axoneme by IF, and no signal was observed in the manchette, suggesting that CCDC146 is probably not involved in the transport machinery. Moreover, our results indicated that the manchette was remarkably long in elongated spermatids. A similar phenotype was observed in Katanin80-deficient animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. Katanin80 is a microtubule-severing enzyme that is important for manchette reduction. Interestingly, the absence of WDR62, a scaffold protein involved in centriole duplication, leads to defective katanin80 expression, and the presence of elongated manchettes in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. In combination with our results, this detail suggests that the manchette’s structure and its reduction are influenced by centrosomal proteins, possibly through katanin80 defects. The precise molecular link between CCDC146 and manchette assembly and reduction remains to be identified.</p>
<p>The HTCA was also aberrant in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO spermatids. Centrioles in elongating spermatids were frequently displaced from their implantation fossa at the nuclear envelope. We observed some correctly lodged centrioles in round spermatids; however, we are unable to determine with certainty whether the majority of centrioles failed to correctly attach or whether they detached from the nuclear envelope during spermatid elongation. Defects in cohesion of the HTCA have been associated with the acephalic spermatozoa syndrome, and were shown to involve a number of proteins such as SUN5, SPATA6 and ODF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. Here, we did not observe any sperm decapitation, suggesting that CCDC146 is involved in a different pathway controlling the HTCA. Moreover, elongating <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO spermatids displayed supernumerary centrioles. Abnormal centriole numbers have also been reported in the absence of a few other centrosome-associated proteins including DZIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] and CCDC42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], and of microtubule-regulating proteins such as katanin like-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>] and tubulin deglutamylase CCP5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>].</p>
<p>Overall, these results suggest a relationship between the manchette and the centrioles. In the literature there are limited information about this relationship. Studies of the spermiogenesis defects observed in different models deficient for centrosomal proteins show some common features such as abnormal manchette and duplicated centrosomes. The absence of these proteins does not appear to be directly responsible for these defects, rather it seems to modify the expression of microtubule regulatory proteins such as katanins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. Moreover, there is a report showing that both organelles share molecular components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>].These modifications could explain the pleiotropic effect of the absence of CCDC146 on microtubule-based organelles.</p>
<p>In conclusion, by characterizing the genetic causes of human infertility, we not only improve the diagnosis and prognosis of these pathologies but also pave the way for the discovery of new players in spermatogenesis. We are constantly adding to the number of proteins present in the flagella of the mammalian spermatozoa that are necessary for its construction and functioning. This study showed that CCDC146, a protein previously described as a centrosomal protein in somatic and germ cells, localizes in spermatozoa’s axonemal microtubule doublets. The presence of CCDC146 in somatic cells’ centrosomes gives weight to the idea of a centrosome with a dynamic composition, allowing it to fulfill its multitude of functions throughout all the phases of cellular life.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO and HA-tagged CCDC146 mice</title>
<p><italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO mice were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Briefly, to maximize the chances of generating deleterious mutations, two gRNAs located in two distinct coding exons located at the beginning of the targeted gene were used. For each gene, the two gRNAs (5’-CCT ACA GTT AAC ATT CGG G-3’ and 5’-GGG AGT ACA ATA TTC AGT AC-3’), respectively targeting exons 2 and 4, were inserted into two distinct plasmids, each plasmid also contained the Cas9 sequence. The Cas9 gene was controlled by a CMV promoter and the gRNA and its RNA scaffold by a U6 promoter. Full plasmids (pSpCas9 BB-2A-GFP (PX458)) containing the specific sgRNA were ordered from Genescript (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genscript.com/crispr-synthetic-sgrna.html">https://www.genscript.com/crispr-synthetic-sgrna.html</ext-link>).

After washing three times in PBS, nuclei were stained with 2 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 in PBS (Sigma Aldrich). Coverslips were once again washed three times in PBS, then carefully placed on Superfrost slides (cells facing the slide) and sealed with nail polish.</p>
<p>Spermatogenic cells – Seminiferous tubules were isolated from mouse testes (8–16 weeks old). After removing of the tunica albuginea, the testes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 3 mL of a solution containing (mM): NaCl (150), KCl (5), CaCl2 (2), MgCl2 (1), NaH2PO4 (1), NaHCO3 (12), D-glucose (11), Na-lactate (6), HEPES (10) pH 7.4, and collagenase type IA (1 mg/mL – Sigma Aldrich). Tubules were rinsed twice in collagenase-free medium and cut into 2-mm sections. Spermatogenic cells were obtained by manual trituration and filtered through a 100-µm filter. The isolated cells were centrifuged (10 min, 500 g), resuspended in 500 µL PBS and 50 µL was spread onto slides pre-coated with 0.1% poly-L-lysine (Epredia) and allowed to dry. Dried samples were fixed for 5 min in PBS/4% PFA. After washing twice in PBS, slides were placed in PBS/0.1% Triton/5% BSA (Euromedex) for 90 min at RT. Following two washes in PBS, the primary antibody was added in PBS/1% BSA overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times in PBS/1% BSA, secondary antibody was added in PBS/1% BSA for 2 h at RT. After washing three times in PBS, nuclei were stained with 2 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 in PBS (Sigma Aldrich) and slides were mounted with DAKO mounting media (Agilent).</p>
<p>Testis sections – After deparaffination and rehydration, testis sections were subjected to heat antigen retrieval for 20 min at 95 °C in a citrate-based solution at pH 6.0 (VectorLabs). Tissues were then permeabilized in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at RT. After washing three times in PBS (5 min each), slides were incubated with blocking solution (PBS/10% BSA) for 30 min at RT. Following three washes in PBS, slides were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS/0.1% Tween/5% BSA overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed three times in PBS before applying secondary antibodies in blocking solution and incubating for 2 h at RT. After washing in PBS, nuclei were stained with 2 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 in PBS (Sigma Aldrich) for 5 min at RT. Slides were washed once again in PBS before mounting with DAKO mounting media (Agilent).</p>
<p>Spermatozoa - Mouse spermatozoa were recovered from the caudae epididymides. After their incision, sperm were allowed to swim in 1 mL of PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. They were washed twice with 1 mL of PBS 1X at 500 g for 5 min, and 10 µL of each sample was smeared onto slides pre-coated with 0.1% poly-L-lysine (Epredia). Sperm were fixed in PBS/4% PFA for 45 s, washed twice in PBS and permeabilized in PBS/0.1% Triton for 15 min at RT. After incubation in PBS/0.1% Triton/2% NGS for 2 h at RT, primary antibody was added in PBS/0.1% Triton/2% NGS overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times in PBS/0.1% Triton, the secondary antibody was applied in PBS/0.1% Triton/2% NGS for 90 min at RT. Slides were washed three times in PBS before staining nuclei with 2 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 in PBS (Sigma Aldrich). Slides were washed once in PBS before mounting with DAKO mounting media (Agilent).</p>
<p>For human spermatozoa, the protocol was based on that of Fishman <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Straws were thawed at RT for 10 min and resuspended in PBS. Sperm were washed twice in 1 mL of PBS (10 min, 400 g), 50 µL was spread onto slides pre-coated with 0.1% poly-L-lysine and left to dry. Dry slides were fixed in 100% ice-cold methanol for 2 min and washed twice in PBS. Cells were permeabilized in PBS/3% Triton X-100 (PBS-Tx) for 1 h at RT. Slides were then placed in PBS-Tx/1% BSA (PBS-Tx-B) for 30 min at RT. Sperm were then incubated with primary antibodies in PBS-Tx-B overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times in PBS-Tx-B for 5 min each, slides were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT in PBS-Tx-B. After washing three times in PBS, nuclei were stained with 2 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 in PBS (Sigma Aldrich) and slides were mounted with DAKO mounting media (Agilent).</p>
<p>Sarkosyl protocol for mouse sperm - Mouse sperm from caudae epididymides were collected in 1 mL PBS 1X, washed by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 g and then resuspended in 1 mL PBS 1X. Sperm cells were spread onto slides pre-coated with 0.1% poly-L-lysine (Epredia), treated or not for 5 min with 0.2% sarkosyl (Sigma) in Tris-HCl 1 mM, pH7.5 at RT and then fixed in PBS/4% PFA for 45 s at RT. After washing twice for 5 min with PBS, sperm were permeabilized with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich) for 15 min at RT and unspecific sites were blocked with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100/2% NGS for 30 min at RT. Then, sperm were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100/2% NGS. Slides were washed three times with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 before incubating with secondary antibody diluted in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100/2% NGS for 90 min at RT. Finally, sperm were washed three times in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100, adding 2 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Sigma Aldrich) during the last wash to counterstain nuclei. Slides were mounted with DAKO mounting media (Agilent).</p>
<p>Image acquisition – For all immunofluorescence experiments, images were acquired using 63X oil objectives on a multimodal confocal Zeiss LSM 710 or Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 equipped with ApoTome and AxioCam MRm or NIKON eclipse A1R/Ti2. Images were processed using Fiji [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>] and Zeiss ZEN (Carl Zeiss, version 3.4). Figures for cultured cells were arranged using QuickFigures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>].</p>
<p>Image analysis – To quantify the number of spots in the flagella the brightfield and fluorescent images were preprocessed with a home-made macro in ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/ij/">https://imagej.net/ij/</ext-link>) to improve the contrast and decrease noise. Masks of whole cells, midpieces and head were then realised using Ilastik [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>] on brightfield and fluorescent images. The masks of midpieces and head were then subtracted from the mask of the whole cell to obtain a mask of the flagella. This mask was used as an ROI to quantify intensity maxima in the flagella of control and CCDC146 expressing cells. To compare the number of spots in images with a random distribution, we quantified the total number of intensity maxima in the fluorescent image and a new image was generated with a random distribution of the same number of spots. Subsequently, the same quantification of intensity maxima in the flagella was carried out on the random images. A second home-made macro in ImageJ allows to automatize these two steps. Both macros are available on demand.</p>

<p><bold>(U-ExM)</bold> Coverslips used for either sample loading (12 mm) or image acquisition (24 mm) were first washed with absolute ethanol and dried. They were then coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/mL) for 1 h at 37 °C and washed three times with ddH2O before use. Sperm from cauda epididymides or human sperm from straws were washed twice in PBS. 1×10<sup>6</sup> sperm cells were spun onto 12-mm coverslips for 3 min at 300 g. Crosslinking was performed in 1 mL of PBS/1.4% formaldehyde/2% acrylamide (ThermoFisher) for 5 h at 37 °C in a wet incubator. Cells were embedded in a gel by placing a 35-μL drop of a monomer solution consisting of PBS/19% sodium acrylate/10% acrylamide/0.1% N,N’- methylenbisacrylamide/0.2% TEMED/0.2% APS (ThermoFisher) on parafilm and carefully placing coverslips on the drop, with sperm facing the gelling solution. Gelation proceeded in two steps: 5 min on ice followed by 1 h at 37 °C. Coverslips with attached gels were transferred into a 6-well plate for incubation in 5 mL of denaturation buffer (200 mM SDS, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris in ddH2O, pH 9) for 20 min at RT until gels detached. Then, gels were transferred to a 1.5-mL microtube filled with fresh denaturation buffer and incubated for 90 min at 95 °C. Gels were carefully removed with tweezers and placed in beakers filled with 10 mL ddH2O to cause expansion. The water was exchanged at least twice every 30 min. Finally, gels were incubated in 10 mL of ddH2O overnight at RT. The following day, a 5- mm piece of gel was cut out with a punch. To remove excess water, gels were placed in 10 mL PBS for 15 min, the buffer was changed, and incubation repeated once. Subsequently, gels were transferred to a 24-well plate and incubated with 300 µL of primary antibody diluted in PBS/2% BSA at 37 °C for 3 h with vigorous shaking. After three washes for 10 min in PBS/0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) under agitation, gels were incubated with 300 µL of secondary antibody in PBS/2% BSA at 37 °C for 3 h with vigorous shaking. Finally, gels were washed three times in PBS-T for 10 min with agitation. Hoechst 33342 (2 µg/mL) was added during the last wash. The expansion resolution was between 4X and 4.2X depending on sodium acrylate purity. For image acquisition, gels were placed in beakers filled with 10 mL ddH2O. Water was exchanged at least twice every 30 min, and then expanded gels were mounted on 24-mm round poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips, placed in a 36-mm metallic chamber for imaging. Confocal microscopy was performed using either a Zeiss LSM 710 using a 63x oil objective or widefield was performed using a Leica THUNDER widefield fluorescence microscope, using a 63x oil objective and small volume computational clearing.</p>

<p>Testis from HA-CCDC146 pups were collected at days 9, 18, 26 and 35 after birth and directly cryopreserved at −80 °C before RNA extraction (n=3 for each day). RNA was extracted as follow. Frozen testes were placed in RLT buffer (Qiagen)/1% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), cut in small pieces and lysis performed for 30 min at RT. After addition of 10 volumes of TRIzol (5 min, RT, ThermoFisher) and 1 volume of chloroform (2 min, RT, Sigma Aldrich), the aqueous phase was recovered after centrifugation at 12 000 g, 15 min, 4 °C. RNA was precipitated by the addition of one volume of isopropanol (Sigma) and of glycogen (20 mg/mL, ThermoFisher) as a carrier, tube was placed overnight at −20 °C. The day after, after centrifugation (15 min, 12 000 g, 4 °C), RNA pellet was washed with ethanol 80%, air-dried and resuspended in 30 µl of ultrapure RNAse free water (Gibco). RNA concentrations were determined by using the Qubit RNA assay kit (ThermoFisher). 800 ng of total RNA were used to perform the RT step using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) in a total volume of 20 μL. Gene expression was assessed by qPCR (1 μL of undiluted cDNA in a final volume of 20 μL with the appropriate amount of primers, see table 1) using the SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The qPCR program used was 94 °C 15 min, (94 °C 30 s, 58 °C 30 s, 72 °C 30 s) x40 followed by a melt curve analysis (58 °C 0.05 s, 58–95 °C 0.5-°C increment 2–5 s/step). Gene expression was calculated using the 2<sup>-ΔCT</sup> method. Results are expressed relative to <italic>Ccdc146</italic> expression on day 9.</p>

<p>Testis from adult mice were fixed in PBS/4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). They were then decapsulated from the tunica albuginea and the seminiferous tubules were divided into three to four pieces using a razor blade (Gillette Super Sliver). The seminiferous tubules were incubated for 60 min at RT in fixation buffer (100 mM HEPES pH7.4, 4 mM CaCl2, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% PFA, all from Sigma Aldrich) and then the buffer was exchanged with fresh fixation buffer and the samples left overnight fixed at 4 °C. After washing three times for 10 min in 100 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 4 mM CaCl2, samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, DE) in distilled water for 120 min at 4 °C. After three additional 10-min washes in distilled water, the tissue pieces were embedded in 1.5% DifcoTM Agar noble (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD, US) and dehydrated using increasing concentrations of ethanol. The samples were then embedded in glycidyl ether 100 (formerly Epon 812; Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) using propylene oxide as an intermediate solvent according to the standard procedure. Ultrathin sections (60-80 nm) were cut with a diamond knife (type ultra 35°; Diatome, Biel, CH) on the EM UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and mounted on single-slot pioloform-coated copper grids (Plano, Wetzlar, Germany). Finally, sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. The sectioned and contrasted samples were analyzed under a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, JP) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. Images were acquired using a 4080 x 4080 charge-coupled device camera (UltraScan 4000 - Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, US) and Gatan Digital Micrograph software.

<p>Here, Muronova et al., demonstrate the physiological importance of a centriole and microtubule-associated protein, CCDC146, in sperm flagellar formation and male reproduction. This study identifies novel causal variants to cause male infertility and resolves the pathogenicity by the mutation with characterizing mouse models. Furthermore, the authors' claims are well supported by the biochemical and imaging approaches used in this study.</p>

<p>Male infertility is an important health problem. Among pathologies with multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagellum (MMAF), only 50% of the patients have no identified genetic causes. It is thus primordial to find novel genes that cause the MMAF syndrome. In the current work, the authors follow up the identification of two patients with MMAF carrying a mutation in the CCDC146 gene. To understand how mutations in CCDC146 lead to male infertility, the authors generated two mouse models: a CCDC146-knockout mouse, and a knockin mouse in which the CCDC146 locus is tagged with an HA tag. Male CCDC146-knockout mice are infertile, which proves the causative role of this gene in the observed MMAF cases. Strikingly, animals develop no other obvious pathologies, thus underpinning the specific role of CCDC146 in male fertility. The authors have carefully characterised the subcellular roles of CCDC146 by using a combination of expansion and electron microscopy. They demonstrate that all microtubule-based organelles, such as the sperm manchette, the centrioles, as well as the sperm axonemes are defective when CCDC146 is absent. Their data show that CCDC146 is a microtubule-associated protein, and indicate, but do not prove beyond any doubt, that it could be a microtubule-inner protein (MIP).</p>
<p>This is a solid work that defines CCDC146 as a novel cause of male infertility. The authors have performed comprehensive phenotypic analysis to define the defects in CCDC146 knockout mice. The manuscript text is well written and easy to follow also for non-specialists. The introduction and discussion chapters contain important background information that allow to put the current work into the greater context of fertility research. Overall, this manuscript provides convincing evidence for CCDC146 being essential for male fertility and illustrates this with a large panel of phenotypic observations. Together, the work provides important first insights into the role of a so-far unexplored proteins, CCDC146, in spermatogenesis, thereby broadening the spectrum of genes involved in male infertility.</p>

<body>
<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>First of all, we'd like to thank the three reviewers for their meticulous work that enable us to present now an improved manuscript and substantial changes were made to the article following reviewers' and editors' recommendations. We read all their comments and suggestions very carefully. Apart from a few misunderstandings, all comments were very pertinent. We responded positively to almost all the comments and suggestions, and as a result, we have made extensive changes to the document and the figures. This manuscript now contains 16 principal figures and 15 figure supplements.</p>
<p>The number of principal figures is now 16 (1 new figure), and additional panels have been added to certain figures. On the other hand, we have added 7 additional figures (supplement figures) to answer the reviewers' questions and/or comments.</p>
<p>Main figures</p>
<p>▪   Figures 1, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14: unchanged ▪    Figure 7 and 8 were switched.</p>
<p>▪   Figure 2: we added panel F in response to reviewer 3's and request for sperm defect statistics</p>
<p>▪   Figure 3: the contrast in panel B has been taken over to homogenize colors</p>
<p>▪   Figure 6: This figure was recomposed. The WB on testicular extract was suppressed and we present a new WB allowing to compare the presence of CCDC146 in the flagella fraction. Using an anti-HA Ab, we demonstrate that the protein is localized in the flagella in epididymal sperm. Request of the 3 reviewers.</p>
<p>▪   Figure 7 (old 8): to avoid the issue of the non-specificity of secondary antibodies, we performed a new set of IF experiments using an HA Tag Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated Antibody (anti-HA-AF488-C Ab) on WT and HA-CCDC146 sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel A (new). The specificity of the signal obtained with the anti-HA-AF488-C Ab on mouse spermatozoa was evaluated by performing a statistical study of the density of dots in the principal piece of the flagellum from HA-CCDC146 and WT sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel B (new). This study was carried out by analyzing 58 WT spermatozoa and 65 CCDC146 spermatozoa coming from 3 WT and 3 KI males. We found a highly significant difference, with a p-value &lt;0.0001, showing that the signal obtained on spermatozoa expressing the tagged protein is highly specific. We have added a paragraph in the MM section to describe the process of image analysis. We finally present new images obtained by ExM showing no staining in the midpiece (figure 7C new). Altogether, these results demonstrate unequivocally the presence of the protein in the flagellum. Moreover, the WB was removed and is now presented in figure 6 (improved as requested).</p>
<p>▪   Figure 8. Was old figure 7</p>
<p>▪   Figure 9: figure 9 was recomposed and improved for increased clarity as suggested by reviewer 2 and 3.</p>

<p>▪   Figure supplementary 1 New. Answer to question requested by reviewer 2 note #1</p>
<p>All the reviewers' and editors’ comments have been answered (see our point to point response) and we resubmit what we believe to be a significantly improved manuscript. We strongly hope that we meet all your expectations and that our manuscript will be suitable for publication in &quot;eLife&quot;. We look forward to your feedback,</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point by point answer</p>
<p>Please note that there has been active discussion of the manuscript and the summarize points below is the minimal revision request that the reviewers think the authors should address even under this new review model system. It was the reviewers' consensus that the manuscript is prepared with a lot of oversights - please see all the minor points to improve your manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All minimal revision requests have been addressed</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minimal revision request</p>
<p>1. Clinical report/evaluation of the two patients should be given as it was not described even in their previous study as well as full description of CCDC146.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We provide now a new Figure 1-figure supplement 1 describing the patients sperm parameters</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Antibody specificity should be provided, especially given two of the reviewers were not convinced that the mid piece signal is non-specific as the authors claim. As both KO and KI model in their hands, this should be straightforward.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To validate the specificity of the Antibody, we transfected HEK cells with a human DDK-tagged CCDC146 plasmid and performed a double immunostaining with a DDK antibody and the CCDC146 antibody. We show that both staining are superimposable, strongly suggesting that the CCDC146 Ab specifically target CCDC146. This experiment is now presented in Figure 4-Figure supplement 1.
Next, to avoid the issue of the non-specificity of secondary antibodies, we performed a new set of IF experiments using an HA Tag Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated Antibody (anti-HA-AF488-C Ab) on WT and HA-CCDC146 sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel A (new). The specificity of the signal obtained with the anti-HA-AF488-C Ab on mouse spermatozoa was evaluated by performing a statistical study of the density of dots in the principal piece of the flagellum from HA-CCDC146 and WT sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel B (new). This study was carried out by analyzing 58 WT spermatozoa and 65 CCDC146 spermatozoa coming from 3 WT and 3 KI males. We found a highly significant difference, with a p-value &lt;0.0001, showing that the signal obtained on spermatozoa expressing the tagged protein is highly specific. We have added a paragraph in the MM section to describe the process of image analysis. We finally present new images obtained by ExM showing no staining in the midpiece (figure 7C new). Altogether, these results demonstrate unequivocally the presence of the protein in the flagellum.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors should improve statistical analysis to support their experimental results for the reader can make fair assessment. Combined with clear demonstration of ab specificity, this lack of statistical analysis with very few sample number is a major driver of dampening enthusiasm towards the current study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Several statistical analyses were carried out and are now included:</p>
<p>1. distribution of the HA signal in mouse sperm cells (see point 2 Figure 7 panel B)</p>
<p>2. quantification and statistical analyses of the defect observed in Ccdc146 KO sperm (figure 2 panel
E)</p>
<p>3. Quantification and statistical analyses of the length of the manchette in spermatids 13-15 steps (Figure 13-Figure supplement 1 new)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors need to clarify (peri-centriolar vs. centriole)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In figure 4A, we have clearly shown that the protein colocalizes with centrin, a centriolar core protein in somatic cells. This colocalization strongly suggests that CCDC146 is therefore a centriolar protein, and this is now clearly indicated lines 211-212. However, its localization is not restricted to the centrioles and a clear staining was also observed in the pericentriolar material (PCM). The presence of a protein in PCM and centriole was already described, and the best example is maybe gamma-tubulin (PMID: 8749391).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>or tone down (CCDC146 to be a MIP) of their claim/description.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Concerning its localization in sperm, we agree with the reviewer that our demonstration that CCDC146 is MIP would deserve more results. Because of that, we have toned down the MIP hypothesis throughout the manuscript. See lines 491495</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Testis-specific expression of CCDC146 as it is not consistent with their data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have also modified our claim concerning the testis-expression of CCDC146. Line 176</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>1. As described in general comments, this study limits how the CCDC146 deficiency impairs abnormal centriole and manchette formation. The authors should explain their relationship in developing germ cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In fact, there are limited information about the relationship between the manchette and the centriole. However, few articles have highlighted that both organelles share molecular components. For instance, WDR62 is required for centriole duplication in spermatogenesis and manchette removal in spermiogenesis (Commun Biol. 2021; 4: 645. doi: 10.1038/s42003-021-02171-5). Another study demonstrates that CCDC42 localizes to the manchette, the connecting piece and the tail (Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2019 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2019.00151">https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2019.00151</ext-link>). These articles underline that centrosomal proteins are involved in manchette formation and removal during spermiogenesis and support our results showing the impact of CCDC146 lack on centriole and manchette biogenesis. This information is now discussed. See lines 596-603</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors generated knock-in mouse model. If then, are the transgene can rescue the MMAF phenotype in CCDC146-null mice? This reviewer strongly suggest to test this part to clearly support the pathogenicity by CCDC146.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We indeed wrote that we created a “transgenic mice”, which was misleading. We actually created a CCDC16 knock-in expressing a tagged-protein.  The strain was actually made by CRISPR-Cas9 and a sequence coding for the HA-tag was inserted just before the first amino acid in exon 2, leading to the translation of an endogenous HA-tagged CCDC146 protein. We have removed the word transgenic from the text and made changes accordingly (see lines 250-253). We can therefore not use this strain to rescue the MMAF phenotype as suggested by the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Although the authors cite the previous study (Coutton et al., 2019), the study does not describe any information for CCDC146 and clinical information for the patients. The authors must show the results for clinical analysis to clarify the attended patients are MMAF patients without other phenotypic defects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now inserted a table, indicating all sperm parameters for the patients harboring a mutation in the CCDC146 gene (Figure 1-Figure supplement 1) and is now indicated lines 159-160</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors describe CCDC146 expression is dominant in testes, However, the level in testis is only moderate in human (Supp Figure 1). Thus, this description is not suitable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 1-figure supplement 2 (old FigS1), the median of expression in testis is around 12 in human, a value considered as high expression by the analysis software from Genevestigator. However, for mouse, it is true that the level of expression is medium. We assumed that reviewer’s comment concerned testis expression in mouse. To take into account this remark, we changed the text accordingly. See line 176.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Although the authors mentioned that two mice lines are generated, only one line information is provided. Authors must include information for another line and provide basic characterization results to support the shared phenotype within the lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provide a revised Figure 2-figure supplement 1CD, presenting the second line and the corresponding text in the main text is found lines 178-183.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In somatic cells, the CCDC146 localizes at both peri-centriole and microtubule but its intracellular localization in sperm is distinguished. The authors should explain this discrepancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The multi-localization of a centriolar protein is already discussed in detail in discussion lines 520-526. We have written:</p>
<p>“Despite its broad cellular distribution, the association of CCDC146 with tubulin-dependent structures is remarkable. However, centrosomal and axonemal localizations in somatic and germ cells, respectively, have also been reported for CFAP58 [37, 55], thus the re-use of centrosomal proteins in the sperm flagellar axoneme is not unheard of. In addition, 80% of all proteins identified as centrosomal are found in multiple localizations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome">https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome</ext-link>). The ability of a protein to home to several locations depending on its cellular environment has been widely described, in particular for MAP. The different localizations are linked to the presence of distinct binding sites on the protein…. “</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Authors mention CCDC146 is a centriolar protein in the title and results subtitle. However, the description in results part depicts CCDC146 is a peri-centriolar protein, which makes confusion. Do the authors claim CCDC146 is centrosomal protein?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In figure 4A, we have clearly shown that the protein colocalizes with centrin, a centriolar core protein. This colocalization strongly suggests that CCDC146 is therefore a centriolar protein in somatic cells, and is now clearly indicated lines 211-212. However, its localization is not restricted to the centrioles and a clear staining was also observed in the pericentriolar material (PCM). The presence of a protein in PCM and centriole was already described and the best example is maybe gamma-tubulin (PMID:
8749391).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Verification of the antibody against CCDC146 must be performed and shown to support the observed signal are correct. 2nd antibody only signal is not proper negative control.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is a very important remark. The commercial antibody raised against human CCDC146 was validated in HEK293-cells expressing a DDK-tagged CCDC146 protein. Cells were co-marked with anti-DDK and anti-CCDC146 antibodies. We have a perfect colocalization of the staining. This experiment is now presented in Figure 4-figure supplement 1 and presented in the text (lines 206-208).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In human sperm, conventional immunostaining reveals CCDC146 is detected from acrosome head and midpiece. However, in ExM, the signal at acrosome is not detected. How is this discrepancy explained? The major concern for the ExM could be physical (dimension) and biochemical (properties) distortion of the sample. Without clear positive and negative control, current conclusion is not clearly understood. Furthermore, it is unclear why the authors conclude the midpiece signal is non-specific. The authors must provide experimental evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Staining on acrosome should always be taken with caution in sperm. Indeed, numerous glycosylated proteins are present at the surface of the plasma membrane regarding the outer acrosomal membrane for sperm attachment and are responsible for numerous nonspecific staining. Moreover, this acrosomal staining was not observed in mouse sperm, strongly suggesting that it is not specific.</p>
<p>Concerning the staining in the midpiece observed in both conventional and Expansion microscopy, it also seems to be nonspecific and associated with secondary Abs.</p>
<p>For IF, we now provide new images showing clearly the nonspecific staining of the midpiece when secondary Ab were used alone (see Figure 10-figure supplement 1B).</p>
<p>For ExM, we provide new images in Figure 8-figure supplement 1B (POC5 staining) showing a staining of the midpiece (likely mitochondria), although POC5 was never described to be present in the midpiece. Both experiments (CCDC146 and POC5 staining by ExM) shared the same secondary Ab and the midpiece signal was likely due to it.</p>
<p>Moreover, we now provide new images (figure 7C) in ExM on mouse sperm showing no staining in the midpiece and demonstrating that the punctuated signal is present all along the flagellum. Finally, we would like to underline that we now provide new IF results, using an anti-HA conjugated with alexafluor 488 and confirming the ExM results.</p>
<p>These points are now discussed lines 498-502 for acrosome and lines 503-511 for midpiece staining.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. For intracellular localization of the CCDC146 in mouse sperm, the authors should provide clear negative control using WT sperm which do not carry the transgene.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This experiment was performed.</p>
<p>To avoid the issue of the non-specificity of secondary antibodies, we performed a new set of IF experiments using an HA Tag Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated Antibody (anti-HA-AF488-C Ab) on WT and HA-CCDC146 sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel A (new). The specificity of the signal obtained with the anti-HA-AF488-C Ab on mouse spermatozoa was evaluated by performing a statistical study of the density of dots in the principal piece of the flagellum from HA-CCDC146 and WT sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel B (new). This study was carried out by analyzing 58 WT spermatozoa and 65 CCDC146 spermatozoa coming from 3 WT and 3 KI males. We found a highly significant difference, with a p-value &lt;0.0001, showing that the signal obtained on spermatozoa expressing the tagged protein is highly specific. We have added a paragraph in the MM section to describe the process of image analysis. We finally present new images obtained by ExM showing no staining in the midpiece (figure 7C new). Altogether, these results demonstrate unequivocally the presence of the protein in the flagellum.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Current imaging data do not clearly support the intracellular localization of the CCDC146. Although western blot imaging reveal that CCDC146 is detected from sperm flagella, this is crude approach. Thus, this reviewer highly recommends the authors provide more clear experimental evidence, such as immuno EM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We provide now a WB comparing the presence of the protein in the flagellum and in the head fractions; see new figure 6. We show that CCDC146 is only present in the flagellum fraction; The detection of the band appeared very quickly at visualization and became very strong after few minutes, demonstrating that the protein is abundant in the flagella. It is important to note that epididymal sperm do not have centrioles and therefore this signal is not a centriolar signal. We also now provide new statistical analyses showing that the immuno-staining observed in the principal piece is very specific (Figure 7B). Altogether, these results demonstrate unequivocally the intracellular localization of CCDC146 in the flagellum. This point is now discussed lines 480-489</p>

<p>1. Although sarkosyl is known to dissociate tubulin, it is not well understood and accepted that the enhanced detection of CCDC146 by the detergent indicates its microtubule inner space. Sperm axoneme to carry microtubule is also wrapped peri-axonemal components with structural proteins, which are even not well solubilized by high concentration of the ionic detergent like SDS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the solubilization of the protein by sarkozyl is not a proof of the presence of the protein inside microtubule.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Overall, editing oversights are present throughout the manuscript, which has made the review process quite difficult. Some repetitive figures can be removed to streamline to grasp the overall story easier. Some claims are not fully supported by evidence that need to tone down. Some figures not referenced in the main text need to be mentioned at least once.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All figures are now referenced in the text</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>1. 163-164 - Please clarify the claim that there is going to be an absence of the protein or nonfunctional protein, especially for the patient with a deletion that could generate a truncated protein at two third size of the full-length protein. Similarly, 35% of the protein level is present for the patient with a nonsense mutation. Some in silico structural analysis or analysis of conserved domains would be beneficial to support these claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Both mutations are predicted to produce a premature stop codons: p.Arg362Ter and p.Arg704serfsTer7, leading either to the complete absence of the protein in case of non-sense mediated mRNA decay or to the production of a truncated protein missing almost two third or one fourth of the protein respectively. CCDC146 is very well conserved throughout evolution (Figure supplementary 1), including the 3’ end of the protein which contains a large coil-coil domain (Figure 1B). In view of the very high degree of conservation, it is most likely that the 3’ end of the protein, absent in both subjects, is critical for the CCDC146 function and hence that both mutations are deleterious. This explanation is now added to the discussion. see lines 439-448</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. 173, 423 - Please clearly state a rationale of your mouse model design (i.e., why a mouse model that recapitulate human mutation is not generated) as the truncations identified in human patients are located further towards the C-terminus, and it is not clear whether truncated proteins are present, and if so, they could still be functional. Basically, the current mouse model supports the causality of the human mutations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important question, which goes beyond the scope of this article, and raises the question of how to confirm the pathogenicity of mutations identified by high-throughput sequencing. The production of KO or KI animals is an important tool to help confirm one’ suspicions but the first element to take into consideration is the nature of the genetic data.</p>
<p>Here we had two patients with homozygous truncating variants. In human, it is well established that the presence of premature stop codons usually induces non-sense mediated mRNA decay (NMD), inducing the complete absence of the protein or a strong reduction in protein production. In the unlikely absence of NMD in our two patients, the identified variants would induce the production of proteins missing 60% and 30% of their C terminal part. Often (and it is particularly true for structural proteins) the production of abnormal proteins is more deleterious than the complete absence of the protein (and it is most likely the purpose of NMD, to limit the production of abnormal “toxic” proteins). For these reasons, to try to recapitulate the most likely consequences of the human variants, without risking obtaining an even more severe effect, we decided to introduce a stop codon in the first exon in order to remove the totality of the protein in the KO mice.</p>
<p>The second element is to interpret the phenotype of the KO animals. Here, the human sperm phenotype is perfectly recapitulated in the KO mice.</p>
<p>Overall, we have strong genetic arguments in human and the reproduction of the phenotype in KO mice confirming the pathogenicity of the variants identified in men.</p>
<p>This point is now discussed see lines 433-438</p>

<p>1. 261/267- The conclusion that mitochondrial staining in the flagellum (in both mice and humans) is non-specific is not convincing. Supplementary fig 8 shows that the signal from secondary only IF possibly extends beyond the midpiece - but it is hard to determine as no mitochondrial-specific staining is present. Either need to tone down the conclusion or provide supporting experimental evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First, to avoid the issue of the non-specificity of secondary antibodies, we performed a new set of IF experiments using an HA Tag Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated Antibody (anti-HA-AF488-C Ab) on WT and HA-CCDC146 sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel A (new). The specificity of the signal obtained with the anti-HA-AF488-C Ab on mouse spermatozoa was evaluated by performing a statistical study of the density of dots in the principal piece of the flagellum from HA-CCDC146 and WT sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel B (new). This study was carried out by analyzing 58 WT spermatozoa and 65 CCDC146 spermatozoa coming from 3 WT and 3 KI males. We found a highly significant difference, with a p-value &lt;0.0001, showing that the signal obtained on spermatozoa expressing the tagged protein is highly specific. We have added a paragraph in the MM section to describe the process of image analysis. We finally present new images obtained by ExM showing no staining in the midpiece (figure 7C new). Altogether, these results demonstrate unequivocally the presence of the protein in the flagellum.  These experiments are now described lines 271-279</p>
<p>Second, we provide new images of the signal obtained with secondary Abs only that shows more clearly that the secondary Ab gave a non-specific staining (Figure 10-Figure supplement 1B).  This point is discussed lines 503-511</p>

<p>We do not understand the remark of the reviewer “manchette in step I is not seen clearly”. The figure shows clearly the manchette (red signal) in both WT and KO (Figure 13 D1/D2).</p>
<p>For steps 13-15 WT spermatids, the size of the manchette decreases and become undetectable.

<p>1. Can the authors provide a rationale why they have chosen to tag their gene with an HA tag for localisation? One would rather think of fluorescent proteins or a Halo tag.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because the functional domains of the protein are unknown, adding a fluorescent protein of 24 KDa may interfere with both the localization and the function of CCDC146. For this reason, we choose a small tag of only 1.1 KDa, to limit as such as possible the risk of interfering with the structure of the protein. This rational is now indicated in the manuscript lines 251-254. It is worth to note, that the tagged-strain shows no sperm defect, demonstrating that the HA-tag does not interfere with CCDC146 function.</p>

It would be more helpful to write what is loaded on the gel, such as &quot;sperm&quot;. Second, in panels B and C it would be helpful to add the antibodies used. It is not clear why there is a signal in the WT lane of panel B, but not in the HA lane (supposing an anti-HA antibody is used: why has WT a specific HA band?). In panel C, it is not clear why the blot that has so beautifully shown a single band in panel B suddenly gives such a bad labelling. Can the authors explain this? Also, they cut off the blot, likely because to too much background, but this is bad practice as full blots should be shown. In the current state, the panel C does not allow any clear conclusion. To make it conclusive, it must be repeated.</p>

We have added a paragraph in the MM section to describe the process of image analysis. We finally present new images obtained by ExM showing no staining in the midpiece (figure 7C new). Altogether, these results demonstrate unequivocally the presence of the protein in the whole flagellum.</p>

<p>1. It seems that in both, Fig 7 and 8, the authors use expansion microscopy to localise CDCC146 in sperm tails. However, the staining differs substantially between the two figures. How is this explained?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In figure 8 we used the commercial Ab in human sperm, whereas in figure 7 we used the anti-HA Abs in mouse sperm. Because the antibodies do not target the same part of the CCDC146  protein (the tag is placed at the N-terminus of the protein, and the HPA020082 Ab targets the last 130 amino acids of the Cter), their accessibility to the antigenic site could be different. However, it is important to note that both antibodies target the flagellum. This explanation is now inserted see lines 304-312</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Fig 8D and line 274: the authors do a fractionation, but only show the flagella fraction. Why?</p>
<p>Showing all fractions of their experiment would have underpinned the specific enrichment of CDCC146 in the flagella fraction, which is what they aim to show. Actually, given the absence of control proteins, the fact that the band in the flagellar fraction appears to be weaker than in total sperm, one could even conclude that there is more CDCC146 in another (not analysed) fraction of this experiment. Thus, the experiment as it stands is incomplete and does not, as the authors claim, confirm the flagellar localisation of the protein.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s remark. We provide now new results showing both flagella and nuclei fractions in new figure 6A. This experiment is presented lines 253-256</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 283, Fig 9D,F: The description of the microtubules in this experiment is not easy to understand. Do the authors mean to say that the labelling shows that the protein is associated with doublet microtubules, but not with the two central microtubules? They should try to find a clearer way to explain their result.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by reviewer 2, we have changed the figure to make it clearer.  The text was changed accordingly. See new figure 9 and new corresponding legend lines 1006.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Fig 9G - how often could the authors observe this? Why is the axoneme frayed? Does this happen randomly, or did the authors apply a specific treatment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, it happens randomly during the fixation process.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 300 and Fig 10A - the authors talk about the 90-kDa band, but do say anything about what they think this band is representing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added the following sentence lines 340-342: “This band may correspond to proteolytic fragment of CCDC146, the solubilization of microtubules by sarkosyl may have made CCDC146 more accessible to endogenous proteases.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Fig 11A, lines 321-322: the authors write that the connecting piece is severely damaged. This is not obvious for somebody who does not work in sperm. Perhaps the authors could add some arrow heads to point out the defects, and briefly describe them in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We realized from your remark that our message was not clear. In fact, there is a great variability in the morphological damages of the HTCA. For instance, the HTCA of Ccdc146 KO sperm presented in figure 10A2 is quite normal, whereas that in figure 10A4 is completely distorted.  This point is now underlined in the corresponding text. See lines 367-369</p>
<p>We also added the size of the marker bar (200 nm), which were missing in the figure’s legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 323: it will be important to name which tubulin antibody has been used to identify centrioles, as they are heavily posttranslationally modified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The different types of anti-tubulin Abs are described in the corresponding figure’s legend</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Fig 11B - phenotypes must be quantified to make these observations meaningful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a quantification would improve the message. However, testicular sperm are obtained by enzymatic separation of spermatogenic cells and the number of testicular sperm are very low. Moreover, not all sperm are stained. Taking these two points into account, it seems to us that quantification could be difficult to analyze. For this reason, the quantification was not done; however, it is important to note that these defects were not observed in WT sperm, demonstrating that these defects are cased by the lack of CCDC146. We have added a sentence to underline this point; See lines 374-375</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 329: Figure 12AB - is this a typo - should it read Figure 12B?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have split the panel A in A1 and A2 and changed the text accordingly. See line 378</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Why are there not wildtype controls in Fig 12B, C?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We provide now as Figure 12-figure supplement 1, a control image for fig 12B. For figure 12C, the emergence of the flagellum from the distal centriole in WT is already shown in Fig 12A1</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Fig 13: the authors write that the manchette is &quot;clearly longer and wider than in WT cells&quot; (lines 342-343). How can they claim this without quantitative data?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provide a statistical analysis of the length of the manchette. See figure 13-figure supplement 1A. We also provide a new a new image illustrating the length of the manchette in Ccdc146 KO spermatids; See Figure 13-figure supplement 1B.</p>
