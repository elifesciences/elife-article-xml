<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Allosteric cooperativity between ATP and substrates is a prominent characteristic of the cAMP-dependent catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA). Not only this long-range synergistic action is involved in substrate recognition and fidelity, but it is also likely to regulate PKA association with regulatory subunits and other binding partners. To date, a complete understanding of the molecular determinants for this intramolecular mechanism is still lacking.</p>
<p>Here, we integrated NMR-restrained molecular dynamics simulations and a Markov State Model to characterize the free energy landscape and conformational transitions of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-C). We found that the apoenzyme populates a broad free energy basin featuring a conformational ensemble of the active state of PKA-C (ground state) and other basins with lower populations (excited states). The first excited state corresponds to a previously characterized inactive state of PKA-C with the αC helix swinging outward. The second excited state displays a disrupted hydrophobic packing around the regulatory (R) spine, with a flipped configuration of the F100 and F102 residues at the αC-β4 loop. To experimentally validate the second excited state, we mutated F100 into alanine (F100A) and used NMR spectroscopy to characterize the structural response of the kinase to ATP and substrate binding. While the catalytic efficiency of PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup> with a canonical peptide substrate remains unaltered, this mutation rearranges the αC-β4 loop conformation, interrupting the structural coupling of the two lobes and abolishing the allosteric binding cooperativity of the enzyme. The highly conserved αC-β4 loop emerges as a pivotal element able to control the synergistic binding between nucleotide and substrate. These results may explain how mutations or insertions near or within this motif affect the function and drug sensitivity in other homologous kinases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eukaryotic protein kinases (EPKs) are plastic enzymes of paramount importance in signaling processes, catalyzing phosphoryl transfer reactions, or acting as scaffolds for other enzymes and/or binding partners <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Of all kinases, the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-C) was the first to be structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> In its inhibited state, PKA-C assembles into a heterotetrametric holoenzyme comprising two catalytic (C) and two regulatory (R) subunits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> The canonical activation mechanism of PKA involves the binding of two cAMP molecules that disassemble the holoenzyme, unleashing active PKA-C monomers, which target signaling partners.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> In 2017, however, Scott and coworkers proposed an alternative activation mechanism in which the holoenzyme does not disassemble under physiological conditions; rather, it is clustered in <italic>signaling islands</italic>, localized near the substrates by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), facilitating targeted signaling interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> To date, the activation mechanism of PKA is still under active investigation since PKA-C appears to be fully liberated under pathological conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>X-ray crystallography studies revealed that PKA-C is a bilobal enzyme, with a dynamic N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) comprising four β-sheets and an αC helix, while the C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) is more rigid and mostly composed of α-helices (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> The N-lobe harbors the nucleotide-binding site, whereas the substrate binding cleft lays at the interface between the N- and C-lobe. The three-dimensional structure of PKA-C features a highly conserved hydrophobic core decorated with catalytically important motifs, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the Gly-rich loop, DFG-loop, activation loop, and magnesium and peptide positioning loops.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> In the catalytically active state, these motifs are all poised for phosphoryl transfer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> a condition necessary but not sufficient to define an active kinase. More recent studies revealed a critical role of the enzyme’s hydrophobic core, which is crossed by a catalytic (C) spine and a regulatory (R) spine surrounded by shell residues (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> The C spine comprises an array of hydrophobic residues and is assembled upon binding ATP, whereas the R spine is engaged when the activation loop is phosphorylated at Thr197, which positions the αC-helix in an active configuration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup></p>

<p>A distinct property of PKA-C is the binding cooperativity between ATP and substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> In the catalytic cycle, the kinase binds ATP and unphosphorylated substrates with positive binding cooperativity, whereas a negative binding cooperativity between ADP and phosphorylated substrate characterizes the exit complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> The biological importance of these phenomena has been emphasized by our recent studies on disease-driven mutations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> which all feature disrupted cooperativity between nucleotides and protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) or canonical substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Since the recognition sequence of substrates is highly homologous to that of the R subunits,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> a loss of cooperativity may affect not only substrate binding fidelity but also regulatory processes. Thus far, the molecular determinants for the binding cooperativity between nucleotide and sub-strate and its role in PKA signalosome remain elusive.</p>
<p>Aiming to define the allosteric mechanism for PKA-C cooperativity, we combined NMR-restrained replica-averaged metadynamics (RAM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and Markov State Model (MSM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and charted the conformational landscape and dynamic transitions of the main forms of PKA-C. We found that the apo kinase occupies three distinct basins: (<italic>i</italic>) a most populated ground state (GS) with constitutively active conformations competent for catalysis, (<italic>ii</italic>) a first high free energy basin representative of typical inactive states with a dislodged configuration of the αC helix (ES1), and (<italic>iii</italic>) a second high free energy basin with a disrupted hydrophobic array of residues at the core of the enzyme (ES2). Notably, the equilibrium between the most populated ground state and the other low-populated states agrees with previous NMR Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> To compound the existence of the second inactive basin, we mutated F100 at the αC-β4 loop into Ala (PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup>) and characterized its ligand binding thermodynamics and structural response by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NMR spectroscopy, respectively. We found that PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup> phosphorylates a canonical peptide with a catalytic efficiency similar to the wild-type kinase (PKA-C<sup>WT</sup>); however, this mutation abolishes the binding cooperativity between nucleotide and substrate. The NMR experiments reveal that F100A perturbs the hydrophobic packing around the αC-β4 loop and interrupts the allosteric communication between the two lobes of the enzyme. Overall, these results emphasize the pivotal role of the αC-β4 loop in kinase function and may explain why single-site mutations or insertion mutations stabilizing this motif in homologous kinases result in oncogenes and confer differential drug sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup></p>

<title>The free energy landscape of PKA-C charted by NMR-restrained replica-averaged metadynamics (RAM) simulations</title>
<p>To characterize the experimentally accessible conformational landscape of PKA-C in the µs-to-ms timescale, we performed NMR-restrained metadynamics simulations within the RAM framework.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> Using four replicas restrained with backbone chemical shifts (CS), we simulated the apo, binary (PKA-C/ATP), and ternary (PKA-C/ATP/PKI<sub>5-24</sub>) complexes of PKA-C. Incorporating the CS restrains in the simulations ensures a close agreement with the conformational space explored by the kinase under our NMR experimental conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> whereas the enhanced sampling through metadynamics simulations boosts the conformational plasticity of the enzyme along different degrees of freedom (<italic>i.e.</italic>, collective variables, CVs. See Methods) (<bold><xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1</xref></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> In our case, back-calculations of the CS values with Sparta+ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> show that the restrained simulations improved the agreement between theoretical and experimental CS values of ∼0.2 ppm for the amide N atoms and ∼0.1 ppm for the remainder backbone atoms (<bold><xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 2</xref></bold>). Also, the bias-exchange metadynamics allow each replica to span a significantly broader conformational space relative to classical MD simulations (<bold><xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 3</xref></bold>). The metadynamics simulations were equilibrated and converged in 300 ns (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig2s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 4</xref></bold>). The full free energy landscape was then reconstructed by sampling an extra 100 ns of production phase with reduced bias along each CV. We found that the population of the PKA-C conformers is modulated by ATP and pseudosubstrate binding within the NMR detection limit of sparsely populated states (∼ 0.5% or ΔG &lt; 3.2 kcal/mol).</p>

<p>Specifically, the apo PKA-C populates preferentially a ground state and five readily accessible low-populated excited states (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Figure 2 – supplementary table 1</xref></bold>). The binary complex populates the same ground state and a broad higher energy basin (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Figure 2 – supplementary table 1</xref></bold>). Finally, the ternary complex occupies a narrower dominant ground state (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Figure 2 – supplementary table 1</xref></bold>). Overall, these calculations revealed that the apo kinase explores multiple minima along each CV. The binding of ATP shifts the population of the ensemble into an additional minimum, featuring structures that are committed to substrate binding. Finally, the conformational heterogeneity of the ensemble is significantly reduced upon formation of the ternary complex, which represents a catalytically committed state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). The free energy landscape obtained from these RAM simulations is consistent with the qualitative picture previously inferred from our NMR spin relaxation experiments and hydrogen/deuterium exchange studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> while providing a detailed structural characterization of the ground and sparsely populated conformationally excited states.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>MSM reveals the conformational transitions of PKA-C from ground to high free energy (excited) states</title>
<p>To refine the free energy landscape and delineate the kinetics of conformational transitions of the kinase, we performed additional unbiased sampling to build Markov State Models (MSM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> MSMs are commonly used to describe the dynamic transitions of various metastable states for macromolecules in terms of their populations and transition rates. MSMs are typically created by combining thousands of short unbiased simulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Following this strategy, we performed several short simulations (10 – 20 ns) using thousands of the low free energy conformations (ΔG &lt; 3.2 kcal/mol) chosen randomly from the three forms of PKA-C as starting structures. The conformational ensembles were clustered into microstates and seeded to start a second round of adaptive sampling (see Methods). This iterative process was repeated three times to assure convergence and yielded 100 μs trajectories for both the apo and binary forms, whereas 60 μs trajectories were collected for the less dynamic ternary complex. Once we reached a sufficient sampling, we built an MSM including L95, V104, L106, M118, M120, Y164, and F185 to investigate the dynamic transitions of the hydrophobic R spine and shell residues (<bold><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). These residues are ideal reporters of the dynamic processes governing the activation/deactivation of the kinase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> To compare the free energy landscape of different complexes, we projected the conformational ensembles of three forms and existing crystal structures of PKA-C onto the first two time-lagged independent components (tICs) of the apo form, which were obtained by a time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA). These tICs represent the directions of the slowest motion of the kinase and visualize the conformational transitions of V104, L95, and F185 (<bold><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). The MSM shows that the hydrophobic core of the apo PKA-C accesses three major basins. The broadest basin represents the ground state (GS) and corresponds to the conformations of PKA-C captured in several crystal structures (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). The other two states (conformationally excited states) are less populated. The first excited state (ES1) features a disrupted hydrophobic packing of L95, V104, and F185. This conformation matches an inactive state with an outward orientation of the αC-helix typical of the inhibited states of PKA-C (<bold><xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure supplement 2</xref></bold>). The second state (ES2) displays a flipped configuration of the V104 side chain and disrupted hydrophobic interactions responsible for anchoring the αC-β4 loop to the C-lobe, with F100 and F102 adopting a gauche+ configuration and forming a stable π-π stacking. (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). In contrast, the active GS ensemble features a <italic>trans</italic> configuration for the F100 and F102 side chains that stabilize the π-π stacking with Y156 at the αE-helix and cation-π interactions with R308 at the C-tail (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). To our knowledge, the ES2 state was never observed in the available crystal structures. Upon ATP binding, the confor-mational space spanned by the kinase becomes narrower, and the conformers populate mostly the GS, with a small fraction in the ES1 state (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). This is consistent with the role of the nucleotide as an allosteric effector that enhances the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> In the ternary form (ATP and PKI-bound), PKA-C populates only the GS consistent with the competent conformation observed in the ternary structure (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 1ATP). In this case, the αC-β4 loop of the enzyme is locked in a well-defined, active configuration (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>).</p>

Finally, we used kinetic Monte Carlo sampling to characterize the slow transition between different states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> In the GS state of the apo PKA-C, F100 and F102 adopt <italic>trans</italic> configurations that stabilize the interactions with the αE and αJ helices, and, together with the nucleotide, they lock the αC-β4 loop in an active state (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). The GS to ES1 transition features the disruption of the K72-E91 salt bridge, typical of the inactive kinase.

Interestingly, the GS to ES2 transition involves a concerted disruption of the D166-N171 and K168-T201 electrostatic interactions and the destabilization of the packing between W222 and the APE motif (A206 and P207) required for substrate recognition (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>).

<title>The F100A mutation disrupts the allosteric network of the kinase</title>
<p>The above analysis suggests that the destabilization of the αC-β4 loop may promote the GS to ES2 transition of the kinase. To validate this hypothesis, we generated the F100A mutant seeking to increase the flexibility of the αC-β4 loop. Starting from the coordinates of the X-ray structure of the ternary complex (PDB ID: 4WB5), we simulated the F100A dynamics in an explicit water environment. First, we performed a short equilibration using classical MD simulations. During 1 μs of MD simulations, the αC-β4 loop of the F100A mutant undergoes a significant motion as manifested by increased values of the backbone root mean square deviation (rmsd) and a conformational change (flipping) of the F102 side chain (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). This region in PKA-C<sup>WT</sup> adopts a stable β-turn, with a persistent hydrogen bond between the backbone oxygen of F100 and the amide hydrogen of L103. In contrast, the hydrogen bond in F100A is formed more frequently between A100 and F102, resulting in an average γ-turn conformation (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>). Such local rearrangement not only disrupts the hydrogen bond between N99 and Y156, altering the interactions between the αC-β4 loop and the αE helix but also destabilizes the cation-π interaction between F102 and R308 at the C-tail (<bold><xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B – supplementary figure 1</xref></bold>)</p>

<p>The structural changes of the αC-β4 loop caused by the F100A mutation propagate through the protein core across the R spine, C spines, and shell residues (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>), and alter the response of the kinase to nucleotide binding. In the PKA-C<sup>WT</sup>, ATP binding shifts the conformational ensemble of the kinase toward an intermediate state competent to substrate binding, as represented by the changes in the population densities of the hydrophobic core residues as a function of the rmsd (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>). For F100A, the population of the C spine follows the same trend of the WT kinase, with the shell residues already populating the intermediate state. In contrast, the R spine residues fail to adopt a competent state (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>). The latter is due to the perturbation of hydrophobic packing of L95 and L106 in the R spine, and V104 in the shell near the mutation site. Using the lowest principal components, we also analyzed the global dynamic response of the kinase to ATP binding. Not only does F100A change the breathing mode of the two lobes (PC1), but it also alters the shearing motion (PC2) of the binary complex, emphasizing the importance of this allosteric site for the inter-lobe communication (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-E</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Effects of the F100A mutation on the catalytic efficiency and binding thermodynamics of PKA-C</title>

<title>NMR mapping of nucleotide/pseudosubstrate binding response</title>

CHESCA works under the assumption that pairwise correlated CS changes of residues identify possible intramolecular allosteric networks.<sup>52,53</sup> For PKA-C, we found that coordinated structural rearrangements, as identified by CHESCA, are directly related to the extent of binding cooperativity.<sup>22,23,27</sup> Therefore, we compared the CHESCA maps for PKA-C<sup>WT</sup> and PKAC<sup>F100A</sup> for four different states: <italic>apo</italic>, ATPγN-, ADP-, and ATPγN/PKI<sub>5–24</sub>-bound. For PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup>, the CHESCA matrix exhibits sparser and more attenuated correlations (<italic>i.e.</italic>, lower correlation co-efficient value) relative to PKA-C<sup>WT</sup> (<bold>Figure 10A</bold>). Although many inter-lobe correlations are still present for F100A, several other correlations in specific structural domains such as the αG-, αH-, and αI-helices are absent or attenuated. For instance, the F100A mutation does not display cor-relations between the αA-helix and the C-terminal tail that constitute a critical “complement to the kinase core”.<sup>54</sup> We also utilized CHESCA to assess the allosteric communication among the PKA-C communities as defined by McClendon <italic>et al</italic>.<sup>55</sup> The CHESCA community map for PKA-C<sup>WT</sup> shows strong correlations across the enzyme, especially for structurally adjacent communities and at the interface between the two lobes (see for instance the correlations among <italic>ComA</italic>, <italic>ComB</italic>, <italic>ComC</italic>, <italic>ComE</italic>, and <italic>ComH</italic>) (<bold>Figure 10B-C</bold>). For F100A, the CHESCA community map shows that the cross-talk between the nucleotide-binding (<italic>ComA</italic>) and positioning of αC-helix (<italic>ComB</italic>) communities, as well as the R-spine assembly (<italic>ComC</italic>) and the activation loop (<italic>ComF</italic>) communities are preserved (<bold>Figure 10B-C</bold>). However, the correlations between <italic>ComE</italic>, responsible for stabilizing the C spine, and <italic>ComC</italic>, involved in the assembly of the R spine, are absent.

Finally, several correlations between <italic>ComF1</italic>, <italic>ComG</italic>, and <italic>ComH</italic> are no longer present. These communities orchestrate substrate recognition and R subunits binding. Overall, the CHESCA analysis for PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup> suggests that the reduced degree of cooperativity we determined thermodynamically corresponds to a decrease in coordinated structural changes upon ligand binding.

<p>To determine the global response to ligand binding for WT and F100A, we analyzed the chemical shifts of the amide fingerprints of the two proteins using the COordiNated ChemIcal Shifts bEhavior (CONCISE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> CONCISE describes the overall changes of the protein fingerprint resonances by providing the probability density (population) of each state along the conformational equilibrium for binding phenomena that follow linear CS trajectories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> For PKA-C<sup>WT</sup>, both nucleotide and pseudosubstrate binding shift the overall population of the amides from an open to an intermediate and a fully closed state (<bold><xref rid="fig9s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 – figure supplement 2</xref></bold>). A similar trend is observed for PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup>, though the probability densities are broader, indicating that the amide resonances follow a less coordinated response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> Also, the maximum of the probability density for the ternary complex is shifted toward the left, indicating that the mutant adopts a more open structure than the corresponding wild-type enzyme. Overall, the shapes and the positions of the probability distributions of the resonances suggests that several residues do not respond in a coordinated manner to the nucleotide binding, and PKI<sub>5-24</sub> shifts the conformation of the kinase toward a partially closed state, which explains the loss in binding cooperativity as previously observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup><sup>-</sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our structural and dynamic studies suggest that the binding cooperativity of PKA-C originates from the allosteric coupling between the nucleotide-binding pocket and the interfacial region between the two lobes, which harbors the substrate binding cleft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> The latter has been emphasized for other kinases such as Src and ERK2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> The biological significance of this intramolecular communication has emerged from our recent studies on pathological mutations situated in the activation loop of PKA-C and linked to Cushing’s syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> These mutations drastically reduce substrate binding affinity, and more importantly, disrupt the communication between the two ligand binding pockets of the kinase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Interestingly, the E31V mutation distal from the active site and also related to the Cushing’s syndrome, displays disfunction similar to the other orthosteric mutations, suggesting that it is possible to modulate substrate recognition allosterically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Indeed, these mutations are connected to allosteric nodes that, once perturbed, radiate their effects towards the periphery of the enzyme interrupting the coordinated dynamic coupling between the two lobes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Interestingly, these mutations do not prevent Kemptide phosphorylation; rather, they cause a loss of substrate fidelity with consequent aberrant phosphorylation of downstream substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> Additionally, recent thermodynamic and NMR analyses of PKA-C binding to different nucleotides and inhibitors demonstrated that it is possible to control substrate binding affinity by changing the chemistry of the ligand at the ATP binding pocket.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> Altogether, these studies put forward the idea that substrate phosphorylation and cooperativity between ATP and substrates may be controlled independently.</p>
<p>By integrating our NMR data with RAM simulations and MSM, we comprehensively mapped the free energy landscape of PKA-C in various forms. We found that the active kinase unleashed from the regulatory subunits occupies a broad energy basin (GS) that corresponds to the conformation of the ternary structure of PKA-C with ATP and pseudosubstrate (PKI<sub>5-24</sub>), exemplifying a catalytic competent state poised for phosphoryl transfer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> We also identified two orthogonal conformationally excited states, ES1 and ES2. While ES1 corresponds to canonical inactive kinase conformations, the ES2 state was never observed in the crystallized structures. Our previous CEST NMR measurements suggested the presence of an additional sparsely populated state that, at that time, we were unable to characterize structurally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> The chemical shifts of this state did not follow the opening and closing of the kinase active cleft and were assigned to a possible alternate inactivation pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> These new simulations and MSM show that this sparsely populated state may be attributed to the transition from GS to ES2, which features a disruption of hydrophobic packing, with a conformational rearrangement for the αC-β4 loop that causes a partial disruption of the hydrophobic R spine. These structural changes rewire the allosteric coupling between the two lobes, as shown by mutual information analysis. A single mutation (F100A), suggested by our simulations, promotes the flip of the αC-β4 loop and reproduces the hypothesized structural un-coupling between the two lobes of PKA-C. We experimentally tested the effects of the F100A mutation and found that it prevents the enzyme from adopting a conformation competent for substrate binding, resulting in a drastic reduction of the cooperativity between ATP and substrate. These NMR data further support our working model, showing that if the inter-lobe communication is interrupted, the binding response of the kinase is attenuated. Indeed, our investigation further emphasizes the integral role of the kinase hydrophobic core and demonstrates that alterations in the spines and shell residues may lead to a dysfunctional kinase by either preventing phosphorylation (see V104G and I150A mutations)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> or by disrupting the binding cooperativity as for F100A.</p>
<p>The αC-β4 loop is a regulatory element present in all EPKs and its importance has been stressed in bioinformatics studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> and supported by computational work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> F100 and F102 in the αC-β4 loop are at intersections of various structural communities and constitute a critical hydrophobic node that anchors the N- to the C-lobe. Also, studies on EGFR and ErbB2 kinases led to the hypothesis that the αC-β4 loop may act as a molecular brake <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> or an autoinhibitory switch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> Therefore, it is not surprising that activating mutations and in-frame insertions in the αC-β4 loop are frequently found in kinase-related cancers and somatic oncogenic mutations such as P101S, P101L, and L103F.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> Also, an elegant study by Kannan and coworkers emphasized the role of the αC-β4 loop in dimerization and aberrant activation of EGFR by insertion mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Moreover, in a recent paper Zhang and co-workers found a similar behavior for the HER2 exon 20 insertions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> These latter two studies propose that in-frame insertions alter the conformational landscape of the kinase rigidifying the structure around the αC-β4 loop and restricting the kinase conformational ensemble in a constitutively active state. Remarkably, in the case of EGRF insertion mutations, the activation of the kinase occurs in a length-dependent manner. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Additionally, these human mutations display a gradual response to drugs, which can be exploited for designing selective inhibitors against EGFR pathological mutants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>The data presented here show that it is possible to abolish the binding cooperativity of a kinase by turning the dial in the opposite direction, <italic>i.e.</italic>, increasing the flexibility of the αC-β4 loop and disconnecting the allosteric network between the N- and C-lobes. The identification of this new, partially inactivating pathway provides further understanding of how to control the dynamics and function of kinases.</p>

<title>CHEmical Shift Covariance Analysis (CHESCA)</title>
<p>This analysis was used to identify and characterize allosteric networks of residues showing concerted responses to nucleotide and pseudosubstrate binding. To identify inter-residue correlations, four states were used: apo, ATPγN-bound, ADP-bound, and ATPγN/PKI<sub>5–24</sub>. The identification of inter-residue correlations by CHESCA relies on agglomerative clustering (AC) and singular value decomposition (SVD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> Pairwise correlations of chemical shift changes were calculated to identify networks. When plotted on a correlation matrix, the 2D correlations allow the identification of local and long-range correlated residues. For each residue, the maximum change in the chemical shift was calculated in both the <sup>1</sup>H (<italic>x</italic>) and <sup>15</sup>N (<italic>y</italic>) dimensions (Δδ<italic><sub>x,y</sub></italic>). The residues included in the CHESCA analysis were those satisfying Δδ<sub>x,y</sub> &gt; ½ <italic>Δν</italic><sub>x<italic>A</italic>,y<italic>A</italic></sub>+½ <italic>Δν</italic><sub>x<italic>B</italic>,y<italic>B</italic></sub>, where A and B correspond to two different forms analyzed, and Δν denotes the linewidth. Correlation scores were used to quantify the CHESCA correlation of a single residue or a group of residues with another group. Correlation scores were evaluated for single residues or for the entire protein using the following expression:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="557419v2_ueqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>R<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the correlation coefficient and <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> denote (a) a single residue and the remainder residues of the protein, respectively, or (b) both represent all the assigned residues in the entire protein. For all the analyses a <italic>R<sub>cutoff</sub></italic> of 0.98 was used. Community CHESCA analysis utilizes a similar approach to map correlations between functional communities within the kinase. Each community represents a group of residues associated with a function or regulatory mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> To represent community-based CHESCA analysis, we utilized <italic>R<sub>cutoff</sub></italic> &gt; 0.8. For instance, to represent a chemical shift correlation between two community (X and Y) with <italic>n<sub>A</sub></italic> and <italic>n<sub>B</sub></italic> number of assigned residues, respectively, the correlation score between A and B is defined as
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="557419v2_ueqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>R<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the correlation coefficient between residue <italic>i</italic> (belonging to community A) and residue <italic>j</italic> (belonging to community B). <italic>R<sub>cutoff</sub></italic> is the correlation value cutoff. <italic>R<sub>A,B</sub></italic> assumes values from 0 (no correlation between residues in A and B) to 1 (all residues in A have correlations &gt; cut-off with all residues in B).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study provides an example of integrating computational and experimental approaches that lead to new insights into the energy landscape of a model kinase. <bold>Compelling</bold> use of molecular dynamics simulations and NMR spectroscopy provide a conformational description of active and excited states of the kinase; one of which has not been captured in previously solved crystal structures. Overall, this comprehensive study expands our understanding of the architecture and allosteric features of the conserved bilobal kinase domain structure.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors use insights into the dynamics of the PKA kinase domain, obtained by NMR experiments, to inform MD simulations that generate an energy landscape of PKA kinase domain conformational dynamics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors integrate strong experimental data through the use of state-of-the-art MD studies and derive detailed insights into allosteric communication in PKA kinase. Comparison of wt kinase with a mutant (F100A) shows clear differences in the allosteric regulation of the two proteins. These differences can be rationalized by NMR and MD results. During the revision process, the authors have addressed the reviewers' comments adequately and have improved the accessibility of the manuscript to a wider audience.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Combining several MD simulation techniques (NMR-constrained replica-exchange metadynamics, Markov State Model, and unbiased MD) the authors identified the aC-beta4 loop of PKA kinase as a switch crucially involved in PKA nucleotide/substrate binding cooperatively. They identified a previously unreported excited conformational state of PKA (ES2), this switch controls and characterized ES2 energetics with respect to the ground state. Based on translating the simulations into chemical shits and NMR characterizing of PKA WT and an aC-beta4 mutant, the author made a convincing case in arguing that the simulation-suggested excited state is indeed an excited state observed by NMR, thus giving the excited state conformational details.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work incorporates extensive simulation works, new NMR data, and in vitro biochemical analysis. It stands out in its comprehensiveness, and I think it made a great case.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is somewhat difficult to read even for kinase experts, and even harder for the layman. The difficulty partially arises from mixing the technical description of the simulations with the structural interpretation of the results, which is more intuitive, and partially arises from the assumption that readers are familiar with kinase architecture and its key elements (the aC helix, the APE motif, etc).</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>The very detailed insights gained by the authors into allosteric regulation require very specialized techniques in this study. This poses a challenge to communicate the methods, the results, and the meaning of the results to a broader audience. In some places, the authors overcome this challenge better than in others.</p>

<p>Fig3: GS-ES2 transition: the changes appear minimal in the illustration.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by this reviewer, we have re-examined the GS-ES2 transition and clearly defined the structural characteristics of the conformationally excited state 2 (ES2) state. As shown in the revised Fig.3 of the main text, the ground state (GS) features a π-π packing between the aromatic rings of F100 and Y156, as well as a cation-π stacking between R308 and F102. In the ES2 state, these above interactions are disrupted, while a new π-π packing interaction is formed between F100 and F102. We added new comments in the main text clarifying these structural interactions that characterize each state.</p>

<p>GS-ES1 transition: how is the K72-E91 salt bridge disrupted? How do you define the formation/disruption of a salt bridge? The current figure does not make this very clear and the K72-E91 salt bridge appears to be intact in ES1. Maybe the authors could replace the dotted K72-E91 line with a dotted line and distance?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated above, we revised Fig. 3 highlighting the differences between the two states. The K72 and E91 salt bridge is formed when the distance between Nε of K72 and Oε of E91 is shorter than 4.0 Å
(the typical cutoff for a salt bridge). In the ES1 state, the outward movement of the αC helix increases the distance over 4.5 Å, disrupting the salt bridge.</p>

<p>L251: Could the authors remind the reader why they are only comparing V104 and I150? Could they give a little context as to why they consider the agreement to be good? It appears that they would be statistically different, so a little context for what comprises a good agreement in the literature may be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our mutagenesis studies show that V104 and I150 are key residues for allosteric communication, and if mutated, result in well-folded but inactive kinases (Sci Adv. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.1600663). Importantly, V104 and I150 show two distinct populations in the CEST experiments that can be directly related to the GS and ES states. Regarding the fitting of these residues, we obtained a good agreement with the direction of the chemical shifts, which supports the hypothesized GS -&gt; ES structural transition. The lack of a quantitative agreement between the chemical shifts of the experimental and simulated excited state is not surprising for two reasons a) all state-of-the art simulations fall short in sampling slow conformational interconversions, and b) the uncertainty of the SHIFTX algorithm for the prediction of 13C chemical shifts of methyl groups is quite large. Finally, we would like to point out that most NMR relaxation-dispersion experiments (CEST and CPMG) are performed for the backbone 15N, 13Calpha and 1H resonances, which have been used to calculate the structures of the intermediate states (Neudecker, P. et. al Science, 2012, 336,doi: 10.1126/science.1214203) and yield reasonable agreement with the prediction for metastable states derived from Markov Models (Olsson, S. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2017,139,doi:10.1021/jacs.6b09460). To the best of our knowledge, there is no literature reporting on calculations of the 13C CEST profiles for methyl groups from MD simulations, and remarkably, we found a reasonably good agreement between experimental and predicted chemical shifts (see Fig.5C).</p>

<p>Just to clarify: the calculated CS values are informed by experimental CS values that were used in the calculation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used the backbone chemical shifts as the restraints only in the metadynamics simulations. We used the chemical shifts of the methyl groups and their corresponding excited states to verify the ES2 state.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>While the alphaC-beta4 loop is a conserved feature of protein kinases, the residues within this loop vary across various kinase families and groups, enabling group and family-specific control of activity through cis and trans acting elements. F102 in PKA interacts with co-conserved residues in the C-tail, which has been proposed to function as a cis regulatory element. The authors should elaborate on the conformational changes in the C-tail, particularly in the arginine that packs against F102, in the results and discussion. This would further extend the impact and scope of the manuscript, which is currently confined to PKA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by this reviewer, we re-analyzed the time-dependent interactions between F102 and R308 at the C-tail. As this reviewer suspected, these interactions differentiate the ES2 from the GS state. In the GS state, there is a stable cation-π interaction between F102 and R308, which becomes transient in the ES2 state (Fig. 3). For the F100A mutant, the interactions between F102 and R308 have lower occurrence relative to the WT enzyme, i.e., a weaker interaction between the αC-β4 loop and the C-tail (see new Figure 6 - figure supplement 1). The latter supports our conclusion that the structural coupling between the C-tail and the two lobes of the enzyme decreases for the F100A mutant. We added more comments in the main text.</p>

<p>Due to the large size of the simulations (&gt;500 GB), we could not deposit them in the Data

<p>The authors state that ES1 and ES2 states are novel and not observed in previous crystal structures. The authors should quantify this through comparisons with PKA inactive states and with other AGC kinases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion. We now clarify that the ES1 is a well-known inactivation pathway.
As suggested by this reviewer, we now report a few examples of active and inactive conformations of PKA-C and other kinases (see new Figure 3 – figure supplement 2.). Briefly, ES1 corresponds to the typical αC-out conformation found for PKA-C bound to inhibitors or in R194A mutant. A similar conformation is present for Src, Abl, and CDK2. The C-out conformation features a disrupted β3K-αCE salt bridge, which is key for active kinases. In contrast, the transition GS-ES2 is not present in the inactive conformations deposited in the PDB.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Based on the results, can the authors speculate on the impact of oncogenic mutations in the alphaCbeta4 loop mutations in PKA?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now include additional comments and another citation that further supports our findings. In short, the activation of a kinase is generated by mutation insertions that stabilize the αC-β4 loop as pointed out by Kannan and Zhang (see references 28, 30, and 68). In contrast, mutations that destabilize this allosteric site (e.g., F100A) are inactivating, disrupting the structural couplings of the two lobes (our work).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript is somewhat difficult to read even for kinase experts, and even harder for the layman. The difficulty partially arises from mixing technical description of the simulations with structural interpretation of the results, which is more intuitive, and partially arises from the assumption that readers are familiar with kinase architecture and its key elements (the aC helix, the APE motif, etc).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We revised the text and modified Fig. 1 in the main text to make the paper more accessible to the general audience.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors haven't done a good job describing the ES2 state intuitively. From my examination of the figures, it appears that in the ES2 state, the kinase domain is more elongated and the N and the C lobes are relatively less engaged than in the ground state. This may or may not be exactly, but a more intuitive description of the ES2 state is needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by this reviewer, we include a better description of the ES2 state of the kinase and the structural details of the inactivation pathway. Also, we checked the radius of gyration of the two lobes for GS and ES2. ES2 is slightly more elongated with an Rg of 20.3 ± 0.1 Å as compared to the GS state (20.0 ± 0.2 Å). This marginal difference is consistent with our characterization of the local packing around the C-4 loop, in which the lack of stable interaction with E and C-tail in the ES2 state makes the overall structure less compact.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors need to introduce and give a brief description of technical terms such as CV (collective variable), PC (principal component) etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now specify both collective variables and principal components and include those definitions in the Method section. Briefly, to characterize the complex conformational transitions of PKA-C, we utilize collective variables (Figure 2 – figure supplement 1). We chose these variables based on structural motifs described in the literature to define local and global structural transitions (Camilloni C., Vendruscolo, M, Biochemistry, 2015,54,7470; Kukic, P. et al. Structure, 2015,23, 745). On the other hand, we utilized the principal component analysis to compare the conformational changes of the kinase in the same two-dimensional space, revealing the two lowest frequencies that define the global motions of the enzyme (Figures 7C, D, and E).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The following paper should be discussed as it discussed similar ATP/substrate binding of Src kinase based on an extensive network that largely overlaps with the discussed PKA network. Foda, et al. &quot;A dynamically coupled allosteric network underlies binding cooperativity in Src kinase.&quot; Nature communications 6.1 (2015): 5939.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for missing this citation. Indeed, it makes our finding more general as allosteric cooperativity is key in other kinases such as Src and ERK2. We included this in the Discussion section.</p>

<p>The CHESCA analysis appears to be an add-on that doesn't add much value. It is difficult to direct. I'd suggest considering removing it to the SI.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand this concern. We rewrote part of the paper to make the NMR analysis of the correlated chemical shifts described by the CHESCA matrices linked to the MD calculations.</p>
