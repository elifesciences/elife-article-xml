<title>Abstract</title><p>There is optimism that cancer drug resistance can be addressed through appropriate combination therapy, but success requires understanding the growing complexity of resistance mechanisms, including the evolution and population dynamics of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant clones over time. Using DNA barcoding to trace individual prostate tumor cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, we find that the evolutionary path to acquired resistance to androgen receptor signaling inhibition (ARSI) is dependent on the timing of treatment. In established tumors, resistance occurs through polyclonal adaptation of drug-sensitive clones, despite the presence of rare subclones with known, pre-existing ARSI resistance. Conversely, in an experimental setting designed to mimic minimal residual disease, resistance occurs through outgrowth of pre-existing resistant clones and <underline>not</underline> by adaptation. Despite these different evolutionary paths, the underlying mechanisms responsible for resistance are shared across the two evolutionary paths. Furthermore, mixing experiments reveal that the evolutionary path to adaptive resistance requires cooperativity between subclones. Thus, despite the presence of pre-existing ARSI-resistant subclones, acquired resistance in established tumors occurs primarily through cooperative, polyclonal adaptation of drug-sensitive cells. This tumor ecosystem model of resistance has new implications for developing effective combination therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer patients treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, molecularly targeted therapy and immunotherapy often confront the formidable challenge of drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). These resistant tumors compromise patient prognosis and pose a significant obstacle to effective cancer management. The term “upfront”” resistance is often used to refer to clinical scenarios where the tumor is unresponsive at the beginning of treatment, whereas “acquired” resistance refers to tumors that are initially responsive but subsequently relapse. For cancers with canonical oncogenic driver mutations, upfront resistance may be a consequence of co-occurring genomic alterations that mitigate dependence of tumor cells on the initial primary driver alteration. <italic>PTEN</italic> loss in the setting of treating <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-mutant breast cancer with a PI3K inhibitor serves as an example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). On the other hand, acquired resistance is a consequence of a cell-intrinsic or cell-extrinsic change that prevents an initially effective drug from continuing to inhibit tumor growth. Examples of cell intrinsic mechanisms include mutation of the drug target in a manner that preserves oncogenic activity but precludes inhibition, or epigenetic changes that alter the cell state of the tumor such that it is no longer dependent on the drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Cell-extrinsic mechanisms include changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that “rescue” the tumor by providing new growth signals that bypass the effect of the targeted therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). More complex, population-level processes may also be at play, including transcriptional heterogeneity among tumor cells as well as adaptive TME responses to therapeutic stress that, collectively, can rewire survival pathways in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>The androgen receptor (AR) is a lineage survival factor for luminal prostate epithelial cells and, on that basis, provides the rationale for the use of androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) as the primary treatment for advanced prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). ARSI therapy is used to treat patients with metastatic disease measured by radiographic imaging, as well as patients with biochemical relapse, a state of minimal residual disease defined by elevated levels of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) but no radiographically detectable disease. Current insight into acquired ARSI resistance comes primarily from genomic sequencing analysis of tumors from patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Mechanisms include AR amplification/mutation, structural variants in the AR genomic locus, and aberrant AR mRNA slicing, all of which typically reflect persistent AR pathway dependency. Of note, an increasing fraction of ARSI-resistant tumors display features of lineage plasticity, whereby tumor cells transition from a luminal state to basal-like, mesenchymal, stem-like or neuroendocrine states that are no longer dependent on AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Whether these same mechanisms are relevant in the setting of minimal residual disease, where the surrounding TME is not fully established, is not known.</p>
<p>To gain insight into this question, we used <italic>in vivo</italic> barcoding to trace the evolutionary path resistance in two human prostate cancer xenografts treated with ARSI in two different ways: one to model the minimal residual disease setting and the second to model the measurable disease setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Remarkably, the path to ARSI resistance differs across these two treatment settings but the underlying molecular mechanisms are convergent. Furthermore, acquired resistance in the measurable disease setting requires cooperativity between subclones, indicative of a tumor ecosystem that could potentially be targeted to achieve effective combination therapy.</p>

<title>ARSI resistance in established tumors is adaptive despite the presence of pre-existing resistant clones</title>
<p>To determine the evolutionary trajectory of ARSI resistance (ARSI<sup>R</sup>), we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular barcoding experiments to track individual cells in mixed populations using ClonTracer, a method previously used to study the origin of drug-resistant clones in models of non-small lung cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). This method provides a powerful tool to distinguish between pre-existing resistance (the same barcode is enriched in multiple independent ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors but not in control tumors) and adaptive resistance (a similar barcode profile is recovered from ARSI<sup>R</sup> and control tumors). This distinction between pre-existing and adaptive resistance can be statistically quantified using Pearson correlation matrices. Barcoding also provides an opportunity, through single cell cloning, to isolate the clones responsible for subsequent <italic>in vivo</italic> biology from the initial starting population of cells, thereby providing an opportunity to characterize the molecular properties responsible for emergent ARSI<sup>R</sup> prior to exposure to any selective pressure.</p>
<p>We focused initially on the LNCaP/AR xenograft model due to its track record of revealing clinically relevant mechanisms of antiandrogen resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). To introduce the library into LNCaP/AR cells, we intentionally used a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) to generate ∼10,000 uniquely barcoded cells, a number chosen based on an estimated frequency of pre-existing resistant cells (if they exist) of ∼0.1% and the need to recover identical barcodes from such pre-existing resistant cells across different xenografted animals (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref></bold>, see methods for more detail) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Toward this end, we generated a population of LNCaP/AR cells labeled with 11,600 unique barcodes (hereafter called pre-graft), expanded the cells, and then established xenografts in hormonally intact mice (control) or surgically pre-castrated mice treated with Enz (called pre-engraftment ARSI) to mirror the clinical use of ARSI therapy in a setting of non-radiographically measurable, minimal residual disease (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A-B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>After tumor progression, control and ARSI-resistant (ARSI<sup>R</sup>) tumors were harvested and subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to compare barcode recovery across these two conditions relative to pre-graft. As expected, the number of barcodes recovered from tumors in both groups was reduced relative to pre-graft, reflecting a well-known bottleneck in tumor initiation seen when xenografting cancer cell lines. Turning to the comparison of interest, ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors contained significantly fewer barcodes than controls, and these barcodes were shared across tumors (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 1B-C</xref></bold>). To quantify the difference in barcode enrichment in the intact versus ARSI setting, we ranked each barcode by percentage abundance and noted that barcode enrichment in control versus ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors was non-overlapping (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). This conclusion was confirmed by a Pearson correlation analysis showing distinct control and ARSI<sup>R</sup> clusters (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>). Thus, ARSI resistance in the pre-engraftment setting is caused by outgrowth of pre-existing resistant subclones.</p>
<p>The two dominant clones enriched in all ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors (average 33.4% and 23.6%, blue pie slices in ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref></bold>) were detected at 2.1% and 1.7% respectively in the pre-graft (blue bars in top graph in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1E</xref></bold>), and thus were enriched 10-20 fold under the selective pressure of ARSI treatment. Conversely, these clones were 4-5 fold depleted in control tumors (average 0.57% and 0.35%), suggesting their growth may be inhibited in hormonally intact mouse. We explored this question by adding dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or Enz to our standard pre-graft culture media for 7 days and examined changes in the global barcode distribution (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 2A-B</xref></bold>). The abundance of the two dominant ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors clones in the pre-graft (blue bars in <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1E</xref></bold>) was decreased by DHT treatment (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2C</xref></bold>), indicative of androgen-dependent growth suppression.</p>
<p>The pre-engraftment ARSI treatment scenario described above was selected to model the clinical scenario of ARSI treatment when patients have minimal residual disease, e.g., those with a rise in serum PSA level (called biochemical relapse or BCR). To model the use of ARSI in patients with measurable disease, we injected the barcoded LNCaP/AR cells into hormonally intact mice, waited until tumors reached ∼200mm<sup>3</sup>, then administered ARSI therapy (castration + Enz) (hereafter called post-engraftment ARSI) <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</bold> As expected from earlier work using this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), tumors grown in this setting responded initially to ARSI but then progressed, at which time we compared barcode distribution between control and ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref></bold>). As with the pre-ARSI experiment (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref></bold>), the number of enriched barcodes in ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors was lower than control tumors (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref></bold>); however, the resistant clones enriched in the pre-engraftment ARSI setting (reflecting minimal residual disease) were surprisingly <underline>depleted</underline> in the post-engraftment ARSI setting (measurable disease) (average 0.00076% and 0.00082%, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref></bold>). Rather, we found a common set of barcodes enriched in both control and ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors, indicating that clones in control tumors adapted to ARSI treatment and were sustained or further enriched (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1I-J</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 3B-C</xref></bold>). The barcode correlation analysis showed that control and ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors were no longer separated (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref></bold>), revealing a distinct evolutionary path from that seen in the pre-engraftment ARSI setting (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>). Instead, they were grouped into three main clusters, each of which contain both ARSI<sup>R</sup> <underline>and</underline> control tumors. Furthermore, &gt;90% of the barcodes in the post-engraftment ARSI experiment were also enriched in control tumors (yellow data points in scatter plots and bar graphs in <bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3D</xref></bold>). Thus, the clones that gave rise to control tumors persisted and adapted to ARSI treatment. Surprisingly, the small number of pre-existing, drug resistant subclones that cause resistance the pre-engraftment setting did not expand.</p>
<p>To determine if this finding extends to an independent model, we performed an analogous barcode labeling xenograft experiment using the CWR22Pc cell line (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4A</xref></bold>, see details in methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Unlike the LNCaP/AR model, CWR22Pc cells did not progress to ARSI resistance despite &gt;5 months of therapy. Remarkably however, tumors arose within 2-3 weeks of discontinuing Enz treatment, indicating that tumor cells in this model persist at the injection site for months and are poised to resume growth if the selective pressure of ARSI is partially mitigated by Enz removal (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref></bold>). Cognizant of this difference between CWR22Pc and LNCaP/AR in the pre-engraftment ARSI setting (persistence versus resistance), we nonetheless analyzed the relative distribution of barcodes in control versus ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors exactly as before. As we saw with LNCaP/AR, a small number of clones present in the pre-graft were highly enriched in ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors, indicative of a pre-existing resistance mechanism. The only difference was modest enrichment of three of these barcodes in control tumors, likely indicative of the high engraftment potential of these clones even in the absence of ARSI treatment. Importantly, the fact that control and ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors clustered separately in barcode correlation analysis underscores that resistance in the pre-engraftment ARSI setting is pre-existing (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2C-E</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 4B-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">5B-D</xref></bold>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Having documented pre-existing resistance in two models when ARSI therapy is given prior to tumor engraftment, we next asked if a similar switch to adaptive resistance occurs in the CWR22Pc model when treatment is started after tumor engraftment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref></bold>). As expected, established CWR22Pc tumors responded to ARSI treatment by entering a cytostatic phase then developed acquired resistance within 10-20 weeks (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref></bold>). Barcode distribution graphs and correlation analysis showed intermixing of barcodes in control and ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors in the established tumor setting, in contrast to the pre-engraftment ARSI setting where the barcode distribution was separated (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2H-J</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 6A-C</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">7B-D</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the percentage of shared barcodes between control and ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors was higher when ARSI was given post-engraftment compared to pre-engraftment (Venn diagrams in <bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 6D</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref></bold>) and the relative abundance of these shared barcodes is ∼90% in both groups in the post-engraftment setting (yellow data points in scatter plots and bar graphs in <bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 6D</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref></bold>). In summary, barcode sequencing analysis of two different prostate cancer xenograft models shows that the path to ARSI resistance differs depending on the timing of ARSI therapy. In a minimal residual disease setting (modeled by pre-engraftment ARSI treatment), a small number of subclones contribute to resistance. However, in a measurable disease setting (modelled by post-engraftment ARSI treatment), resistance primarily evolves though adaptation of the dominant clones present in ARSI-sensitive tumors.</p>
<p>The sharing of barcodes in control and ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors provides conclusive evidence that acquired resistance in the established tumor setting is adaptive, a mechanism generally viewed as a consequence of epigenetic rewiring or perturbation of feedback circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). To determine if genetic mechanisms may also play a role, we performed targeted exome sequencing of DNA from ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors using a comprehensive 468 gene panel (MSK IMPACT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). As expected, baseline and acquired genomic alterations were seen in both models, but none were shared across resistant tumors with the exception of a single missense mutation in PTPRD (D767R) detected in 4 of 4 ARSI<sup>R</sup> CWR22Pc tumors, but at a low allele burden (average variant allele frequency = 0.09) (<bold>Supplementary tables 1-2</bold>). Although PTPRD has been reported as a potential tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), the D767R mutation has not been reported in existing cancer genome databases (cBioPortal). Thus, while the barcoding data provides clear evidence that acquired resistance in the established tumor setting is adaptive, further work is needed to conclusively eliminate any genetic contribution.</p>

<title>Pre-existing and adaptive paths to ARSI resistance converge on common mechanisms</title>
<p>Having demonstrated these different paths to resistance through lineage tracing, we next turned our attention to the underlying molecular causes within each path. In the post-engraftment setting, we previously reported glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling and HER3 kinase activation (by stromal production of NRG1) as the primary molecular drivers of ARSI resistance in LNCaP/AR and CWR22PC, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Furthermore, we found that GR expression (in LNCaP/AR cells) and NRG1 expression (in stromal cells) are both upregulated by ARSI therapy <italic>in vivo</italic>, consistent with the adaptive response confirmed by the current barcoding experiments. Now armed with the barcode identity of the specific clones responsible for ARSI resistance <italic>in vivo</italic>, we sought to isolate these clones from the mixture of cells in the pre-graft as this would allow us to characterize them before exposure to ARSI, i.e., before any selective pressure that might drive an adaptive response.</p>
<p>Through single cell cloning and barcode sequencing of several hundred clonal isolates from the LNCaP/AR pre-graft, we identified two clones that contributed substantially to <italic>in vivo</italic> ARSI resistance in the pre-engraftment setting (hereafter called pre-ARSI<sup>R1</sup> and pre-ARSI<sup>R2</sup>). We also isolated one clone enriched in control tumors (pre-Intact) and four neutral clones that were not enriched in any tumors (clones A-D) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). To determine whether the two pre-ARSI<sup>R</sup> clones had any evidence of pre-existing ARSI resistance, we characterized their <italic>in vitro</italic> growth characteristics in the presence or absence of Enz. Pre-ARSI<sup>R1</sup> and pre-ARSI<sup>R2</sup> both displayed resistance to Enz (2-3 fold increase in IC50) compared to the neutral (A-D) and pre-Intact clones (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 8A-B</xref></bold>). In addition, both pre-ARSI<sup>R</sup> clones had elevated baseline AR transcriptional output measured by a commonly used AR reporter (<bold><xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 8C-D</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>(A) The clonal isolation was performed by sorting single cell of LNCaP/AR barcode cell line into 96-well plate and sanger sequencing of barcode in each clonal line. One clone enriched across control tumors (Pre-Intact), one clone enriched across ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors in pre-engraftment ARSI setting (Pre-ARSI<sup>R</sup>), and four clones not enriched in the tumors (cloneA through D) were isolated.

<p>Having previously implicated GR as the driver of adaptive resistance <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), we asked if GR might also be responsible for pre-existing resistance. We first confirmed GR is highly expressed in both pre-engraftment ARSI<sup>R</sup> and post-engraftment ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>). We then performed RNA sequencing of the <italic>in vitro</italic> pre-graft clones and found that GR is 1.8-fold upregulated in the pre-ARSI<sup>R1</sup> clone compared to pre-Intact and clones A-D (<bold>Supplementary table 3</bold>). Furthermore, both pre-ARSI<sup>R</sup> clones express GR protein that is further induced by just 3 days of Enz treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8E</xref></bold>), a finding reminiscent of the “GR-primed” state reported previously in cell lines isolated from LNCaP/AR xenografts with acquired ARSI resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). To determine if baseline or Enz-induced GR expression in the pre-ARSI<sup>R</sup> clones is the cause of Enz resistance, we examined the consequences of GR and AR shRNA knockdown on cell growth. GR knockdown restored Enz sensitivity to the pre-ARSI<sup>R</sup> clones, while AR knockdown blocked cell growth regardless of Enz treatment. (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 8F-H</xref></bold>). To mimic the emergence of drug resistance in a polyclonal population, we mixed fluorescently labeled pre-ARSI<sup>R</sup> clones (green) expressing control shRNA (Renilla, RL), AR shRNA or GR shRNA, the pre-Intact clone (blue) and the 4 neutral A-D clones (no color) and performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> cell growth competition assay in Enz. AR and GR knockdown, but not the RL control, blocked expansion of the Pre-Enz clone (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref></bold>), providing further evidence that GR upregulation is the driver of pre-existing ARSI resistance in this model.</p>
<p>With this insight documenting baseline GR expression in rare pre-ARSI<sup>R</sup> clones prior to engraftment, we re-examined GR expression in the established LNCaP/AR tumor model, but now in a time course experiment (0, 1, 4, 14 weeks) to monitor the kinetics of GR induction following initiation of ARSI therapy. Because the barcode analysis in this setting revealed that resistance does not emerge from pre-ARSI<sup>R</sup> clones (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref></bold>), we were interested in the kinetics of GR expression across the entire population of tumor cells, particularly at early time points when one would expect rare pre-existing resistant clones to expand. To ensure precision in this assessment, we took advantage of RFP expression in the engrafted LNCaP/AR cells to avoid scoring GR expression in mouse endothelial and stromal cells. Specifically, we counted GR+/RFP+ (double positive) cells at each time point, together with Ki67 to track proliferation. As expected, the number of Ki-67+ cells was low (but clearly measurable) 1 week after ARSI treatment, increased at 4 weeks and fully evident at 14 weeks (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref></bold>). Notably, despite quantitative immunofluorescence analysis of tens of thousands of cells, no GR+/RFP+ tumor cells were detectable after 1 week but were clearly evident at 4 and 14 weeks (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3G-H</xref></bold>). We conclude that pre-ARSI<sup>R</sup> clones, which are present (albeit rare) in intact tumors, fail to expand after ARSI therapy. However, adaption of pre-Intact clones is evident within 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Having documented a shared mechanism (GR upregulation) in the different paths to resistance in the LNCaP/AR model, we asked if the same theme applies to the CWR22Pc model, where NRG1/HER3 is the primary mechanism of adaptive resistance <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). As with LNCaP/AR, we isolated and screened single cell clones from the CWR22Pc pre-graft and identified the highest enriched clone responsible for Enz persistence (pre-ARSI<sup>P</sup>) as well as three neutral clones (clones A-C) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>). We previously reported that <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of CWR22Pc tumor cells is responsive to conditioned media (CM) derived from cancer associated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). We therefore evaluated the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of the pre-ARSI<sup>P</sup> clone and the three neutral clones in media with or without CM, as well as in presence or absence of DHT. All four clones grew at similar rates in the absence of CM; however, the pre-ARSI<sup>P</sup> clone expanded more quickly in CM in a dose-dependent manner, in regular and hormone-deprived media (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4B-C</xref></bold>). Consistent with earlier work documenting HER3 activation by NRG1 as the mechanism of CM action in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), CM treatment led to dose-dependent phosphorylation of HER3 and AKT in the pre-ARSI<sup>P</sup> clone but not in the neutral clones (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref></bold>). Furthermore, treatment with the dual HER2/HER3 inhibitor neratinib reversed the growth promoting effect of CM in the pre-ARSI<sup>P</sup> clone but had no effect on the neutral clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref></bold>). <italic>In vivo</italic> phospho-HER3 and phospho-AKT levels were also higher in ARSI<sup>R</sup> tumors compared to controls, as well as NRG1 expression (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4F-G</xref></bold>). Taken together, the evidence from both models of ARSI resistance demonstrates that the molecular basis of resistance in each model (GR in LNCaP/AR; NRG1/HER3 in CWR22Pc) is conserved despite the different evolutionary paths that tumor cells undertake in the pre-engraftment versus post-engraftment setting.</p>

<title>The adaptive enzalutamide resistance requires inter-clonal cooperation</title>
<p>To gain further insight into how established ARSI-sensitive tumors adapt to ARSI treatment, we repeated the LNCaP/AR <italic>in vivo</italic> barcoding experiment described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> but now using a greatly simplified pool consisting only of the 6 single cell clones derived from the LNCaP/AR pre-graft (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5A-B</xref></bold>).

<p>To further investigate this capacity, we simplified the adaptive resistance model even further by repeating the experiment with just the pre-Intact clone alone. As expected, pre-Intact cells efficiently gave rise to tumors in control mice; however, they were no longer capable of adaptive resistance when injected alone (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5D-E</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 9A</xref></bold>). In light of recent evidence of cooperativity between subclones in promoting tumor progression, metastasis and drug resistance in other models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), we asked if clonal cooperativity might be contributing to adaptive ARSI resistance. We paired the pre-Intact clone with either the pre-ARSI<sup>R</sup> clone, clone A (selected based on its capacity to form small tumors in intact mice when injected alone (<bold><xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 9A</xref></bold>)) or both. Remarkably, the ability of pre-Intact cells to undergo adaptive ARSI resistance was now restored but only when paired with the pre-ARSI<sup>R</sup> clone (with or without clone A) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref></bold>). Thus, clonal interaction is required for adaptive resistance in this model. Whether this cooperativity occurs through paracrine mechanisms or physical cell-to-cell interaction will require further study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Acquired resistance to targeted cancer therapy is a dynamic process that evolves with treatment through a mix of genetic and non-genetic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). The recent application of high-content lineage tracing has revealed the impact of transcriptional heterogeneity in facilitating this evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Here we have applied this technology to prostate cancer, using <italic>in vivo</italic> barcoding to track the evolutionary path to ARSI resistance, but adding a new variable of modeling resistance by varying the timing of ARSI treatment. When ARSI therapy was administered early (prior to tumor engraftment, to mirror the clinical scenario minimal residual disease), only a few clones were capable of resistance and, in all cases, that resistance was pre-existing. However, when ARSI was initiated after tumors had already established, drug-sensitive tumor cells were the primary contributors to resistance - despite the fact that the same pre-existing resistant clones that cause resistance in the minimal residual disease setting are present in the established tumors. Furthermore, the adaptation of these drug sensitive clones to ARSI resistance required cooperativity with other tumor clones that, in the end, represented a minor fraction of the emergent drug resistant tumor.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, timing of therapy has not been directly evaluated as a variable that influences the path to treatment resistance. The fact that established tumors develop resistance through an adaptive path is likely a consequence of increased heterogeneity (due to larger tumor burden) as well as the surrounding ecosystem of stromal and inflammatory cells that are not present to the same degree in the setting of minimal residual disease. Importantly, the experimental model reported here provides a tractable system to dissect the molecular details of the adaptive response. For example, the barcoding analysis reveals that ∼35% of drug-sensitive clones in an established tumor consistently contribute to resistance. This suggests that not all ARSI-sensitive cells in untreated tumors are capable of adaptation to ARSI therapy. By comparing the “adaptable” and “non-adaptable” populations from the pre-graft populations of each model, it should be possible to gain insight into the molecular basis of adaptability. In the LNCaP/AR model reported here, adaptability is likely explained by a unique chromatin state in “adaptable” cells that is permissive for GR upregulation in response to ARSI therapy, as suggested by an earlier study documenting AR repression of a GR enhancer in GR-positive LNCaP/AR subline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). A similar mechanism could explain enhanced sensitivity to stromal NRG1 in a subset of CWR22Pc tumor cells, perhaps through elevated expression HER kinase receptors.</p>
<p>Another critical question is how cooperativity among clones in established tumors promotes adaptability. A similar phenomenon has been described in breast cancer, where cytokine-dependent communication of “neutral” tumor clones with infiltrating myeloid cells helps drive the growth of the resistant tumor clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). In the prostate model described here, we have isolated “cooperativity” to a single “helper” clone which, coincidently, is the same clone responsible for pre-existing resistance in the minimal residual disease model. Curiously, despite their capacity to thrive in the setting of ARSI therapy, these inherently ARSI-resistant cells switch to a new role in tumors in hormonally intact mice, “helping” the more abundant population of ARSI-sensitive clones adapt to ARSI treatment. Having now reduced the complexity of clonal cooperativity to just two isolated tumor cell clones, it should be possible to dissect the molecular details of cooperativity and “help” through detailed a single cell analysis of the adaptive process over time. The answer could provide insight into strategies to disrupt the “helper” cell signal and thereby prevent the emergence of adaptive resistance.</p>

The same number of cells used for injection (2 × 10<sup>6</sup>) was also snap-frozen at each xenograft experiment and referred to as ‘pre-graft’.

Once tumors were palpable, tumor size was measured weekly using Peira TM900 system (Peira bvba, Belgium). For pre-engraftment androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) experiments, cells were injected into hormonally intact or physically castrated mice 1 week prior to the injection, and enzalutamide treatment (10 mg/kg) was initiated on the day of injection to the castrated mice, 5 days a week by oral gavage. For post-engraftment ARSI experiments, cells were injected into the intact mice first and when the xenografts reached 200∼400mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were randomized and the half of the mice were physically castrated and treated with enzalutamide. Once these ‘resistant’ tumors exceeded their original volume, the mice were sacrificed, tumors were collected into tissue grinder (Fisher Scientific, 02-542-09), and the ground tissues were snap-frozen for analysis.

<title>AR luciferase reporter assay</title>
<p>1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well were plated in triplicate on white 96 well plates (Corning, 3903) and cotransfected with SV40 Renilla Luciferase and ARR3-Luciferase constructs using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). Luciferase activity was assayed 48 hr after transfection using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). To measure enzalutamide IC50, the cells were plated and transfected in hormone-deprived media (10% charcoal-stripped dextran-treated fetal bovine serum, Omega Scientific, FB-04). Cells were treated with DMSO or enzalutamide (0.1, 1 or 10 μM) on the following day, and luciferase activity was assayed 24 hr after treatment. IC50 values were determined using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad).</p>

<title>Conditioned Media Collection</title>
<p>To isolate CAFs, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CWR22Pc cells were trypsinized and re-suspended in 200 μl staining buffer (PBS containing 3% BSA). Cells were blocked for 30 min and stained with 2μl of human EpCAM (FITC conjugated, Miltenyi Biotec, 130-080-301) and 1:75 of mouse MHC class I (APC conjugated, BioLegend, 114613) antibodies at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Cells were then washed 3 times, counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen) and the FITC-negative/APC-positive population was sorted out using BD FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences).</p>
<p>To collect conditioned media (CM), 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAFs were plated in 10cm dish. The following day the media was removed and replaced with serum free media after washing the cells with PBS twice. CM was collected 3 days later, filtered with a 0.45μM filter (Millex, SLHA033SS), concentrated 10x using Vivaspin™ protein concentrator spin columns (Sartorius, VS15T02) and stored at 4°C.</p>

<title>Cell growth assay</title>
<p>For all experiments, 1-2 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well were plated in triplicate on white 96 well plates (Corning, 3903). Cells were culture in regular media or hormone-deprived media with indicated concentration of enzalutamide, DHT or DMSO for each experiment. CellTitier-Glo assay (Promega) was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions at indicated days and the viability was normalized to day 0 or DMSO. For clones with AR or GR knockdown, the cells were pre-treated with doxycycline for 3 days and plated for growth assay with continuous doxycycline treatment. To test the effect of CM on growth, CWR22Pc clones were plated in 100 μl regular or hormone-deprived media per well, and 100 μl CM with concentration twice higher than indicated was added to each well the next day.</p>

<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>The immunofluorescent staining was performed at MSKCC Molecular Cytology Core Facility using Discovery XT processor (Ventana Medical Systems). The tissue sections were deparaffinized with EZPrep buffer (Ventana Medical Systems), antigen retrieval was performed with CC1 buffer (Ventana Medical Systems). Sections were blocked for 30 minutes with Background Buster solution (Innovex), followed by avidin-biotin blocking for 8 minutes (Ventana Medical Systems). Multiplex immunofluorescent stainings were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) with GR (Cell Signaling, 12041, 0.5μg/ml), Ki-67 (Abcam, ab15580, 1μg/ml) or tRFP (Evrogen, AB233, 1μg/ml) primary antibodies and Tyramide Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, B40953), Tyramide CF543 (Biotum, 92172) or Tyramide CF594 (Biotum, 92174) secondary antibodies, respectively. After staining, slides were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma, D9542, 5 μg/ml) for 10 min and coverslipped with Mowiol, and image was scanned. The number of total cells (DAPI+), RFP+ and RFP+/GR+ cells in each slide were counted using ImageJ. The average of total cells counted per slide was 86,000 cells.</p>
<p>The Immunohistochemistry staining was performed at MSKCC Pathology Core Facility. Tumor pieces were fixed in 4% PFA prior to paraffin embedding and then stained with GR (1:1000, Cell Signaling, D6H2L) on a bond III automated stainer (Leica Biosystems, IL).</p>

<title>Transcription analysis</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from cells or frozen tissues as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). For quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR), we used the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) to synthesize cDNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time PCR was performed using 2X SYBR green quantfast PCR Mix (Qiagen, 1044154) and gene-specific primers as follows: human-specific Actin and GR. Data were analyzed by the DDCT method using Actin as a control gene and normalized to control samples, which were arbitrarily set to 1. Primers for GR and ACTB were purchased through Qiagen. For RNA-seq, library preparation, sequencing and expression analysis were performed by the New York Genome Center. Libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation Kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer (rapid run v2 chemistry) with 50 base pair (bp) reads. To analyze RNA-seq data, reads were aligned to the NCBI GRCh37 human reference using STAR aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Quantification of genes annotated in Gencode vM2 were performed using featureCounts and quantification of transcripts using Kalisto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). QC were collected with Picard and RSeQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>).

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study provides new insight into the dynamics that underlie the development of therapy resistance in prostate cancer by revealing that divergent tumor evolutionary paths occur in response to different treatment timing and that these converge on common resistance mechanisms. The use of barcoded lineage tracing and characterization of isolated tumor clonal populations provides <bold>compelling</bold> evidence supporting the importance of clonal dynamics in a tumor ecosystem for treatment resistance. Several open questions remain, however, raising the possibility of alternative interpretations of the data set in its current form. Overall, the findings deepen our understanding of prostate cancer evolution and hold promising implications for how drug resistance can be addressed or prevented.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lee, Eugine et al. use in vivo barcoded lineage tracing to investigate the evolutionary paths to androgen receptor signaling inhibition (ARSI) resistance in two different prostate cancer clinical scenario models: measurable disease and minimal residual disease. Using two prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP/AR and CWR22PC, the authors find that in their minimal residual disease models, the outgrowth of pre-existing resistant clones gives rise to ARSI-resistant tumors. Interestingly, in their measurable disease model or post-engraftment ARSI setting, these pre-existing resistant clones are depleted and rather a subset of clones that give rise to the treatment of naïve tumors adapt to ARSI treatment and are enriched in resistant tumors. For the LNCaP/AR cell line, characterization of pre-existing resistant clones in treatment naïve and ARSI treatment settings reveal increased baseline androgen receptor transcriptional output as well as baseline upregulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as the primary driver of pre-existing resistance. Similarly, the authors found induction of high GR expression over long-term ARSI treatment in ARSI-sensitive clones for adaptive resistance to ARSI. For CWR22Pc cells, HER3/NRG1 signaling was the primary driver for ARSI resistance in both measurable disease and minimal residual disease models. Not only were these findings consistent with the authors' previous reports of GR and NRG1/Her3 as the molecular drivers of ARSI resistance in LNCaP/AR and CWR22Pc, respectively, but also demonstrate conserved resistance mechanisms despite pre-existing or adaptive evolutionary paths to resistance. Lastly, the authors show adaptive ARSI resistance is dependent on interclonal cooperation, where the presence of pre-existing resistant clones or &quot;helper&quot; clones is required to promote adaptive resistance in ARSI-sensitive clones.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employ DNA barcoding, powerful a tool already demonstrated by others to track the clonal evolution of tumor populations during resistance development, to study the effects of the timing of therapy as a variable on resistance evolution. The authors use barcoding in two cell line models of prostate cancer in two clinical disease scenarios to demonstrate divergent evolutionary paths converging on common resistant mechanisms. By painstakingly isolating clones with barcodes of interest to generate clonal cell lines from the treatment of naïve cell populations, the authors are able to not only characterize pre-existing resistance but also show cooperativity between resistant and drug-sensitive populations for adaptive resistance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the finding that different evolutionary paths result in common molecular drivers of ARSI resistance is novel and unexpected, this work primarily confirms the authors' previous published work identifying the resistance mechanisms in these cell lines. The impact of the work would be greater with additional studies understanding the specific molecular/genetic mechanisms by which cells become resistant or cooperate within a population to give rise to resistant population subclones.</p>
<p>This study would also benefit from additional explanation or exploration of why the two resistance driver pathways described (GR and NRG1/Her3) are cell line specific and if there are genetic or molecular backgrounds in which specific resistance signaling is more likely to be the predominant driver of resistance.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The authors aimed to characterise the evolutionary dynamics that occur during the resistance to androgen receptor signalling inhibition, and how this differs in established tumours vs. residual disease, in prostate cancer. By using a barcoding method, they aimed to both characterise the distribution of clones that support therapy resistance in these settings, while also then being able to isolate said clones from the pre-graft population via single-cell cloning to characterise the mechanisms of resistance and dependency on cooperativity.</p>
<p>While, interestingly, the timing of combination therapies has been shown to be critical to avoid cross-resistance, the timing of therapy has not been specifically considered as a factor dictating resistance pathways. Additionally, the role of residual disease and dormant populations in driving relapse is of increasing interest, yet a lot remains to be understood of these populations. The question of whether different clinical manifestations of therapy resistance follow similar evolutionary pathways to resistance is therefore interesting and relevant for the field.</p>
<p>The methods applied are elegant and the body of work is substantial. The proposed divergent evolutionary pathways pose interesting questions, and the findings on cooperativity provide insight. However, whether the model truly reflects minimal residual disease to the extent that the authors suggest may limit the relevance of the findings at this stage. Certain patterns in the DNA barcoding results also call into question whether the results fully support the strong claims of the authors, or whether alternative explanations could exist. While the potential to isolate individual clones in the pre-graft setting is a great strength of the method applied and the isolation of these clones is a huge body of work in itself, the limited number of clones that could be isolated also somewhat limits the validation of the findings.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>• Very relevant and interesting question, clear clinical relevance, applying elegant methods that hold the potential to provide a novel understanding of multiple aspects of therapy resistance, through from evolutionary patterns to intracellular and cooperative mechanisms of resistance.</p>
<p>• The text is clearly written, logical, and the structure is easy to follow.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) The extent to which the model used truly mimics residual disease</p>
<p>The main conclusions of the paper are built upon results using a model for minimal residual disease. However, the extent to which this truly recapitulates minimal residual disease, particularly with regard to their focus on the timings of therapy, could be discussed further. If in the clinical setting residual disease occurs following the existence of a tumour and its microenvironment, there might be many aspects of the process that are missed when coinciding treatment with engraftment of a xenograft tumour with pre-castration. If any characterisation of the minimal residual disease was possible (such as histologically or through RNA sequencing), this may help demonstrate in what ways this model recapitulates minimal residual disease.</p>
<p>(2) Whether the observed enrichment of pre-resistant clones is truly that</p>
<p>The authors strongly make the case that their barcoding experiments provide evidence for pre-existing resistance in the context of minimal residual disease. However, it seems that the clones enriched in the ARSIR tumours are consistently the most enriched clones in the pregraft. Is it possible that the high selective pressure in the pre-engraftment ARSI condition simply leads to an enrichment of the most populous clones from the pregraft? Whereas in the control setting, the reduced selective pressure at the point of engraftment allows for a wider variety of clones to establish in the tumour? Additionally, is there the possibility that the clones highly enriched in the pregraft are in fact a heterogeneous group of cells bearing the same barcode due to stochastic events in the process of viral transduction? Addressing these questions would greatly improve the study.</p>
<p>(3) The robustness of the subsequent work based on 1-2 pre-resistant clones</p>
<p>While appreciating the volume of work involved in isolating and culturing individual pre-resistant clones, given the previous point, the conclusions would benefit from very robust validations with these single-cell clones. There are only two clones, and the results seem to focus more on one than the other, for which the data is less convincing. For instance, the Enz IC50 data, which in the case for pre-ARSI R2 is restricted to the supplementary, compares the clones A-D. In Figure S8 B, pre-ARSI R2 is compared to clone B, which is, of the four clones shown in the main figure when compared to R1, the one with the lowest Enz IC50. Therefore, while the resistant clones seem to have a significantly higher Enz IC50, comparing both clones to clones A-D may not have achieved this significance. It would also be useful to know how abundant the resistant clones were in the original barcode experiments.</p>
<p>(4) The logic used in the final section requires further explanation</p>
<p>In the final section, the authors suggest that a pre-ARSIR clone is able to cooperate with a pre-Intact clone to aid adaptive ARSI resistance. If this is true, then could it not be that rare, pre-resistant clones support adaptive resistance in established tumours? And, therefore, the mechanism underlying resistance could be through pre-existing resistant clones in both settings. The work would benefit from a discussion to clarify this discrepancy in the interpretation of the findings. This is particularly necessary given the strong wording the authors use regarding their findings, such as that they have provided 'conclusive evidence' for acquired resistance.</p>

<p>This important study provides new insight into the dynamics that underlie the development of therapy resistance in prostate cancer by revealing that divergent tumor evolutionary paths occur in response to different treatment timing and that these converge on common resistance mechanisms. The use of barcoded lineage tracing and characterization of isolated tumor clonal populations provides compelling evidence supporting the importance of clonal dynamics in a tumor ecosystem for treatment resistance. Several open questions remain, however, raising the possibility of alternative interpretations of the data set in its current form. Overall, the findings deepen our understanding of prostate cancer evolution and hold promising implications for how drug resistance can be addressed or prevented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are pleased the reviewers found our work reporting distinct evolutionary paths to resistance based on timing of treatment to be important and supported by compelling evidence.  We also acknowledge the need for additional work to clarify some details, particularly regarding the mechanism of clonal cooperativity as a catalyst of resistance.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lee, Eugine et al. use in vivo barcoded lineage tracing to investigate the evolutionary paths to androgen receptor signaling inhibition (ARSI) resistance in two different prostate cancer clinical scenario models: measurable disease and minimal residual disease. Using two prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP/AR and CWR22PC, the authors find that in their minimal residual disease models, the outgrowth of pre-existing resistant clones gives rise to ARSI-resistant tumors. Interestingly, in their measurable disease model or post-engraftment ARSI setting, these pre-existing resistant clones are depleted and rather a subset of clones that give rise to the treatment of naïve tumors adapt to ARSI treatment and are enriched in resistant tumors. For the LNCaP/AR cell line, characterization of pre-existing resistant clones in treatment naïve and ARSI treatment settings reveal increased baseline androgen receptor transcriptional output as well as baseline upregulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as the primary driver of pre-existing resistance. Similarly, the authors found induction of high GR expression over long-term ARSI treatment in ARSI-sensitive clones for adaptive resistance to ARSI. For CWR22Pc cells, HER3/NRG1 signaling was the primary driver for ARSI resistance in both measurable disease and minimal residual disease models. Not only were these findings consistent with the authors' previous reports of GR and NRG1/Her3 as the molecular drivers of ARSI resistance in LNCaP/AR and CWR22Pc, respectively, but also demonstrate conserved resistance mechanisms despite pre-existing or adaptive evolutionary paths to resistance. Lastly, the authors show adaptive ARSI resistance is dependent on interclonal cooperation, where the presence of pre-existing resistant clones or &quot;helper&quot; clones is required to promote adaptive resistance in ARSI-sensitive clones.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employ DNA barcoding, powerful a tool already demonstrated by others to track the clonal evolution of tumor populations during resistance development, to study the effects of the timing of therapy as a variable on resistance evolution. The authors use barcoding in two cell line models of prostate cancer in two clinical disease scenarios to demonstrate divergent evolutionary paths converging on common resistant mechanisms. By painstakingly isolating clones with barcodes of interest to generate clonal cell lines from the treatment of naïve cell populations, the authors are able to not only characterize pre-existing resistance but also show cooperativity between resistant and drug-sensitive populations for adaptive resistance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the finding that different evolutionary paths result in common molecular drivers of ARSI resistance is novel and unexpected, this work primarily confirms the authors' previous published work identifying the resistance mechanisms in these cell lines. The impact of the work would be greater with additional studies understanding the specific molecular/genetic mechanisms by which cells become resistant or cooperate within a population to give rise to resistant population subclones.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that additional insights into the mechanism of adaptive resistant and the role of cell-cell cooperativity are clear next steps for this work. We propose to do so through single cell characterization (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq) of tumor evolution in a time course experiment where we can track each clone using expressed barcodes. This will allow us to explore the dynamics of interaction between the &quot;adaptable&quot; and &quot;helper&quot; clones. Unfortunately, the barcode methodology used in this initial report is DNA-based; therefore, a follow-up study using a transcribable barcode library is needed to address these fascinating questions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This study would also benefit from additional explanation or exploration of why the two resistance driver pathways described (GR and NRG1/Her3) are cell line specific and if there are genetic or molecular backgrounds in which specific resistance signaling is more likely to be the predominant driver of resistance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the case of NRG1/HER3 pathway mediated resistance, we know that this mechanism requires that the PTEN/PIK3CA pathway be wildtype.  This is the case for the CWR22Pc model described in the manuscript. Furthermore, we have data showing that PTEN deletion in these cells rescues the phenotype, meaning that CWR22Pc cells with PTEN deletion are no longer dependent on NRG1/HER3 signaling for ARSI resistance.</p>
<p>In contrast, LNCaP/AR cells are PTEN null at baseline and therefore must evolve alternative mechanisms of ARSI resistance. Since our initial identification of the GR mechanism, we and others have extended the finding to additional models (VCaP, LAPC4) (PMID: 24315100; PMID: 28191869). Another recent insight is the importance of RB1 and TP53 status in maintenance of luminal lineage identity during ARSI therapy, and the recognition of lineage plasticity as a resistance mechanism in cell lines/tumor models that lack these two tumor suppressors. In summary, baseline genetics clearly plays a role in which ARSI resistance pathway is  likely to emerge. We will clarify this point in the revision with additional discussion.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>The authors aimed to characterise the evolutionary dynamics that occur during the resistance to androgen receptor signalling inhibition, and how this differs in established tumours vs. residual disease, in prostate cancer. By using a barcoding method, they aimed to both characterise the distribution of clones that support therapy resistance in these settings, while also then being able to isolate said clones from the pre-graft population via single-cell cloning to characterise the mechanisms of resistance and dependency on cooperativity.</p>
<p>While, interestingly, the timing of combination therapies has been shown to be critical to avoid cross-resistance, the timing of therapy has not been specifically considered as a factor dictating resistance pathways. Additionally, the role of residual disease and dormant populations in driving relapse is of increasing interest, yet a lot remains to be understood of these populations. The question of whether different clinical manifestations of therapy resistance follow similar evolutionary pathways to resistance is therefore interesting and relevant for the field.</p>
<p>The methods applied are elegant and the body of work is substantial. The proposed divergent evolutionary pathways pose interesting questions, and the findings on cooperativity provide insight. However, whether the model truly reflects minimal residual disease to the extent that the authors suggest may limit the relevance of the findings at this stage. Certain patterns in the DNA barcoding results also call into question whether the results fully support the strong claims of the authors, or whether alternative explanations could exist. While the potential to isolate individual clones in the pre-graft setting is a great strength of the method applied and the isolation of these clones is a huge body of work in itself, the limited number of clones that could be isolated also somewhat limits the validation of the findings.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>Very relevant and interesting question, clear clinical relevance, applying elegant methods that hold the potential to provide a novel understanding of multiple aspects of therapy resistance, through from evolutionary patterns to intracellular and cooperative mechanisms of resistance.</p>
<p>The text is clearly written, logical, and the structure is easy to follow.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) The extent to which the model used truly mimics residual disease</p>
<p>The main conclusions of the paper are built upon results using a model for minimal residual disease. However, the extent to which this truly recapitulates minimal residual disease, particularly with regard to their focus on the timings of therapy, could be discussed further. If in the clinical setting residual disease occurs following the existence of a tumour and its microenvironment, there might be many aspects of the process that are missed when coinciding treatment with engraftment of a xenograft tumour with pre-castration. If any characterisation of the minimal residual disease was possible (such as histologically or through RNA sequencing), this may help demonstrate in what ways this model recapitulates minimal residual disease.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback on this point and acknowledge that the pre-ARSI setting used in our studies is not precisely identical to minimal residual disease (MRD) seen clinically, where a patient typically undergoes primary treatment (radical prostatectomy surgery or local radiotherapy) then relapses with distant disease from micrometastases that were not initially detectable.  Having uncovered a key difference in the path to resistance using our pre-ARSI model, we believe our data provide a strong rationale to invest additional effort in designing newer MRD models that more closely mimic the clinical scenario, perhaps through surgical resection of a primary tumor that could “seed” micrometatases prior to therapy. We will highlight this aspect in our revised manuscript and provide clarity on the limitations and scope of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Whether the observed enrichment of pre-resistant clones is truly that</p>
<p>The authors strongly make the case that their barcoding experiments provide evidence for pre-existing resistance in the context of minimal residual disease. However, it seems that the clones enriched in the ARSIR tumours are consistently the most enriched clones in the pregraft. Is it possible that the high selective pressure in the pre-engraftment ARSI condition simply leads to an enrichment of the most populous clones from the pregraft? Whereas in the control setting, the reduced selective pressure at the point of engraftment allows for a wider variety of clones to establish in the tumour?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an important point about enrichment of ARSI resistance clones in the pregraft but we do not believe that explains the subsequent in vivo data for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The two most enriched clones in the Pre-ARSIR tumors are the second and third the most enriched clones in pre-graft, not first (Supplementary figure 1E). If the clones were enriched in resistant tumors based on their abundance in starting population, we expect to find the most enriched clone in the tumor.</p>
<p>(2) By varying the androgen concentration in the pregraft culture media, we could selectively deplete or enrich the same clones enriched in the Pre-ARSIR tumors in vivo, indicating the enrichment of these clones in the resistant tumors is unlikely to be solely based on their relative frequency in the pregraft (Supplementary figure 2).</p>
<p>We will clarify these points in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, is there the possibility that the clones highly enriched in the pregraft are in fact a heterogeneous group of cells bearing the same barcode due to stochastic events in the process of viral transduction? Addressing these questions would greatly improve the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The barcode library was deep sequenced to confirm even distribution of the barcodes before it was transferred from Novartis (PMID: 258491301) and we intentionally used a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) to generate barcode lines to ensure single copy insertion. That said, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that the second and third most enriched clones in the pregraft originated from the same ancestral clone and subsequently acquired two different barcodes.  We will clarify this point in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The robustness of the subsequent work based on 1-2 pre-resistant clones</p>
<p>While appreciating the volume of work involved in isolating and culturing individual pre-resistant clones, given the previous point, the conclusions would benefit from very robust validations with these single-cell clones. There are only two clones, and the results seem to focus more on one than the other, for which the data is less convincing. For instance, the Enz IC50 data, which in the case for pre-ARSI R2 is restricted to the supplementary, compares the clones A-D. In Figure S8 B, pre-ARSI R2 is compared to clone B, which is, of the four clones shown in the main figure when compared to R1, the one with the lowest Enz IC50. Therefore, while the resistant clones seem to have a significantly higher Enz IC50, comparing both clones to clones A-D may not have achieved this significance. It would also be useful to know how abundant the resistant clones were in the original barcode experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that studies relying on 1-2 biological samples indeed have limitations. Given our extensive prior work into the role of GR in the development of ARSI resistance (and that of other labs), we focused on demonstrating that both pre-ARSIR1 and pre-ARSIR2 clones exhibit pre-existing GR expression and are primed to further upregulate GR levels under ARSI conditions, thereby relying on GR function to sustain resistance. Given the redundancy of resistant mechanisms of the two clones, we made efforts to isolate additional clones enriched in Pre-ARSIR tumors. However, despite our attempts, we were unable to identify further clones. Pre-ARSIR1 and pre-ARSIR2 are second and third most enriched clones in pre-graft (2.1% and 1.7% respectively).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The logic used in the final section requires further explanation</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the final section, the authors suggest that a pre-ARSIR clone is able to cooperate with a pre-Intact clone to aid adaptive ARSI resistance. If this is true, then could it not be that rare, pre-resistant clones support adaptive resistance in established tumours? And, therefore, the mechanism underlying resistance could be through pre-existing resistant clones in both settings. The work would benefit from a discussion to clarify this discrepancy in the interpretation of the findings. This is particularly necessary given the strong wording the authors use regarding their findings, such as that they have provided 'conclusive evidence' for acquired resistance.</p>
<p>We agree that rare, pre-resistant clones could support adaptive resistance (and therefore resistance in this adaptive setting could, technically be called “pre-existing”) but it is critical to recognize that these rare, pre-resistant “helper” clones are vastly outnumbered by pre-Intact clones that “acquire” resistance through their “help.” We find this to be fascinating biology and we will clarify this logic in the resubmission, as well as future experimental approaches to unravel the mechanism.</p>
