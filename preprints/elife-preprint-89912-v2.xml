<title>Abstract</title><p>Quiescence (G0) maintenance and exit are crucial for tissue homeostasis and regeneration in mammals. Here, we show that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2) expression is cell cycle-dependent and negatively regulates quiescence exit in cultured cells and in an injury-induced liver regeneration mouse model. Specifically, acute reduction of Mecp2 is required for efficient quiescence exit, as deletion of Mecp2 accelerates, while overexpression of Mecp2 delays quiescence exit, and forced expression of Mecp2 after Mecp2 conditional knockout rescues cell cycle reentry. The E3 ligase Nedd4 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of Mecp2, and thus facilitates quiescence exit. Genome-wide study uncovered the dual role of Mecp2 in preventing quiescence exit by transcriptionally activating metabolic genes while repressing proliferation-associated genes. Particularly, disruption of two nuclear receptors (NRs), <italic>Rara</italic> or <italic>Nr1h3,</italic> accelerates quiescence exit, mimicking the Mecp2 depletion phenotype. Our studies unravel a previously unrecognized role for Mecp2 as an essential regulator of quiescence exit and tissue regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cellular quiescence, also referred to as G0, is a reversible non-proliferating state. Quiescent cells can be reactivated to exit from the quiescent state and reenter the actively cycling states (G1, S, G2 and M phases) in response to certain intrinsic or extrinsic signals. Increasing evidence indicates that quiescence is not a passive non-proliferating state but is rather an active metabolic state maintained by certain transcriptional programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The switch from quiescence to proliferation is coupled with extensive changes in the transcriptional program coordinating metabolic and proliferation dynamics. The tightly orchestrated quiescence exit is crucial for tissue homeostasis and regeneration after injury, especially in the liver, which is composed of hepatocytes with both metabolic and regenerative capacities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The unique regenerative capability of hepatocytes as differentiated cells after injury makes the liver an ideal <italic>in vivo</italic> model for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying quiescence exit. Recent studies have demonstrated that hepatocytes act like stem cells that possess regenerative potential to reenter the cell cycle and proliferate during liver regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Upon quiescence exit, a process also known as priming/initiation, hepatocytes favor proliferative capacity over metabolism to meet the rapid hepatic growth demand. However, how the active metabolic state is transcriptionally altered and modulated during the G0/G1 transition remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2), as a chromatin-binding protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, plays multiple roles in gene expression regulation, including transcriptional activation and repression, RNA splicing, chromatin remodeling and regulation of chromatin architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Given the high expression and pivotal role of Mecp2 in the brain, understanding the mechanisms of Mecp2 in neurological disorders such as Rett Syndrome and autism has attracted intense interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Mecp2 has also been identified as an oncogene highly expressed in several cancer types. Several lines of evidence suggest that the role of Mecp2 in malignancy mainly involves facilitation of cancer cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The role of Mecp2 in quiescence exit and tissue regeneration and the underlying mechanisms have not been reported, to the best of our knowledge.</p>
<p>In this study, using a mouse model of injury-induced liver regeneration and cellular models of quiescence exit, we intriguingly found that Mecp2 is a cell cycle-dependent protein which is drastically abated during the G0/G1 transition and gradually restored at further stages of cell cycle progression. A sharp decline in Mecp2 expression is essential for efficient quiescence exit in response to extrinsic stimuli using both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> models. Additionally, the E3 ligase Nedd4 contributes to the ubiquitination and degradation of Mecp2 at quiescence exit, which modulates the pace of quiescence exit. Mechanistically, Mecp2 governs quiescence exit by transcriptionally orchestrating proliferative and metabolic gene expression, among which many nuclear receptor genes (NRs) emerge as novel Mecp2-activated genes in quiescent cells. Together, our findings identify a critical negative regulatory role for Mecp2 in quiescence exit and tissue regeneration, partially through targeting several NRs.</p>

<title>Mecp2 is dynamically expressed during injury-induced liver regeneration</title>
<p>To screen for key regulators governing the initiation/priming phase of liver regeneration, we used the 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PHx) mouse model, a widely used <italic>in vivo</italic> model to study quiescence exit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, Mecp2, a well-known essential regulator of brain development, emerged as a dramatically repressed protein at the priming/initiation stage of PHx-induced liver regeneration. The expression kinetics of Mecp2 were examined at both the mRNA and protein levels in liver tissues at six time points after PHx, which cover the three phases of liver regeneration, namely priming/initiation, progression and termination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> (Figure S1A, Fig S1 source data). The results showed that Mecp2 was remarkably reduced as early as 6 h after PHx, was further decreased at 12 h and 24 h, but was restored at the 48- and 120-h time points (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A, 1B</xref>, and S1B, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> source data and Fig S1 source data). The decrease in the active histone mark H3K27ac <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> at the Mecp2 promoter was consistent with the reduced transcriptional activity within 36 h post-PHx (Figure S1C, Fig S1 source data). Notably, Mecp2 protein levels were decreased more dramatically than mRNA, suggesting a posttranslational regulation of Mecp2 at the very early stage of liver regeneration. The early acute reduction of Mecp2 in hepatocytes during liver regeneration, mainly in nuclei, was further validated by immunofluorescence (IF) staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> source data) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> source data). To confirm the quiescence exit-specific reduction of Mecp2 in hepatocytes, we assessed proliferation-associated proteins that are widely used to distinguish the G0 from the G1 phase, including phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb), Cyclin D1 and Ki67 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> source data). The phosphorylation states of Rb, including un-phosphorylated, hypo-phosphorylated and hyper-phosphorylated Rb, can reflect G0, early G1 and late G1 phases, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The results showed that pRb was undetectable by 6 h after PHx. Accordingly, Cyclin D1, which mediates the phosphorylation of Rb, was also maintained at extremely low levels during the very early stage of liver regeneration. Several other cyclins important for the G1/S stage (Cyclin E1) and the G2/M stage (Cyclin A2 and B1), were also expressed at low levels, further supporting the negative correlation between the amount of Mecp2 and cell cycle reentry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> source data). Moreover, Ki67, a well-known proliferation marker, which is degraded and barely detected in the G0 phase but accumulates during cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, showed an inverse correlation with Mecp2 in hepatocytes within 48 h after PHx (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> source data). It is worth noting that the acute reduction in Mecp2 during quiescence exit was gradually restored by 48 to 120 h post-PHx, suggesting the functional involvement of Mecp2 in active cell cycle phases. Together, these findings demonstrate the identification of Mecp2 as a new cell cycle-associated protein, which is highly expressed in quiescent hepatocytes, sharply decreased at the G0/G1 transition, and gradually restored at later stages of cell cycle progression during injury-induced liver regeneration.</p>

<title>Mecp2 negatively regulates quiescence exit during PHx-induced liver regeneration</title>
<p>Given the acute reduction of Mecp2 during hepatocyte quiescence exit, we asked whether Mecp2 prevents the G0/G1 transition. To this aim, we generated hepatocyte-specific Mecp2 conditional knockout mice (Mecp2-cKO) by crossing control mice containing <italic>Loxp</italic> sites flanking exon 2 and 3 of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene (Mecp2<sup>fl/fl</sup>) with albumin (Alb)-Cre mice expressing Cre recombinase under the Alb promoter (Figure S2A, Fig S2 source data). The successful Mecp2 depletion in the liver was confirmed by genotyping (Figure S2B, Fig S2 source data) and measuring the amount of Mecp2 at both mRNA and protein levels in Mecp2<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Mecp2-cKO mice (Figures S2C and S2D, Fig S2 source data). Mecp2-cKO mice were viable and showed no obvious abnormalities in the liver compared to control littermates (Figures S2E-S2G, Fig S2 source data). PHx triggered the decay of Mecp2 in livers at 6 and 48 h after PHx, which reflected the G0/G1 transition and M phase, respectively, in the remaining hepatocytes undergoing the first round of the cell cycle after PHx (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> source data). The results of western blotting and corresponding quantification in Mecp2-cKO livers indicated that Mecp2 depletion promoted quiescence exit in hepatocytes after PHx (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> source data). IF staining for Ki67 showed that Mecp2-deficient livers contained more proliferating hepatocytes than controls, further supporting the enhanced G0/G1 transition in Mecp2-cKO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> source data). Accordingly, liver regeneration was significantly enhanced at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after PHx based on the significantly higher liver index in the Mecp2-cKO mice than in the controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> source data). Therefore, hepatocyte-specific Mecp2 depletion accelerates quiescence exit in injury-induced regenerating livers.</p>

<p>We next tested whether overexpression (OE) of Mecp2 in hepatocytes has an adverse effect on cell cycle reentry after PHx. Intravenous injection of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-TBG-Mecp2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> reinforced the levels of Mecp2 in hepatocytes compared to empty vector (EV) control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> source data). Decreased protein levels of pRb and Cyclin D1, as well as lower levels of Ki67 in nuclei from Mecp2-overexpressing hepatocytes were observed within 48 h after PHx (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> source data). Expectedly, Mecp2 OE significantly delayed cell cycle reentry and resulted in a decreased liver index within 24 h after PHx (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> source data). Therefore, Mecp2 OE negatively regulates quiescence exit in hepatocytes after PHx.</p>
<p>To further confirm the specificity of Mecp2 on the regulation of quiescence exit, we performed rescue experiments using AAV-mediated Mecp2 OE in Mecp2-cKO livers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2I</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>, Fig S2 source data). The restoration of Mecp2 in Mecp2-depleted hepatocytes was accompanied by increased expression of cell cycle regulators and earlier appearance of Ki67 compared to the EV controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2J</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2K</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> source data). In addition, the increased liver index caused by the loss of Mecp2 was significantly compromised by Mecp2 restoration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> source data). Therefore, forced restoration of Mecp2 rescues Mecp2 loss-induced accelerated quiescence exit.</p>
<p>Notably, the modest but significant changes in liver regeneration caused by the manipulation of Mecp2 in the first 2 days after PHx disappeared 5 days post-PHx (Figures S2H-S2J, Fig S2 source data), indicating the involvement of Mecp2 in not only quiescence exit but also in later stages of cell proliferation. Taken together, our <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses demonstrate that the rapid reduction of Mecp2 in hepatocytes is essential for efficient quiescence exit during injury-induced liver regeneration.</p>

<title>Acute reduction of Mecp2 is universal for quiescence exit in cellular models</title>
<p>We then asked whether the expression pattern of Mecp2 during the quiescence-proliferation transition is universal in cells. To this end, we released three types of cultured cells, including 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts, mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells and human primary umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), from quiescence induced by two classical signals, i.e., serum starvation (S.S.) and contact inhibition (C.I.) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The cell cycle analysis in 3T3 cells showed that more than 90% of cells resided in the G0/G1 phase in response to S.S. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> source data) or C.I.

The expression kinetics revealed that serum restimulation (S.R.)- and/or C.I. loss (C.I.L.)-induced cell cycle reentry of quiescent 3T3 cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in Mecp2 at the G0/G1 transition and its gradual restoration during cell cycle progression, resembling that seen after PHx-induced initiation of hepatocellular regeneration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C, 3D, 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3I</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> source data). The time course of IF staining for Ki67 and Mecp2 showed extremely low levels of Ki67 signals in nuclei within 6 h after S.R. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> source data) or 24 h after C.I.L. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> source data), further supporting the reduction in Mecp2 at quiescence exit in 3T3 cells. Similar results were obtained in both HT22 cells (Figures S3A-S3H, Fig S3 source data) and HUVECs (Figures S3I-S3P, Fig S3 source data). Taken together, this evidence suggests that the acute reduction in Mecp2 is a general phenomenon at the G0/G1 transition.</p>

<title>Acute reduction of Mecp2 is essential for efficient quiescence exit in cells</title>
<p>To determine whether the functional relationship between acute Mecp2 reduction and quiescence exit also exists in cells other than hepatocytes, we first assessed the effect of siRNA-mediated Mecp2 knockdown (KD) on the S.R.-induced quiescence exit of 3T3 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> source data). Western blotting showed that Mecp2 depletion led to an earlier induction of pRb, Cyclin D1, as well as cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin E proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, S4A, S4C, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> source data and Fig S4 source data).

Additionally, we used Ki67 and propidium iodide (PI) double staining followed by flow cytometry to quantify G0 cells (Ki67<sup>−</sup> with 2N DNA content) at early time points after quiescence exit with or without Mecp2 depletion. The results showed that Mecp2 KD significantly reduced G0 cells compared to negative control siRNA (NC si)-treated cells after S.R. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> source data). As such, about 70% of control cells and over 90% of Mecp2 KD cells re-entered the cell cycle at 6 h post-S.R., indicating that Mecp2 KD accelerated quiescence exit in 3T3 cells. Thus, enhanced reduction of Mecp2 stimulates exit from quiescence.</p>

<p>We then asked whether increased Mecp2 expression could postpone quiescence exit. To test this, we forced Mecp2 OE in 3T3 cells through lentiviral transduction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> source data). Compared to the EV, Mecp2 OE resulted in the delayed quiescence exit phenotype upon S.R., as evidenced by decreased expression of pRb, Cyclin D1, and other cell cycle protein, such as cyclin A2, cyclin B1 and cyclin E1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, S4B, S4D, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> source data and Fig S4 source data), delayed induction of Ki67 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> source data), and a two-fold increase in the proportion of cells residing in the G0 phase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> source data).

<title>Nedd4 contributes to Mecp2 degradation and regulates quiescence exit</title>
<p>Given the more rapid decay of Mecp2 at the protein compared to the mRNA level during the quiescence-proliferation transition, we speculated that Mecp2 is targeted by posttranslational regulation. This hypothesis was supported by proteasome inhibition with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which attenuated the reduction of Mecp2 in quiescent cells after S.R (Figure S5A, Fig S5 source data). In contrast, the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine had no impact on the degradation of MeCP2 protein (Figure S5B, Fig S5 source data). To identify proteins that regulate Mecp2 degradation during the G0/G1 transition, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) using Mecp2 antibody in quiescent 3T3 cells treated with or without S.R. (Figure S5C, Fig S5 source data). A total of 647 proteins were identified as putative Mecp2 interactors. We were particularly interested in the proteins involved in proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process which was one of the enriched Gene Ontology (GO) items in the Mecp2 interactome (Table S1). Among the candidate genes, we identified the ubiquitin ligase ‘‘neuronal precursor cell developmentally downregulated 4-1’’ (Nedd4) that specifically interacted with endogenous Mecp2 by reciprocal IP-WB in 3T3 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> source data). Co-IP using Mecp2 antibody revealed that Mecp2-associated ubiquitin and Nedd4 were dramatically increased at 3 h and 6 h post-S.R. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> source data), suggesting that Nedd4 interacts with Mecp2 to induce the polyubiquitination and degradation of Mecp2 upon cell cycle reentry.</p>

<p>Given the important role of Nedd4 in posttranslational regulation of Mecp2, we reasoned that despite regulating internalization of major growth factor receptors involved in liver regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, Nedd4-mediated degradation of Mecp2 may be a new mechanism through which Nedd4 contributes to liver regeneration. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of Nedd4 on S.R.-induced quiescence exit of 3T3 cells. Knocking down Nedd4 using siRNA replenished the remarkable reduction of Mecp2 at the early stages of quiescence exit, and thus resulted in lower levels of proliferation markers such as pRb, Cyclin D1 and Ki67 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> source data). Nedd4 deficiency significantly retained cells in the G0 phase upon S.R. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> source data). On the contrary, Nedd4 OE significantly enhanced the degradation of Mecp2 and accordingly accelerated the quiescence exit which mimicked the effect of Mecp2 depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5G</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5J</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> source data). Thus, Nedd4 interacts with Mepc2 and regulates quiescence exit partially through posttranslational regulation of Mecp2 upon quiescence exit.</p>

<title>Mecp2 slows quiescence exit by transcriptionally activating metabolism-associated genes while repressing proliferation-associated genes</title>
<p>It has been well established that Mecp2 transcriptionally regulates gene expression by binding methylated CpG islands and chromatin proteins in the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. However, little is known about the transcriptional targets of Mecp2 during hepatocyte quiescence exit in the regenerating liver. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying Mecp2-regulated quiescence exit, we performed RNA-seq combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify the Mecp2-dependent transcriptome genome-wide during the very early stage of liver regeneration (Figure S6C, Fig S6 source data). RNA-seq and comparative analyses in control Mecp2<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Mecp2-cKO mice livers before and 6 h after PHx revealed 3048 Mecp2-dependent genes that were differentially expressed in a Mecp2-dependent manner. Meanwhile, we mapped the binding landscape of Mecp2 in Mecp2<sup>fl/fl</sup> livers before and after PHx using ChIP-seq by filtering out peaks identified in Mecp2-cKO livers (Figure S6C, Fig S6 source data). It has been reported that Mecp2 occupies a large proportion of the genome in the brain due to its methyl-CpG (mCpG) binding preference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Similarly, we identified a total of 14640 and 15350 Mecp2-binding genes before and after PHx in the Mecp2 control liver, respectively (Figures S6A and S6B, Fig S6 source data). To further identify putative Mecp2-direct target genes, we integrated Mecp2-dependent genes with Mecp2-binding genes (Figures S6C, Fig S6 source data). As a result, there were 2658 Mecp2 direct target genes, in which 537 were PHx-activated and 2121 were PHx-repressed genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> source data). GO analysis showed that PHx-activated Mecp2 targets, which are either silent or basally expressed in quiescent hepatocytes, were highly enriched in proliferation-associated biological processes such as ribosome biogenesis, rRNA metabolic process, ncRNA metabolic process, and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase I, whereas PHx-repressed Mecp2 targets, which are highly expressed in quiescent hepatocytes, were associated with several metabolic processes including carboxylic acid catabolic process, cellular amino acid metabolic process, fatty acid metabolic process and steroid metabolic process (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> source data). Notably, among PHx-repressed genes, several NRs were newly identified as Mecp2 direct targets, such as <italic>Nr2f6</italic>, <italic>Nr3c1</italic>, <italic>Nr1h3</italic>, <italic>Nr1i3</italic>, <italic>Nr6a1</italic>, <italic>Rxrg</italic>, <italic>Rara</italic>, <italic>Nr4a1</italic>, <italic>Srebf1</italic> and <italic>Ppard</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> source data). To gain insights into the relevance between Mecp2 occupancy and the differential expression of Mecp2 direct targets, we interrogated the binding strength of Mecp2 in the promoter-proximal regions (within 3 kb of the transcription start sites (TSS)) and defined gene regions (±25 kb around the TSS and transcription end sites (TES)) (Figure S6A, Fig S6 source data). Intriguingly, Mecp2 occupancy at these regions was not apparently altered after PHx, which was inconsistent with its protein levels, suggesting that the majority of Mecp2 is not tightly associated with the genome in quiescent hepatocytes and Mecp2 may recruit other factor(s) to achieve the differential transcriptional outcomes in response to extrinsic stimuli (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> source data).</p>

<p>Because the liver is a key metabolic organ, we paid particular attention to Mecp2-regulated NRs, whose alteration may result in a shift in the balance between metabolism and proliferation. The Mecp2-dependent transcriptional repression of ten NRs upon hepatic resection was validated using real-time qPCR in both Mecp2 control and cKO livers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> source data). Notably, the mRNA levels of NRs were significantly higher in Mecp2<sup>fl/fl</sup> than in Mecp2-cKO livers before PHx, suggesting that Mecp2 contributes to the transcriptional activation of NRs in normal livers while Mecp2 degradation upon PHx leads to their deactivation. We also confirmed the repression of NRs in S.R.-induced 3T3 cell quiescence exit (Figure S6D, Fig S6 source data). We did not detect the expression of <italic>Nr1i3</italic> and <italic>Rxrg</italic> in quiescent 3T3 cells either before or after G0 exit, and failed to validate the repression of <italic>Nr4a1</italic>, suggesting that Mecp2-mediated transcriptional repression of NRs may vary with cell type and/or mobilization signals. Thus, these results suggest that Mecp2 plays a negative regulatory role during quiescence exit by activating metabolism-associated genes while repressing proliferation-associated genes in quiescent cells.</p>

<p>To interrogate the functional relevance of Mecp2-mediated repression of NRs to quiescence exit, we selected two candidate genes for further investigation, <italic>Rara</italic> and <italic>Nr1h3</italic>. Retinoic acid (RA) has long been recognized as a liver mitogen required for normal liver regeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Rara and Rarb as receptors for RA have been recently identified to mediate RA-induced hepatocyte proliferation after PHx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Cholesterol is another important regulator of cell proliferation. Nr1h3 (LXR) is highly expressed in the liver, and has recently been reported to reduce hepatocyte proliferative capacity during PHx-induced regeneration by regulating genes involved in lipid and cholesterol homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The accurate transition from quiescence to the active cell cycle is crucial for the control of eukaryotic cell proliferation and adult stem cell-mediated tissue homeostasis and regeneration after injury. Conversely, dysregulation of quiescence exit may compromise tissue integrity and lead to oncogenesis. In this work, we sought to explore the general molecular mechanisms that regulate quiescence by focusing on Mecp2, a multifunctional protein with a broad spectrum of activities. Using genetic mouse models, cellular models, and genome-wide approaches, we uncovered a regulatory capacity of Mecp2 in quiescence exit (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> source data). In quiescent cells, Mecp2 is maintained at relative high levels and serves as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. It binds to and activates metabolic genes, such as several NRs, while repressing proliferation-associated genes in quiescent and metabolically hyperactive hepatocytes. In response to extrinsic stimuli, such as injury and mitogenic stimulation, the protein levels of Mecp2 are acutely decreased by both transcriptional repression and Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination. The remarkable reduction of Mecp2 releases the transcriptional repression of proliferation-associated genes while compromising the activation of metabolic genes, in order to satisfy a rapidly regenerating demand of the remaining hepatocytes, eventually leading to quiescence exit and cell cycle progression. The transient repression of Mecp2 during quiescence exit and its restoration during further cell cycle progression probably serve as means to avoid over-inhibition of metabolism and to guarantee the appropriate metabolic adaption required for cell proliferation. Therefore, our results suggest that quiescent cells employ Mecp2 to balance the needs of cell division and metabolism upon receiving extrinsic signals.</p>
<p>Although it has been reported that Mecp2 null mice develop fatty liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, the Mecp2-cKO mice used in our study did not demonstrate obvious abnormalities, such as necrosis or liver damage when we performed PHx (Figure S2, Fig S2 source data). Based on our comparative analysis of RNA-seq data from control and Mecp2 cKO livers before PHx, only 90 upregulated and 128 downregulated genes (log2 |FC| &gt; 1.5, p &lt; 0.05) were identified which did not enrich any GO terms with adjusted <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1×10<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, further supporting the notion that liver-specific deletion of Mecp2 does not cause liver abnormalities in 3-month-old mice. This allowed us to study liver regeneration in mice with non-damaged livers and avoid any defects prior to injury. It is worth noting that, other than accelerated cell cycle reentry, Mecp2 cKO hepatocytes also displayed a modest increase in cell size with enlarged nuclei relative to control cells (Figure S2G, Fig S2 source data), implying the attenuation of mitosis.</p>
<p>It has been well documented that both overexpression and depletion of Mecp2 have deleterious effects on neuronal homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, and thus, tight regulation of Mecp2 protein levels is critical for its physiological functions. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that many Rett Syndrome-causing mutations in the methyl-CpG binding domain not only compromise DNA binding capacity of Mecp2 but also reduce its protein stability, implying the relevance of protein stability in Mecp2 dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Mecp2 has been shown to undergo various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation, which may also affect protein stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Protein degradation via ubiquitination is the most prevalent recycling machinery used by cells. Despite 11 identified ubiquitination sites in Mecp2, our knowledge about the E3 ligases that catalyze the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to these sites remains scarce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Recently, Wang et al. uncovered the role of RING Finger Protein 4 (RNF4) in transcriptional activation by mediating the ubiquitination of Mecp2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Herein, we discovered Nedd4 as a novel regulator of Mecp2 protein stability. Nedd4 has recently been identified as an essential regulator of liver regeneration through posttranslational modification of growth factor signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Consistent with our results, Bachofner et al. reported <italic>in vivo</italic> knockdown of Nedd4 in hepatocytes caused inhibition of cell proliferation after PHx. Although we identified Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination of Mecp2 in the cellular model of quiescence exit, we also measured the expression of Nedd4 at the early stages of liver regeneration (Figure S5D, Fig S5 source data), which in turn may drive hepatocytes to enter the cell cycle by targeting Mecp2. Further studies are needed to explore what domain(s) is (are) responsible for the interaction between Mecp2 and Nedd4, which corresponding ubiquitylation sites within Mecp2 are targeted by Nedd4, and whether ubiquitylation site mutations of Mecp2 can completely abolish cell cycle reentry.</p>
<p>The switch from quiescence to active cycling requires coordinating all the necessary metabolic and cell cycle machinery. There is an urgent need to synthesize DNA, proteins and lipids required for the generation of daughter cells in resting cells reentering the cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Regarding injury-induced hepatic regeneration, a global transcriptome shift from metabolism to proliferation is a reasonable strategy to satisfy the proliferating needs at the early stages of liver regeneration after PHx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Consistently, we observed an increase in gene expression involved in mRNA abundance, splicing and translation, and a decrease in genes enriched in fatty acid, lipid, and amino acid metabolism at 6 h post-PHx in a Mecp2-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> source data). This metabolic repression is transient and largely restored when the regenerating liver reaches its original size. Yet, how Mecp2 differentially regulates proliferation-associated and metabolic genes is a fascinating question that remains unanswered in our study and merits further investigation.</p>
<p>In this study, we discovered that Mecp2-mediated transcriptional activation of genes involved in metabolism is one of the mechanisms which prevents exit from quiescence. Specifically, we identified ten NRs, which are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The NR superfamily can be divided into three classes based on their ligands and mechanisms of action, including the steroid receptor family, the thyroid/retinoid family and the orphan receptor family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. To date, studies on NRs have elucidated the roles of several NRs in regulating hepatomegaly and liver regeneration, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα or Nr1c1, and PPARγ or Nr1c3), pregnane X receptor (PXR, Nr1i2), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, Nr1i3), liver X receptor (LXR, Nr1h3) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR, Nr1h4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Among these genes, <italic>Nr1i3</italic> and <italic>Nr1h3</italic> also emerged as PHx-repressed Mecp2-activated NRs in our study. Consistent with our observations, Sasso et al. demonstrated that Nr1h3, which is responsible for cholesterol catabolism and fatty acid synthesis, acts as an inhibitor of liver regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, they did not observe the decreased mRNA levels of both LXR isoforms (Nr1h3 and Nr1h2), mainly because they monitored the transcriptional levels at one day post-PHx, which was not early enough to capture the upstream changes in transcriptional regulation. In general, previous studies have barely focused on the connection between quiescence exit and NRs. Based on our observations, the inhibition of certain NRs by Mecp2 depletion during quiescence exit is probably general and not hepatocyte-specific, because we also validated the repression of several NRs in cellular models of quiescence exit. Additionally, the functional validation of Nr1h3 and Rara in 3T3 cells further supports the notion that Mecp2 may postpone cell cycle reentry through activating NRs. However, not all NRs exhibit the same function in quiescence exit. Huang and colleagues reported that the absence of the primary nuclear bile acid receptor FXR (also known as Nr1h4) strongly inhibited liver growth in the early stages of regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Therefore, the cell type- and/or stimulus-specific function and detailed mechanisms for certain NRs in regulating quiescence exit await further investigation. Our study highlights the importance of NRs in mediating Mecp2-regulated quiescence exit, which may serve as attractive therapeutic targets after further investigation of the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>In summary, our study opens a brand-new perspective to understand the functional involvement of Mecp2 as a general regulator of quiescence exit, and has provided insight into the mechanisms that may link metabolism to quiescence exit. Differential targeting of Mecp2 based on its different roles at different cell-cycle phases should be taken into consideration when examining potential clinical applications.</p>

<title>Co-IP assay</title>
<p>NIH3T3 cells were synchronized in G0 phase by S.S. as previously described, followed by 15% FBS stimulation for 3 or 6 hours. Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in IP lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland, #05892791001). The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 10000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were quantified using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA, #23250). One milligram of total protein was incubated with anti-Mecp2 (5 μg) or anti-Nedd4 (5 μg) antibody overnight at 4 °C with constant mixing. Then, 30 μl of Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA, #10004D) were added and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. After three washings with PBS, retained proteins were eluted using 30 μl of SDS lysis buffer. Protein complexes were then detected by WB and then immunoblotted with anti-Mecp2 or Nedd4 antibodies.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry assay</title>
<p>To reveal the proteins of the ubiquitination system possibly interacting with Mecp2, NIH3T3 cells were synchronized by S.S. for 36 hours and collected following 15% FBS stimulation for 3 or 9 hours. Total protein (1 mg) was incubated with anti-Mecp2 (5 μg) overnight at 4 °C with constant mixing. IgG was used as the negative control. Then, antibody was incubated with Dynabeads for 2 h with shaking. After three washings, retained proteins were eluted using 30 μl of SDS lysis buffer. Eluted Mecp2-associated cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. Trypsin was used to digest stained protein bands. An Orbitrap Elite mass spectromete was used to analyze the digested samples by Applied Protein Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Using Mascot as a search engine, fragment spectra were scanned against the Uniprot database to identify proteins. In this assay, Nedd4 was identified as the most abundant peptide of E3 ligase during the G0-G1 transition.</p>

<title>Lentiviral vector constructs and transduction</title>
<p>For stable knockdown of Nr1h3 and Rara, lentiviruses were generated according to our previous protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Briefly, shRNAs targeting luciferase or mouse Nr1h3 and Rara were cloned into the pLKO.1 vector (Addgene, MA, USA, #8453). The lentiviral vectors were co-transfected with the packaging vectors pCMV-deltaR8 (Addgene, MA, USA, #12263) and pCMV-VsVg (Addgene, MA, USA, #8454) into LentiX-293T cells to generate virus. After 48 h, virus was collected and used to infect NIH3T3 cells with 6 µg/ml polybrene (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA; #TR-1003) for another 12 h. Infected cells were selected in puromycin (4 µg /ml) for 3 days, and the expression of Nr1h3 and Rara in infected cells was verified by qRT–PCR. We used pLKO.1-luciferase-Puro empty vector as a negative control. The sequences of the shRNAs are listed in Resources Table.</p>

<title>AAV production and tail vein injection</title>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> Mecp2 overexpression was achieved by recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) vectors. AAV8 vectors carrying Mecp2 or GFP sequences with a TBG (thyroxin-binding globulin) promoter (AAV8-TBG-GFP, AAV8-TBG-Mecp2) were manufactured by Genechem Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). AAV8-TBG-GFP served as negative control. AAV8-TBG-GFP/Mecp2 vectors (2×10<sup>11</sup> vector genomes per mouse) were injected intravenously into C57 mice (termed AAV-Mecp2 mice) or CKO<sup>Alb-Mecp2</sup> mice (termed Mecp2 cKO/AAV-Mecp2 mice), respectively. After 4 weeks, 70% PHx was performed as described above. Mecp2 overexpression were verified by IF and WB. The remaining livers were collected at 6 and 48 h after surgery. Liver-to-body weight ratios were calculated as described above.</p>
<p>To knockdown the expression of Nr1h3 or Rara in Mecp2-KO mice, AAV8-mediated delivery of shRNAs was used in this study. The vehicle vector ssAAV-TBG-mNeonGreen-WPRE-SV40pA was used as a negative control (termed shLuc). AAV production was performed according to our previous method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected with various plasmids. We transfected 40 µg of total DNA (5.7 µg of pAAV8, 11.4 µg of pHelper (ZoomaBio, #ZK736) and 22.8 µg of TBG-NeonGreen-mir30-shNr1h3 (termed shNr1h3) or 22.8 µg of TBG-NeonGreen-mir30-shRara (termed shRara) into 293T cells in a 15-cm dish. After 12 h, the transfection medium was changed to normal medium. The medium containing AAV was collected at 72 h and 120 h post-transfection, and the cells were collected at 120 h post-transfection. AAV particles were digested from cells by salt-active nuclease (ArcticZymes, Sweden, #70910-202). Subsequently, AAV vector particles were purified by ultracentrifugation in an iodixanol density gradient at 350,000 <italic>g</italic> for 2 h at 18°C. The virus titer was determined by real-time PCR. AAV vector (2×10<sup>11</sup> vector genomes per mouse) were injected intravenously via the tail vein to Mecp2 cKO mice. After 4 weeks, 70% PHx was performed as described above. The knockdown efficacy of Nr1h3 and Rara was verified by qPCR. The remaining livers were collected 6 h after surgery. Liver-to-body weight ratios were calculated as described above.</p>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> study provides insights into the mechanism controlling cell cycle reentry, establishing a regulatory role for Mecp2 degradation in shifting transcription from metabolic to proliferation genes during quiescence exit. The evidence, which includes experimental data from in vitro cell culture and an in vivo injury-induced liver regeneration model, is <bold>convincing</bold> but the trigger for MeCP2 degradation and how MeCP2 differentially regulates proliferation and metabolic genes remain unclear.</p>

<p>In the study described in the manuscript, the authors identified Mecp2, a methyl-CpG binding protein, as a key regulator involved in the transcriptional shift during the exit of quiescent cells into the cell cycle. Their data show that Mecp2 levels were remarkably reduced during the priming/initiation stage of partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration and that altered Mecp2 expression affected the quiescence exit. Additionally, the authors identified Nedd4 E3 ligase that is required for downregulation of Mecp2 during quiescence exit. This is an interesting study with well-presented data that supports the authors' conclusions regarding the role of Mecp2 in transcription regulation during the G0/G1 transition. However, the significance of the study is limited by a lack of mechanistic insights into the function of Mecp2 in the process. This weakness can be addressed by identifying the signaling pathway(s) that trigger Mecp2 degradation during the quiescence exit.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Since the data suggests that the degradation of Mecp2 is a crucial event in the exit from quiescence, gaining a better understanding of the underlying mechanism would improve the significance of the study. In this regard, the authors should take advantage of the serum stimulated degradation of Mecp2 (Fig. 3D) to identify the signaling pathway(s) required for the degradation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying Mecp2-regulated quiescence exit, we performed RNA-seq combined with ChIP-seq to identify the Mecp2-dependent transcriptome genome-wide during the early stage of liver regeneration (Figure S6C). There were 2658 Mecp2 direct target genes, in which 537 were PHx-activated and 2121 were PHx-repressed genes (Figure 6A). GO analysis showed that PHx-activated Mecp2 targets were highly enriched in proliferation-associated biological processes such as ribosome biogenesis, rRNA metabolic process, ncRNA metabolic process, and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase I, whereas PHx-repressed Mecp2 targets were associated with several metabolic processes including carboxylic acid catabolic process, cellular amino acid metabolic process, fatty acid metabolic process and steroid metabolic process (Figure 6B). These results suggest that Mecp2 plays a negative regulatory role during quiescence exit by activating metabolism-associated genes while repressing proliferation-associated genes in quiescent cells.</p>
<p>Given the more rapid decay of Mecp2 at the protein compared to the mRNA level during the quiescence-proliferation transition, we speculated that Mecp2 is targeted by posttranslational regulation. This hypothesis was supported by proteasome inhibition with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which attenuated the reduction of Mecp2 in quiescent cells after S.R. (Figure S5A). To identify the signaling pathway that regulate Mecp2 degradation during the G0/G1 transition, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) using Mecp2 antibody in quiescent 3T3 cells treated with or without S.R. (Figure S5B). A total of 647 proteins were identified as putative Mecp2 interactors. We were particularly interested in the proteins involved in proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process which was one of the enriched Gene Ontology (GO) items in the Mecp2 interactome (Table S1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors suggest that Mecp2 downregulation accelerates the induction of pRb, which serves as a key marker for G0/G1 transition. However, their data only show increased magnitudes of the expression in Mecp2 downregulated cells at the timepoints when samples were collected (Figs. 2B and 4B). In the in vitro experiments, the authors should investigate earlier timepoints to demonstrate that induction of pRB during the quiescence exit occurs earlier in Mecp2 deficient cells compared to control cells. Likewise, a later induction of pRB in Mecp2 overexpression cells, in comparison to normal cells, should be demonstrated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these valuable suggestions. We have, accordingly, collected cell samples re-entered the cell cycle at 30-, 60-, 90- and 120-minutes post-S.R. We examined the pRb expression and found that phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) at Ser807/811 occurs earlier (about 90 minutes) in Mecp2 deficient cells compared to control cells (Figure S4C). Compared to the EV, Mecp2 OE resulted in the delayed induction of pRB (about 60 minutes) upon S.R. (Figure S4D). These data indicate that enhanced reduction of Mecp2 stimulates exit from quiescence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) There are three well-known phosphorylation sites in Mecp2, including S80, S229, and S423. As protein ubiquitination and degradation are often triggered by phosphorylation, it would be interesting to examine whether phosphorylation at these sites of Mecp2 is required for its downregulation during quiescence exit. This can be achieved using non-phosphorylate mutants of Mecp2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very good question. Indeed, the 26S ubiquitin-proteasome system (26S UPS) is responsible for the breakdown of MeCP2 (PMID: 28394263, 28973632). In 2009, the bona fide PEST (enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) domains have been identified, which are highly conserved across vertebrate evolution (PMID: 19319913). Consensus sequences enriched in PEST residues have been found to predispose proteins containing them for rapid proteolytic degradation (PMID: 8755249, 2876518). In addition, phosphorylation within PEST motifs precedes ubiquitination of proteins (PMID: 15229225).  One of the best characterized sites of MeCP2 phosphorylation (S80) (PMID: 19225110), as well as one of the identified ubiquitination sites (K82/K99) (PMID: 22615490), both fall within one of these regions. It is still noteworthy that most of the MeCP2 phosphorylation sites were found in close proximity to potential ubiquitylation sites. For example, Rett syndrome missense mutations in Rett syndrome affecting three (K82R, K135A, K256S) of the ubiquitination sites (PMID: 25165434) and S80 (within one of the PEST sequences) and K82 have been shown to be phosphorylated and ubiquitinated.</p>
<p>Based on the above discussion, we providing a potential hypothesis that the MeCP2 turnover during cell cycle re-entry is achieved by an initial phosphorylation signal (phosphorylated at S80, S229, or S421) that triggers the ubiquitination of a close lysine residue. We hope to solve these issues and be able to present the findings in future work. Thanks again for your professional suggestions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It would be interesting if the authors could also examine the effect of altered expression of Mecp2 on the maintenance of quiescence. For example, whether the downregulation of Mecp2 sensitizes quiescent cells for entry of the cell cycle in response to serum stimulation or delays withdrawal from the cell cycle upon serum starvation or contact inhibition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions. Cell cycle synchronization was induced with serum deprivation. When nutrients are exhausted, altered expression of Mecp2 have no statistical influence on the maintenance of quiescence as analyzed by Flow cytometric (Figure 4D and H). This suggests that the altered expression of Mecp2 alone may not be sufficient for cell cycle exit. In the presence of growth factors or nutrients, loss of MeCP2 only accelerates the rate of cell cycle re-entry.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>For Figs. 2D, 2H, and 2L, it would be more intuitive if the percentage of changes in liver index rather than the relative index values were used. Also, the values listed in the figures should start from time zero after partial hepatectomy rather than pre-surgery.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Liver weight have the corresponding change with body weight. The liver index (ratio of regenerate liver weight/body weight) is tightly regulated and depends on metabolic demands of the organism. During the course of liver regeneration, reestablishment of liver volume after resection is regulated by the functional needs of the organism. Using the percentage of regenerate liver weight/body weight as a liver growth index could reflect the regenerative function.
Next, we agree with the data presentation form and the values listed in the figures have been modified in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>My concerns are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The authors note that the decrease in Mecp2 protein levels was more pronounced than the decrease in mRNA levels, suggesting the presence of post-translational regulation of Mecp2 during the early stages of G0 exit. Could the decrease in MeCP2 levels be related to autophagy flux?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments. Also, we have compared the cells extracts from untreated and chloroquine-treated cells (to block lysosomal degradation). Chloroquine did not cause any accumulation of MeCP2 (Figure S5B). The results suggest that autophagy activity do not involve in the decrease the MeCP2 protein.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In addition to Cyclin D1, how about other cell cycle-related proteins (cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin E) were changed when MeCP2 was lost during cell cycle re-entry? Protein expression should be examined by western blot.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your valuable suggestions. The expression of cell cycle related protein cyclin A2, cyclin B1 and cyclin E1 were evaluated by Western blotting. The expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1 and cyclin E1 was enhanced by the knockdown of MeCP2 (Figure 4B). Conversely, the repressed expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1 and cyclin E1 was observed by the over-expression of MeCP2 (Figure 4F).</p>

<p>(3) By combining MeCP2 ChIP-seq and RNA-seq of genes regulated by MeCP2, the authors uncovered the dual role of Mecp2 in preventing quiescence exit by targeting Rara and Nr1h3. All they show are the Q-PCR results. The authors should show the protein level of Rara and Nr1h3 when MeCP2 was lost during cell cycle re-entry.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your advice. In Figure 7C, the knockdown efficiency of Rara and Nr1h3 were checked by Western blot analysis.</p>

<p>(4) The authors performed lentiviral and AAV-mediated gene knockdown to target Rara and Nr1h3 in Cells and Mecp2-cKO livers, respectively. The Knockdown efficacy should be verified by western blots (Fig 7 C and F).</p>

<p>In Figure 7F, the consequences of the Rara and Nr1h3 knockdown efficiency was verified by Western blot analysis.</p>

<p>(5) The other major concern is regarding the lack of quantitative assessments of MeCP2 WB results (Fig 2, Fig 4, and Fig 7).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We added supplementary figures to Figure 2B, 2F and 2J to show the quantification membrane signal of MeCP2 protein in liver regeneration. And Fig S4A and 4B showing the quantification signal of MeCP2 protein in NIH3t3 cell cycle re-entry model.</p>

<p>(6) In the Figure legends of Fig 4 B and Fig 4F, the authors should delete the statistical descriptions, as there are no statistical results. In Fig 5F, Fig 5J, Fig 6D, Fig 7D and Fig7H, there are no statistical results of **p &lt; 0.01, *p &lt; 0.05 or ****p &lt; 0.0001, respectively. The authors should check the description in the figure legends. In Fig S2C, the level of significance should be annotated.</p>

<p>We would like to express our heartfelt thanks for your thorough reading of our manuscript. We have made corrections to make manuscript clearer and more accurate. The level of significance have been annotated in Fig S2C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Fig S4A, there are no WB results of Cyclin D1 and pRb, the authors should check the description.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have deleted the confusing statements in the revised manuscript.</p>
