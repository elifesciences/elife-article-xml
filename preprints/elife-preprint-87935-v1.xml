<title>Abstract</title><p>Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2), a core planar cell polarity (PCP) component, plays an important role in polarized cellular and tissue morphology induction, growth development and cancer. However, its role in regulating inflammatory responses remains elusive. Here, we report that Vangl2 is upregulated in patients with sepsis and identify Vangl2 as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling by regulating the protein stability and activation of the core transcription component p65. Mice with myeloid-specific deletion of Vangl2 (<italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔM</sup></italic>) are hypersusceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. Vangl2 deficient myeloid cells exhibit enhanced phosphorylation and expression of p65, therefore, promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines after LPS stimulation. Mechanistically, NF-κB signaling-induced-Vangl2 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination on p65, which serves as a recognition signal for cargo receptor NDP52-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate Vangl2 as a suppressor of NF-κB mediated inflammation and provide insights into the crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vangl2, a core PCP component, mediates Wingless-type (Wnt)/PCP signaling, and controls homeostasis, development, and repair of organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bailly, Walton, &amp; Borg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hatakeyama, Wald, Printsev, Ho, &amp; Carraway, 2014</xref>). Vangl2 has four transmembrane domains with both carboxyl termini and amino oriented toward the cytoplasm, which is phosphorylated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then transported to the cell surface and becomes stabilized, while the unphosphorylated Vangl2 is unstable and internalized to degrade via the lysosomal pathway (D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). The shuttle of Vangl2 between cytoplasm and cell membrane results in its multifunction, including adhesion, membrane protrusive activity, migration, and bridging proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hatakeyama et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, Vangl2 inhibited matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) activity and affected cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jessen &amp; Jessen, 2017</xref>). Vangl2 also modulates glomerular injury by promoting MMP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Papakrivopoulou et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the abnormal function of Vangl2 results in various diseases, such as cancer, kidney glomerular injury, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and systemic dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Papakrivopoulou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Poobalasingam et al., 2017</xref>). Vangl2 is markedly down-regulated in patients with emphysema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Poobalasingam et al., 2017</xref>), while which level was up-regulated and amplified in breast, ovarian, and uterine carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gao et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, Vangl2 is bounded to p62 to promote breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Puvirajesinghe et al., 2016</xref>). Our previous study showed that Vangl2 prevents osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells, resulting in osteogenic dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gong et al., 2021</xref>). Vangl2 mediated downstream of Toll-like or interleukin (IL)-1 receptor, such as myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gong et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that Vangl2 may play roles in immune-related diseases, including autoimmune diseases. However, the function of Vangl2 in inflammatory diseases remains uncovered.</p>
<p>The NF-κB signaling is critical for the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu, Zhang, Joo, &amp; Sun, 2017</xref>). NF-κB activation relies on the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including Toll like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). LPS triggers TLR activation and the recruitment of adaptor proteins including MyD88. This in turn activates a series of downstream canonical NF-κB signaling cascade, resulting in the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB and the nuclear translocation of RelA/p65 and p50 to induce the transcription of several inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Funes, Rios, Escobar-Vera, &amp; Kalergis, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Locati, Curtale, &amp; Mantovani, 2020</xref>). Since uncontrolled immune responses are detrimental to the host, inappropriate or excessive NF-κB activity contributes to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases and cancer (Cartwright, Perkins, &amp; C, 2016). Thus NF-κB signaling must be tightly regulated to maintain immune balance in the organism. In recent decades, extensive studies have focused on the mechanisms underlying the regulation of NF-κB signaling. Recent research demonstrated that NLRC5 strongly prevents NF-κB signaling pathway by interacting with IκB kinase (IKK) α/IKKβ and blocking their phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cui et al., 2010</xref>). COMMD1, PPARγ, SOCS1 and GCN5 were also shown to negatively regulate NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bartuzi, Hofker, &amp; van de Sluis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mao et al., 2009</xref>). Meanwhile, tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (Trim21) enhanced the interaction of p65 with IKK, which promotes p65 phosphorylation and downstream gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the regulation of NF-κB signaling are still elusive.</p>
<p>Autophagy, a conserved intracellular degradation pathway, decomposes cytoplasmic organelles and components, and acts as a defense mechanism to pathogen infection, playing a crucial role in nutrient recycling, stress response and cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ashrafi &amp; Schwarz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Denton &amp; Kumar, 2019</xref>). Recent evidence indicates that autophagy is highly selective when delivering specific substrates to autolysosomal degradation by virtue of a number of cargo receptors, including sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62), optineurin (OPTN), nuclear dot protein 52 (NDP52/CALCOCO2) and neighbor of BRCA1 (NBR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gatica, Lahiri, &amp; Klionsky, 2018</xref>). Selective autophagy targets immune regulators for degradation, thus suppressing innate immune signaling, such as type I IFN and NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pradel, Robert-Hebmann, &amp; Espert, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tong et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, p62 protein has been identified as a novel Vangl2-binding partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Puvirajesinghe et al., 2016</xref>), and our recent study has demonstrated that Vangl2 reduces lysosomal chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) activity by targeting LAMP-2A for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gong et al., 2021</xref>). However, whether and how Vangle2 is involved in the selective autophagic regulation of NF-κB signaling remains largely unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we uncover a previously unrecognized role of Vangl2, as a “molecular brake”, in the negative regulation of NF-κB signaling to prevent excessive and potentially harmful immune responses during sepsis in both human patient samples and LPS induced mouse model. Induction of Vangl2 upon inflammation recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination on p65, thus promoting the recognition of p65 by the cargo receptor NDP52 and resulting in the selective autophagic degradation of p65. Our findings provide a potential target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.</p>

<title>Loss of Vangl2 promotes inflammatory responses in LPS-induced septic shock</title>
<p>To investigate the potential role of Vangl2 in inflammatory response, we first analyzed the expression of Vangl2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from sepsis patients (Fig. S1 A) and found mRNA level of Vangl2 was increased in the sepsis patients compared to healthy control (HC) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Expression of Vangl2 from database GSE156382 also confirmed that Vangl2 mRNA was induced during sepsis (Fig. S1 B). To further determine whether <italic>Vangl2</italic> expression could be regulated in response to inflammatory stimulation, we treated mice with LPS to activate NF-κB pathway and detected <italic>Vangl2</italic> mRNA in different tissues from LPS treated mice, and found the expression of <italic>Vangl2</italic> significantly increased in secondary lymphoid organs including the spleen and lymph nodes after LPS stimulation, but not in other tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Moreover, qPCR and western blot analyses revealed strong upregulation of <italic>Vangl2</italic> at both the mRNA and protein levels after LPS stimulation in bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages (BMDMs), neutrophils and peritoneal macrophages (Fig. S1, C-E), suggesting that Vangl2 is induced in immune organ tissues and cells in response to inflammation.</p>

<p>To determine the function of Vangl2 during LPS-induced sepsis, we specifically ablated Vangl2 in myeloid cells by crossing <italic>Vangl2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice with mice expressing lysozyme proximal promoter (<italic>Lyz2-Cre</italic>). The resultant homozygous <italic>Vangl2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> × <italic>Lyz2-Cre</italic> mice were designated <italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔM</sup></italic>mice and selective deletion of Vangl2 in myeloid cells of <italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔM</sup></italic> mice were confirmed by PCR (Fig. S1 F). Although there were no significant differences in the size of spleen and lymph nodes between wild-type (WT) and <italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔM</sup></italic> mice (Fig. S1 G), myeloid-specific loss of Vangl2 increased the number of monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils in the spleen and bone marrow (Fig. S1, H and I). To gain further insight into the physiological function of Vangl2, we treated WT and <italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔM</sup></italic> mice with a high dose of LPS and monitored mice survival. We found that all <italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔM</sup></italic> mice died after LPS-induced septic shock within 20 hours, compared to only 20% of the WT mice, whereas the remaining WT mice survived for more than 50 hours (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Consistent with this observation, <italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔM</sup></italic>mice markedly increased the protein level of IL-1β in isolated CD11b<sup>+</sup> splenocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), and mRNA levels of <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Tnfa</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic> in the spleen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Meanwhile, <italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔM</sup></italic>mice showed markedly elevated serum amounts of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 after LPS treatment, compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Together, these data provide in vivo evidence that myeloid cell-specific deletion of Vangl2 in mice enhances the sensitivity and severity of LPS-induced septic shock and is associated with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines.</p>

<title>Vangl2 negatively regulates NF-κB activation and inflammation in myeloid cells</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanisms by which Vangl2 prevents sepsis, we performed RNA-seq analysis to identify signal pathways involved in LPS-induced septic shock by comparing LPS-stimulated BMDMs from <italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔM</sup></italic> and WT mice. Differentially expression analysis showed 907 up-regulated genes and 1092 down-regulated genes in response to Vangl2 deficiency in BMDMs after LPS stimulation (Fig. S2 A). Gene ontology (GO) analysis further identified that these genes are involved in cellular immune responses, including “cellular response to lipopolysaccharide” (Fig. S2 B) and KEGG analysis revealed genes involved in TNF signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction were highly enriched in <italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔM</sup></italic> BMDMs after LPS stimulation, suggesting that Vangl2 may regulate these signaling pathways and related cytokines release (Fig. S2 C).</p>
<p>To determine the function of Vangl2 in innate immune signaling in myeloid cells, we isolated BMDMs, neutrophils and peritoneal macrophages (pMAC) from WT and <italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔM</sup></italic> mice, treated them with LPS, and performed immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies. We found that phosphorylations of IKK and p65 were enhanced and remained high level for a sustained period in Vangl2-deficient pMAC, neutrophils and BMDMs, compared with WT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A-D</xref> and Fig. S2, D and E). Consistent with this observation, Vangl2-deficient macrophages, and neutrophils showed markedly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">F</xref> and Fig. S2 F) and IL-1β (Fig. S2 G), after LPS treatment. Moreover, we detected enhanced p65 nuclear accumulation in LPS-induced Vangl2-deficient neutrophils, compared with WT neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">H</xref>).</p>

<p>To further confirm the function of Vangl2 in regulating NF-κB signaling, we overexpressed Flag-tagged Vangl2 in A549 cells. We found that Vangl2 overexpression inhibited phosphorylation of IKK and p65 in A549 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">J</xref>).

<title>Vangl2 inhibits LPS-induced NF-κB activation by interacting with p65</title>
<p>To clarify the regulatory mechanism of Vangl2, we transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or 293T cells with NF-κB luciferase reporter vector, with or without the Vangl2 plasmid, then treated the cells with LPS, IL-1β, or TNF-α. We found that Vangl2 markedly inhibited NF-κB activation induced by LPS, IL-1β, or TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, A-C). Next, we sought to determine potential signaling molecules that mediated the NF-κB-luc reporter. NF-κB-luc activity was strongly activated by overexpression of MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, IKKα, IKKβ or p65, but all of these activities were inhibited when <italic>Vangl2</italic> was co-transfected at increasing concentrations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref> and Fig. S3, A-F), suggesting that Vangl2 may block NF-κB activation at the very downstream signaling level of p65.</p>

<p>To test this prediction, we transfected 293T cells with HA-tagged Vangl2 together with Flag-tagged IKKα, p65, TRAF6, IRAK1 or MyD88. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay revealed that Vangl2 interacted strongly with IKKα, p65 and MyD88, and weak with TRAF6 or IRAK1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref> and Fig. S3 G). In addition, endogenous co-IP immunoblot analyses showed that Vangl2 was strongly associated with p65 upon LPS stimulation in BMDMs, but not with IKKα, IKKβ or MyD88 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> F and Fig. S3 H). Moreover, ZDOCK server predicted that Vangl2 may potentially interact with p65 by a hydrogen bond (Fig. S3 I). We further investigated the co-localization of Vangl2 and p65 by confocal microscopy and found a weak-co-localization of Vangl2 with p65 in unstimulated cells and the co-localization between Vangl2 and p65 was notably enhanced upon LPS stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref> and Fig. S3 J). To determine how Vangl2 interacts with cytoplasmic p65, we isolated cytoplasm and membrane in LPS treated THP-1 cells. We found that Vangl2 interacted with p65 mainly in the cytoplasm, although most of Vangl2 located on the membrane (Fig. S3 K). Together, these data suggest that Vangl2 may interact with p65 in the cytoplasm to inhibit NF-κB signaling.</p>
<p>Vangl2 comprises an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (NT), a transmembrane (TM) domain, a Prickle-binding domain (PkBD), and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nagaoka, Furuse, Ohtsuka, Tsuchida, &amp; Kishi, 2019</xref>). To map the essential domains of Vangl2 that mediate its association with p65, we generated several deletion constructs of Vangl2. We found Vangl2 FL (full-length), T2 (ΔNT+TM), T3 (ΔCT), and T4 (ΔNT) interacted with the full-length p65, while Vangl2 T1 (ΔPkBD+CT) abrogated their association (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 H</xref> and Fig. S3 L), indicating that the PkBD domain is important for the Vangl2-p65 interaction. Additionally, we constructed HA-tagged Vangl2 PkBD plasmid and co-IP assay revealed that Vangl2 FL and PkBD interacted with p65 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 I</xref>). Moreover, we observed that deletion of the PkBD domain (T1), but not other domains, of Vangl2 abolished the Vangl2-mediated inhibition of NF-κB-luc activity, and transfection of Vangl2 PkBD domain achieved similar inhibition on p65 induced NF-κB activation as Vangl2 FL did (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 J</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that Vangl2 suppresses NF-κB signaling by targeting p65 through Vangl2 PkBD domain interaction.</p>

<title>Vangl2 promotes the autophagic degradation of p65</title>
<p>Next we sought to study the physiological role of Vangl2-p65 interaction in the regulation of NF-κB signaling by transfecting 293T cells with Flag-tagged p65, together with increasing doses of Vangl2, and found that Vangl2 dramatically decreased the protein level of p65 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the downregulation of p65 protein by Vangl2 was caused by the inhibition of p65 transcription, qPCR results suggested that the abundance of <italic>p65</italic> mRNA did not change in cells with increased expression of Vangl2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Since activated p65 translocates to the nucleus, we next assessed whether Vangl2 regulates the degradation of p65 in the cytoplasm or nucleus, and found that the Vangl2 interacted with p65 mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. S4 A) and mediated the degradation of p65 in the cytoplasmic fraction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), which is consistent with the result that Vangl2 and p65 co-localized in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>). To further assess whether Vangl2 regulates the degradation of endogenous p65, we found that Vangl2-deficient BMDMs stabilized the expression of endogenous p65 after LPS treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). After 12 h LPS stimulation, cycloheximide (CHX)-chase assay result showed that the degradation rate of p65 in <italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔM</sup></italic> BMDMs was slower, compared with WT cells (Fig. S4 B). Together, these data suggest that Vangl2 promotes p65 protein degradation.</p>

<p>To investigate whether Vangl2 degrades p65 through an autolysosome or proteasome pathway, 293T cells were transfected with p65, together with or without the Vangl2 plasmids, and treated with different pharmacological inhibitors. We found the degradation of p65 induced by Vangl2 was blocked by autolysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), or autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>), but not by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or caspase-1 inhibitor Z-VAD and VX-765 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref> and Fig. S4 C). Furthermore, Vangl2 significantly increased the degradation of p65 during rapamycin-triggered autophagy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>), which suggested that Vangl2 promoted autophagic degradation of p65.</p>
<p>To further demonstrate Vangl2 mediated p65 degradation through autophagy, we transfected WT, ATG5, and Beclin1 knockout (KO) 293T cells with Vangl2, and found that the degradation of p65 triggered by Vangl2 was almost abrogated in ATG5 and Beclin1 KO cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> G). The p65 turnover rates were markedly reduced in ATG5 and Beclin1 KO cells post CHX treatment (Fig. S4, D and E), suggesting that the impaired autophagy prevented p65 degradation. Consistently, NF-κB activation induced by p65 was rescued in ATG5 and Beclin1 KO cells expressing Vangl2, compared to WT 293T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">I</xref>).

<title>Vangl2 promotes the recognition of p65 by cargo receptor NDP52</title>
<p>Accumulating evidence showed that cargo receptors play crucial roles in selective autophagic degradation by delivering substrates (X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kirkin &amp; Rogov, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Since there is no research suggests that Vangl2 is a cargo protein, we hypothesized that Vangl2 might bridge p65 to the cargo receptors for autophagic degradation. To identify the potential cargo receptor responsible for Vangl2-mediated autophagic degradation of p65, we co-transfected 293T cells with Vangl2 and various cargo receptors, followed by Co-IP assay. Result suggested that Vangl2 strongly interacted with the cargo receptors p62 and NDP52, and slightly associated with NBR1 and Nix (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). However, p65 only interacted with the cargo receptors p62 and NDP52 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>), which is consistent with a recent finding that p62 protein is a Vangl2-binding partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Puvirajesinghe et al., 2016</xref>). We next attempted to clarify whether p62 or NDP52 is involved in Vangl2-mediated autophagic degradation of p65. Interestingly, we found that Vangl2 promoted the association between p65 and NDP52, but did not affect p65-p62 complex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Consistently, we found that Vangl2 mediated degradation of p65 was rescued in NDP52 KO cells, but not in p62 KO cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Endogenous co-IP immunoblot analyses also revealed that deficiency of Vangl2 remarkably attenuated the association of endogenous p65 and NDP52 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Likewise, NDP52, but not p62, enhanced the association between p65 and Vangl2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref> and Fig. S5 A). And Vangl2 failed to inhibit the activation of NF-κB signaling in NDP52 KO cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>), but not in p62 KO cells (Fig. S5 B). Furthermore, compared with WT cells, CHX-chase assay results showed that the degradation rates of p65 were reduced in NDP52 KO cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 H</xref>), but not in p62 KO cells (Fig. S5 C). Taken together, these data suggest that Vangl2 mediates the NDP52-directed selective autophagic degradation of p65.</p>

<title>Vangl2 increases the K63-linked poly-ubiquitination of p65</title>

<title>Vangl2 recruits PDLIM2 to ubiquitinate p65</title>
<p>Although Vangl2 promotes K63-linked ubiquitination and degradation of p65, Vangl2 is not an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We hypothesized that Vangl2 might function as a scaffold protein to link p65 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase for ubiquitination or to block the interaction of deubiquitinase (DUB) with p65. To identify the potential E3 ubiquitinase or DUB responsible for Vangl2 mediated ubiquitination of p65, we further analyzed our RNA-seq data to identify E3 ubiquitin ligase or DUB involved in ubiquitination of p65 by comparing LPS-stimulated BMDMs from <italic>Vangl2<sup>ΔM</sup></italic> and WT mice. Differentially expression analysis identified 88 down-regulated genes related to E3 ubiquitin ligase and 56 up-regulated genes related to DUB in response to Vangl2 deficiency in BMDMs after LPS stimulation (Fig. S6 A), which included PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2), Trim21 and DUB ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7). Recent research showed that ubiquitin E3 ligases PDLIM2 and Trim21 ubiquitinated p65 via K63 linkage and enhanced the interaction of p65 with IKK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Healy &amp; O’Connor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jodo, Shibazaki, Onuma, Kaisho, &amp; Tanaka, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), while DUB USP7 promoted NF-κB-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mitxitorena et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we found that the mRNA level of PDLIM2 and USP7 decreased in Vangl2-deficient BMDMs, compared with WT BMDMs (Fig. S6, B-D).

<title>We next investigated whether Vangl2 promoted the association between p65 and</title>
<p>PDLIM2 by co-IP experiments. Our results indicated that Vangl2 interacted with PDLIM2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>) and promoted the association between p65 and PDLIM2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 E</xref>). Notably, PDLIM2 accelerated the degradation of p65 in the presence of Vangl2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 F</xref>). Conversely, PDLIM2 deficiency markedly impaired Vangl2-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of p65 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 G</xref>) and knockdown of Vangl2 inhibited K63-linked poly-ubiquitination of p65 mediated by PDLIM2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 H</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that Vangl2 functions as a potential adaptor to recruit E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to p65 and promotes the K63-linked ubiquitination of p65 for its subsequent autophagic degradation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As a core PCP component, Vangl2 is widely known for its function in organ development, such as brain, tooth, tongue and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bailly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hatakeyama et al., 2014</xref>), trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface, and subsequently shuttles between the endocytic vesicles and cell surface (D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). The function of Vangl2 mostly depends on its cellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hatakeyama et al., 2014</xref>) and is reported mainly through PCP/WNT signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jessen &amp; Jessen, 2019</xref>). Activated Vangl2 exhibits extremely long cytoplasmic and intercellular branches and delivers Wnt to multiple cells to enhance Wnt/β-Catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>). During myocardial hypertrophy, Vangl2 aggravates myocardial hypertrophy by regulating Wnt/JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jessen &amp; Jessen, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">2019</xref>) and the expansion of cardiomyocyte surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jessen &amp; Jessen, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">2019</xref>). However, our previous study showed that the lysosome-suppressing function of Vangl2 in osteoblast differentiation is not dependent on conventional PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gong et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that Vangl2 has additional functions in pathways besides PCP. In this study, we provided direct evidence that the expression of Vangl2 was increased during sepsis and upregulated significantly in immune organs (lymph nodes and spleen) upon LPS stimulation, which is consistent with our previous finding that Vangl2 regulated the downstream signaling of TLR or IL-1R. In addition, the present study showed that Vangl2 prevented the progression of sepsis and the accumulation of inflammatory cytokines through suppressing NF-κB pathway: Vangl2 inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation by delivering p65 to autophagosome for degradation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study proves that Vangl2 regulates NF-κB signaling and inflammatory responses, and could serve as a potential target for therapeutic purposes in diseases associated with NF-κB signaling.</p>
<p>The proteasome, lysosome and autolysosome pathways are the major systems that are utilized by eukaryotic cells to maintain the protein abundance and immune homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Deretic, 2021</xref>). Previous studies have shown that cellular levels of Vangl2 (D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feng et al., 2021</xref>) and its binding partner Prickle2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nagaoka et al., 2019</xref>) are maintained by the proteasomal pathway. Our recent study showed that Vangl2 mediated osteogenic differentiation by limiting chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in mesenchymal stem cells, suggesting a close relationship between Vangl2 and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gong et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, our study suggests Vangl2 promotes p65 degradation through autophagy pathway, but not proteasomal pathway. Importantly, we demonstrated that the degradation of p65 mediated by Vangl2-NDP52 complex is regulated by autophagy induction through rapamycin treatment and autophagy blockade by ATG5 KO or Beclin1 KO. Considering our findings and other reports, Vangl2 may play multi-functional roles in regulating different types of autophagy (i.e. CMA or selective autophagy).</p>
<p>Selective autophagy requires that cargo receptors recognize the labeling of cargoes with degradation signals and subsequently engaged with the LC3 localized in the autophagosome membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Shaid et al., 2013</xref>). Common cargo receptors mainly include p62/SQSTM1, CALCOCO2/NDP52, OPTN, NBR1 and TOLLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Johansen &amp; Lamark, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yamano &amp; Youle, 2020</xref>). A study in HEK293T cells showed that LRRC25 promotes the autophagic degradation of p65 through enhancing the interaction between p65 and p62 (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, a recent study showed that Vangl2 interacts with p62, subsequently promoting breast tumors by activating JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Puvirajesinghe et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that Vangl2 may promote the autophagic degradation of p65 by recruiting the cargo receptor p62. However, our data suggested that Vangl2 markedly increased the p65-NDP52 interaction but not p65-p62. Strikingly, Vangl2 mediated autophagic degradation of p65 was abolished in NDP52 KO cells, but not in p62 KO cells. Thus, our findings identify that NDP52 is the new cargo receptor responsible for Vangl2-mediated selective autophagic degradation of p65.</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence has shown that cargo receptors mainly recognize ubiquitination modifications on the substrates and then promote degradation in auto-lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Shaid et al., 2013</xref>). As expected, we observed Vangl2 promoted the ubiquitination of p65, thus enhancing the association between cargo protein and p65. K48- and K63-linked ubiquitination were mostly reported modifications on p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kauppinen, Suuronen, Ojala, Kaarniranta, &amp; Salminen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Korbecki, Bobinski, &amp; Dutka, 2019</xref>). For example, E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF182 inhibited TLR triggered cytokine production by promoting K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cao, Sun, Chang, Sun, &amp; Yang, 2019</xref>). Trim21 promoted K63-linked poly-ubiquitination of p65, but did not affect the stability of p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). PDLIM7 cooperated with PDLIM2 to inhibit inflammation by promoting K63-linked poly-ubiquitination of p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jodo et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we revealed that Vangl2 specifically promoted K63-linked poly-ubiquitination of p65, but not other ubiquitin linkages by recruiting a previously unrecognized E3 ligase PDLIM2, which further explore the molecular mechanism by which regulates the stability of p65. Although many studies focus on the regulation of p65, the location of p65 degradation has not been clarified. A study showed PDLIM2 degrades p65 through the proteasomal pathway in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jodo et al., 2020</xref>), while we found Vangl2 mediated autophagic degradation of p65 mainly happened in cytoplasm, but not in nucleus. Combined with previous studies, our study indicates that p65 undergoes different degradation pathway in distinct location of cells.</p>
<p>Autophagy is a fundamental biological process contributing to multiple life processes. Emerging evidence has suggested that crosstalk between autophagy and innate immune signaling plays critical roles in diseases with inflammatory components, including infections, cancer, autoimmunity, and metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pradel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Recent study showed that the interplay between autophagy and type I IFN or NF-κB signaling drives or suppresses inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hui et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, autophagy related key genes, such as Atg5, Atg9, and ULK1, also play critical roles in inflammatory diseases (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Peng et al., 2019</xref>). Here, our discovery of Vangl2-PDLIM2-NDP52 complex in the regulation of p65-mediated NF-κB signaling could be a therapeutic target for the development of immunotherapy against infection and inflammation.</p>
<p>Based on our findings, we propose a working model that Vangl2 negatively regulates NF-κB signaling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> I). Vangl2 functions as an adaptor to recruit ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 and increase K63-linked ubiquitination on p65, which promotes the recognition of p65 by cargo receptor NDP52 and the autophagic degradation of p65, resulting in suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ameliorating sepsis. Our findings provide a potential target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> work describes a novel role of Vangl2, a core planar cell polarity protein, in mechanistically linking the inflammatory NF-kB pathway to selective autophagic protein degradation. Using <bold>solid</bold> methods, the authors also establish the functional significance of the proposed mechanism in sepsis. The work may advance our understanding of NF-kB control, particularly in the context of aberrant inflammation. However, some gaps remain, and additional studies are needed to unequivocally establish the role of Vangl2 in regulating NF-kB signaling.</p>

<p>In the manuscript titled &quot;Vangl2 suppresses NF-κB signaling and ameliorates sepsis by targeting p65 for NDP52-mediated autophagic degradation&quot; by Lu et al, the authors show that Vangl2, a planner cell polarity component, plays a direct role in autophagic degradation of NFkB-p65 by facilitating its ubiquitination via PDLIM2 and subsequent recognition and autophagic targeting via the autophagy adaptor protein NDP52. Conceptually it is a wonderful study with excellent execution of experiments and controls. The concerns with the manuscript are mainly on two counts - First issue is the kinetics of p65 regulation reported here, which does not fit into the kinetics of the mechanism proposed here, i.e., Vangl2-mediated ubiquitination followed by autophagic degradation of p65. The second issue is more technical- an absolute lack of quantitative analyses. The authors rely mostly on visual qualitative interpretation to assess an increase or decrease in associations between partner molecules throughout the study. While the overall mechanism is interesting, the authors should address these concerns as highlighted below:</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>1. Kinetics of p65 regulation by Vangl2: As mentioned above, authors report that LPS stimulation leads to higher IKK and p65 activation in the absence of Vangl2. The mechanism of action authors subsequently work out is that- Vangl2 helps recruit E3 ligase PDLIM to p65, which causes K63 ubiquitination, which is recognised by NDP52 for autophagic targeting. Curiously, peak p65 activation is achieved within 30 minutes of LPS stimulation. The time scale of all other assays is way longer. It is not clear that in WT cells, p65 could be targeted to autophagic degradation in Vangl2 dependent manner within 30 minutes. The HA-Myc-Flag-based overexpression and Co-IP studies do confirm the interactions as proposed. However, they do not prove that this mechanism was responsible for the Vangl2-mediated modulation of p65 activation upon LPS stimulation. Moreover, the Vangl2 KO line also shows increased IKK activation. The authors do not show the cause behind increased IKK activation, which in itself can trigger increased p65 phosphorylation.</p>
<p>2. The other major concern is regarding the lack of quantitative assessments. For Co-IP experiments, I can understand it is qualitative observation. However, when the authors infer that there is an increase or decrease in the association through co-IP immunoblots, it should also be quantified, especially since the differences are quite marginal and could be easily misinterpreted.</p>
<p>3. Figure 4E and F: It is evident that inhibiting Autolysosome (CQ or BafA1) or autophagy (3MA) led to the recovery of p65 levels and inducing autophagy by Rapamycin led to faster decay in p65 levels. Did the authors also note/explore the possibility that Vangl2 itself may be degraded via the autophagy pathway? IB of WCL upon CQ/BAF/3MA or upon Rapa treatment does indicate the same. If true, how would that impact the dynamics of p65 activation?</p>
<p>4. Autophagic targeting of p65 should also be shown through alternate evidence, like microscopy etc., in the LPS-stimulated WT cells.</p>
<p>Limitation: The mechanism behind enhanced activation of IKK in the absence of Vangl2 remains unclear. It is possible there is an autophagy-independent mechanism also involved in this regulation.</p>
<p>Summary: The study shows a new mechanism of NFkB-p65 regulation mediated by Vangl2-dependent autophagic targeting. Autophagic regulation of p65 has been reported earlier; this study brings an additional set of molecular players involved in this important regulatory event, which may have implications for chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.</p>

<p>Vangl2, a core planar cell polarity protein involved in Wnt/PCP signaling, mediates cell proliferation, differentiation, homeostasis, and cell migration. Vangl2 malfunctioning has been linked to various human ailments, including autoimmune and neoplastic disorders. Interestingly, Vangl2 was shown to interact with the autophagy regulator p62, and indeed, autophagic degradation limits the activity of inflammatory mediators such as p65/NF-κB. However, if Vangl2, per se, contributes to restraining aberrant p65/NF-kB activity remains unclear.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Lu et al. describe that Vangl2 expression is upregulated in human sepsis-associated PBMCs and that Vangl2 mitigates experimental sepsis in mice by negatively regulating p65/NF-κB signaling in myeloid cells. Vangl2 recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to promote K63-linked poly-ubiquitination of p65. Vangl2 also facilitates the recognition of ubiquitinated p65 by the cargo receptor NDP52. These molecular processes cause selective autophagic degradation of p65. Indeed, abrogation of PDLIM2 or NDP52 functions rescued p65 from autophagic degradation, leading to extended p65/NF-κB activity.</p>
<p>As such, the manuscript presents a substantial body of interesting work and a novel mechanism of NF-κB control. If found true, the proposed mechanism may expand therapeutic opportunities for inflammatory diseases. However, the current draft has significant weaknesses that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Specific comments</p>
<p>
1. Vangl2 deficiency did not cause a discernible increase in the cellular level of total endogenous p65 (Fig 2A and Fig 2B) but accumulated also phosphorylated IKK.</p>
<p>
Even Fig 4D reveals that Vangl2 exerts a rather modest effect on the total p65 level and the figure does not provide any standard error for the quantified data. Therefore, these results do not fully support the proposed model (Figure 7) - this is a significant draw back. Instead, these data provoke an alternate hypothesis that Vangl2 could be specifically mediating autophagic removal of phosphorylated IKK and phosphorylated IKK, leading to exacerbated inflammatory NF-κB response in Vangl2-deficient cells. One may need to use phosphorylation-defective mutants of p65, at least in the over-expression experiments, to dissect between these possibilities.</p>
<p>
2. Fig 1A: The data indicates the presence of two subgroups within the sepsis cohort - one with high Vangl2 expressions and the other with relatively normal Vangle2 expression. Was there any difference with respect to NF-κB target inflammatory gene expressions between these subgroups?</p>
<p>
3. The effect of Vangl2 deficiency was rather modest in the neutrophil. Could it be that Vangl2 mediates its effect mostly in macrophages?</p>
<p>
4. Fig 1D and Figure 1E: Data for unstimulated Vangl2 cells should be provided. Also, the source of the IL-1β primary antibody has not been mentioned.</p>
<p>
5. The relevance and the requirement of RNA-seq analysis are not clear in the present draft. Figure 1E already reveals upregulation of the signature NF-κB target inflammatory genes upon Vangl2 deficiency.</p>
<p>
6. Fig 2A reveals an increased accumulation of phosphorylated p65 and IKK in Vangl2-deficient macrophages upon LPS stimulation within 30 minutes. However, Vangl2 accumulates at around 60 minutes post-stimulation in WT cells. Similar results were obtained for neutrophils (Fig 2B). There appears to be a temporal disconnect between Vangl2 and phosphorylated p65 accumulation - this must be clarified.</p>
<p>
7. Figure 2E and 2F do not have untreated controls. Presentations in Fig 2E may be improved to more clearly depict IL6 and TNF data, preferably with separate Y-axes.</p>
<p>
8. Line 219: &quot;strongly with IKKα, p65 and MyD88, and weak&quot; - should be revised.</p>
<p>
9. It is not clear why IKKβ was excluded from interaction studies in Fig S3G.</p>
<p>
10. Fig 3F- In the text, authors mentioned that Vangl2 strongly associates with p65 upon LPS stimulation in BMDM. However, no controls, including input or another p65-interacting protein, were used.</p>
<p>
11. Figure 4D - Authors claim that Vangl2-deficient BMDMs stabilized the expression of endogenous p65 after LPS treatment. However, p65 levels were particularly constitutively elevated in knockout cells, and LPS signaling did not cause any further upregulation. This again indicates the role of Vangl2 in the basal state. The authors need to explain this and revise the test accordingly.</p>

<p>Lu et al. describe Vangl2 as a negative regulator of inflammation in myeloid cells. The primary mechanism appears to be through binding p65 and promoting its degradation, albeit in an unusual autolysosome/autophagy dependent manner. Overall, the findings are novel and the crosstalk of PCP pathway protein Vangl2 with NF-kappaB is of interest. Whether PCP is anyway relevant or if this is a PCP-independent function of Vangl2 is not directly explored (the later appears more likely from the manuscript/discussion). PCP pathways intersect often with developmentally important pathways such as WNT, HH/GLI, Fat-Dachsous and even mechanical tension. It might be of importance to investigate whether Vangl2-dependent NF-kappaB is influenced by developmental pathways. Are Vangl2 phosphorylations (S5, S82 and S84) in anyway necessary for the observed effects on NF-kappaB or would a phospho-mutant (alanine substitution mutant) Vangl2 phenocopy WT Vangl2 for regulation of NF-kappaB? Another area to strengthen might be with regards to specificity of cell types where this phenomenon may be observed. LPS treatment in mice resulted in Vangl2 upregulation in spleen and lymph nodes, but not in lung and liver. What explains the specificity of organ/cell-type Vangl2 upregulation and its consequences observed here? Why is NF-kappaB signaling not more broadly or even ubiquitously affected in all cell types in a Vangl2-dependent manner, rather than being restricted to macrophages, neutrophils and peritoneal macrophages, or, for that matter, in spleen and LN and not liver and lung? After all, one may think that the PCP proteins, as well as NF-kappaB, are ubiquitous. Regardless, Vangl2 as a negative regulator of NF-kappaB is an important finding. There are, however, some concerns about methodology and statistics that need to be addressed.</p>
