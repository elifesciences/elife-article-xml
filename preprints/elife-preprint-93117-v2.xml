<title>Abstract</title><p>How the fate (folding versus degradation) of glycoproteins is determined in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an intriguing question. Monoglucosylated glycoproteins are recognized by lectin chaperones to facilitate their folding, whereas glycoproteins exposing well-trimmed mannoses are subjected to glycoprotein ER-associated degradation (gpERAD); we have elucidated how mannoses are sequentially trimmed by EDEM family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">George et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">2021</xref> eLife). Although reglucosylation by UGGT was previously reported to have no effect on substrate degradation, here we directly tested this notion using cells with genetically disrupted UGGT1/2. Strikingly, the results showed that UGGT1 delayed the degradation of misfolded substrates and unstable glycoproteins including ATF6Î±. An experiment with a point mutant of UGGT1 indicated that the glucosylation activity of UGGT1 was required for the inhibition of early glycoprotein degradation. These and overexpression-based competition experiments suggested that the fate of glycoproteins is determined by a tug-of-war between structure formation by UGGT1 and degradation by EDEMs. We further demonstrated the physiological importance of UGGT1, since ATF6Î± cannot function properly without UGGT1. Thus, our work strongly suggests that UGGT1 is a central factor in ER protein quality control via regulation of both glycoprotein folding and degradation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an essential role in the cell as the site of biosynthesis of approximately one third of all proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kaufman, 1999</xref>). Membrane and secretory proteins, after being newly synthesized on ribosomes attached to the ER membrane, are translocated to the ER in a translation-coupled manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brodsky and Skach, 2011</xref>). Post-translational modifications of proteins occurring in the ER include disulfide bond formation mediated by PDI (protein disulfide isomerase) family members and <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation of Asn in the consensus sequence consisting of Asn-X-Ser/Thr (Xâ Pro). <italic>N</italic>-Glycan modifying a large number of proteins that enter the ER is converted from oligomannose type to complex type in the Golgi and is deeply involved in biological phenomena inside and outside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pinho et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The structure of <italic>N</italic>-glycans plays a key role in protein folding and degradation in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ninagawa et al., 2020a</xref>). The <italic>N</italic>-glycan added to nascent proteins is composed of three glucoses, nine mannoses, and two <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamines (GlcNAc), and is termed Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> (G3M9), which is processed to GM9 by the actions of glucosidase I and glucosidase II. Calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) recognize glycoproteins with GM9 to facilitate productive folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lamriben et al., 2016</xref>) and then the last glucose is removed by glucosidase II. If glycoproteins with M9 attain their tertiary structure, they move on to the next compartment of the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ninagawa et al., 2020a</xref>). If the protein portion does not form a proper structure, UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferses (UGGTs: UGGT1 and UGGT2) re-add glucose to the glycoprotein (reglucosylation) for recognition by CNX/CRT to facilitate protein folding, collectively referred to as the âCNX/CRTâ cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lamriben et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sun and Brodsky, 2019</xref>). UGGT1 promotes substrate solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ferris et al., 2013</xref>) and prefers proteins with exposed hydrophobic regions to folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Caramelo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sousa and Parodi, 1995</xref>). UGGT1 has a paralogue, UGGT2, whose glucosyltransferase activity is weaker than that of UGGT1 at least in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ito et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Takeda et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>If glycoproteins with M9 are not folded correctly within a certain period, mannose residues are trimmed from M9 first by EDEM2-S-S-TXNDC11 complex to M8B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">George et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>) and then by EDEM3/1 to M7A, M6 and M5 exposing Î±1,6-bonded mannose on the glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">George et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hirao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>), which are recognized by OS9 or XTP3B lectins for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">van der Goot et al., 2018</xref>). They are recruited to the HRD1-SEL1L complex on the ER membrane, retrotranslocated back to the cytosol, and degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The series of these processes is collectively designated glycoprotein ER-associated degradation (gpERAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ninagawa et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Smith et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>However, how the fate (folding versus degradation) of glycoprotein is determined in the ER is not clearly understood, and remains one of the biggest issues in the field of ER protein quality control. UGGTs appear to be among the key enzymes determining this. UGGTs have been shown to contribute to glycoprotein folding through their reglucosylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Helenius and Aebi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pearse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sousa et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tessier et al., 2000</xref>), but seem not to affect ERAD, because it was previously reported that the presence of one glucose in the A branch of <italic>N</italic>-glycans did not change the timing of substrate degradation as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tannous et al., 2015</xref>): MI8-5 Chinese hamster ovary cells are deficient in the dolichol-P-glucoseâdependent glycosyltransferase termed Alg6, and therefore produce only glycoproteins with <italic>N</italic>-glycans lacking glucoses (M9). In these cells, <italic>N</italic>-glycans with one glucose are produced only by the action of UGGTs. Accodingly, the monoglucosylated state is maintained by treatment of MI8-5 with the glucosidase inhibitor 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ). It was found that such trapping of glycoproteins in a monoglucosylated state delayed their efflux from the ER, as expected, but did not affect their rate of degradation. The selection for the degradation process seemed to progress in a dominant manner that was independent of the glucosylation state of the A-branch on the substrate glycans.</p>
<p>We consider that it has not been directly examined whether UGGT-mediated reglucosylation of <italic>N</italic>-glycan is involved in degradation of glycoproteins in the ER. Here, we generated UGGT1-knockout (KO), UGGT2-KO and UGGT-double KO (DKO) cell lines to investigate this involvement. Surprisingly, we found that degradation of misfolded and unstable glycoproteins was markedly accelerated in UGGT1-KO and DKO cells. Our work has identified UGGT1 as a regulator of both protein folding and degradation in the ER and thus emphasizes the importance of UGGT1 in ER protein quality control.</p>

<title>Generation of knockout cell lines of UGGTs</title>
<p>To explore the roles of UGGT1 and UGGT2 in ERAD, UGGT1-KO, UGGT2-KO and UGGT-DKO cell lines were generated from HCT116 diploid cells derived from human colonic carcinoma using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9. Gene disruptions of UGGT1 and UGGT2 were confirmed at the genome, mRNA and protein level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>; <xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A-J</xref>). The growth rate of the KO cell population was not significantly altered (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Previously, the protein level of UGGT2 was estimated to be 4% relative to that of UGGT1 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>). In our hands, the protein expression levels of UGGT2 in HCT116 and HeLa cells were found to be approximately 4.5 % and 26 % of that of UGGT1, respectively, as estimated by transfection of UGGT1-Myc3 and UGGT2-Myc3 (<xref rid="fig1-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A</xref>). Immunoblotting showed that ER stress marker proteins BiP, XBP1(S) and ATF4 were not induced in UGGT1-KO, UGGT2-KO or UGGT-DKO cells (<xref rid="fig1-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2B</xref>). Both UGGT1 and UGGT2 are modified with <italic>N</italic>-glycans, as indicated by their sensitivity to treatment with Endoglycosidase H (EndoH), which cleaves oligomannose-type <italic>N</italic>-glycans localized in the ER (<xref rid="fig1-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p>

These results confirmed the establishment of KO cells for UGGTs, which show the expected phenotype with UGGT1 involved in the maturation of nascent polypeptides.</p>

<title>Effect of UGGT1/2 knockout on ERAD</title>
<p>We then examined the effect of UGGT1/2 knockout on ERAD. We previously showed that ATF6Î± functions as an unfolded protein response (UPR) sensor/transducer but is a somewhat unfolded protein that is constitutively subjected to gpERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Haze et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Horimoto et al., 2013</xref>). The half-life of ATF6Î± in WT HCT116 cells was less than 2 h and degradation of ATF6Î± was blocked almost completely in SEL1L-KO cells (the construction and characterization of these KO cells is described in <xref rid="fig1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3</xref>) and in EDEM1/2/3-triple KO (TKO) HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), as was shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Horimoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>). Strikingly, degradation of ATF6Î± was markedly accelerated in UGGT1-KO and UGGT-DKO cells but not in UGGT2-KO cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). These findings revealed for the first time that UGGT1 is involved in ERAD. The fact that ATF6Î± was stabilized in UGGT-DKO cells treated with a mannosidase inhibitor, kifunensine, as in WT cells treated with kifunensine, indicated that the acceleration of ATF6Î± degradation still required mannose trimming (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>We then examined the effect of the glucosidase inhibitor DNJ, which preferentially inhibits glucosidase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Saunier et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Szumilo et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zeng et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, accumulation of GM9 rather than G3M9 or G2M9 was observed in WT, UGGT-DKO, and EDEM-TKO cells after treatment with DNJ [Figure 1-Figure supplement 4A-C (raw data), 5A-C (isomer composition ratio)]. Treatment of WT cells with DNJ did not affect the degradation rate of ATF6Î± (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), consistent with the previously published claim described in the Introduction. Stabilization of ATF6Î± in SEL1L-KO and EDEM-TKO cells was not affected by treatment with DNJ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). This is because SEL1L is required for retrotranslocation of substrates, and because mannose trimming required for gpERAD cannot work and therefore M9 markedly accumulates in EDEM-TKO cells, compared with WT cells [<xref rid="fig1-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 4AC</xref> (raw data) and 5D (isomer composition ratio)]; note that both retrotranslocation and mannose trimming are events downstream of glucose trimming (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Comparison between WT and EDEM-TKO cells indicates that ATF6Î± is still degraded via gpERAD requiring mannose trimming even in the presence of DNJ.</p>
<p>Treatment of WT cells with DNJ resulted in a similar degradation rate of ATF6Î±, however, the accelerated degradation of ATF6Î± in UGGT-DKO cells was compromised by treatment with DNJ, so that the degradation rate of ATF6Î± became very similar in WT and UGGT-DKO cells after treatment with DNJ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). This implies that glucose trimming-mediated production rate of M9 is important for efficient gpERAD. Indeed, an increase in the level of GM9 and the a decrease in the level of M9 were observed in WT and UGGT-DKO cells treated with DNJ [<xref rid="fig1-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 4AB</xref> (raw data) and 5AB (isomer composition ratio)]. Nonetheless, we noted that ATF6Î± was not stabilized completely in WT or UGGT-DKO cells treated with DNJ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), unlike in EDEM-TKO and SEL1L-KO cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). We consider it likely that this is because mannose trimming still occurred even in the absence of glucose trimming, as evidenced by the increased detection of GM8 in WT and UGGT-DKO cells treated with DNJ [<xref rid="fig1-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 4AB</xref> (raw data) 5AB (isomer composition rate)], leading to recognition of GM7 by OS9/XTP3B for retrotranslocation (Refer to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This notion was supported by the similar results obtained using another inhibitor of glucosidase I and II, castanospermine (CST) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), which was reported to preferentially inhibit glucosidase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Saunier et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Szumilo et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zeng et al., 1997</xref>); in WT and UGGT-DKO cells treated with CST, large amounts of G3M9 and G2M9 were indeed detected in addition to GM9, but the increased detection of GM8 should also be noted [<xref rid="fig1-6" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 6BC</xref> (raw data) and D (isomer composition ratio)]. CD38-ÏTM-HA, a soluble and low molecular weight gpERAD substrate possessing three <italic>N</italic>-glycans, migrated as a single band in WT cells, as a single band with a slightly higher molecular weight (representing a GM9 form) in WT cells treated with DNJ than that in WT cells, and as multiple higher molecular weight bands (representing a mixture of G3M9, G2M9 and GM9, etc.) in WT cells treated with CST than that in WT cells (<xref rid="fig1-6" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 6A</xref>). As the occurrence of mannose trimming in the presence of DNJ (GM9 &gt; GM8 &gt; GM7) obscured the effect of reglucosylation on gpERAD in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tannous et al., 2015</xref>), the active role of UGGT1 in gpERAD was demonstrated here for the first time by our gene knockout strategy. We consider that UGGT1-mediated reglucosylation reduces the probability of the mannose trimming that is a prerequisite for gpERAD.</p>
<p>We next examined the effect of UGGT1/2 knockout on degradation of NHK, a soluble gpERAD substrate. NHK with three <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites is severely misfolded because of its C-terminus truncation resulting from TC deletion in the Î±1-antitrypsin (A1AT) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sifers et al., 1988</xref>). We found that degradation of NHK was accelerated in UGGT1-KO and UGGT-DKO cells but not in UGGT2-KO cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), similar to the case of ATF6Î±. Of note, this acceleration required glucosyltransferase activity, as introduction of myc-tagged WT UGGT1 but not its catalytically inactive mutant, D1358A located in the DxD motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Takeda et al., 2014</xref>), into UGGT1-KO cells by transfection decelerated the degradation of NHK (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Accordingly, the degradation rate of NHK-QQQ, in which all three <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites in NHK were mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ninagawa et al., 2015</xref>), was not affected by gene disruption of UGGT1 or UGGT2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>UGGT1 is required for the proper functioning of ATF6Î±</title>
<p>Finally, we investigated the physiological significance of the prevention of early degradation of substrates by UGGT1. Upon ER stress (accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER), a precursor form of ATF6Î±, designated ATF6Î±(P), is cleaved at the Golgi to the nucleus-localizing form of ATF6Î±, designated ATF6Î±(N), to transcriptionally activate promoters containing cis-acting ER stress response element (ERSE) or UPR element (UPRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mori, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>), but not the ATF4 promoter, which is translationally activated in response to ER stress(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lu et al., 2004</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results reveal that UGGT1 contributes to determination of the fate of glycoproteins in the ER. In WT cells, unfolded or misfolded glycoproteins with M9 are subjected to either the CNX/CRT cycle for folding via UGGT1-mediated reglucosylsation or gpERAD via EDEMs-mediated mannose trimming, leading to degradation at a certain rate [the half-life of ATF6Î± was â¼1.5 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) and that of NHK was â¼2.5 h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>)]. In UGGT1-KO cells, unfolded or misfolded glycoproteins with M9 skip the CNX/CRT cycle and are subjected to gpERAD, resulting in accelerated degradation [the half-life of ATF6Î± became less than 1 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) and that of NHK became â¼1.5 h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>)]. This acceleration occurred for rRI332 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) and hEMC1-ÎPQQ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), but not for native and stable glycoproteins, such as Ribophorin I, EMC1, Grp170 and Sil1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3ABD</xref>). Glycoproteins with stable conformational states do not require UGGT1, whereas unstable, unassembled, conformationally abnormal or severely misfolded proteins are examined by UGGT1 for the possibility of proper folding in the CNX/CRT cycle. Therefore, we conclude that the capability of reglucosylation has an impact on determining the timing of substrate degradation, and UGGT1 acts to prevent early degradation. Substrate degradation was delayed by knockout of EDEMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">George et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Leto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ninagawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>) and accelerated by overexpression of EDEMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hirao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mast et al., 2005</xref>).

It is further concluded that UGGT1 plays a âtug-of-warâ with EDEMs regarding the determination of the fate of glycoproteins: whether to give them a chance to fold, or to degrade them (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Proposed fate of glycoproteins in the ER</title>
<p>(A) In WT cells, glucosidase II produces glycoproteins with M9, which are either reglucosylated by UGGT1 and then subjected to the CNX/CRT cycle, or degraded via EDEMs-mediated mannose trimming. Thus, the fate of glycoproteins is determined by a tug-of-war between structure formation by UGGT1 and degradation by EDEMs. (B). In WT cells treated with DNJ, glycoproteins are not subjected to the CNX/CRT cycle and are degraded by EDEMs-mediated gpERAD. It is likely that mannose trimming from GM9 proceeds more slowly than that from M9, so that glycoproteins are degraded at similar speed in (A) and (B). (C). In UGGT1-KO cells, glycoproteins are directly subjected to premature (accelerated) degradation by EDEMs-mediated gpERAD. (D). In UGGT1-KO cells treated with DNJ, glycoproteins are degraded similarly to (B).</p></caption>

<p>Previously, in higher animals, the reglucosylation activity of UGGT1 was thought to contribute to folding and secretion but not to degradation of glycoproteins, based on experiments using the glucosidase inhibitor DNJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tannous et al., 2015</xref>). The reason why the degradation rate was not changed significantly by DNJ treatment can be explained by the occurrence of mannose trimming in the presence of DNJ: GM8 was increasingly detected in cells treated with DNJ (Fig. 1-Figure supplement 5A-C). Substrates with GM9 are degraded via mannose trimming (GM9 &gt; GM8 &gt; GM7) in cells treated with DNJ. Nonetheless, as ATF6Î± was degraded at a similar rate in WT cells, WT cells treated with DNJ, and UGGT1-KO cells treated with DNJ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), we consider it likely that mannose trimming is inefficient when a glucose residue is present on the A chain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>The inhibitory effect of UGGT2 on substrate degradation appears to be quite limited. For all substrates used in this study, genetic disruption of UGGT2 alone did not accelerate degradation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3DF</xref>). Overexpression of UGGT1 in UGGT-DKO cells attenuated the accelerated degradation of NHK, whereas that of UGGT2 did not do so (data not shown). Given that the protein expression level of UGGT2 was more markedly lower than that of UGGT1 in HCT116 compared to HeLa cells (Fig. 1-Figure supplement 2A), further investigation in other cell lines and tissues will be required to elucidate the function of UGGT2. The main function of UGGT2 might be in lipid quality control rather than protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hung et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings strongly suggest that UGGT1 is not just a CNX/CRT safety net, but should be considered to be a central component involved in the <italic>N</italic>-glycan-dependent folding and degradation in the ER. The loss of UGGT1 reduced tolerance to ER stress in cultured cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). UGGT1 is necessary for proper functioning of ER resident proteins such as ATF6Î± (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-F</xref>). It is highly possible that ATF6Î± undergoes structural maintenance by UGGT1, which would avoid unnecessarily degradation and maintain proper function, because ATF6Î± with more rigid structure tended to remain in UGGT1-KO cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Responses of ERSE-and UPRE-containing promoters toward ER stress, which require ATF6Î±, were decreased in UGGT1-KO cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4DE</xref>). In contrast, ATF4 reporter activity was increased in UGGT1-KO cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>), while the basal level of ATF4 reporter in UGGT1-KO cells was comparable to that in WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). The ATF4 pathway might partially compensate the functional loss of the ERSE and UPRE pathway in UGGT1-KO cells in response to acute ER stress.</p>
<p>Our work focusing on the function of mammalian UGGT1 greatly advances the understanding of how ER homeostasis is maintained in higher animals. Considering that <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> does not have a functional orthologue of UGGT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ninagawa et al., 2020a</xref>) and that KO of UGGT1 causes embryonic lethality in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Molinari et al., 2005</xref>), it would be interesting to know at what point the function of UGGT1 became evolutionarily necessary for life. Related to its importance in animals, it would also be of interest to know what kind of diseases UGGT1 is associated with. Recently, it has been reported that UGGT1 is involved in ER retention of Trop-2 mutant proteins, which are encoded by a causative gene of gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tax et al., 2024</xref>). Not only this, but since the ER is known to be involved in over 60 diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Guerriero and Brodsky, 2012</xref>), we must investigate how UGGT1 and other ER molecules are involved in diseases.</p>

<p>In this study, Ninagawa et al., sheds light on UGGT's role in ER quality control of glycoproteins. By utilizing UGGT1/UGGT2 DKO , they demonstrate that several model misfolded glycoproteins undergo early degradation. One such substrate is ATF6alpha where its premature degradation hampers the cell's ability to mount an ER stress response.</p>
<p>This study convincingly demonstrates that many unstable misfolded glycoproteins undergo accelerated degradation without UGGTs. Also, this study provides evidence of a &quot;tug of war&quot; model involving UGGTs (pulling glycoproteins to being refolded) and EDEMs (pulling glycoproteins to ERAD).</p>
<p>The study explores the physiological role of UGGT, particularly examining the impact of ATF6Î± in UGGT knockout cells' stress response. The authors further investigate the physiological consequences of accelerated ATF6Î± degradation, convincingly demonstrating that cells are sensitive to ER stress in the absence of UGGTs and unable to mount an adequate ER stress response.</p>
<p>These findings offer significant new insights into the ERAD field, highlighting UGGT1 as a crucial component in maintaining ER protein homeostasis. This represents a major advancement in our understanding of the field.</p>

<p>This valuable manuscript demonstrates the long-held prediction that the glycosyltransferase UGGT slows degradation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation substrates through a mechanism involving re-glucosylation of asparagine-linked glycans following release from the calnexin/calreticulin lectins. The evidence supporting this conclusion is solid using genetically-deficient cell models and well established biochemical methods to monitor the degradation of trafficking-incompetent ER-associated degradation substrates, although this could be improved by better defining of the importance of UGGT in the secretion of trafficking competent substrates. This work will be of specific interest to those interested in mechanistic aspects of ER protein quality control and protein secretion.</p>
<p>The authors have attempted to address my comments from the previous round of review, although some issues still remain. For example, the authors indicate that it is difficult to assess how UGGT1 influences degradation of secretion competent proteins, but this is not the case. This can be easily followed using metabolic labeling experiments, where you would get both the population of protein secreted and degraded under different conditions. Thus, I still feel that addressing the impact of UGGT1 depletion on the ER quality control for secretion competent protein remains an important point that could be better addressed in this work.</p>
<p>Further, in the previous submission, the authors showed that UGGT2 depletion demonstrates a similar reduction of ATF6 activation to that observed for UGGT1 depletion, although UGGT2 depletion does not reduce ATF6 protein levels like what is observed upon UGGT1 depletion. In the revised manuscript, they largely remove the UGGT2 data and only highlight the UGGT1 depletion data. While they are somewhat careful in their discussion, the implication is that UGGT1 regulates ATF6 activity by controlling its stability. The fact that UGGT2 has a similar effect on activity, but not stability, indicates that these enzymes may have other roles not directly linked to ATF6 stability. It is important to include the UGGT2 data and explicitly highlight this point in the discussion. Its fine to state that figuring out this other function is outside the scope of this work but removing it does not seem appropriate.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my previous review, I think that this work is interesting and addresses an important gap in experimental evidence supporting a previously asserted dogma in the field. I do think that the authors would be better suited for highlighting the limitations of the study, as discussed above. Ultimately, though, this is an important addition to the literature.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>UGGTs are involved in the prevention of premature degradation for misfolded glycoproteins, by utilizing UGGT-KO cells and a number of different ERAD substrates. They proposed a concept by which the fate of glycoproteins can be determined by a tug-of-war between UGGTs and EDEMs.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Less clear, though, is the involvement of UGGT2 in the process. Also, to this reviewer, some data do not necessarily support the conclusion.</p>
<p>Major criticisms:</p>
<p>(1) One of the biggest problems I had on reading through this manuscript is that, while the authors appeared to generate UGGTs-KO cells from HCT116 and HeLa cells, it was not clearly indicated which cell line was used for each experiment. I assume that it was HCT116 cells in most cases, but I did not see that it was clearly mentioned. As the expression level of UGGT2 relative to UGGT1 is quite different between the two cell lines, it would be critical to know which cells were used for each experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. We have clarified this point, especially in the figure legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While most of the authors' conclusion is sound, some claims, to this reviewer, were not fully supported by the data. Especially I cannot help being puzzled by the authors' claim about the involvement of UGGT2 in the ERAD process. In most of the cases, KO of UGGT2 does not seem to affect the stability of ERAD substrates (ex. Fig. 1C, 2A, 3D). When the author suggests that UGGT2 is also involved in the ERAD, it is far from convincing (ex. Fig. 2D/E). Especially because now it has been suggested that the main role of UGGT2 may be distinct from UGGT1, playing a role in lipid quality control (Hung, et al., PNAS 2022), it is imperative to provide convincing evidence if the authors want to claim the involvement of UGGT2 in a protein quality control system. In fact, it was not clear at all whether even UGGT1 is also involved in the process in Fig. 2D/E, as the difference, if any, is so subtle. How the authors can be sure that this is significant enough? While the authors claim that the difference is statistically significant (n=3), this may end up with experimental artifacts. To say the least, I would urge the authors to try rescue experiments with UGGT1 or 2, to clarify that the defect in UGGT-DKO cells can be reversed. It may also be interesting to see that the subtle difference the authors observed is indeed N-glycan-dependent by testing a non-glycosylated version of the protein (just like NHK-QQQ mutants in Fig. 2C).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment. According to this comment, we reevaluated the importance of UGGT2 for ER-protein quality control. As this reviewer mentioned, KO of UGGT2 does not affect the stability of ATF6a, NHK, rRI332-Flag or EMC1-â³PQQ-Flag (Fig. 1E, 2A, and 3DE). Furthermore, we tested whether overexpression of UGGT2 reverses the phenotype of UGGT-DKO regarding the degradation rate of NHK, and we found that it did not affect the degradation rate of NHK, whereas overexpression of UGGT1 restored the degradation rate to that in WT cells.</p>

</fig>
<p>Collectively, these facts suggest that the role of UGGT2 in ER protein quality control is rather limited in HCT116 cells. Therefore, we have decided not to mention UGGT2 in the title, and weakened the overall claim that UGGT2 contributes to ER protein quality control. Tissues with high expression of UGGT2 or cultured cells other than HCT116 would be appropriate for revealing the detailed function of UGGT2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To this reviewer, it is still possible that the involvement of UGGT1 (or 2, if any) could be totally substrate-dependent, and the substrates used in Fig 2D or E happen not to be dependent to the action of UGGTs. To the reviewer, without the data of Fig. 2D and E the authors provide enough evidence to demonstrate the involvement of UGGT1 in preventing premature degradation of glycoprotein ERAD substrates. I am just afraid that the authors may have overinterpreted the data, as if the UGGTs are involved in stabilization of all glycoproteins destined for ERAD.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on the point this reviewer mentioned, we decided to delete previous Fig. 2D and 2E. There may be more or less efficacy of UGGT1 for preventing early degradation of substrates.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) I am a bit puzzled by the DNJ treatment experiments. First, I do not see the detailed conditions of the DNJ treatment (concentration? Time?). Then, I was a bit surprised to see that there were so little G3M9 glycans formed, and there was about the same amount of G2M9 also formed (Figure 1 Figure supplement 4B-D), despite the fact that glucose trimming of newly syntheized glycoproteins are expected to be completely impaired (unless the authors used DNJ concentration which does not completely impair the trimming of the first Glc). Even considering the involvement of Golgi endo-alpha-mannosidase, a similar amount of G3M9 and G2M9 may suggest that the experimental conditions used for this experiment (i.e. concentration of DNJ, duration of treatment, etc) is not properly optimized.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think that our experimental condition of DNJ treatment is appropriate to evaluate the effect of DNJ. Referring to the other papers (Ali and Field, 2000; Karlsson et al., 1993; Lomako et al., 2010; Pearse et al., 2010; Tannous et al., 2015), 0.5 mM DNJ is appropriate. In our previously reported experiment, 16 h treatment with kifunensine mannosidase inhibitor was sufficient for N-glycan composition analysis prior to cell collection (Ninagawa et al., 2014), and we treated cells for a similar time in Figure 1-Figure Supplement 4 and 5 (and Figure 1-Figure Supplement 6). We could see the clear effect of DNJ to inhibit degradation of ATF6a with 2 hours of pretreatment (Fig. 1G). Furthermore, our results are very reasonable and consistent with previous findings that DNJ increased GM9 the most (Cheatham et al., 2023; Gross et al., 1983; Gross et al., 1986; Romero et al., 1985). In addition to DNJ, we used CST for further experiments in new figures (Fig. 1H and Figure 1-Figure supplement 6). DNJ and CST are inhibitors of glucosidase; DNJ is a stronger inhibitor of glucosidase II, while CST is a stronger inhibitor of glucosidase I (Asano, 2000; Saunier et al., 1982; Szumilo et al., 1987; Zeng et al., 1997). An increase in G3M9 and G2M9 was detected using CST (Figure1-Figure Supplement 6). Like DNJ, CST also inhibited ATF6a degradation in UGGT-DKO cells (Fig. 1H). These findings show that our experimental condition using glucosidase inhibitor is appropriate and strongly support our model (Fig. 5). Differences between the effects of DNJ and CST are now described in our manuscript pages 8 to 10.</p>

<p>While this study convincingly demonstrates early degradation of misfolded glycoproteins in the absence of UGGTs, my major concern is the need for additional experiments to support the &quot;tug of war&quot; model involving UGGTs and EDEMs in influencing the substrate's fate - whether misfolded glycoproteins are pulled into the folding or degradation route. Specifically, it would be valuable to investigate how overexpression of UGGTs and EDEMs in WT cells affects the choice between folding and degradation for misfolded glycoproteins. Considering previous studies indicating that monoglucosylation influences glycoprotein solubility and stability, an essential question is: what is the nature of glycoproteins in UGGTKO/EDEMKO and potentially UGGT/EDEM overexpression cells? Understanding whether these substrates become more soluble/stable when GM9 versus mannose-only translation modification accumulates would provide valuable insights.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the new figure 2DE, we conducted overexpression experiments of structure formation factors UGGT1 and/or CNX, and degradation factors EDEMs. While overexpression of structure formation factors (Fig. 2DE) and KO of degradation factors (Ninagawa et al., 2015; Ninagawa et al., 2014) increased stability of substrates, KO of UGGT1 (Fig. 1E, 2A and 3DF) and overexpression of degradation factors (Fig. 2DE) (Hirao et al., 2006; Hosokawa et al., 2001; Mast et al., 2005; Olivari et al., 2005) accelerated degradation of substrates. A comparison of the properties of N-glycan with the normal type and the type without glucoses was already reported (Tannous et al., 2015). The rate of degradation of substrate was unchanged, but efficiency of secretion of substrates was affected.</p>

<p>The study delves into the physiological role of UGGT, but is limited in scope, focusing solely on the effect of ATF6alpha in UGGT KO cells' stress response. It is crucial for the authors to investigate the broader impact of UGGT KO, including the assessment of basal ER proteotoxicity levels, examination of the general efflux of glycoproteins from ER, and the exploration of the physiological consequences due to UGGT KO. This broader perspective would be valuable for the wider audience. Additionally, the marked increase in ATF4 activity in UGGTKO requires discussion, which the authors currently omit.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We evaluated the sensitivity of WT and UGGT1-KO cells to ER stress (Figure 4G). KO of UGGT1 increased the sensitivity to ER stress inducer Tg, indicating the importance of UGGT1 for resisting ER stress.</p>
<p>We add the following description in the manuscript about ATF4 activity in UGGT1-KO: âIn addition to this, UGGT1 is necessary for proper functioning of ER resident proteins such as ATF6a (Fig. 4B-F). It is highly possible that ATF6a undergoes structural maintenance by UGGT1, which could be necessary to avoid degradation and maintain proper function, because ATF6a with more rigid in structure tended to remain in UGGT1-KO cells (Fig. 4C). Responses of ERSE and UPRE to ER stress, which require ATF6a, were decreased in UGGT1-KO cells (Fig. 4DE). In contrast, ATF4 reporter activity was increased in UGGT1-KO cells (Fig. 4F), while the basal level of ATF4 in UGGT1-KO cells was comparable with that in WT (Figure 1-Figure supplement 2B). The ATF4 pathway might partially compensate the function of the ERSE and UPRE pathways in UGGT1-KO cells in acute ER stress. This is now described on Page 17 in our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The discussion section is brief and could benefit from being a separate section. It is advisable for the authors to explore and suggest other model systems or disease contexts to test UGGT's role in the future. This expansion would help the broader scientific community appreciate the potential applications and implications of this work beyond its current scope.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for making this point. The DISCUSSION part has now been separated in our manuscript. We added some points in the manuscript about other model organisms and diseases in the DISCUSSION as follows: â Our work focusing on the function of mammalian UGGT1 greatly advances the understanding how ER homeostasis is maintained in higher animals. Considering that <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> does not have a functional orthologue of UGGT1 (Ninagawa et al., 2020a) and that KO of UGGT1 causes embryonic lethality in mice (Molinari et al., 2005), it would be interesting to know at what point the function of UGGT1 became evolutionarily necessary for life. Related to its importance in animals, it would also be of interest to know what kind of diseases UGGT1 is associated with. Recently, it has been reported that UGGT1 is involved in ER retention of Trop-2 mutant proteins, which are encoded by a causative gene of gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy (Tax et al., 2024). Not only this, but since the ER is known to be involved in over 60 diseases (Guerriero and Brodsky, 2012), we must investigate how UGGT1 and other ER molecules are involved in diseases.â</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript focuses on defining the importance of UGGT1/2 in the process of protein degradation within the ER. The authors prepared cells lacking UGGT1, UGGT2, or both UGGT1/UGGT2 (DKO) HCT116 cells and then monitored the degradation of specific ERAD substrates. Initially, they focused on the ER stress sensor ATF6 and showed that loss of UGGT1 increased the degradation of this protein. This degradation was stabilized by deletion of ERAD-specific factors (e.g., SEL1L, EDEM) or treatment with mannose inhibitors such as kifunesine, indicating that this is mediated through a process involving increased mannose trimming of the ATF6 N-glycan. This increased degradation of ATF6 impaired the function of this ER stress sensor, as expected, reducing the activation of downstream reporters of ER stress-induced ATF6 activation. The authors extended this analysis to monitor the degradation of other well-established ERAD substrates including A1AT-NHK and CD3d, demonstrating similar increases in the degradation of destabilized, misfolding protein substrates in cells deficient in UGGT. Importantly, they did experiments to suggest that re-overexpression of wild-type, but not catalytically deficient, UGGT rescues the increased degradation observed in UGGT1 knockout cells. Further, they demonstrated the dependence of this sensitivity to UGGT depletion on N-glycans using ERAD substrates that lack any glycans. Ultimately, these results suggest a model whereby depletion of UGGT (especially UGGT1 which is the most expressed in these cells) increases degradation of ERAD substrates through a mechanism involving impaired re-glucosylation and subsequent re-entry into the calnexin/calreticulin folding pathway.</p>
<p>I must say that I was under the impression that the main conclusions of this paper (i.e., UGGT1 functions to slow the degradation of ERAD substrates by allowing re-entry into the lectin folding pathway) were well-established in the literature. However, I was not able to find papers explicitly demonstrating this point. Because of this, I do think that this manuscript is valuable, as it supports a previously assumed assertion of the role of UGGT in ER quality control. However, there are a number of issues in the manuscript that should be addressed.</p>
<p>Notably, the focus on well-established, trafficking-deficient ERAD substrates, while a traditional approach to studying these types of processes, limits our understanding of global ER quality control of proteins that are trafficked to downstream secretory environments where proteins can be degraded through multiple mechanisms. For example, in Figure 1-Figure Supplement 2, UGGT1/2 knockout does not seem to increase the degradation of secretion-competent proteins such as A1AT or EPO, instead appearing to stabilize these proteins against degradation. They do show reductions in secretion, but it isn't clear exactly how UGGT loss is impacting ER Quality Control of these more relevant types of ER-targeted secretory proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your comment. It is certainly difficult to assess in detail how UGGT1 functions against secretion-competent proteins, but we think that the folding state of these proteins is improved, which avoids their degradation and increases their secretion. In Figure 1-Figure supplement 2E, there is a clear decrease in secretion of EPO in UGGT1-KO cells, suggesting that UGGT1 also inhibits degradation of such substrates. Note that, as shown in Fig. 3A-C, once a protein forms a solid structure, it is rarely degraded in the ER.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lastly, I don't understand the link between UGGT, ATF6 degradation, and ATF6 activation. I understand that the idea is that increased ATF6 degradation afforded by UGGT depletion will impair activation of this ER stress sensor, but if that is the case, how does UGGT2 depletion, which only minimally impacts ATF6 degradation (Fig. 1), impact activation to levels similar to the UGGT1 knockout (Fig 4)? This suggests UGGT1/2 may serve different functions beyond just regulating the degradation of this ER stress sensor. Also, the authors should quantify the impaired ATF6 processing shown in Fig 4B-D across multiple replicates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to this valuable comment, we reevaluated our manuscript. As this reviewer mentioned, involvement of UGGT2 in the activation of ATF6a cannot be explained only by the folding state of ATF6a. Thus, the part about whether UGGT2 is effective in activating ATF6 is outside the scope of this paper. The main focus of this paper is the contribution of UGGT1 to the ER protein quality control mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Ultimately, I do think the data support a role for UGGT (especially UGGT1) in regulating the degradation of ERAD substrates, which provides experimental support for a role long-predicted in the field. However, there are a number of ways this manuscript could be strengthened to further support this role, some of which can be done with data they have in hand (e.g., the stats) or additional new experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this revision period, to further elucidate the function of UGGT, we did several additional experiments (new figures Fig. 1H, 2DE, 4G and, Figure 1-Figure Supplement 6). We hope that these will bring our papers up to the level you have requested.</p>

<p>(4) Figure 1F - the authors claimed that maturation of HA was delayed also in UGGT2 cells, but it was not at all clear to me. Rescue experiments with UGGT2 would be desired.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this reviewer, but there was a statistically significant difference in the 80 min UGGT2-KO strain. Previously, it was reported that HA maturation rate was not affected by UGGT2 (Hung et al., 2022). We think that the difference is not large. A rescue experiment of UGGT2 on the degradation of NHK was conducted, and is shown in this response to referees.</p>

The difference in susceptibility against trypsin appears very subtle anyway (Figure 4 Figure Supplement 1).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Let us add our thoughts here: Poorly structured ATF6a is immediately routed for degradation in UGGT1-KO cells. As a result, ATF6a with a stable or rigid structure have remained in the UGGT1-KO strain. ATF6a with a metastable state is tended to be degraded without assistance of UGGT1.</p>

<p>(1) The effect in Fig. 2B with UGGT1-D1358A add-back is minimal. Testing the inactive and active add-back on other substrates, such as ATF6alpha, which undergoes a more rapid degradation, would provide a more comprehensive assessment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To examine the effect of full length and inactive mutant of UGGT1 in UGGT1-KO and UGGT2-KO on the rate of degradation of endogenous ATF6a, we tried to select more than 300 colonies stably expressing full-length Myc-UGGT1/2, UGGT1/2-Flag, and UGGT1/2 (no tag), and their point mutant of them. However, no cell lines expressing nearly as much or more UGGT1/2 than endogenous ones were obtained. The expression level of UGGT1 seemed to be tightly regulated. A low-expressing stable cell line could not recover the phenotype of ATF6a degradation.</p>
<p>We also tried to measure the degradation rate of exogenously expressed ATF6a. But overexpressed ATF6a is partially transported to the Golgi and cleaved by proteases, which makes it difficult to evaluate only the effect of degradation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In reference to this statement on pg. 11:</p>
<p>&quot;This can be explained by the rigid structure of ATF6(P) lacking structural flexibility to respond to ER stress because the remaining ATF6(P) in UGGT1-KO cells tends to have a more rigid structure that averts degradation, which is supported by its slightly weaker sensitivity to trypsin (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A). &quot;</p>
<p>The rationale for testing ATF6(P) rigidity via trypsin digestion needs clarification. The authors should provide more background, especially if it relates to previous studies demonstrating UGGT's influence on substrate solubility. If trypsin digestion is indeed addressing this, it should be applied consistently to all tested misfolded glycoproteins, ensuring a comprehensive approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provide more background with three references about trypsin digestion. Trypsin digestion allows us to evaluate the structure of proteins originated from the same gene, but it can sometimes be difficult to comparatively evaluate the structure of proteins originated from different genes. For example, antitrypsin is resistant to trypsin by its nature, which does not necessarily mean that antitrypsin forms a more stable structure than other proteins. NHK, a truncated version of antitrypsin, is still resistant to trypsin compared with other substrates.</p>
