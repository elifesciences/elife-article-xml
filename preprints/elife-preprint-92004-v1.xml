<title>Abstract</title><p>Despite recent progress, the complex roles played by the extracellular matrix in development and disease are still far from being fully understood. Here, we took advantage of the zebrafish <italic>sly</italic> mutation which affects Laminin γ1, a major component of basement membranes, to explore its role in the development of the olfactory system. Following a detailed characterisation of Laminin distribution in the developing olfactory circuit, we analysed basement membrane integrity, olfactory placode and brain morphogenesis, and olfactory axon development in <italic>sly</italic> mutants, using a combination of immunochemistry, electron microscopy and quantitative live imaging of cell movements and axon behaviours. Our results point to an original and dual contribution of Laminin γ1-dependent basement membranes in organising the border between the olfactory placode and the adjacent brain: they maintain placode shape and position in the face of major brain morphogenetic movements, they establish a robust physical barrier between the two tissues while at the same time allowing the local entry of the sensory axons into the brain and their navigation towards the olfactory bulb. This work thus identifies key roles of Laminin γ1-dependent basement membranes in neuronal tissue morphogenesis and axon development <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a network of glycoproteins which provides support to tissues by contributing to mechanical and chemical signals regulating their biology. It regulates multiple processes, including cell migration, survival/proliferation, differentiation and polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Walma and Yamada, 2020</xref>). In addition to the fundamental role of ECM in development and homeostasis, mutations in matrix genes lead to a variety of genetic disorders, and abnormal ECM remodelling drives disease progression in fibrosis, neurological disorders and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Karamanos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Soleman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Theocharis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Yamada et al., 2022</xref>). ECM components are also critical factors in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kaur et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kim et al., 2021</xref>), and thus represent valuable targets but also key players in a plethora of therapeutic applications.</p>
<p>The ECM can influence development and disease in many ways, and despite recent advances, the full complexity of ECM functions is far from being understood. This partly comes from the lack of tools to investigate ECM roles <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, loss-of-function of ECM components often leads to embryonic lethal phenotypes, for instance during implantation and gastrulation in mice (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Miner and Yurchenco, 2004</xref>), precluding the analysis of ECM functions at later stages of development.</p>
<p>Laminins are major components of the basement membrane (BM), a layer of ECM lying on the basal side of epithelia, which is essential for their development and homeostasis. Laminins are crucial to initiate BM assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Miner and Yurchenco, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Urbano et al., 2009</xref>). They are α/β/γ heterotrimers, with Laminin 111 believed to be the predominant isoform during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Miner and Yurchenco, 2004</xref>). The zebrafish <italic>sly<sup>wi390</sup></italic> (<italic>sleepy/lamc1</italic>) mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wiellette et al., 2004</xref>) affects Laminin γ1, present in 10 out of 18 isoforms. <italic>sly</italic> homozygous mutants exhibit defects in notochord, blood vessel and somite morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dolez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Odenthal et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Parsons et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pollard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Stemple et al., 1996</xref>). Maternal or residual expression of the γ1 chain until around 12 hpf (hours-post-fertilisation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dolez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Parsons et al., 2002</xref>) likely allows <italic>sly</italic> mutants to develop until 48-72 hpf, thus providing an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting to examine later functions of this ECM component.</p>
<p>In this study, we took advantage of the <italic>sly</italic> mutant to investigate the role of Laminin γ1 in the development of the zebrafish olfactory system, which forms through the growth of the axons from the olfactory placode (OP) to the olfactory bulb in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Miyasaka et al., 2007</xref>) in the context of morphogenetic movements shaping the OP and nearby tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aguillon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Breau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hauptmann and Gerster, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Monnot et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ross et al., 1992</xref>). Laminin-rich BMs are known to surround the developing OPs and adjacent brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Torres-Paz and Whitlock, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Torres-Paz et al., 2021</xref>), but their function in the construction of the olfactory system remains uncharacterised.</p>
<p>Laminin stimulates neurite outgrowth for many types of neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Powell and Kleinman, 1997</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, in the developing nervous system, Laminin is important for neuro-epithelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bryan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ivanovitch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sidhaye and Norden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tsuda et al., 2010</xref>), neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Belvindrah et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Grant and Moens, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sittaramane et al., 2009</xref>) and multiple aspects of axonal development including axon emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Moore et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Randlett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wolman et al., 2008</xref>), growth, and pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bonner and O’Connor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">García-Alonso et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Karlstrom et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Paulus and Halloran, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we provide a detailed characterisation of Laminin expression during the construction of the zebrafish olfactory system, in fixed and live embryos. We then use the <italic>sly</italic> mutant, combined with live imaging to quantify cell/tissue movements and axon behaviours, to investigate Laminin γ1 functions in neuronal tissue morphogenesis and axon development <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that Laminin γ1-dependent BMs are instrumental to maintain proper OP morphology and position, to define the boundary between the OP and the brain and to allow the growth and pathfinding of the axons towards the olfactory bulb.</p>

<title>The developing OP and brain tissues are surrounded by Laminin-containing BMs</title>
<p>We first analysed Laminin distribution during early OP morphogenesis. Between 14 and 22 hpf, in a process referred to as OP coalescence, cell movements transform the elongated OP domains into two rounded placodal structures on each side of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Whitlock and Westerfield, 2000</xref>). This occurs through two cell movements: first, cell bodies from the anteroposterior extremities of the OP domain converge towards the OP centre. OP cell bodies then move laterally, away from the brain, while their trailing axons remain attached to the brain and grow through retrograde extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aguillon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Breau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Monnot et al., 2022</xref>). During OP coalescence, cells in the adjacent brain undergo a directional anterior movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Breau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Monnot et al., 2022</xref>). To analyse Laminin expression at these stages, we performed immunostainings with a Laminin 111 polyclonal antibody on <italic>Tg(neurog1:GFP)</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blader et al., 2003</xref>), in which the early-born OP neurons and a subpopulation of forebrain cells are labelled with GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aguillon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Breau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Madelaine et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Torres-Paz and Whitlock, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Torres-Paz et al., 2021</xref>), we first noticed the appearance of a continuous Laminin-rich BM surrounding the brain from 14-18 hpf, while around the OP, only discrete Laminin spots were detected at this stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, A’</xref>). By contrast, at the end of coalescence (22 hpf), two distinct BMs were clearly visible, one around the brain and the other one partially enveloping the OP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, B’</xref>), suggesting that the Laminin-rich BM of the OP assembles between 18 and 22 hpf, during the late phase of OP coalescence.</p>

<p>To further analyse the dynamics of Laminin γ1 expression and BM assembly during OP coalescence, we took advantage of the <italic>TgBAC(lamC1:lamC1-sfGFP)</italic> line, in which Laminin γ1 is tagged with superfolder GFP and expressed under the control of its own promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Yamaguchi et al., 2022</xref>). To co-label OP cells, we used the <italic>Tg(cldnb:Gal4; UAS:RFP)</italic> line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Breau et al., 2013</xref>), which expresses RFP in OP cells and in the periderm from around 16 hpf. RFP expression is initially weak and mosaic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) and becomes progressively stronger and widespread in the OP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Using confocal live imaging (n = 4 imaged embryos, 2 independent experiments), we confirmed the progressive BM-like accumulation of LamC1-sfGFP around the OP, with a gradual increase of the BM fluorescence during OP coalescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F’</xref> and Movie 1). From 14 hpf, mesenchymal cells exhibiting cytoplasmic Laminin-sfGFP were seen to migrate anteriorly around the OP (Movie 1). According to the literature, these cells could represent neural crest cells (NCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bryan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Torres-Paz and Whitlock, 2014</xref>) and/or mesodermally-derived cells of the periocular mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Vöcking et al., 2023</xref>). A subset of RFP+ OP cells also displayed cytoplasmic Laminin-sfGFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-H’</xref> and Movie 1). Altogether, these live imaging experiments suggest that Laminin γ1 around the OP is deposited mostly during late coalescence stages, from at least a subset of OP cells and surrounding mesenchymal cells. Telencephalic cells also exhibited cytoplasmic Laminin-sfGFP expression throughout OP coalescence (Movie 2), suggesting that the forebrain contributes to the deposition of its own Laminin γ1-containing BM at these stages.</p>
<p>To analyse whether the BMs of the brain and OP tissues are maintained at later stages, we used Laminin immunostaining on <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP</italic>) embryos, in which a subpopulation of OP neurons is labelled from 22-24 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyasaka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Miyasaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sato et al., 2007</xref>), and confocal live imaging with the LamC1-sfGFP reporter line. Using both approaches we observed a strong, continuous BM-like signal enveloping the brain and the OP at these stages, except (i) where the olfactory axons leave the OP and enter the brain (defined respectively as the exit and entry points, see below) and, as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baraban et al., 2023</xref>), (ii) above of the neuronal rosette assembling in the dorso-lateral OP, where the nostril orifice opens in the skin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D’, 1G-J</xref>). Thus, the OP and adjacent brain tissues are ensheated by BMs from early stages of olfactory system assembly (as depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>), suggesting these BMs could play a role in their morphogenesis or the maintenance of their shape during development.</p>

<title>Laminin distribution suggests a role in olfactory axon development</title>
<p>It has been proposed that the zebrafish OP contains a transient population of pioneer neurons in the ventro-medial region of the OP: their axons are the first to grow out of the OP at 22-24 hpf, and ablation experiments suggest that they act as a scaffold for the growth of the axons of the later born olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), located in the dorso-lateral rosette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Whitlock and Westerfield, 1998</xref>). To investigate the distribution of Laminin in relation with axonal development, we used the <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP</italic>) line to visualise olfactory axons, including pioneer axons and axons from the ciliated OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyasaka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Miyasaka et al., 2007</xref>). Previous time-course studies using this line showed that following OP coalescence, the YFP+ axons leave the OP from 22-24 hpf through a restricted region in the ventro-medial OP (the exit point), grow dorsally as a fasciculated bundle until around 32 hpf, then start defasciculating in the presumptive olfactory bulb region in the brain (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Breau and Trembleau, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyasaka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Miyasaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sato et al., 2007</xref>). Immunostaining for Laminin 111 revealed local disruptions in the BMs ensheathing the OP and the brain, precisely where the YFP+ axons exit the OP (exit point) and enter the brain (entry point) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D’</xref>). Once into the brain, from around 28 hpf, the most distal extremity of the YFP+ axon bundle was systematically in close contact with the Laminin-labelled BM of the brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D’</xref>), suggesting that the growth cones use it as a substrate to migrate towards the olfactory bulb.</p>
<p>To better understand when and how the gaps of the exit and entry points form in the BMs, we took advantage of our live imaging experiments performed on <italic>TgBAC(lamC1:lamC1-sfGFP); Tg(cldnb:Gal4; UAS:RFP)</italic> embryos. By the end of the coalescence, during the assembly of the BM around the OP, we noticed that small interruptions of the BM were already present near the axon tips, along the ventro-medial wall of the OP (Movie 2). This suggests that the exit point does not open through local perforation of a pre-existing BM around the OP but through incomplete BM synthesis/assembly in this area. The entry point was slightly more dorsal than the exit point (of about 10-20 µm), and the initial dorsal growth of the axons thus occurred between the two BMs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F-H’</xref>). The opening of the entry point through the brain BM was concomitant with the arrival of the RFP+ axons, suggesting that the axons degrade or displace BM components to enter the brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-H’</xref> and Movie 2). Once in the brain, as observed in fixed embryos, the distal tip of the RFP+ axons migrated in close proximity with the brain’s BM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H, I</xref>). Overall our observations indicate that the axons first grow dorsally for a short distance between the BMs of the OP and the brain, and then migrate along the internal side of the brain’s BM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>). We thus hypothesise that the Laminin-rich BMs serve as a migratory path for the axons during their journey from the OP to the olfactory bulb.</p>

<title>The integrity of BMs around the brain and the OP is affected in the <italic>sly</italic> mutant</title>
<p>We used the <italic>sly</italic> mutant to analyse the function of Laminin γ1 in the development of the zebrafish olfactory system. As previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dolez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Parsons et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Stemple et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wiellette et al., 2004</xref>), Laminin 111 BM-like accumulation could not be detected in <italic>sly</italic> <sup>−/−</sup> mutants (referred to as <italic>sly</italic> mutants) at all the analysed stages, from 16 to 36 hpf, while heterozygous <italic>sly</italic> <sup>+/−</sup> embryos displayed an expression pattern that was similar to <italic>sly</italic> <sup>+/+</sup> embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C’</xref>). This indicates that the γ1 chain is required for the assembly of Laminin 111, and that there is likely no residual/maternal Laminin at the onset of OP coalescence. Since Laminins are essential for BM assembly in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lee and Gross, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Miner and Yurchenco, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Smyth et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Urbano et al., 2009</xref>), we further checked the presence and structure of the BMs in <italic>sly</italic> mutants. We carried out immunostaining for two other BM components, Collagen IV and Nidogen, at 22, 28 and 36 hpf. Nidogen was present in BM-like structures around the OP and the brain in control siblings, with a pattern resembling that of Laminin 111, while in <italic>sly</italic> mutants no BM staining could be detected around the two tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-F’</xref>). In controls, Collagen IV was present in the linear BMs around the OP and the brain, and, with a more fibrous distribution, in the mesenchymal tissues surrounding the OP. In <italic>sly</italic> mutants, Collagen IV immunoreactivity was not totally abolished: the BM-like staining was absent, but patches of fibrous expression remained around the OP, at various locations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G-I’</xref>).</p>

<p>We next used electron microscopy (EM) to analyse the ultrastructure of BMs in <italic>sly</italic> mutants and control siblings. We focused on the interface between the forebrain and the OP, where NCC are known to migrate during OP coalescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bryan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Torres-Paz and Whitlock, 2014</xref>). NCC, OP and brain cells could be identified on the large field EM images by their position and morphology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L, L’</xref>). At 24 hpf in controls, the plasma membranes of NCC were separated from those of adjacent OP and brain cells by a 120 nm-wide gap containing electron dense ECM material (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J, M</xref>). This material likely represents the BMs of the two tissues, with morphological features resembling those of BMs found in other tissues of zebrafish embryos at similar stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bryan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Yamaguchi et al., 2022</xref>). In <italic>sly</italic> mutants, almost no NCC could be detected, suggesting that NCC development is affected. In this mutant context, the plasma membranes of OP and brain cells were separated by a 40 nm-wide gap, which was significantly smaller than in controls. This gap was most often devoid of electron dense material (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J, J’, M</xref>). A similar trend was detected at 32 hpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2K, K’, N</xref>). By contrast, the thickness of the intercellular gaps within the OP or the brain was not affected in mutants (Fig. S1). The integrity of the OP and brain BMs is thus strongly affected in <italic>sly</italic> mutants, as previously reported in other tissues of Laminin γ1 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Urbano et al., 2009</xref>; Yamagushi et al., 2022). We next analysed the consequences on the development of the olfactory system components (placode, brain, olfactory axons).</p>

<title>Role of Laminin γ1-dependent BMs in OP coalescence</title>
<p>To study the role of Laminin γ1-dependent BMs in OP coalescence, we first measured the dimensions of the <italic>Tg(neurog1:GFP)</italic>+ OP cell clusters at 22 hpf (end of coalescence) on fixed <italic>sly</italic> mutants and control siblings. While no difference was found for anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) dimensions, the mediolateral (ML) dimension was increased in mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-E</xref>). This could be the consequence of an increased number of GFP+ cells, however no difference was found in the number of mitotic cells in the OPs of <italic>sly</italic> mutants and control siblings at 16 and 21 hpf (Fig. S2A, B, E, F) and, as previously reported in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Parsons et al., 2002</xref>), we observed a tendency for the <italic>sly</italic> mutants to exhibit increased apoptosis (Fig. S2I, J, M, N). The higher ML dimension could also be due to increased lateral movements of OP cell bodies in the absence of the BM surrounding the OP. To test this, we performed live imaging on <italic>sly</italic> mutants and control siblings carrying the <italic>Tg(neurog1:GFP)</italic> transgene, mounted in a dorsal view (n = 5 mutants and n = 5 controls) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-I</xref> and Movie 3). Individual nuclei of GFP+ OP and brain cells were tracked using widespread expression of H2B-RFP, obtained through mRNA injection. From the cell trajectories we extracted the 3D Mean Square Displacements (MSD), a measure of the volume explored by a cell in a given period of time. No significant difference was observed for the MSD of OP cells between controls and <italic>sly</italic> mutants, but the MSD was higher for brain cells in the mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J, K</xref>). Direction wise, surprisingly OP cells did not show any change in their total ML displacement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref>), nor in their DV displacement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M</xref>). Differences, although not statistically significant, could be detected along the AP axis for anterior, central and posterior OP cells: in the mutants the anterior cohort of cells tended to migrate less posteriorly, while central and posterior cells migrated more anteriorly, as if the final cell positions were all shifted towards more anterior locations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3N-P</xref>). In conclusion, while the movements of brain cells are increased in the absence of BMs at coalescence stages, overall the OP cell movements occur with normal parameters and allow the condensation of OPs into compact neuronal clusters in the <italic>sly</italic> mutants. It is possible however that the position of the OP along the AP axis is shifted anteriorly at the end of OP coalescence.</p>

<title>Role of Laminin γ1-dependent BMs during the forebrain flexure</title>
<p>Following OP coalescence, the forebrain flexure, a major morphogenetic process which is essential for the final folded shape of the vertebrate brain, starts to remodel the head tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chapman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Garcia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hauptmann and Gerster, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tropepe and Sive, 2003</xref>). In zebrafish the bending of the forebrain has been reported to occur between 24 and 48 hpf through the observation of fixed samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ross et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hauptmann and Gerster, 2000</xref>). We set out to investigate the role of the brain and OP BMs during the forebrain flexure. The <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP</italic>) transgene expression was used to quantify the dimensions of the YFP+ cluster in the OP at various stages of the flexure (24, 28, 32 and 36 hpf). While no change could be detected in the AP and ML dimensions of the YFP+ cluster, its DV dimension was significantly increased in <italic>sly</italic> mutants at all the analysed stages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-E</xref> and Fig. S3A-L). This higher DV dimension is unlikely to result from an increase in the number of cells, since YFP+ mitotic cells were not more numerous in <italic>sly</italic> mutants (Fig. S2C, D, G, H), and YFP+ OP clusters displayed increased apoptosis, as observed at earlier stages (Fig. S2K, L, O, P). Counting the YFP+ cells on high magnification images of 3 mutant and 3 control OPs at 28 and 36 hpf further confirmed that the YFP+ cell number is unchanged (Fig. S2Q, R). In addition to the DV elongation of the OP tissue, isolated, ectopic (mispositioned) YFP+ cells were observed all around the YFP+ cluster in the <italic>sly</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F-H</xref> and Movie 6). The rosette structure appeared to form normally on the dorso-lateral region of the OP in <italic>sly</italic> mutants (Movie 6).</p>

</fig>
<p>To better understand the origin of these phenotypes, we analysed the dynamic behaviours of brain and OP cells occurring during the forebrain flexure, which had not been characterised so far. We carried out live imaging from 22 to 40 hpf on <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP</italic>) <italic>sly</italic> mutants and control siblings injected with H2B-RFP mRNA to label all nuclei, and tracked YFP+ OP cells and adjacent brain cells (n = 4 mutants and n = 4 controls) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I-L</xref> and Movie 4). From 24-26 hpf we observed a marked anterior and ventral departure of brain cells in control embryos, representing the onset of the flexure movement. Strikingly, OP cells also moved anteriorly and ventrally from these stages, in coordination with the brain, revealing that the OPs are also subjected to the flexure movement (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref> and Fig. S3M). The flexure movements were also visible in the brain and OPs of <italic>sly</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref> and Fig. S3N), with OP cells moving with a higher MSD than in controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>). A similar trend was observed for brain cells, but was not statistically significant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref>). Moreover, upon visualisation of the cell trajectories in a lateral (YZ) view, we noticed that in 4/4 mutant embryos, brain and OP cells exhibited curved trajectories, moving first anteriorly and ventrally, then turning posteriorly, while this phenomenon occurred in only 1/4 control sibling during the duration of our movies (Fig. S3M, N). This reinforces the idea that brain and OP cells are subjected to an accelerated or enhanced forebrain flexure remodelling in the <italic>sly</italic> mutants, and suggests that in the wild type situation the BMs allow the tissues, and in particular the OP, to resist to the morphogenetic movements associated with the flexure. Altogether, our findings show that the Laminin γ1-containing BMs are required to prevent OP cell scattering, maintain OP shape and dampen OP cell movements during the forebrain flexure.</p>

<title>Laminin γ1-dependent BMs are required to define a robust boundary between the OP and the brain</title>
<p>OP cells undergo anterior and ventral movements during the forebrain flexure. We noticed that, while in control siblings OP cells also display a lateral displacement, they rather move in the medial direction in <italic>sly</italic> mutants, towards the brain, as if the two OPs were progressively converging towards each other (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J, L, O</xref>). This prompted us to image OP and brain tissues in 3D to visualise the boundary between the two tissues and analyse the width of the brain. To do so, we first performed immunostainings at 28 and 36 hpf for the pan-neuronal marker HuC to visualise neurons in the OP and brain on <italic>Tg(cldnb:Gal4; UAS:RFP)</italic> embryos, in which RFP is expressed in the OP. Qualitative observations of these z-stacks revealed that OPs in <italic>sly</italic> mutants are partially embedded within the brain tissue and display a curved and irregular boundary with the brain, while the frontier between the two tissues appears as a straight line in control siblings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, A’</xref>, Fig. S4A, A’ and Movie 5). To quantify the width of the brain, we used the <italic>Tg(eltC:GFP)</italic> line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Stedman et al., 2009</xref>), which expresses GFP in forebrain cells, and crossed it with the <italic>Tg(cldnb:Gal4; UAS:RFP)</italic> line to label the OPs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, B’</xref> and Fig. S4B, B’). We measured the width of the forebrain in 3 distincts AP levels and 3 distinct DV levels in between the two OPs (as depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, B’</xref> and Fig. S4B, B’ for the DV levels). The width of the forebrain in <italic>sly</italic> mutants was smaller than in controls, in particular in anterior and dorsal areas (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-D</xref> and Fig. S4B-D). Proliferation was unchanged in the brain of <italic>sly</italic> mutants, while apoptosis was only sligtly increased (Fig. S4E-L), suggesting that the smaller brain width is due to a local distorsion of the tissue rather than a decreased number of cells. Next, we quantitatively analysed the straightness of the brain/OP boundary. Note that the <italic>Tg(eltC:GFP)</italic> line could not be used for that purpose because a few cells in the OP also express the transgene. In addition, <italic>Tg(cldnb:Gal4; UAS:RFP)</italic> expression is mosaic in the OP, preventing the use of this line to assess the shape of the brain/OP boundary. To perform such a quantification we thus turned to immunostainings for Dlx3b, a transcription factor specifically expressed in OP (and skin) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Torres-Paz and Whitlock, 2014</xref>). We used deep learning to segment the 3D z-stacks of Dlx3b-immunostaining in control and <italic>sly</italic> mutant embryos at 36 hpf (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E-F’</xref>), and quantified the distortion of the OP/brain frontier at various z levels. This analysis demonstrated that the OP/brain boundary is less defined in <italic>sly</italic> mutants as compared with controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G, H</xref>). Thus, our analyses of cell tracks, brain size and proliferation/apoptosis, and of the shape of the brain/OP boundary suggest that the forebrain is smaller and distorted in <italic>sly</italic> mutants due to the inward convergence of the two OPs. These findings reveal that the Laminin γ1-dependent BMs serve to establish a straight brain/OP boundary preventing local intermixing and the late convergence of the two OPs towards each other during the flexure movement.</p>

<p>The growth of the olfactory axons starts with the retrograde axon extension of their proximal portions during OP coalescence, from 14 to 22 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Breau et al., 2017</xref>), followed by the dorsal growth from the brain/OP boundary to the olfactory bulb from 22 to 32 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>). Laminin has been reported to orient the emergence of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Randlett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Moore et al., 2022</xref>). Do the Laminin γ1-dependent BMs play any role in axon emergence or anchoring during retrograde axon extension? On fixed <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP</italic>) <italic>sly</italic> mutants at 24 hpf, numerous YFP+ neurons had their proximal axonal portion formed and attached to the brain surface (Fig. S5A-D), suggesting that retrograde axon extension occurs normally for at least some of the YFP+ OP neurons. Thus, the presence of a BM around the OP and/or the brain appears not to be an absolute requirement for the attachment of axon tips to the ventro-medial wall of the OP during retrograde extension.</p>
<p>Are Laminin γ1-dependent BMs important for the growth or navigation of the axons from the brain/OP boundary to the olfactory bulb, as suggested by Laminin expression? We first examined the axons in <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP</italic>) embryos at 24, 28, 32 and 36 hpf. In mutant embryos, severe axonal defects were observed. Most YFP+ axonal protrusions were unable to leave the OP and appeared to stall at the OP/brain boundary (Fig. S5E, left column). In some embryos (8-10%), a small proportion of axons managed to reach the presumptive OB region by exiting the OP dorsally, while the axons would normally exit the OP at more ventral positions in the controls (Fig. S5E, left column and Movie 6). In addition, ectopic medial projections were observed in mutant embryos (18 to 30% of the embryos depending on the stage, as compared to 0 to 9% in controls, Fig. S5E, right column), suggesting navigation issues.</p>
<p>So far the growth of the zebrafish olfactory axons from the OP to the bulb has been mostly characterised using fixed samples or live imaging with long time intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dynes and Ngai, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Miyasaka et al., 2007</xref>). To analyse the dynamic behaviour of the axons, we performed live imaging from 22 hpf on <italic>sly</italic> mutant and control embryos injected with the <italic>omp:meYFP</italic> plasmid, in order to obtain a mosaic labelling of the YFP+ neurons and their axons (n = 5 mutants and n = 5 controls, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A, B</xref>). We tracked individual YFP+ growth cones, as well as the YFP+ cell bodies in the OP, during consecutive periods of 200 min each. We substracted the average movement of OP cell bodies from the growth cone tracks, in order to remove the contribution of the global flexure remodelling and analyse specifically the behaviours of the axons with respect to the surrounding cells/tissue. In controls, as expected, growth cones overall showed a dorsal and medial migration, except at the end of the movie, which likely corresponds to their arrival and stalling in the presumptive olfactory bulb. By contrast, growth cones in the <italic>sly</italic> mutants did not display a directional migration towards the bulb (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C, F, I, L</xref>). They were active and explored the environment, as shown by speed and persistence measurements, but moved on short distances and/or without preferential direction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C-N</xref>). These live imaging analyses confirm that the migration of the olfactory axons is drastically impaired in <italic>sly</italic> mutants, showing that Laminin γ1-dependent BMs are essential for the growth and navigation of the axons from the OP to the olfactory bulb.</p>

<title><italic>Sly</italic> mutants display cranial NCC defects but this does not contribute to the late olfactory system phenotypes</title>
<p>Cranial NCC migration is concomitant with OP coalescence. From 14 hpf, they progressively populate the gaps between the OP and the eye and brain tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Torres-Paz and Whitlock, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bryan et al., 2020</xref>). Our electron microscopy observations suggested that NCC are absent at the brain/OP interface of <italic>sly</italic> mutants. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridisation for the pan-NCC marker <italic>crestin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Luo et al., 2001</xref>) revealed that, while a clear NCC cluster can be seen at the brain/OP interface in controls at 32 hpf, <italic>crestin</italic>-labelled NCC are absent from this area in <italic>sly</italic> mutants (Fig. S6A, A’). This confirms that Laminin γ1-dependent BMs are important for NCC migration or survival in this region of the embryo.</p>
<p>To test whether the phenotypes observed in <italic>sly</italic> mutants are linked to this NCC defect, we took advantage of the <italic>foxd3</italic> mutant, in which cranial NCC migration is delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bryan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Monnot et al. 2022</xref>), leading to a loss of <italic>crestin</italic>-labelled NCC at 32 hpf which resembles that of the <italic>sly</italic> mutants (Fig. S6B, B’). Importantly, Laminin expression appeared to be unchanged in <italic>foxd3</italic> mutants (Fig. S6C’, D’ and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Monnot et al., 2022</xref>). We previously showed that this mutant displays a slightly higher (of about 8-10 µm) ML dimension of the OP at the end of coalescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Monnot et al., 2022</xref>) which is similar to what we observed in <italic>sly</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). This suggests that the NCC defect could be the cause of the increased ML dimension in <italic>sly</italic> mutants. We hypothesize that in absence of NCC around the OP at this stage, the OP tissue is less constrained and thus slightly spread along the ML axis. To further investigate the influence of NCC on the development of the olfactory system at later stages, we analysed OP dimensions and the length of the olfactory axon bundle at 28 and 36 hpf, in <italic>foxd3</italic> <sup>−/−</sup> mutants and <italic>foxd3 <sup>+/−</sup></italic> or <italic><sup>+/+</sup></italic> control siblings expressing the <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP</italic>) transgene. No significant difference was observed between controls and <italic>foxd3</italic> <sup>−/−</sup> mutants for these parameters (Fig. S6C-L), suggesting that the late OP morphogenesis and axonal phenotypes of the <italic>sly</italic> mutants are not a consequence of the impairment of NCC development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study highlights key roles of Laminin γ1-dependent BMs in critical aspects of the development of the zebrafish olfactory system, revealed here through the detailed analysis of the Laminin γ1 loss-of-function mutant <italic>sly</italic>. During the late development of the OP, Laminin γ1-dependent BMs turned out to be essential to maintain its shape and proper position, and to establish a robust brain/placode boundary. In addition, Laminin-dependent BMs also appeared to be instrumental to ensure a proper growth and pathfinding of the olfactory axons towards the developing olfactory bulb. In the following paragraphs, we will discuss these new roles assigned to BMs in the context of the development of the zebrafish olfactory system, in light of the literature.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>The BM of the OP acts as a “shell” maintaining its shape and proper position in the face of forebrain flexure movements</title>
<p>Our data document a mild perturbation of cell movements during OP coalescence, which suggests that Laminin γ1-dependent BMs are overall dispensable for the OP to acquire its initial shape. However, our observation that the OP of the <italic>sly</italic> mutant becomes significantly elongated in the DV dimension and is surrounded by ectopic cells during the forebrain flexure provides strong evidence for a role of the BMs in preventing OP deformation and scattering during this major remodelling of the head tissues. We discovered, along our live imaging observations, a joint anterior and ventral movement of the OPs and forebrain during the flexure time period in the control animals, as if the OPs were dragged along in the same antero-ventral movement as the forebrain. We thus propose that the BM of the OP prevents its deformation in response to the mechanical forces generated by the morphogenetic movement of the neighboring brain.</p>
<p>The ability of the placode’s BM to limit the deformation of the OP during this developmental step most probably relies on its stiffness. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg chamber, while Laminin itself has a minor contribution to the BM mechanical properties, Collagen IV, which deposition in the BM depends on Laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Díaz de la Loza et al., 2017</xref>) has a major contribution to these properties, and in particular to its stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Töpfer et al., 2022</xref>). Actually, this BM is characterized by a gradient of stiffness, due to a gradient of Collagen IV, endowing the BM with anisotropic resistance to tissue expansion, allowing egg chamber elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Crest et al., 2017</xref>). Even though the putative loss of mechanical properties leading to OP deformation observed in the <italic>sly</italic> mutant is consecutive of a Laminin loss-of-function, it remains conceivable that it is the Collagen IV, rather than the Laminin itself, which is responsible of these mechanical properties in wild-type animals. This hypothesis, in line with the dramatic disorganization of the Collagen IV pattern observed by immunofluorescence in the <italic>sly</italic> mutant, however requires to be challenged by further investigation.</p>
<p>BMs were for long considered as inert and passive biological material, unable to generate forces by themselves. We now know that their composition is dynamic during morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Díaz de la Loza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Harunaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Khalilgharibi and Mao, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Van De Bor et al., 2021</xref>) and this dynamics has been proposed to generate autonomous stresses, i.e. within the BM itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Loganathan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zamir et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, Serna-Morales et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Serna-Morales et al., 2023</xref>) recently showed that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ventral nerve cord morphogenesis is driven by a sudden increase in ECM-driven surface tension due to exponential assembly of Collagen IV in the BM. Still in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it was recently shown that the elastic ECM enveloping the wing imaginal disc is a form of “active” shell whose anisotropic growth affects the tissue layers upon morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Harmansa et al., 2023</xref>). Whether such mechanisms participate to the control of the OP shape during the brain flexure remains to be addressed, through the analysis of the dynamics of expression of Collagen IV or other components of the BM as well as biomechanical investigations.</p>
<p>A dramatic consequence of the absence of proper OP and brain BMs in the <italic>sly</italic> mutant is the irregular and undefined frontier between the brain and OP, with placodal cells tending to locally intermingle with brain cells, and vice versa, along the OP/brain interface. This highlights a key role of these BMs in establishing a robust and straight boundary between the OP and the brain. Tissue intermixing has also been observed in the pharynx of Laminin mutants in C. elegans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huang et al., 2003</xref>) and in the Xenopus notochord upon loss-of-function of the Dystroglycan, a major Laminin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Buisson et al., 2014</xref>). The absence of a clear boundary between the OP and the brain in the <italic>sly</italic> mutant is accompanied by an apparent distortion of the brain, with notable reduced dimension in its medio-lateral axis. This phenotype, possibly due to the inward migration of the placodes that become partially embedded in the brain, illustrates an additional and unexpected role of the OP and brain BMs, in preventing late convergence of the two placodes towards each other during the flexure movement.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>BMs act as cues participating to the pathfinding of olfactory axons along their journey from the OP to the olfactory bulb</title>
<p>The early development of zebrafish olfactory axons begins with their retrograde extension, involving the attachment of the tips of the axonal protrusions to the brain’s surface, followed by a lateral movement of the OP cell bodies in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Breau et al., 2017</xref>). This initial step appears not to be affected in the <italic>sly</italic> mutant. These results suggest that Laminin-dependent BMs are dispensable for this retrograde axon extension and, more specifically, that Laminin γ1 itself or other components of the BMs are unlikely to play a role in the anchoring of those axon tips onto the brain’s surface, which is a prerequisite for their retrograde extension.</p>
<p>Our study shows that following retrograde elongation in the OP, the axons grow and navigate using bona fide growth cones, assemble a tight axon fascicle which crosses the BM of the OP, turns and migrates dorsally for a short distance between both BMs and thereafter crosses the brain BM to navigate towards the olfactory bulb. In other words, the olfactory axons have to cross two BMs. Our data show that the axons cross the first BM as it is still under construction and contain perforations, thus taking advantage of BM-free small pores to exit the OP and reach the narrow area located between the two BMs. By contrast, the entry point into the brain, across the second BM, opens with the arrival of the axons, suggesting that this opening is achieved by the axons themselves. It will be interesting, in future work, to determine whether the axons locally degrade the BM through the secretion of matrix metalloproteases, or displace the BM with protrusive forces, or use a combination of both mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chang and Chaudhuri, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ihara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nazari et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Yamada et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>As they migrate in the narrow corridor between the OP and brain BMs, olfactory axons remain confined in close proximity to the Laminin-rich BMs. Entering into the brain tissue, olfactory axons migrate collectively within a dynamic bundle growing towards the presumptive olfactory bulb. Importantly, once they have reached the brain tissue, the distalmost tip of this axon bundle still grows in close apposition to the internal surface of the brain’s BM, suggesting that this BM serves as a migratory path promoting the growth of these axons. This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that axon growth and directionality are dramatically impaired in the <italic>sly</italic> mutant, in which only few axons expressing <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP</italic>) can extend properly towards their target area. This phenotype is unlikely to be the result of defects in neuronal differentiation, as demonstrated by HuC immunolabeling and expression of the <italic>Tg(neurog1:GFP)</italic> and <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP</italic>) transgenes, which do not show obvious difference as compared to control animals, but appears to be rather due to axon growth and navigation defects. We did not formally identify the component(s) of the BM involved in this axon extension and pathfinding, but we consider Laminin itself as a good candidate for acting as a privileged substrate the axons, as Laminin does so for other populations of axons in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Paulus and Halloran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Semina et al., 2006</xref>), and has been shown in rodents to favor OSN axon extension <italic>in vitro</italic>, and to be present <italic>in vivo</italic> along the path followed by OSN axons from the olfactory epithelium to the bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kafitz and Greer, 1997</xref>). From a molecular point of view, it has been established on cultured sympathetic neurons that Laminin accelerates the growth of axons through binding to integrins, which favors the formation of F-actin in the growth cone in a microtubule- and Rac1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Grabham et al., 2003</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abe et al. (2021)</xref> further documented another role of Laminin in promoting hippocampal neuron growth cones enhanced progression on stiff substrate, through its interaction with L1, highlighting a new mechanosensitive axon outgrowth mediated by a L1-Laminin clutch mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abe et al., 2021</xref>). Whereas such Laminin-dependent mechanisms are used for guiding olfactory axons in zebrafish remains to be further explored. Other components of the BM, also affected in the <italic>sly</italic> mutant, may be involved as well in the regulation of olfactory axon development. Still in rodents indeed, the characterisation of the expression of ECM proteins along the developing olfactory pathway unraveled a complex interplay between ECM permissive and inhibitory cues expressed in a dynamic way, appearing to restrict axons to the pathway while promoting axon outgrowth within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Shay et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to ECM molecules present in the BMs, guidance cues interacting with these molecules may also be involved in some aspects of the axonal defects observed in the <italic>sly</italic> mutant. For example, while Xenopus retinal axons are repulsed by ephrin-A5 on fibronectin, they are attracted by ephrin-A5 on Laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Weinl et al., 2003</xref>), and Laminin converts netrin-mediated attraction of these axons to repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Höpker et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, whereas slit2 repulses Robo expressing axons of dorsal root ganglia neurons, this repulsive effect is lost in absence of Laminin 111 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al., 2001</xref>). Netrin1a and 1b are expressed in the zebrafish forebrain close to the route of the axons, where they play an attractive role for olfactory axons which express the netrin receptor DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lakhina et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, several ephrin and slits ligands are expressed in the forebrain at stages of axonal growth (zfin.org, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyasaka et al., 2005</xref>). We may thus envisage that the absence of Laminin in the <italic>sly</italic> mutant may change in some way the netrin-, ephrin- or slit-dependent pathfinding of olfactory axons.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings indicate that the boundary between the sensory and central components of the olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Suter and Jaworski, 2019</xref>) is organised by the BMs of the OP and the brain. These BMs are permeable at specific locations to allow the sensory axons to enter the brain and use them as a substrate to grow towards the olfactory bulb, and at the same time they maintain OP shape and position in the face of major morphogenetic movements occuring during the brain flexure, and ensure proper separation of the two tissues by preventing their intermixing.</p>

<title>Image acquisition</title>
<p>For live imaging, embryos were dechorionated manually and mounted at 14 hpf in 0.5% low melting agarose in 1X E3 medium. For movies on <italic>Tg(neurog1:GFP)</italic> embryos at coalescence stages, the embryos were imaged directly after the mounting, using a dorsal view, from 14 to 22 hpf. For movies on <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP)</italic> embryos, the embryos were placed at 33°C just after the mounting, and imaged from 22 hpf with a frontal view. Movies were recorded at 28.5°C on a Leica TCS SP8 MPII upright multiphoton microscope using a 25X (numerical aperture (NA) 0.95) water lens. For fixed embryos, immunostained embryos were mounted in 0.5% low melting agarose in PBS and imaged on a Leica TCS SP5 AOBS upright confocal microscope using a 63X (NA 0.9) water lens or on a Zeiss 980 FAST Airyscan with a 20X (NA 1.0) water lens.</p>
<p>For electron microscopy, the zebrafish embryos were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% PFA in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.2 overnight at 4°C. Samples were washed in 0.1M cacodylate buffer, incubated for 1h in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1M cacodylate buffer, washed with deionized water, incubated 1h in 1% Uranyl Acetate and washed again with deionized water. To facilitate their orientation for sectionning, the zebrafish embryos were embedded in 4% agarose before being dehydrated through graded concentration of ethanol (50-70-95-100%). Samples were pre-embedded with graded concentration of anhydrous acetone and EPON epoxy resin mix (3:1 – 1:1 – 1:3) and embedded with 100% EPON. Finally, the embryos were mounted on silicon flat mold and polymerized at 60°C for 72 h. Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were prepared with an Ultracut ultramicrotome (UCT, Leica microsystems). They were deposited on silicon wafers, and contrasted with 2.5% uranyl acetate and 2% lead citrate. The wafers were stuck on aluminum stubs, plasma-cleaned, and observed at 1.5 kV, with a 30 µm aperture diameter and high current mode, at 2 mm WD, with SE and BSE in column detectors, in high vacuum in a Field-Emission SEM (Gemini 500, Zeiss). Images were automatically acquired with Atlas 5 (Fibics), with a pixel dwell time of 12.8 µs, a line averaging of 5, with a 8192 x 8192 definition and a pixel size fixed at 2.5 nm (corresponding to an image size of 20.5 × 20.5 µm), and an overlap of 16% between images. To obtain final mosaics, LookUp Table were inverted, SE and BSE signals were mixed, and manual stitching was made.</p>

<title>OP and brain dimensions</title>
<p>The ML dimension of the OP represents the distance between the most medial and the most lateral GFP+ or YFP+ cells in <italic>Tg(neurog1:GFP)</italic> or <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP)</italic> embryos, respectively. Ectopic fluorescent cells (cells that are physically separated from the main cluster) were not taken into account for this measurement. The same method was applied to quantify the AP and DV dimensions of the OP tissue. The width of the brain was measured along the ML axis using the GFP forebrain expression in <italic>Tg(elementC:gfp)</italic> embryos, at 3 different AP positions and 3 different DV positions.</p>

<title>Thickness of the intercellular space in EM images</title>
<p>Analyses were performed on 1000 pixel-long rectangular regions at the interface between NCC and brain or OP cells in controls, and at the brain/OP interface in <italic>sly</italic> mutants (from 3 to 7 regions per embryo). In each region, the thickness of the intercellular space was manually measured every 100 pixels using Fiji (10 measurements/region). The average thickness per region and then per embryo was computed and plotted.</p>

<sec id="s4f3">
<title>Manual cell tracking</title>
<p>Individual cells from the OP (expressing <italic>Tg(neurog1:GFP)</italic> or <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP)</italic>) and the adjacent brain were tracked in 3D using the Manual Tracking plugin in ImageJ/Fiji. For tracking on <italic>Tg(neurog1:GFP)</italic> embryos, tracked cells from the brain and the OP expressed <italic>Tg(neurog1:GFP)</italic> at least at the end of the movie. For tracking on <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP)</italic> embryos, we followed forebrain cells located between the two OPs. For growth cone tracking, individual growth cones were followed in 3D using the same plugin in embryos injected with the <italic>omp:meYFP</italic> plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sato et al., 2005</xref>), over periods of 200 min each. The orientation of the trajectories represents the angle between the track and the vertical DV axis. 2D color coded trajectories and rose plots were generated in Matlab (Mathworks, US). The 3D MSD was computed using the Numpy library in Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Harris et al., 2020</xref>). Plots representing cell tracks merged at their origin were produced with Microsoft Excel.</p>

<title>Segmentation and analysis of the brain/OP boundary</title>
<p>The segmentation of Dlx3b+ OP cells was performed using a two-step workflow in Ilastik and Fiji softwares. First, to achieve pixel classification, 3 representative images of controls and of <italic>sly</italic> mutants were loaded into the data input menu and used to train the algorithm. After the training the pixel features and feature size (sigma) were selected. All features on all sigma scales were selected. This allowed pixels to be classified based on gray intensity, resemblance to an edge, and texture. Next, the supervised training was performed. 3 examples of each object were labelled; then, the classifier was allowed to update to observe the results. Using the uncertainty overlay, areas of high uncertainty were labeled iteratively until the prediction layer showed satisfactory identification of the pixels. This process was repeated for all 3 images. The trained classifier was then run on all images, and the pixel classification data were saved as segmented images. In the second step, a “region of interest” (ROI) containing the brain/OP boundary was manually defined using Fiji. The edge detection was applied in that ROI and allowed the delineation of the boundary between segmented OP cells and brain cells. The data were exported as CSV files to be used for analysis. The distortion index is defined as the total length of the boundary, divided by the distance between the dorsalmost and ventralmost positions along the analysed boundary region.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Most graphs show means ± standard error of the mean (sem), overlayed with all individual data points. These plots were generated with the GraphPad Prism software. For all graphs, we checked for normality of the data distribution before performing parametric, unpaired, two tailed t tests. When the data were not normal, a Mann-Whitney test was used. A Chi2 test was performed on the data presented in Fig. S2M-P and Fig. S4I-L. For the segmentation of the brain/OP boundary (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G, H</xref>), the data were analyzed through an ANOVA test (mixed models, with animals as random effect and genotype and side as fixed effects). The orientation of cell and growth cone trajectories were treated as circular variables and analysed between groups using the circular analysis of variance based on the likelihood ratio test (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C, F, I, L</xref>). The p values correspond to *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001. No statistical method was used to estimate sample size and no randomization was performed.</p>

The yellow arrowhead shows the exit point, which appears as a small interruption (or several small interruptions) in the BM of the OP resulting from its incomplete assembly in this specific area. The blue arrowhead indicates the opening of the entry point (which can also be formed by several gaps in somes instances) in the already assembled BM of the brain, which is concomitant with the arrival of the RFP-positive axons. Pink dots indicate brain cells expressing Laminin <italic>γ</italic>1-sfGFP cytoplasmic expression. Only the left side of the embryo is shown.

<p><bold>Movie 6. 3D stacks showing the axonal defects and ectopic OP cells observed in <italic>sly</italic> mutants,</bold> related to <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and Fig. S5. The embryos are at 28 hpf and carry the <italic>Tg(omp:meYFP)</italic> transgene to visualise the membrane of <italic>ompb</italic>-expressing OP neurons and their axons (green). In control embryos, the bundle of axons exit the OP in a ventral position and migrate dorsally towards the presumptive OB. In mutant embryos, only a few axons manage to exit the OP in a dorsal position and reach the presumptive OB (white arrow). Most of them appear to be stalled at the OP/brain boundary (grey arrow). The mutant embryo also exhibits ectopic OP cells that are detached from the main OP cluster (magenta dots). White dots indicate the centre of the rosette of OP neurons that assemble in the dorso-lateral region of the OP. Only the left side of the embryo is shown. Frontal views, dorsal to the top, lateral to the left, the first z-sections are the most anterior and the z-stack progressively goes posterior, z-step of 1 µm. Scale bar: 25 µm.</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study describing the function of Laminin γ1-dependent basement membranes in the development of the olfactory placode, including morphogenesis of the placode, boundary formation, and olfactory axonal pathfinding. The study uses elegant live imaging approaches, and detailed mutant analyses to provide a <bold>convincing</bold> description of the role of Laminin in olfactory placode development, although the mechanisms by which Laminin γ1 regulates these processes are not conclusive. In addition to the contributions this study makes to understanding olfactory placode development, it will also be of broader interest to individuals interested in extracellular matrix regulation of tissue morphogenesis, and neural development including neuronal pathfinding.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors describe the dynamic distribution of laminin in the olfactory system and forebrain. Using immunohistochemistry and transgenic lines, they found that the olfactory system and adjacent brain tissues are enveloped by BMs from the earliest stages of olfactory system assembly. They also found that laminin deposits follow the axonal trajectory of axons. They performed a functional analysis of the sly mutant to analyse the function of laminin γ1 in the development of the zebrafish olfactory system. Their study revealed that laminin enables the shape and position of placodes to be maintained late in the face of major morphogenetic movements in the brain, and its absence promotes the local entry of sensory axons into the brain and their navigation towards the olfactory bulb.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
-They showed that in the sly mutants, no BM staining of laminin and Nidogen could be detected around the OP and the brain. The authors then elegantly used electron microscopy to analyse the ultrastructure of the border between the OP and the brain in control and sly mutant conditions.</p>
<p>
-To analyse the role of laminin γ1-dependent BMs in OP coalescence, the authors used the cluster size of Tg(neurog1:GFP)+ OP cells at 22 hpf as a marker. They found that the mediolateral dimension increased specifically in the mutants. However, proliferation did not seem to be affected, although apoptosis appeared to increase slightly at a later stage. This increase could therefore be due to a dispersal of cells in the OP. To test this hypothesis, the authors then analysed the cell trajectories and extracted 3D mean square displacements (MSD), a measure of the volume explored by a cell in a given period of time. Their conclusion indicates that although brain cell movements are increased in the absence of BM during coalescence phases, overall OP cell movements occur within normal parameters and allow OPs to condense into compact neuronal clusters in sly mutants. The authors also analysed the dimensions of the clusters composed of OMP+ neurons. Their results show an increase in cluster size along the dorso-ventral axis. These results were to be expected since, compared with BM, early neurog1+ neurons should compact along the medio-lateral axis, and those that are OMP+ essentially along the dorso-ventral axis. In addition to the DV elongation of OP tissue, the authors show the existence of isolated and ectopic (misplaced) YFP+ cells in sly mutants.</p>
<p>
-To understand the origin of these phenotypes, the authors analysed the dynamic behaviour of brain cells and OPs during forebrain flexion. The authors then quantitatively measured brain versus OPs in the sly mutant and found that the OP-brain boundary was poorly defined in the sly mutant compared with the control. Once again, the methods (cell tracks, brain size, and proliferation/apoptosis, and the shape of the brain/OP boundary) are elegant but the results were expected.</p>
<p>
-They then analysed the dynamic behaviour of the axon using live imaging. Thus, olfactory axon migration is drastically impaired in sly mutants, demonstrating that Laminin γ1-dependent BMs are essential for the growth and navigation of axons from the OP to the olfactory bulb.</p>
<p>
-The authors therefore performed a quantitative analysis of the loss of function of Laminin γ1. They propose that the BM of the OP prevents its deformation in response to mechanical forces generated by morphogenetic movements of the neighbouring brain.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- The authors did not analyse neurog1 + axonal migration at the level of the single cell and instead made a global analysis. An analysis at the cell level would strengthen their hypotheses.</p>
<p>
- Rescue experiments by locally inducing Laminin expression would have strengthened the paper.</p>
<p>
-The paper lacks clarity between the two neuronal populations described (early EONs and late OSNs).</p>
<p>
-The authors quantitatively measured brain versus OPs in the sly mutant and found that the OP-brain boundary was poorly defined in the sly mutant compared with the control. Once again, the methods (cell tracks, brain size, proliferation/apoptosis, and the shape of the brain/OP boundary) are elegant but the results were expected.</p>
<p>
- A missing point in the paper is the effect of Laminin γ1 on the migration of cranial NCCs that interact with OP cells. The authors could have analysed the dynamic distribution of neural crest cells in the sly mutant.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript addresses the role of the extracellular matrix in olfactory development. Despite the importance of these extracellular structures, the specific roles and activities of matrix molecules are still poorly understood. Here, the authors combine live imaging and genetics to examine the role of laminin gamma 1 in multiple steps of olfactory development. The work comprises a descriptive but carefully executed, quantitative assessment of the olfactory phenotypes resulting from loss of laminin gamma. Overall, this is a constructive advance in our understanding of extracellular matrix contributions to olfactory development, with a well-written Discussion with relevance to many other systems.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The strengths of the manuscript are in the approaches: the authors have combined live imaging, careful quantitative analyses, and molecular genetics. The work presented takes advantage of many zebrafish tools including mutants and transgenics to directly visualize the laminin extracellular matrix in living embryos during the developmental process.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The weaknesses are primarily in the presentation of some of the imaging data. In certain cases, it was not straightforward to evaluate the authors' interpretations and conclusions based on the single confocal sections included in the manuscript. For example, it was difficult to assess the authors' interpretation of when and how laminin openings arise around the olfactory placode and brain during olfactory axon guidance.</p>

<p>This is a beautifully presented paper combining live imaging and analysis of mutant phenotypes to elucidate the role of laminin γ1-dependent basement membranes in the development of the zebrafish olfactory placode. The work is clearly illustrated and carefully quantified throughout. There are some very interesting observations based on the analysis of wild-type, laminin γ1, and foxd3 mutant embryos. The authors demonstrate the importance of a Laminin γ1-dependent basement membrane in olfactory placode morphogenesis, and in establishing and maintaining both boundaries and neuronal connections between the brain and the olfactory system. There are some very interesting observations, including the identification of different mechanisms for axons to cross basement membranes, either by taking advantage of incompletely formed membranes at early stages, or by actively perforating the membrane at later ones.</p>
<p>This is a valuable and important study but remains quite descriptive. In some cases, hypotheses for mechanisms are stated but are not tested further. For example, the authors propose that olfactory axons must actively disrupt a basement membrane to enter the brain and suggest alternative putative mechanisms for this, but these are not tested experimentally. In addition, the authors propose that the basement membrane of the olfactory placode acts to resist mechanical forces generated by the morphogenetic movement of the developing brain, and thus to prevent passive deformation of the placode, but this is not tested anywhere, for example by preventing or altering the brain movements in the laminin γ1 mutant.</p>
