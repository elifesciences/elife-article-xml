<abstract>
<p>The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway controls embryonic development and tissue homeostasis after birth. This requires regulated solubilization of dual-lipidated, firmly plasma membrane-associated Shh precursors from producing cells. Although it is firmly established that the resistance-nodulation-division transporter Dispatched (Disp) drives this process, it is less clear how lipidated Shh solubilization from the plasma membrane is achieved. We have previously shown that Disp promotes proteolytic solubilization of Shh from its lipidated terminal peptide anchors. This process, termed shedding, converts tightly membrane-associated hydrophobic Shh precursors into delipidated soluble proteins. We show here that Disp-mediated Shh shedding is modulated by a serum factor that we identify as high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In addition to serving as a soluble sink for free membrane cholesterol, HDLs also accept the cholesterol-modified Shh peptide from Disp. The cholesteroylated Shh peptide is necessary and sufficient for Disp-mediated transfer because mCherry linked to cholesteroylated peptides associates with HDL in a Disp-dependent manner, whereas an N-palmitoylated Shh variant lacking C-cholesterol does not. Disp-mediated Shh transfer to HDL is completed by proteolytic processing of the palmitoylated N-terminal membrane anchor. In contrast to dual processed soluble Shh with moderate bioactivity, HDL-associated N-processed Shh is highly bioactive. We suggest that the purpose of different post-translationally modified soluble Shh forms generated from the dual-lipidated cellular precursor is to fine-tune cellular responses in a tissue type and time-specific manner.</p>

<fn fn-type="update"><p>In our updated version of the paper, we have taken into account all of the reviewers' remaining comments. Most importantly, we have performed additional experiments to address one reviewer's concern that unusual normalization strategies were used and that quantification and statistical analyses were missing for several experiments, and the second reviewer's concern that the amounts of Shh released independently of Disp and Scube2 in secretion assays were not quantified in our previous versions of the paper. To mitigate the first reviewer's comment that the significance of the data presented is overstated, we now clearly distinguish between our novel results and the known aspect of Hh release on lipoproteins throughout our paper. We now also confirm key findings of our study in Panc1 cells, which endogenously produce and secrete Shh, and in MIA PaCa-2 and HeLa cells to show that Shh processing during release is not restricted to the Bosc23 cells we used in this study.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hedgehog (Hh) ligands activate an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that provides instructional cues during tissue morphogenesis and, when misregulated, contributes to developmental disorders and cancer. Hhs are unique in that they require autocatalytic covalent cholesteroylation of the C-terminus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and N-terminal palmitoylation by a separate Hh acyltransferase (Hhat) activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Both lipids tightly bind Hh to the plasma membrane of producing cells to effectively prevent unregulated ligand release <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Signaling to distant target cells therefore requires the regulated solubilization of Hh from the membrane of ligand-producing cells, a process that is facilitated by vertebrate and invertebrate Dispatched (Disp) orthologs <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Disp contains 12 transmembrane helices and 2 extracellular domains and belongs to the resistance-nodulation-division family of transmembrane efflux pumps. Normally, such pumps maintain cellular homeostasis and remove toxic compounds. In addition, Disp contains a conserved multi-pass transmembrane domain known as the sterol sensing domain (SSD), which regulates the homeostasis of free or esterified cellular cholesterol in other SSD proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. This molecular architecture is consistent with Disp extraction of free cholesterol from the plasma membrane to remove it from the cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. In addition, given its established role in Hh/Shh release, it has been suggested that Disp also extracts the C-terminal Shh sterol to solubilize Hh/Shh in the extracellular compartment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>However, Disp activity alone is not sufficient to solubilize the vertebrate Hh family member Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) from the plasma membrane. A second synergistic factor required for maximal Shh signaling is the soluble extracellular glycoprotein Scube2 (Signal sequence, cubulin (CUB) domain, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein 2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. One way to explain the Disp/Scube2 synergy is that Disp-mediated extraction of dual-lipidated Shh from the plasma membrane delivers it to Scube2, a mechanism that depends on the C-terminal cysteine-rich and CUB domains of Scube2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic> support for this mechanism comes from co-immunoprecipitation of Disp and Scube2 with Shh <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> and from structural data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Other proposed carriers for Disp-extracted lipidated Hh/Shh include lipoprotein particles (LPPs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, exosomes as carriers of internalized and re-secreted Hhs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and micellous Hh assemblies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Another proposed mode of Shh release is Disp-regulated proteolytic processing (termed shedding) from the plasma membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> by two major plasma membrane-associated sheddases, A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM) 10 and 17 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The role of Scube2 in the shedding model is to enhance proteolytic processing of both terminal lipidated Shh peptides in a CUB domain-dependent manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, CUB function in regulated shedding of other substrates often involves substrate recognition and induced structural changes in the substrate to increase turnover <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we systematically characterized the biochemical parameters of Disp-regulated Shh solubilization with all these published models and parameters in mind. To this end, we used a unique bicistronic Hhat/Shh coexpression system to ensure that only dual-lipidated Shh was produced and analyzed as a substrate for Disp <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. We also avoided any protein tagging to ensure undisturbed Shh modification, secretion, and interaction with Disp and other potential pathway components. Finally, we used unbiased biochemical methods to analyze Shh solubilization, size, and lipidation status under different experimental conditions. First, we confirmed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting and reverse phase (RP)-HPLC that Disp and Scube2 synergistically enhance Shh shedding into the cell culture medium <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. We also found that repeated washing of Disp- and Shh-expressing cells to remove all traces of serum abolished Shh shedding, and that high levels of serum promoted the solubilization of a previously unknown, highly bioactive Shh variant that lacks its palmitoylated N-terminus but retains its cholesteroylated C-terminus. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses revealed co-elution of this novel Shh variant with serum apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), the major protein component of the serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction. Consistent with this observation, purified HDL restored solubilization of the N-processed, bioactive Shh variant from washed cells. We also found that the most C-terminal cholesteroylated Shh peptide is sufficient for Disp-mediated protein transfer to HDL. In contrast, palmitoylated N-terminal Shh membrane anchors are not transferred by Disp, but undergo shedding to complete Shh transfer to HDL. Our updated Hh shedding model thus unifies previously disparate models of Disp-, sheddase-, and LPP-mediated Shh solubilization into a comprehensive system. This comprehensive system is fully consistent with published reports on <italic>in vivo</italic> Disp functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, <italic>in vivo</italic> Scube2 functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, the <italic>in vitro</italic> role of the Scube2 CUB domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, the Disp structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, and the required N-terminal – but not C-terminal – shedding during <italic>in vivo</italic> Hh solubilization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Our model is also consistent with the established importance of Hh C-cholesterol for Hh association into “large punctate” structures visible by light microscopy that may represent Hh-LPP complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, C-cholesterol-dependent Hh spreading <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, and previously established <italic>in vivo</italic> roles of LPPs in Hh biofunction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We propose that the Disp-produced, HDL-bound, mono-lipidated Shh variant presented in this work helps to meet the requirements for regulating Hh activity in specific cell types and developing tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Synergistic function of Disp and Scube2 increases the shedding of dual-lipidated Shh from the plasma membrane</title>
<p>To analyze Shh solubilization from the plasma membrane, we produced dual-lipidated, tightly plasma membrane-associated morphogens in Bosc23 control cells that endogenously express Disp <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (referred to in this study as CRISPR non-targeting control (nt ctrl) cells) and in Bosc23 cells made deficient in Disp function by CRISPR/Cas9 (using previously characterized Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>; experimental outlines and specificity controls are described in Fig. S1A-E). Shh biosynthesis in both cell lines begins with the covalent attachment of a cholesterol moiety to the C-terminus of the Shh signaling domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. This reaction is autocatalytic and tightly coupled to the generation of 19 kDa Shh signaling domains from a 45 kDa precursor. However, the subsequent N-palmitoylation of cholesteroylated Shh/Hh requires a separate enzymatic activity encoded by Hhat <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Since Bosc23 cells do not express endogenous Hhat <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we minimized the production of non-palmitoylated Shh by using bicistronic mRNA encoding the Shh precursor together with Hhat. In contrast to Shh expression in the absence of Hhat, coupled Shh/Hhat expression ensures nearly quantitative Shh N-palmitoylation in transfected Bosc23 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting was then used to characterize dual-lipidated Shh extraction from the plasma membrane of both cell lines into serum-depleted media (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; Fig. S2 includes all transfection and loading controls). We confirmed the published finding that Scube2 enhanced Shh solubilization from nt ctrl cells (arrowhead) and that Shh solubilization from Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells was strongly reduced <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>’, Table S1). We also confirmed that the electrophoretic mobility of most Shh released from nt ctrl cells was increased over that of the corresponding dual-lipidated cellular material on the same blot <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, asterisk). RP-HPLC of the solubilized material shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> demonstrated that the observed increase in electrophoretic mobility was caused by the proteolytic removal of both lipidated terminal peptides (this post-translational modification of Shh is referred to as shedding throughout this manuscript, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>’’; see Fig. S2 for cellular dual-lipidated or artificially produced monolipidated and unlipidated Shh standard proteins and see Reference <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, which rules out alternative modes of Shh deacylation). Transgenic Disp expression in Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells restored Shh shedding and solubilization, confirming the specificity of the assay (Fig. S2E) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Strikingly, the same phenotypic reversal was achieved by the coexpression of the cholesterol pump Patched (Ptch1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, which depletes the plasma membrane of free sterols <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. This suggests an indirect “second messenger” role of plasma membrane cholesterol not only in the regulation of Smoothened downstream of Ptch1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, but also in the regulation of Shh shedding by Disp (Fig. S2E) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Note that alternative solubilized Shh variants (represented by the “top” bands) are also present in the media. However, the release of these variants is independent of Disp and Scube2 (Fig. S2F). In contrast, Scube2 and Disp synergistically and specifically increased Shh shedding from the cell surface (as indicated by the appearance of “lower” sized bands compared to those of cellular proteins, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, A’) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>We also observed that solubilization of engineered monolipidated Shh variants (<sup>C25S</sup>Shh, lacking N-palmitate, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, B’, and ShhN, lacking C-cholesterol, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, C’, Fig. S2B,C) was much less controlled, consistent with the observations of others <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The release of both monolipidated Shh variants remained linked with the shedding of the respective lipidated membrane termini, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shifts of soluble proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,C</xref>, arrowheads) and their delipidation during solubilization (as determined by RP-HPLC, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>’’,C’’).

Taken together, these results suggest that cell surface shedding represents a “ground state” from which dual-lipidated Shh is protected, but only until Disp and Scube2 render it susceptible to shedding. Our results also suggest that the complete conservation of dual N- and C-terminal Hh lipidation during biosynthesis serves to prevent unregulated protein release from producing cells.

<title>Shh shedding is dependent on cleavage-activated Disp and the presence of serum</title>
<p>It was recently shown that the prohormone convertase furin cleaves Disp at a conserved processing site to activate it and to release Shh from the cell surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Based on this mode of activation, we hypothesized that furin inhibition might specifically interfere with Disp-regulated Shh shedding. To test this hypothesis, we added 0-80 μM peptidyl chloromethylketone (CMK, a competitive inhibitor of furin) to our solubilization assays. Indeed, CMK reduced Shh shedding from the cell surface in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>, Fig. S3A). During these assays, we also found that repeated careful washing of cells to quantitatively remove all traces of serum severely impaired Disp- and Scube2-mediated Shh solubilization into serum-free media (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D,E</xref>, Fig. S3B). From this latter observation, we derive two important conclusions. The first is that the minimal requirements of Na<sup>+</sup>-driven, Disp-mediated Shh extraction and hand-over to Scube2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> are not sufficient to release Shh. The second is that Shh self-assembly by the law of mass action <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> is also not supported, because this process should solubilize Shh regardless of the presence or absence of serum. In contrast, we previously found that one function of Disp is to extract free plasma membrane cholesterol and transfer it to a soluble sink for removal from the cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In vertebrates, HDLs represent a soluble sink for “free” peripheral cholesterol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, and HDLs and the pharmacological cholesterol chelator methyl-β-cyclodextrin have previously been shown to increase Shh shedding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Taken together, these results suggest that the permissive factor missing from our shedding assay is most likely a soluble cholesterol acceptor, such as HDL or a related serum LPP, as previously reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>To further characterize serum-dependent shedding, we expressed dual-lipidated Shh in nt ctrl cells and Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells and solubilized the proteins into serum-depleted Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) or into DMEM supplemented with 0.05%, 5% and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref>; Fig. S3C-F shows transfection and loading controls). Consistent with previous observations, we again found that Scube2 enhanced Shh shedding from Disp-expressing cells into serum-depleted media (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, arrowhead), but did not significantly enhance Shh shedding from Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells. RP-HPLC of the solubilized material confirmed that the observed increase in electrophoretic mobility was caused by the proteolytic removal of both terminal lipidated peptides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>’’). Increased serum concentrations during Shh solubilization (0.05% FCS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, quantified in B’), 5% FCS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, quantified in C’), and 10% FCS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, quantified in D’)) did not appear to much affect Disp- and Scube2-specific Shh shedding (arrowheads, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> in contrast shows unregulated release of unprocessed Shh (the “top” band) in the presence of 10% FCS). To our surprise, however, RP-HPLC of the solubilized materials shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-D</xref> revealed a gradual shift from dual Shh shedding (labeled [1] in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>’’-D’’) toward the solubilization of variant proteins with their C-terminal cholesteroylated peptide still intact (labeled [2] in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>’’-D’’, Fig. S4A-E). We also observed this hydrophobicity shift (together with an electrophoretic mobility shift, see Fig. S1D) when analyzing endogenous Shh from the pancreatic cancer cell line Panc1 (Fig. S4F-H). We note that small amounts of dual-lipidated Shh were also present in serum-containing media (indicated by asterisks in Fig. S4B-E). However, the relative amounts of this protein fraction increased both in the absence of Scube2 (Fig. S4I; here, cells had to be incubated for 24 h to compensate for the low Shh solubilization) and in the absence of Disp (Fig. S4J). In contrast, Scube2 expression in Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells increased the relative amount of delipidated soluble Shh (Fig. S4K). From this, we conclude that the Disp- and Scube2-independent solubilization of dual-lipidated Shh is physiologically irrelevant, consistent with the findings shown in Fig. F2F-H..</p>

<p>So far, our data have shown that Scube2 increases N- and C-terminal Shh shedding from Disp-expressing cells and that serum enhances this process, probably by providing a sink for membrane cholesterol transferred by Disp <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> (Fig. S4L). We also showed that high serum levels promote a second Disp solubilization mode in which Shh shedding is restricted to the palmitoylated N-peptide, leaving the C-terminus intact. This latter finding raised the interesting possibility that serum factors may accept or protect the cholesteroylated Shh C-terminus. Indeed, it is known that a filtrate of blood serum through the capillary walls, called interstitial fluid, represents the microenvironment of tissues and cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, as well as of tissues and cells that express and solubilize Shh during development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. It is also known that the interstitial fluid is rich in LPPs of small mass from the serum <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>.

These studies have shown that dual-lipidated Hh/Shh expression <italic>in vitro</italic> generates soluble variants that are 10-30 times more bioactive than engineered proteins that do not undergo Hhat-catalyzed N-palmitoylation but undergo unperturbed C-terminal cholesteroylation and secretion to the cell surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. According to these published observations, the N-terminally processed Shh variant described here should not be very active because it also lacks the palmitate. To test this hypothesis, we used the Ptch1-expressing multipotent fibroblastic cell line C3H10T1/2 as a reporter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. We first verified the multipotency of our C3H10T1/2 cells to differentiate into osteoblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, chondrocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, or adipocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> (Fig. S5A). To this end, C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in the presence of adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic supplements for different periods of time, and their responsiveness was confirmed based on phenotype and the expression of cell surface markers. We then incubated C3H10T1/2 cells with Shh expressed in the presence of 10% serum and the physiological release regulators Scube2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and Disp <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Shh shares 91% sequence identity and both lipids with Indian hedgehog, an established osteogenic factor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, and both Indian hedgehog and Shh stimulate C3H10T1/2 osteogenic differentiation. We confirmed that Shh induced alkaline phosphatase (Alp) expression and C3H10T1/2 differentiation into osteoblasts in a concentration-dependent manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Notably, we observed that <sup>C25A</sup>Shh expressed under the same conditions was as active or even more active than Shh (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of Ptch1 and Gli1 expression in Shh-treated C3H10T1/2 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, Fig. S5B) or Shh-treated NIH3T3 cells (Fig. S5B) confirmed this finding: After protein normalization, qPCR confirmed similar increases in Ptch1 and Gli1 mRNA expression under direct Shh or <sup>C25A</sup>Shh control. Ptch1 is known to be upregulated by Shh <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, and Gli1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that acts downstream of Ptch1 and is also transcribed in an Hh-dependent manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Key regulators of adipogenesis, osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and proliferation in Shh and <sup>C25S</sup>Shh-induced C3H10T1/2 cells were also similar (Fig. S5C,D). In contrast, the biofunction of the <sup>C25S</sup>ShhN negative control was always severely impaired. Finally, we incubated C3H10T1/2 cells with high activity Shh R&amp;D 8908-SH, a commercially available dual lipidated Shh variant obtained by detergent extraction from transfected cells (Fig. S5E,F). We observed that R&amp;D 8908-SH induced Alp expression in differentiating C3H10T1/2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, as expected <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. We also found that the activities of solubilized Shh and <sup>C25A</sup>Shh were increased over similar amounts of R&amp;D 8908-SH. qPCR of Ptch1 and Gli1 expression confirmed high activities of R&amp;D 8908-SH, Shh and <sup>C25A</sup>Shh (Fig. S5G).

<title>Soluble Shh/Hh and ApoA1-containing LPPs have a similar size</title>
<p>A decade ago, it was already known that flies and mammals release sterol-modified Hh/Shh in the LPP-associated bioactive form as well as in the desteroylated, unassociated form <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. These results suggest that serum LPPs in our assays may not only have promoted dual Shh shedding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), but may also have promoted assembly of monolipidated Shh into soluble LPP-associated complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. We used size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to test this possibility. SEC detects soluble Shh monomers (20 kDa) and covers the entire molecular weight (MW) range up to a cutoff of about 1 mDa. The MW range of serum HDL is from 1.75×10<sup>5</sup> Da to 3.6×10<sup>5</sup> Da, corresponding to particle sizes of 5-11 nm. This small size range makes HDLs abundant components of interstitial fluid and good candidates for Shh solubilization from cells and tissues. Larger complexes in mammalian serum include low-density lipoproteins (LDLs, MW 2.75×10<sup>6</sup> Da) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs, MW 10-80×10<sup>6</sup> Da), both of which would elute in the void column volume. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, Shh in DMEM + 10% FCS elutes in fractions covering the entire MW range (black line). A prominent Shh peak is detected at around 20 kDa – most likely representing the dually cleaved, fully delipidated Shh fraction (as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>’’-D’’, labeled [1]) – and a second peak is detected between 300 kDa and 600 kDa. Reprobing the same (stripped) blot with antibodies directed against ApoA1 (the major protein component of HDL) revealed an elution profile that overlapped with that of Shh (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, orange line). The leftward shift of Shh elution relative to HDL elution may be explained by the increased size of an LPP subfraction after its Disp-mediated loading with Shh. In contrast, Scube2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, blue line) co-eluted only with smaller Shh multimers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. To determine which size fraction contained biologically active Shh, we analyzed the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 osteoblast progenitor cells by using aliquots of eluted fractions from the same SEC run. We found that Shh induced C3H10T1/2 osteoblast differentiation with a size-dependent activity distribution: Large Shh assemblies were highly bioactive, and smaller assemblies were also bioactive, but monomeric Shh was only moderately active (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, green dashed line). We also found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh expressed in S2 cells and solubilized into serum-containing medium showed a similar size distribution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, black line) and that Hh assemblies also co-eluted with serum ApoA1 (orange line). This suggests that the mechanism of serum-enhanced Hh assembly during solubilization is conserved. The alternative possibility of Hh assembly as a consequence of heparan sulfate (HS)-proteoglycan interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> was rejected because site-directed mutagenesis of the HS-binding Cardin-Weintraub motif did not alter the size distribution of Hh<sup>ΔHS</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, black dotted line). These results confirm a previous study showing that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh copurifies with LPP and co-localizes with LPP in the developing wing epithelium <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.

<title>Disp function requires HDL</title>
<p>To test whether the soluble LPP that enhances Disp-mediated solubilization of N-processed, cholesteroylated Shh is HDL, we tested this possibility directly. To this end, we expressed Shh in nt ctrl cells and Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells in the presence or absence of Scube2, washed the cells 36 h after transfection to inhibit Shh release, and added serum-free DMEM or DMEM supplemented with 40 μg/mL purified human HDL <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. We first confirmed that the absence of serum factors greatly reduced Shh solubilization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, labeled [1], Fig. S6A). RP-HPLC of the small amounts of released Shh confirmed the removal of both lipidated Shh peptide anchors during solubilization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>’, Fig. S6A’), and SEC confirmed that the solubilized proteins were monomeric and not Scube2-associated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>’’). In contrast, Shh solubilization from nt ctrl cells into DMEM supplemented with 40 μg/mL HDL was greatly increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B,C</xref>, Fig. S6B). As previously observed for Shh expression in the presence of serum, RP-HPLC of HDL-solubilized Shh (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, labeled [2]) confirmed that its C-terminal cholesteroylated peptides were still intact (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>’, Fig. S6B’) and that the proteins were highly bioactive (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>’’, green dashed line). Solubilized dual-lipidated Shh – represented by the “upper” bands – was also found, but its solubilization was again independent of Scube2 and Disp function (Fig. S6B’’,B’’’), indicating a non-specific release. From the observed size shift and overlap with ApoA1 and ApoE4 elution profiles in SEC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>’’, note that the observed Shh MW range almost matches that of ApoA1), we suggest that monolipidated truncated Shh associates with HDL in a Disp-regulated manner. This possibility is supported by the previous observation that Hh levels were greatly decreased in the hemolymph of Disp-deficient fly larvae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. We also tested whether HDL is the only possible Shh acceptor, or whether LDL can also carry monolipidated morphogens. As shown in Fig. S6C,D, Shh was transferred to HDL-supplemented serum-free DMEM, but not to LDL-supplemented serum-free DMEM.

<p>Is N-terminally processed, HDL-associated Shh functional? To answer this question, we again used the multipotent fibroblastic cell line C3H10T1/2 as a reporter. Shh was co-expressed with Scube2 in the presence of 80 µg/mL purified human HDL and the conditioned media was added to C3H10T1/2 cells. As expected, Shh/HDL complexes induced Alp expression and C3H10T1/2 differentiation into osteoblasts in a concentration-dependent manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> and <sup>C25A</sup>Shh expressed under the same conditions was equally active (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). qPCR of Ptch1 and Gli1 expression in Shh/HDL-stimulated or <sup>C25A</sup>Shh/HDL-stimulated C3H10T1/2 cells and NIH3T3 cells confirmed this finding: Both protein/HDL complexes induced similar increases in Ptch1 and Gli1 mRNA expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). This suggests an unchanged bioactivity of the HDL-associated, N-terminally truncated Shh variants described in this study.</p>

<title>The C-terminal cholesterylated Shh peptide is necessary and sufficient for the Disp-mediated export of the protein and the association with HDL</title>
<p>We next asked whether both terminal lipids are required for Disp-mediated Shh export to HDL, or whether the C-cholesteroylated peptide is sufficient for the transfer. The latter possibility was suggested by the loss of the N-palmitoylated peptide during solubilization from Disp-expressing cells in the presence of serum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and by Disp-independent ShhN solubilization into serum-depleted medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. We expressed palmitoylated/non-cholesterylated ShhN and non-palmitoylated/cholesterylated <sup>C25S</sup>Shh and confirmed that palmitoylated ShhN solubilization from the plasma membrane was independent of Disp and HDL (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, [1] denotes material solubilized into serum-free DMEM, [2] denotes material solubilized by HDL; see also Fig. S7A,B). SEC detected only monomeric ShhN, regardless of the presence or absence of HDL (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>’,A’’). These results suggest that the N-terminal palmitate of Shh is not a substrate for Disp-mediated transfer to HDL. In contrast, only small amounts of monomeric <sup>C25S</sup>Shh were solubilized into serum-free media (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B,B</xref>’, labeled [3]), and HDL strongly increased soluble <sup>C25S</sup>Shh and its assembly to sizes similar to those of HDL (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>’’, labeled [4]; see also Fig. S7C,D). In support of the importance of Shh cholesterylation for its transfer to HDL, the C-termini of soluble <sup>C25S</sup>Shh remained lipidated (Fig. S7E). Taken together, our results suggest that the C-terminal cholesterol moiety is required for Disp-mediated Shh transfer and HDL association. However, we also found that a fraction of monolipidated <sup>C25S</sup>Shh was solubilized in a Disp-independent manner (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, asterisks; Fig. S7F, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>; the green dotted line indicates the distribution of <sup>C25S</sup>Shh sizes when released from Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells). We explain this finding by the unspecific release of <sup>C25S</sup>Shh in the presence of HDL, consistent with increased desorption of large proteins – such as Shh – when attached only to a single membrane anchor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Once desorbed, lipidated proteins can either reintegrate into the plasma membrane or associate with lipophilic soluble competitors, as shown in Fig. S7G. This demonstrates that another important role of the fully conserved dual N- and C-terminal Hh lipidation is to reduce non-enzymatic desorption of morphogens from the plasma membrane.</p>

<p>Is the cholesteroylated peptide sufficient for Disp-mediated transfer to HDL or is the globular Shh ectodomain involved in the transfer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>? To answer this question, we replaced most of the <sup>C25S</sup>Shh ectodomain with mCherry flanked N-terminally by the Shh secretion signal and C-terminally by the Shh cholesterol transferase/autoprocessing domain. This strategy resulted in the secretion of cholesteroylated mCherry to the cell surface and its association with the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (Fig. S7H). As previously observed for Shh (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), mCherry remained monomeric or formed small aggregates when released into serum-depleted media (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>, dashed violet line), and HDL shifted mCherry elution to fractions that also contained ApoA1 (solid violet line). This result supports that HDL serves as a soluble acceptor for C-terminally cholesterylated peptides. SEC also revealed that loss of Disp function decreased the relative amount of HDL-associated material (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>, solid violet line) and increased the relative amount of solubilized monomeric protein (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>, dotted violet line). Thus, cholesterylated peptides represent the critical determinant for Disp-mediated Shh transport to HDL. In contrast, Shh ectodomain interactions with Disp are not essential for the transfer. We supported the physical interactions of <sup>C25S</sup>Shh with HDL by the addition of EtOH or Triton X-100, both of which dissociate soluble high MW aggregates into monomers or small assemblies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>, light green lines indicate <sup>C25A</sup>Shh after treatment and the light orange line ApoA1 after treatment).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Dual Shh lipidation and Disp-regulated Shh solubilization are interdependent</title>
<p>In the past, it has been well established that Hh solubilization and signaling depend on Disp co-expression in source cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. However, the additional involvement of many cell surface and soluble cofactors has complicated efforts to elucidate the exact nature of Disp-mediated Hh solubilization. To address this problem, we transfected Disp-deficient and Disp-expressing source cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> with Shh and systematically modified Shh solubilization by a number of extracellular cofactors. Cell surface-associated Shh upstream of Disp function and soluble Shh downstream of Disp function were then analyzed together with their cofactors by using unbiased biochemical tools. The first important result of this approach is that both Shh lipids act together to prevent uncontrolled Shh desorption or shedding from producing cells. In contrast, engineered <sup>C25S/C25A</sup>Shh, which lacks N-palmitate, and ShhN, which lacks C-cholesterol, are constitutively solubilized by either non-enzymatic desorption or unregulated shedding (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). The second important finding is that Disp and Scube2 specifically and synergistically increase the shedding of the dual-lipidated cellular protein. These two observations suggest that cell surface shedding represents a “ground state” from which dual-lipidated Shh is protected by tight plasma membrane association of both lipids – but only until Disp and Scube2 render Shh susceptible to proteolytic processing of the terminal lipidated peptides. This concept is important in reinterpreting the observation that dual lipidation is essential for unimpaired Hh biofunction <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. The current interpretation of these observations is that both Hh lipids contribute directly to Ptch1 receptor binding and maximal signaling. Our results support an alternative mechanism acting upstream of Ptch1: We suggest that the selective artificial prevention of N- or C-terminal lipidation during Hh/Shh biosynthesis <italic>in vivo</italic> (as achieved by the deletion of the N-terminal palmitate acceptor cysteine or of Hhat, or by prevention of C-cholesteroylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>) may have converted spatiotemporally controlled Hh/Shh solubilization into unregulated “leakage” of monolipidated precursors from producing cells and tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The “unavailability” of dual-lipidated Shh for Disp-controlled spatiotemporal signaling, or the desensitization of target cells to ongoing Shh exposure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, may then have caused the observed Hh loss-of-function phenotypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Therefore, our release model does not contradict the established essential role of unimpaired dual Shh lipidation during biosynthesis for the regulation of Hh activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, but provides an alternative explanation for it. Published support for our model of Disp- and Scube2-regulated Hh shedding and release on HDL includes the following: Disp is required only in Hh-producing cells and not in receiving cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>; Hh signaling defects in Disp-deficient model organisms are caused by a defect in the deployment of cell surface-associated Shh <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>; and full Disp activity requires Scube2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Further support comes from the <italic>in vivo</italic> observation that artificially depalmitoylated Hh variants impair development to varying degrees, but also show increased signaling in some tissues and induce ectopic signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. The latter observation is difficult to reconcile with the proposed essential signaling functions of the Shh palmitate, but is compatible with our model of spatiotemporally perturbed release of monolipidated proteins.</p>

<p><bold>A)</bold> Dual lipidation protects Shh from unregulated cell surface shedding by tight plasma membrane association of both lipids (blocked shedding is indicated by an x in [1]). In contrast, monolipidated ShhN [2] and <sup>C25S</sup>Shh [3] are prone to unregulated membrane proximal shedding (indicated by the dashed line) or non-enzymatic desorption. <bold>B)</bold> Depiction of the surface hydrophobicity of Disp (pdb:7RPH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>) suggests an extended hydrophobic surface channel (hydrophobic residues are shown in red) that may function as a “slide” for lipophiles extending from the plasma membrane (dashed lines) to a cavity of the second extracellular domain (blue arrows). A sterol lifted upward (green stick representation) at the starting point of the hydrophobic track may represent an intermediate state of sterol extraction from the membrane, and a lipidic group modeled as the amphiphilic detergent lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (violet stick structure) may represent the end point of the transfer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> prior to delivery to HDL. <bold>C)</bold> We propose two sequences of Shh transfer events. In the first event [1], plasma membrane sterol is transferred through the hydrophobic Disp surface channel to HDL acceptors. This process is similar to the established reverse cholesterol transport. In the second event, if present, C-terminal cholesterol moieties of Shh can also be transferred [2]. This partial Shh extraction exposes the N-terminal cleavage site [3] and makes it susceptible to proteolytic processing (similar to ShhN as shown in A). N-terminal Shh shedding can then release the protein from the plasma membrane [4] to complete the transfer [5]. In addition to, or competing with this process, cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane (representing the first event, [1]) may indirectly trigger shedding of both terminal Shh peptides and the solubilization of monomeric proteins [6].

<title>Disp mediates Shh solubilization through two functionally related modes of transfer</title>
<p>The third important finding of our study is that the absence of all serum traces reduces or even abolishes Disp/Scube2-mediated Shh solubilization. This indicates that Disp and Scube2 are not sufficient to solubilize dual-lipidated Shh and that a serum factor is also required. We have previously shown that Disp knockout in cells impairs <sup>3H</sup>cholesterol efflux and increases membrane cholesterol levels, which in turn indirectly inhibits Shh shedding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. We also showed that HDL serves as a soluble sink for Disp-exported cholesterol and that Shh shedding from Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells is restored by Disp and the established cholesterol transporter Ptch1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Consistent with these published observations, both Disp and Ptch1 contain sterol-sensing domains that are likely involved in cholesterol transport or its regulation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). Taken together, these published findings suggest that the required serum factor is HDL.</p>
<p>In this paper, we describe that HDL also accepts cholesteroylated – but not dual-lipidated – Shh from Disp (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). This finding is supported by the presence of an extended hydrophobic surface channel in Disp that may function as an open “slide” for lipophiles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>, blue arrows). This slide may be powered by a transmembrane Na<sup>+</sup> flux <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, similar to the H<sup>+</sup> flux that drives the related prokaryotic resistance-nodulation-division transporter export of small molecules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. The Disp exporter function of cholesteroylated proteins to HDL is further supported by the published concept that the fly LPP lipophorin carries cholesteroylated Hh <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We extend this published concept by showing that the most C-terminal cholesteroylated Shh peptide is sufficient for direct Disp-mediated protein export to HDL, because mCherry linked to this peptide is also transferred to HDL in a mostly Disp-dependent manner. This is consistent with a previous report showing that C-cholesterol is necessary and sufficient for Disp-mediated protein export <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Due to their small size of 5-10 nm, HDLs are not only abundant in the circulation, but are also present in interstitial fluids, both in the adult and during development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In contrast, larger LPPs such as LDLs and VLDLs are limited in their distribution by vascular impermeability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. The ratio of HDL to LDL in interstitial fluids has been estimated to average 50:1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. These properties make HDL well suited not only for reverse cholesterol transport, but also for the transport of cholesteroylated Hh/Shh cargo to its receptor Ptch1, which also functions as an LPP receptor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. This would lead to the interesting concept that “Hh-free” LPPs and “Hh-loaded” LPPs may compete for Ptch1 receptor binding, the former by promoting Ptch1-mediated cholesterol export to suppress signaling and the latter by terminating cholesterol efflux to trigger Hh signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Indeed, this elegant mechanism of Ptch1 activity regulation has been previously demonstrated both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Shedding of the N-terminus during Disp-mediated export of Hh <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived concept of required N-terminal peptide shedding is supported by the <italic>in vivo</italic> finding that site-directed mutagenesis of the sheddase target site completely abolishes transgene function in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing and eye (see Fig. S8 for a detailed description of repeated and combined experiments from published work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>). Another striking observation was that the same mutant proteins suppress endogenous Hh biofunction in a dominant-negative manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. However, the same site-directed mutagenesis approach at the Hh C-terminus only slightly affects the biofunction of the transgene and does not suppress endogenous Hh biofunction <italic>in vivo</italic>. Both observations can now be explained by the fact that mutant Hh transgenes readily associate their C-terminal peptides with the extended Disp “slide” for lipophiles, with the N-mutant protein unable to complete the transfer due to blocked N-terminal shedding and continued plasma membrane association of the palmitoylated Hh N-terminus (preventing step [3] and [4] due to transfer arrest at step [2] in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). As a consequence, the resulting Disp bottleneck would slow down endogenous Hh release, explaining the observed dominant-negative developmental defects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> (Fig. S8C,D). This sequence of events is supported by reversed dominant-negative defects of the N mutant protein upon additional removal of the palmitate membrane anchor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Taken together, our results suggest that most Hh solubilization <italic>in vivo</italic> does not require C-terminal Hh shedding, but rather direct cholesterylated Hh transfer from Disp to LPPs. During this process, only the palmitoylated N-terminus is shed to complete the transfer (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>, Fig. S8). Our finding that cholesterylated C-terminal peptides are sufficient for Disp-mediated transfer to HDL is supported by the <italic>in vivo</italic> observation that transgenes with cholesterylated 27 kDa green fluorescent protein tags downstream of the 19 kDa Hh signaling domain are bioactive in flies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> and mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. However, the Disp specificity <italic>in vivo</italic> can be elegantly explained by the fact that Hh is the only known metazoan protein with covalently attached cholesterol. Finally, our finding that palmitoylated Shh N-termini are not extracted and translocated by Disp is supported by the <italic>in vivo</italic> observation that transgenic expression of ShhN – the variant protein that is N-palmitoylated but lacks C-cholesterol – rescues many early Hh-related embryonic lethal defects in Disp<sup>-/-</sup> mutant mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.</p>

Both cDNAs were cloned into pIRES (Clontech) for their coupled expression from bicistronic mRNA to achieve near-quantitative Shh palmitoylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. ShhN (nucleotides 1-594, corresponding to amino acids 1-198) and Hhat were also cloned into pIRES. <sup>C25S</sup>Shh was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Unlipidated <sup>C25S</sup>ShhN cDNA and non-palmitoylated <sup>C25S</sup>Shh cDNA (amino acids 1-438) were inserted into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Primer sequences can be provided upon request. Human Scube2 constructs were a kind gift from Ruey-Bing Yang (Academia Sinica, Taiwan). Murine V5-tagged Disp<sup>tg</sup> was a kind gift from Stacey Ogden (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, USA). Murine Ptch1<sup>tg</sup> and Ptch1<sup>ΔL2</sup> were generated from Ptch1 Full Length (pcDNA-h-mmPtch1-FL, Addgene #120889). Ptch1<sup>ΔL2</sup> was generated by deletion of the second extracellular loop (L2) between transmembrane domains 7 and 8 (amino acids 794-997). Primer sequences can be provided upon request. For Shh-NanoLuc, NanoLuc (pNH-NanoLuc, Plasmid #173075, Addgene), flanked by one glycine residue on both sides, was inserted into murine Shh between amino acids 92N and 93T (corresponding to N91 and T92 in human Shh) by using Gibson assembly (HiFi Assembly Kit, NEB). Where indicated, dual-lipidated, HEK293-derived human Shh (R&amp;D Systems, 8908-SH) served as a bioactivity control and to quantify Bosc23-expressed, TCA-precipitated proteins on the same blot.</p>

<title>Protein detection</title>
<p>Bosc23 cells, nt ctrl cells, or Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells were seeded into six-well plates and transfected with 1 µg Shh constructs together with 0.5 µg Scube2 or empty cDNA3.1 by using Polyfect (Qiagen). Where indicated, 0.5 µg Disp or Ptch1 encoding constructs were co-transfected. Cells were grown for 36 h - 2 days at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM containing 10% FCS and penicillin-streptomycin (100 µg/mL). Where indicated, 50 μM peptidyl-CMK (Millipore 344930), an inhibitor of furin activity in DMSO, or DMSO alone was added to the media. Serum-containing media were aspirated and serum-free DMEM added for 6 h, harvested, and centrifuged at 300<italic>g</italic> for 10 min to remove debris. Supernatants were incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 13,000<italic>g</italic> for 20 min to precipitate the proteins. Proteins solubilized into serum-containing media were pulled down by using heparin-sepharose beads (Sigma). Cell lysates and corresponding supernatants were analyzed on the same reducing SDS polyacrylamide gel and detected by Western blot analysis by using rabbit-α-Shh antibodies (Cell signaling C9C5), rabbit-α-GAPDH antibodies (Cell Signaling, GAPDH 14C10, #2118), or anti-β-actin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, A3854) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Flag-tagged Scube2 was detected by using polyclonal α-FLAG antibodies (Sigma, St. Louis, USA). GAPDH, β-actin (for cell lysates), or Ponceau S (for media) served as a loading control. Note that the amounts of immunoblotted soluble and cellular Shh do not correlate inversely. This is because medium lanes represent all TCA-precipitated proteins or all proteins captured by heparin-pulldown in medium, while cells were directly lysed in SDS buffer and only a small fraction (about 5%) were applied to the gel. As a consequence, a 100% increase in Shh solubilization will correlate to only 5% reduction in the amount of cell-surface-associated Shh. Shh release was quantified using ImageJ and calculated as the ratio of total, unprocessed (top band) or processed (truncated, bottom band) soluble Shh relative to the corresponding cellular Shh material and multiplied by 100 to express as a percentage. This protocol was varied in three ways: For <italic>serum-free</italic> release, cells cultured in DMEM+10% FCS were carefully washed three times with serum-free DMEM before serum-free media were added for 6 h of protein release. For Shh release into <italic>serum-depleted</italic> medium, cells were not washed before the serum-free DMEM was added. For release into <italic>serum-containing</italic> media, DMEM containing the indicated amounts of serum was added for 6 h. For mCherry visualization at the surface of Bosc23 cells, cells were incubated with polyclonal anti-mCherry antibodies (Invitrogen PA5-34974) under non-permeabilizing conditions, and mCherry was visualized by secondary anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova) by using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope.</p>

<title>Shh release in the presence of HDL or LDL</title>
<p>nt ctrl or Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells were transfected with pIRES for coupled Shh and Hhat expression, together with Scube2 cDNA as described earlier. Two days after transfection, cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and additionally incubated for 1 h in serum-free DMEM. This extensive washing was intended to quantitatively remove serum LPPs. Serum-free DMEM was then discarded and cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 80 µg/mL human HDL (Millipore, LP3, MW 175,000-360,000) or LDL (Millipore, LP2, MW 2,300,000 Da) at 80 µg/mL or at similar molarity (630 µg/mL) for 6 h. Increased Shh release was observed for HDL concentrations ranging from 40 μg/mL to 120 μg/mL; higher HDL concentrations were not tested. For cell debris removal, supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 300<italic>g</italic>. For subsequent Shh purification, supernatants were TCA precipitated or incubated with 5 µg/mL anti-Shh antibody DSHB 5E1 for 2 h at 4°C, followed by the addition of 5 mg protein A beads (Sigma, P1406) in PBS and incubated at 4°C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 300<italic>g</italic> for 5 min and subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. Shh release was quantified by first determining the ratios of soluble Shh signals detected in 5E1-Protein A pulldown samples relative to cellular Shh signals. Shh release from nt ctrl and Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells was next compared, with nt ctrl release set to 100%. Where indicated, <sup>C25S</sup>Shh/HDL assemblies were dissolved in 50% ethanol or 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min before SEC analysis. Immunoblotted HDL was identified by using antibodies directed against apolipoprotein (Apo)A1 (NB400-147, NovusBio) and mobile ApoE4 (4E4 Cell Signaling), the latter engaging in HDL size expansion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>.</p>

Cells were harvested 6 days after osteoblast differentiation was induced and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and osteoblast-specific alkaline phosphatase activity was measured at 405 nm by using 120 mM p-nitrophenolphosphate (Sigma) in 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 8.5).

Two days after transfection, cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) on ice and ultracentrifuged, and the soluble whole-cell extract was acetone precipitated. Protein precipitates were resuspended in 35 μL of (1,1,1,3,3,3) hexafluoro-2-propanol and solubilized with 70 μL of 70% formic acid, followed by sonication. RP-HPLC was performed on a C4-300 column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and an Äkta Basic P900 Protein Purifier. To elute the samples, we used a 0%-70% acetonitrile/water gradient with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature for 30 min. Eluted samples were vacuum dried, resolubilized in reducing sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Proteins expressed into the media were analyzed in the same way. Signals were quantified with ImageJ and normalized to the highest protein amount detected in each run. Where indicated, Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells were incubated for 24 h instead of the standard 6 h for protein expression before media harvest and TCA precipitation to compensate for the very low Shh release rate from these cells.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> manuscript presents an analysis of different factors that are required for release of the lipid-linked morphogen Shh from cellular membranes. The evidence is still <bold>incomplete</bold>, as experiments rely on over-expression of Shh in a single cell line and are sometimes of a correlative nature. The study, which otherwise confirms and extends previous findings, will be of interest to developmental biologists who work on Hedgehog signaling.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents a model in which combined action of the transporter-like protein DISP and the sheddases ADAM10/17 promote shedding of a mono-cholesteroylated Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) species following cleavage of palmitate from the dually lipidated precursor ligand. The authors propose that this leads to transfer of the cholesterol-modified SHH to HDL for solubilization. The minimal requirement for SHH release by this mechanism is proposed to be the covalently linked cholesterol modification because DISP could promote transfer of a cholesteroylated mCherry reporter protein to serum HDL. The authors used an in vitro system to demonstrate dependency on DISP/SCUBE2 for release of the cholesterol modified ligand. These results confirm previously published results from other groups (PMC3387659 and PMC3682496).</p>
<p>A strength of the work is the use of a bicistronic SHH-Hhat system to consistently generate dually-lipidated ligand to determine the quantity and lipidation status of SHH released into cell culture media.</p>
<p>Key shortcomings include the unusual normalization strategies used for many experiments and the lack of quantification/statistical analyses for several experiments. Due to these omissions, it is difficult to conclude that the data justify the conclusions. The significance of the data provided is overstated because many of the presented experiments confirm/support previously published work. The study provides a modest advance in understanding of the complex issue of SHH membrane extraction.</p>

<p>Ehring et al. analyze contributions of Dispatched, Scube2, serum lipoproteins and Sonic Hedgehog lipid modifications to the generation of different Shh release forms. Hedgehog proteins are anchored in cellular membranes by N-terminal palmitate and C-terminal cholesterol modifications, yet spread through tissues and are released into the circulation. How Hedgehog proteins can be released, and in which form, remains controversial. The authors systematically dissect contributions of several previously identified factors, and present evidence that Disp, Scube2 and lipoproteins concertedly act to release a novel Shh variant that is cholesterol-modified but not palmitoylated. The results provide new insights into the function of Disp and Scube2 in Hedgehog release. The findings concerning the function of lipoproteins and cholesterol in Hedgehog release are largely confirmatory (PMID 23554573, 20685986). However, in light of the multitude of competing models for Hedgehog release, the present study is a valuable contribution that provides further insights into the relevance of lipoproteins in this process.</p>
<p>A novel and surprising finding of the present study is the differential removal of Shh N- or C-terminal lipid anchors depending on the presence of HDL and/or Disp. In particular, the identification of a non-palmitoylated but cholesterol-modified Shh variant that associates with lipoproteins is potentially important. The authors use RP-HPLC and defined controls to assess the properties of processed Shh forms, but their precise molecular identity remains to be defined. A caveat is the strong reliance on over-expression of Shh in a single cell line. The authors detect Shh variants that are released independently of Disp and Scube2 in secretion assays, which however are excluded from interpretation as experimental artifacts. Thus, it would be important to demonstrate key findings in cells that secrete Shh endogenously.</p>

<p>As reviewer 2 correctly points out, there are many competing models for Hedgehog release. Our study cannot possibly support them all - the reviewer's statement is therefore misleading. In fact, our careful biochemical analysis of the mechanistics of Dispatched- mediated Shh export supports only two of them: The model of proteolytic processing of Shh lipid anchors (shedding) and the model of lipoprotein-mediated Shh transport. In contrast, our study does not support the predominant model of Dispatched-mediated extraction of dual-lipidated Shh and delivery to Scube2, which is currently thought to act as a soluble Shh chaperone. We also do not support Dispatched function in Shh endocytic recycling and cytoneme loading, or any of the other models such as exosome-mediated or micelle Shh transport.</p>

<p>We would like to respond as follows:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>This is the original reviewers statement regarding our original manuscript submission. We believe that the biochemical and functional data presented in the VOR clearly describe the molecular identity of solubilized Shh: it is monolipidated, lipoprotein-associated, and highly biologically active in two established Shh bioassays.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>One caveat is the heavy reliance on overexpression of Shh in a single cell line.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated by reviewer 1, the strength of our work is the use of a bicistronic SHH-Hhat system to consistently generate doubly lipidated ligand to determine the amount and lipidation status of SHH released into cell culture media. This unique system therefore eliminates the artifacts of protein overexpression. We have also added two other cell lines to our VOR that produce the same results (including Panc1 cells that endogenously produce Shh,
Supplementary Figure 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors detect Shh variants that are released independently of Disp and Scube2 in secretion assays, but these are excluded from interpretation as experimental artifacts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer correctly points out, these variants are released independently of Disp and Scube2, both of which are known as essential release factors in vivo. These variants are
therefore by definition experimental artifacts. The forms we have included in our analysis are the alternative forms that are clearly dependent on Dispatched and Scube2 for their
release - as shown in the first figure in the manuscript, and in pretty much every other figure after that.</p>
<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Key shortcomings include the unusual normalization strategies used for many experiments and the lack of quantification/statistical analyses for several experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the updated version of the paper, we have addressed all of this reviewer's criticisms. Most importantly, we have performed several additional experiments to address the concern that unusual normalization strategies were used in our paper and that quantification and statistical analyses were lacking for several experiments. We have now analyzed the full set of release conditions for Shh and engineered proteins from Disp-expressing n.t. control cells and Disp-/- cells both in the presence and absence of Scube2 (Figure 1A'-D', Figure 2E added to the paper, Figure 3B'-D', Figure 5C and Figure S2F-H). Previously, we had only quantified protein release from n.t. controls and Disp-/- cells in the presence but not in the absence of Scube2 under serum-depleted conditions. Quantifications of serum-free protein release and Shh release under conditions ranging from 0.05% FCS to 10% FCS were completely missing from the earlier versions of the manuscript, but have now been added to our paper. In addition, we have reanalyzed all of the data sets in the above figures, as well as Figures 2C and S1B, to address the issue of &quot;unusual normalization strategies&quot;: unlike previous assays in which the highest amount of protein detected in the media was set to 100% and all other proteins in that experiment were expressed relative to that value, we now directly compare the relative amounts of cellular and corresponding solubilized proteins as a method to quantify release without the need for data normalization (Figs. 1A'-D', 2C,E, 3B'-D', E, 5C, Fig. S1B, S2F-H).</p>
<p>We have also repeated the qPCR analyses in C3H10T1/2 cells and now show that the same Shh/C25AShh activities can be observed when using another Shh responsive cell line, NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4B, 6B, fig. S5B).</p>
<p>We would like to point out that if the criticism refers to the presentation of our RP-HPLC and SEC data, the normalization of the strongest eluted protein signal to 100% for all proteins tested is necessary to put their behavior in a clearer relationship. This is because only the relative positions of protein elution, and not their amounts, are important in these experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The significance of the data provided is overstated because many of the presented experiments confirm/support previously published work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To mitigate the first reviewer's comment that the significance of the data presented is overstated, we now clearly distinguish between our novel results and the known aspect of Hh release on lipoproteins throughout our paper. We now clearly describe what is new and important in our paper: First, contrary to the general perception in the field, Disp and Scube2 are not sufficient to solubilize Shh, casting doubt on the currently accepted model that Scube2 accepts dual-lipidated Shh from Disp and transports it to the receptor Ptch. Second, lipoproteins shift dual Shh processing to N-terminal peptide processing only to generate different soluble Hh forms with different activities (as shown in Figure 4C). Third, and again contrary to popular belief, this new release mode does not inactivate Shh, as we now show in two established cellular assays for Hh biofunction (Figures 4A-C, 5B'', 6B and S5C-G). Fourth, and most importantly, we show that spatiotemporally controlled, Disp-, Scube2- and HDL-mediated Shh release absolutely requires dual lipidation of the membrane-associated Shh precursor prior to its release. This finding (as shown in Figures 1 and S2) changes the interpretation of previously published in vivo data that have long been interpreted as evidence for the requirement of dual Shh lipidation for full receptor binding and activation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The study provides a modest advance in our understanding of the complex issue of Shh membrane extraction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we agree that our results integrate our novel observations into previously established concepts of Hh release and trafficking, we also hope that our data cast well-founded doubt on the current view that the issue of Hh release and trafficking is largely resolved by the model of Disp-mediated Shh hand-over to Scube2 and then to Ptch, which requires interactions with both Shh lipids. Our data show that this is clearly not the case in the presence of lipoproteins. Thus, the significance of our data is that models of Shh lipid-regulated signaling to Ptch obtained using the dual-lipidated Shh precursor prior to its Disp- and Scube2-mediated conversion into a delipidated or monolipidated, HDL-associated soluble ligand are likely to describe a non-physiological interaction. Instead, our work describes a highly bioactive soluble ligand with only one lipid still attached, which has not been described before in the literature. The in vivo endpoint analyses presented in Fig. S8 suggest that this new protein variant is likely to play an important role during development.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The precise molecular identity (of the released Shh) remains to be defined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to respond that the direct comparison of soluble proteins and their well-defined double-lipidated precursors side-by-side in the same experiment, as shown in our paper, determines all relevant molecular changes in the Shh release process. Most importantly, we show by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC that HDL restricts Shh processing to the N-terminus and that the absence of HDL results in double processing of Shh during its release. We also show by SEC that the C-terminus binds the protein to HDL. In addition, the fly experiments confirm the requirement for N-terminal Hh processing, but not for processing of the C-terminal peptide, and suggest that the N-terminal Cardin-Weintraub sequence replaced by the functionally blocking tag represents the physiological cleavage site.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be important to demonstrate key findings in cells that secrete Shh endogenously.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now confirm the key findings of our study in Panc1 cells that endogenously produce and secrete Shh: As shown in Fig. S1D, we find that soluble proteins are processed but retain the C-cholesterol, which we now directly confirm by RP-HPLC (Fig. S4F-H). The in vivo analyses shown in Fig. S8 suggest that the key finding - that N-terminal but not C-terminal Hh shedding is required for release - can be supported, at least in the fly: here, Hh variants impaired in their ability to be processed N-terminally strongly repress the endogenous protein, whereas the same protein impaired in its ability to be processed C-terminally does not.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors detect Shh variants that are expressed independently of Disp and Scube2 in secretion assays, but are excluded from interpretation as experimental artifacts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer's criticism that the amounts of Shh released independently of Disp and Scube2 in secretion assays were not quantified and analyzed statistically to justify their proposed status as not physiologically relevant. We now show that these forms are indeed secretion artifacts (Fig. 3E and Fig. S2F-H show quantification of the lower electrophoretic mobility protein fraction (i.e., the &quot;top&quot; band representing the double-lipidated soluble protein fraction)) because this fraction is released independently of Disp and Scube2.</p>
