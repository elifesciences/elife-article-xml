<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> within the host macrophages requires the virulence regulator PhoP, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Because growing evidence connects PhoP with varying stress response, we hypothesized that the level of 3ʹ,5ʹ cAMP, one of the most widely used second messengers, was regulated by the <italic>phoP</italic> locus, linking numerous stress response with cAMP production. A transcriptomic analysis discovers that PhoP functions as a repressor of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) Rv0805, which hydrolytically degrades cAMP. The most fundamental insight is derived from the PhoP-dependent regulation of <italic>rv0805</italic> expression by specific recruitment of the regulator within the promoter region of the PDE. Consistent with these results, absence of PhoP or ectopic expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> independently accounts for elevated PDE synthesis and depletion of intra-mycobacterial cAMP level. Thus, genetic manipulation to inactivate PhoP-<italic>rv0805</italic>-cAMP pathway leads to disruption of cAMP homeostasis, decreased stress tolerance and reduced survival of the bacilli.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>There is substantial change in the manuscript. We have taken out part of the previous version and expanded it as an independent story as the other part is already published in 2022.
(1) While Ritesh Sevalkar, Sangita Kachchap and Balwinder Singh were omitted from the authorship of this article, Navin Baid was included as an author of this version. Accordingly, we have updated author affiliations.
(2) As mentioned above one part of the previous preprint version of the manuscript describing CRP PhoP interaction and PhoP promoting CRP recruitment have been taken out from this version of the manuscript. However, the other part describing mechanism of PhoP-dependent regulation of Rv0805 expression has been included in this version of the manuscript. Effectively, although the content of the first three (3) figures (Figs. 1-3) of the bioRxiv preprint are largely similar to the current version (with relatively minor change), figures 4-7 of the bioRxiv preprint which relates to PhoP-CRP protein-protein interaction are absent in the present version of the manuscript. Thus, Fig.3 and Fig.6 studying regulation of Rv0805 expression and depicting the schematic model, respectively are entirely new additions to the present version of the manuscript. Consequently, supplemental files are updated accordingly.
Collectively, the revised manuscript underwent substantial updating of the content; for example, new data sets added, old data sets eliminated, results re-analysed, discussion and supplemental information expanded.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the causative agent of pulmonary tuberculosis, keeps encountering diverse environmental conditions during infection, persistence and transmission of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ehrt <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ernst, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Russell, 2011</xref>). However, the intracellular pathogen is exceptionally capable to adjust and survive within diverse intracellular environments. Mycobacterial adaptive response to different stages of infection is achieved via fine tuning of regulation of gene expression using an extensive repertoire of more than 100 transcriptional regulators, 11 two-component systems, 6-serine-threonine protein kinases and 13 alternative sigma factors suggesting that a very complex transcriptional program is important for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis. While regulation of gene expression as a consequence of interaction of tubercle bacilli with its immediate environment remains critically important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rohde <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), defining these regulatory pathways represent a major challenge in the field.</p>
<p>3’, 5’- cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), one of the most widely used second messengers, impacts on a wide range of cellular responses in microbial pathogens including <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">McDonough &amp; Rodriguez, 2011</xref>). The bacterial genome encodes at least 15 adenylate cyclases, including one of the adenylate cyclases (Rv0386) which is required for virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), and multiple cAMP regulated effector proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Banerjee <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Johnson &amp; McDonough, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">McDonough &amp; Rodriguez, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shenoy &amp; Visweswariah, 2006</xref>). cAMP levels are elevated upon infection of macrophages by pathogenic mycobacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bai <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) and addition of exogenous cAMP was shown to influence mycobacterial protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gazdik &amp; McDonough, 2005</xref>). While intra-bacterial cAMP respond to macrophage environment and carry out specific functions like gene expression and protein function under host-related conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bai <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bai <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Johnson <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Johnson &amp; McDonough, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Knapp &amp; McDonough, 2014</xref>), secreted cAMP controls macrophage signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gazdik <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Johnson <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nambi <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ranganathan <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rittershaus <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Importantly, cAMP signalling remains essential to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis. Agarwal and colleagues had shown that bacterial cAMP burst, upon infection of macrophages, improved bacterial survival by interfering with host signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). In keeping with this, anti-tubercular compounds that interfere with mycobacterial cAMP levels also impact intracellular growth of mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bai <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Johnson <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Knapp <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nambi <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rittershaus <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">VanderVen <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wilburn <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Together, these results underscore the significance of cAMP signalling in mycobacteria.</p>
<p>cAMP signalling is controlled at the transcriptional level. Previous <italic>in silico</italic> studies had identified two out of 10 predicted nucleotide binding proteins of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> as members of the CRP/FNR superfamily of transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">McCue <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). These are CRP (cyclic AMP Receptor protein), encoded by <italic>rv3676</italic> and CMR (cAMP macrophage regulator), encoded by <italic>rv1675c</italic>, respectively. Off these two, CRP becomes activated upon cAMP binding, and functions as a global regulator of ∼100 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bai <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rickman <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Consequently, deletion of the <italic>crp</italic> locus significantly impairs mycobacterial growth and attenuates virulence of the bacilli in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rickman <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). In contrast, CMR is necessary for regulated expression of genes involved in virulence and persistence including members of the dormancy regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gazdik <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ranganathan <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Together, these results strongly suggest that balanced synthesis and degradation of cAMP contributes to rapid adaptive response of mycobacteria in a hostile intracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Johnson &amp; McDonough, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">McDonough &amp; Rodriguez, 2011</xref>). However, very little is known about the underlying mechanism of mycobacterial cAMP homeostasis.</p>
<p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> encounters a hostile environment within the host. Among the hostile conditions is the acidic pH stress and exposure to host immune effectors such as NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nathan &amp; Shiloh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rustad <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wayne &amp; Sohaskey, 2001</xref>). A growing body of evidence connects virulence-associated mycobacterial <italic>phoP</italic> locus with varying environmental conditions, including acid stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramovitch <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bansal <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tan <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), heat-shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sevalkar <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Singh <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) and integration of acid stress response to redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Baker <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Baker <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goar <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Disruption of <italic>phoP,</italic> the gene encoding the response regulator of the PhoPR two-protein regulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gupta <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) significantly reduces <italic>in vivo</italic> multiplication of the bacilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Walters <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), suggesting that PhoPR remains essential for virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Perez <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Moreover, the mutant lacking this system shows a significantly lowered synthesis of cell-wall components diacyltrehaloses, polyacyltrehaloses, and sulfolipids, specific to pathogenic mycobacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gonzalo Asensio <italic>et al</italic>, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Goyal <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Walters <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In fact, the significant attenuation of <italic>phoPR</italic> deletion strain forms the basis of the mutant being considered in trials as a vaccine strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arbues <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Recent transcriptomic analyses uncovered that approximately 2% of the H37Rv genome is regulated by PhoP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Solans <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Walters <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), and mycobacterial gene expression in response to acidic pH significantly overlaps with the PhoP regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rohde <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this, a large subset of PhoPR-regulated low-pH-inducible genes are induced immediately following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> phagocytosis and remain induced during macrophage infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gonzalo Asensio <italic>et al</italic>, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Martin <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Perez <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Walters <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Additional evidences coupled with more recent results suggest that during onset of macrophage infection, PhoPR activation is linked to acidic pH and the available carbon source, suggesting a physiological link between pH, carbon source, and macrophage pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Baker <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we hypothesized that intra-mycobacterial cAMP level could be determined by the <italic>phoP</italic> locus since the major regulator has been implicated in regulation of bacterial responses against numerous stress conditions, many of which function as signals to activate cAMP synthesizing diverse adenylate cyclases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Knapp &amp; McDonough, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, our results connect virulence regulator PhoP with intra-mycobacterial cAMP level. We discovered that PhoP regulates expression of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase <italic>rv0805</italic>, which hydrolytically degrades cAMP. To further probe the regulation, we demonstrate that under the condition which activates PhoP-PhoR system, PhoP in a PhoR-dependent mechanism represses transcription of <italic>rv0805</italic> through direct DNA binding at the upstream regulatory region. These observations account for a consistently lower level of cAMP in a PhoPR-deleted <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (<italic>phoPR</italic>-KO) relative to the WT bacilli, and establishes the molecular mechanism of cAMP homeostasis, absence of which strikingly impacts phagosome maturation, and reduces mycobacterial survival within macrophages and mice. Together, the newly identified mechanism of cAMP homeostasis represents a molecular checkpoint during intra-phagosomal survival and growth program of mycobacteria.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Intra-mycobacterial cAMP level is regulated by the <italic>phoP</italic> locus</title>
<p>As stress conditions are often linked to variation of cAMP levels, we compared cAMP levels of WT and <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO mutant (mutant lacking both copies of <italic>phoP</italic> and <italic>phoR</italic>), grown under normal and specific stress conditions, like NO stress and acid stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO showed a significantly lower level of cAMP relative to the WT bacilli, both under normal and stress conditions. More importantly, complementation of the mutant (Compl.) could restore cAMP to the WT level. Because bacterial growth often varies under stress conditions, and growth inhibition can influence cAMP level, we compared viability of mycobacterial strains under normal and indicated stress conditions (conditions of cAMP measurements) by determining the bacterial CFU (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> - figure supplement 1). Note that for <italic>in vitro</italic> viability under specific stress conditions, indicated mycobacterial strains were grown to mid log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.4-0.6) and exposed to acidic media (7H9 media, pH 4.5(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gouzy <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) for further two hours at 37°C. Likewise, for NO stress, cells grown to mid-log phase were exposed to 0.5 mM DetaNonoate for 40 minutes. Our results suggest that WT and <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO under carefully controlled stress conditions display comparable viability, indicating that variation in viable cell counts of the mutant under specific stress conditions do not account for lower cAMP level. From these results, we conclude that PhoP plays a major role in maintaining intra-mycobacterial cAMP level.</p>

<p>(A) Intra-mycobacterial cAMP levels were determined by a fluorescence-based assay as described in the Methods, and compared for indicated mycobacterial strains, grown under normal or specific stress conditions. For acid stress, mycobacterial strains were initially grown to mid-log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.4 to 0.6), and then it was transferred to acidic pH (7H9 media, pH 4.5) for further 2 hours of growth at 37°C. For NO stress, cells grown to mid-log phase were exposed to 0.5 mM DataNonoate for 40 minutes. The data represent average values from three biological repeats (*P≤0.05, **P≤0.01). (B) To compare secretion of cAMP by WT and <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, cAMP levels were also determined in the corresponding culture filtrates (CF). (C) Immunoblotting analysis of 10 µg of cell lysates (CL) and 20 µg of culture filtrates (CF) of indicated <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains. α-GroEL2 was used as a control to verify cytolysis of cells, CFP-10 detected as a secreted mycobacterial protein in the culture filtrates, and RpoB used as the loading control.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>To investigate the possibility that <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO secretes out more cAMP and therefore, shows a lower cytoplasmic level, we compared cAMP secretion of WT and the mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The WT and mutant strains were grown as described in the Methods and culture filtrates (CF) as well as cell lysates (CL) were collected as described previously (Anil Kumar <italic>et al</italic>, 2016). Our results demonstrate that the mutant reproducibly secretes lower amount of cAMP relative to the WT bacilli, and cAMP secretion is fully restored in the complemented mutant (Compl.). As the fold difference of secretion (∼ 1.25-fold) is not much different relative to the fold difference in intra-mycobacterial cAMP level (∼2-fold), we conclude that most likely lower cAMP level of the mutant is not due to its higher efficacy of cAMP secretion. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> confirms absence of autolysis of mycobacterial cells as GroEL2 was undetectable in the culture filtrates (CF).</p>

<p>We next investigated role of the <italic>phoP</italic> locus on expression of mycobacterial adenylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which synthesize and degrade cAMP, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The selection of adenylate cyclases (ACs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs) were based on two key points. First, we have chosen ACs which are activated by known signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Knapp &amp; McDonough, 2014</xref>). Secondly, we reasoned that the previously reported ACs were activated under environmental conditions, which are linked to mycobacterial <italic>phoP</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bansal <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goar <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Our RT-qPCR results using gene-specific primer pairs (Table S1) suggest that expression of adenylate cyclases including <italic>rv0386</italic>, <italic>rv1264</italic>, <italic>rv1647</italic> and <italic>rv2488c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dass <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dittrich <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Knapp &amp; McDonough, 2014</xref>) do not appear to be regulated by the <italic>phoP</italic> locus. However, a significant activation of adenylate cyclase <italic>rv0891c</italic> (4±0.05-fold), and repression of phosphodiesterase <italic>rv0805</italic> expression (6.5±0.7-fold), respectively, were dependent on the <italic>phoP</italic> locus. Although Rv0891c was suggested as one of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv adenylate cyclases, the protein lacks most of the important residues conserved for adenylate cyclase family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zaveri <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>rv0805</italic> encodes for a cAMP specific PDE, present only in slow growing pathogenic <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Matange <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Although expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> was restored at the level of WT in the complemented mutant (Compl.), we observed poor restoration of expression of <italic>rv0891c</italic> in the Compl. strain. Further, expression of PDE <italic>rv1339</italic> which contributes to mycobacterial cAMP level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Thomson <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>) remains unaffected by the <italic>phoP</italic> locus. Therefore, we focussed our attention on the biological significance of PhoP-dependent regulation of <italic>rv0805</italic>. It should be noted that expressions of <italic>rv1357c</italic> and <italic>rv2837c</italic>, encoding PDEs for cyclic di-GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Flores-Valdez <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) and cyclic di-AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Valadares &amp; Woo, 2017</xref>), respectively, remained unchanged in <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO.</p>

<p>As we reproducibly observed activation of <italic>rv0805</italic> expression in <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO (relative to WT), we investigated whether acidic pH conditions under which <italic>phoPR</italic> system is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramovitch <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bansal <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), impacts expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> in WT bacilli (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Our results show that repression of <italic>rv0805</italic> is significantly higher in WT grown under acidic conditions (pH 4.5) relative to normal conditions (pH 7.0) of growth. This observation is consistent with RNA-seq data displaying significant down-regulation of <italic>rv0805</italic> in WT bacilli grown under acidic pH conditions relative to normal conditions of growth (GEO Accession number: GSE180161). As a control, expression of PDE <italic>rv1339</italic> which also degrades cAMP, remains unaffected under acidic conditions of growth. The finding that acidic pH (pH4.5) conditions of growth promoted PhoP-dependent repression of <italic>rv0805</italic>, prompted us to investigate whether PhoP directly binds to <italic>rv0805</italic> promoter. To this end, we next examined <italic>in vivo</italic> recruitment of PhoP within the <italic>rv0805</italic> promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). In this assay, formaldehyde-cross-linked DNA-protein complexes of growing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cells were sheared to generate fragments of average size ≍500 bp. Next, ChIP experiments utilized anti-PhoP antibody, and IP DNA was analysed by real-time qPCR relative to a mock sample (without antibody as a control) using FPrv0805up/RPrv0805up as the primer pair (Table S1). Our results show that under normal condition (empty bars) rv0805up showed an insignificant enrichment of PCR signal for PhoP relative to non-specific (16S rRNAup) recruitment (compare empty bars with black bars). This is suggestive of low affinity rv0805up binding of PhoP. However, IP samples from cells grown under acidic pH showed a significant enrichment of PhoP at the <italic>rv0805</italic> promoter (compare empty bars with black bars). Notably, ChIP data showing PhoP recruitment under acidic pH conditions is in agreement with low pH-specific impact of PhoP on <italic>rv0805</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Note that PhoP binding to <italic>msl3</italic> promoter region (msl3up) was used as a positive control.</p>

<p>(A-B) To determine the impact of PhoR (the cognate sensor kinase of PhoP), expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> was compared in indicated <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv strains: (A) <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO<italic>::phoP</italic> (<italic>phoPR</italic> mutant complemented with <italic>phoP</italic>) and (B) <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO<italic>::phoPR</italic> (<italic>phoPR</italic> mutant complemented with <italic>phoP-phoR</italic>) under normal and acidic conditions of growth.

Notably, similar to <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, WT-Rv0805 (but not WT-Rv0805M) showed a considerably lower level of cAMP relative to WT bacteria.

<p>To examine the effect of Rv0805 on mycobacterial cAMP level, we next expressed a copy of <italic>rv0805</italic> in WT bacteria (referred to as WT<bold><italic>-</italic></bold>Rv0805) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). <italic>rv0805</italic> ORF was cloned within the multicloning site of pSTki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Parikh <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>) between the EcoRI and HindIII sites under the control of P<sub>myc1</sub><italic>tetO</italic> promoter, and ectopic expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> was verified by determining the mRNA level (Figure 3 - figure supplement 1A). We then assessed the impact of Rv0805 on intra-mycobacterial cAMP. Consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), WT-Rv0805 showed a significant depletion (2.1± 0.7-fold) of intra-mycobacterial cAMP relative to WT bacteria. To confirm that the reduced level of mycobacterial cAMP is attributable to <italic>rv0805</italic> expression, we also expressed <italic>rv0805M</italic>, a mutant Rv0805 lacking phosphodiesterase activity. As structural data coupled with biochemical evidences reveal that Asn-97 at the enzyme active site plays a key role in phosphodiesterase activity of Rv0805 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), the mutant Rv0805M was constructed by changing the conserved Asn-97 to Ala. Most importantly, WT-Rv0805M showed an insignificant variation of cAMP level relative to WT, suggesting that depletion of intra-mycobacterial cAMP in WT-Rv0805 is indeed attributable to phosphodiesterase activity of Rv0805. However, the corresponding mRNA levels of PDEs in WT suggest that both the WT and mutant Rv0805 are over-expressed approximately 4.5-6 -fold relative to the genomic <italic>rv0805</italic> level of WT (Figure 3 - figure supplement 1A). In contrast, other PDEs under identical conditions, demonstrate comparable expression levels in <italic>rv0805</italic> over-expressing strains and WT. Thus, we conclude that a significantly different protein levels is unlikely to account for variable cAMP levels in the two PDEs (WT and mutant Rv0805) over-expressing strains utilizing identical expression strategy. Notably, over-expression of these PDEs did not influence bacterial growth under normal conditions (Figure 3 - figure supplement 1B).</p>
<p>To further probe regulation of Rv0805 expression and its control of intra-mycobacterial cAMP homeostasis, we utilized a previously reported CRISPRi based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Singh <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) to construct <italic>rv0805</italic> and <italic>phoP</italic> knockdown (<italic>rv0805</italic>-KD, and <italic>phoP-KD</italic>, respectively) mutants. Importantly, consistent with <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, <italic>phoP</italic>-KD shows a significantly higher <italic>rv0805</italic> expression in the presence of ATc relative to its absence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). However, despite a significant down regulation of <italic>rv0805</italic> expression in presence of ATc, a comparable <italic>phoP</italic> expression was observed in <italic>rv0805</italic>-KD mutant both in the absence or presence of ATc. As a control, we observed a comparable expression of 16S rRNA in both knock-down mutants. Next, we determined intra-mycobacterial cAMP of the mutants as described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Importantly, cAMP level of <italic>phoP</italic>-KD (showing activation of Rv0805) was significantly lower relative to WT bacteria. In contrast, <italic>rv0805</italic>-KD mutant demonstrated a significantly higher level of cAMP relative to WT. Together, these data represent an integrated view of our results suggesting that PhoP-dependant repression of <italic>rv0805</italic> regulates intra-mycobacterial cAMP homeostasis. In keeping with these results, activated PhoP under acidic pH conditions significantly represses <italic>rv0805</italic>, and intracellular mycobacteria most likely utilizes a higher level of cAMP to effectively mitigate stress response for survival under stressful environment of the phagosome.</p>

However, all four mycobacterial strains showed comparable growth at pH 7.0. Next, to compare growth of WT-Rv0805 and WT under oxidative stress, cells were grown in presence of increasing concentrations of diamide, a thiol-specific oxidant, and examined by microplate-based Alamar Blue assays (Figure 4 - figure supplement 1A). We have recently shown that <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO is significantly more sensitive to diamide relative to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goar <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Here, we uncovered that similar to <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, WT-Rv0805, but not WT-Rv0805M was significantly more susceptible to diamide stress as compared to WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Notably, a previous study had reported that <italic>phoP</italic>-deleted mutant strain was more sensitive to Cumene Hydrogen Peroxide (CHP), suggesting role of PhoP in regulating mycobacterial transcriptome and stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Walters <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). To compare sensitivity to CHP, we next grew mycobacterial strains in presence of 50 µM CHP for 24 hours and determined their survival by enumerating CFU values (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Note that in this case we were unable to perform Alamar Blue-based survival assays requiring a longer time because of the bactericidal property of CHP. Our CFU data highlight that WT-Rv0805, but not WT-Rv0805M, displayed a significantly higher growth inhibition relative to WT in the presence of CHP. Together, these results demonstrate a comparably higher susceptibility of <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, and WT-Rv0805 to acidic pH and oxidative stress relative to WT and establish a link between cAMP homeostasis and mycobacterial stress response, suggesting that at least one of the mechanisms by which PhoP contributes to global stress response is attributable to maintenance of mycobacterial cAMP homeostasis.</p>

The data is normalized relative to WT grown in presence of 5 mM diamide.

Having shown a significantly higher sensitivity of WT-Rv0805 to low pH and oxidative stress (relative to WT), we sought to investigate whether altered cell wall structure/properties of the mycobacterial strain contribute to elevated stress sensitivity. Thus, we compared expression level of lipid biosynthetic genes, which encode part of cell-wall structure of the bacilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gonzalo Asensio <italic>et al</italic>., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Walters <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Our results clearly suggest that in contrast to <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, both WT-Rv0805 and WT-Rv0805M share a comparable expression profile of complex lipid biosynthesis genes as that of WT (Figure 4 - figure supplement 1B). These results suggest that both strains expressing WT- or the mutant PDEs share a similar cell-wall properties and are consistent with a recent study reporting no significant effect of cAMP dysregulation on mycobacterial cell wall structure/ permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>).

Although WT bacilli inhibited phagosome maturation, infection of macrophages with WT-Rv0805 and <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO matured into phagolysosomes, suggesting increased trafficking of the bacilli to lysosomes.

Note that <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, under the conditions examined, showed a ≍ 246-fold lower lung burden compared to WT.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A number of studies suggest that conditions associated with host environment like low pH, and macrophage interactions often influence mycobacterial cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bai <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gazdik &amp; McDonough, 2005</xref>). Although many bacterial pathogens modulate host cell cAMP levels as a common strategy, the mechanism of mycobacterial cAMP-homeostasis remains unknown. In this study, we sought to investigate whether PhoP, a master regulator implicated in controlling diverse mycobacterial stress response, is connected to mycobacterial cAMP level. Intriguingly, we find that under normal conditions as well as under carefully controlled single stress conditions, <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO shows a significantly lower level of cAMP relative to the WT bacilli (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and complementation of the mutant restored cAMP level. To investigate the mechanism, we next probed regulation of adenylate cyclases and PDEs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and unambiguously demonstrated that PhoP functions as a major repressor of <italic>rv0805</italic>, encoding cAMP specific PDE. Indeed, this newly-identified <italic>rv0805</italic> regulation, coupled with a very recent discovery that phosphodiesterase activity of Rv0805 controls propionate detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McDowell <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>), fits well with and explains, the previously puzzling <italic>in vivo</italic> observation by Abramovitch et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramovitch <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) that PhoP -controlled <italic>aprABC</italic> locus is associated with the regulation of genes of carbon and propionate metabolism.</p>
<p>Although a large number of ACs are present in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genome, a class III metallo-phosphoesterase Rv0805 was earlier considered the only PDE, specific for mycobacterial cAMP. However, a recent study has identified an atypical class II PDE Rv1339, which upon overexpression reduces cAMP level and contributes to antibiotic sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Thomson <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). While, the functional role of Rv1339 in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is yet to be understood, crystal structure and biochemical evidence suggest that dimeric Rv0805 is stabilized by the presence of a divalent cation, and remains catalytically active on a broad range of linear and cyclic PDE substrates <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Keppetipola &amp; Shuman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). More recently, cyclic nucleotide hydrolytic activity of mycobacterial Rv0805 has been implicated in propionate detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McDowell <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). However, the mechanisms of regulation of Rv0805 and maintenance of mycobacterial cAMP homeostasis remain unknown.</p>
<p>To examine biological significance of PhoP-dependent Rv0805 expression, we studied <italic>rv0805</italic> expression under acidic conditions of growth as <italic>phoPR</italic> system is induced under acidic pH both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramovitch <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bansal <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Strikingly, a significantly higher repression of <italic>rv0805</italic> expression under acidic pH relative to normal conditions is consistent with activation of PhoP and subsequent repression of <italic>rv0805</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These results further suggest that effective mitigation of stress response by mycobacteria possibly requires a higher cAMP level for survival under intra-phagosomal environment. The most fundamental biological insight is derived from the finding that PhoP-dependent <italic>rv0805</italic> repression requires PhoR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A-B</xref>), the cognate kinase which activates PhoP in a signal-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gupta <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). These results account for a consistently lower level of cAMP in <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO relative to the WT bacilli. Notably, except recently reported PDE Rv1339, Rv0805 has been known as the only cAMP-specific PDE present in the slow growing pathogenic mycobacteria and its closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Matange, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), and Rv1339 expression does not appear to be regulated by the <italic>phoP</italic> locus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, the above results showing PhoP-dependent repression of <italic>rv0805</italic> activity likely represents the most critical step of mycobacterial cAMP homeostasis. In this connection, our recent results that PhoP interacts with cAMP receptor protein, CRP and a complex of two interacting regulators control expression of virulence determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Khan <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), invite speculation of a complex regulatory control of cAMP-responsive mycobacterial physiology.</p>
<p>As one might argue that PhoP deletion and <italic>rv0805</italic> over-expression could be unrelated and independent events, we constructed <italic>phoP</italic> and <italic>rv0805</italic> knock-down mutants to further investigate the PhoP-Rv0805-cAMP pathway. Our objective was to probe regulation of expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) and examine the impact on mycobacterial cAMP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Importantly, <italic>phoP</italic>-KD significantly elevated <italic>rv0805</italic> expression; however, <italic>phoP</italic> expression remains unaffected in <italic>rv0805</italic>-KD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). More importantly, elevated <italic>rv0805</italic> expression in <italic>phoP</italic>-KD reduces cAMP level, whereas cAMP level is understandably elevated in <italic>rv0805</italic>-KD mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). These results integrate PhoP-dependent <italic>rv0805</italic> repression with mycobacterial cAMP level, suggesting how <italic>phoP</italic>-deletion or knock-down, at least in part, mimics Rv0805 over-expression. These considerations take on more significance given the fact that these two events have similar consequences on correspondingly relevant strains with respect to stress tolerance, and survival in cellular and animal models. Thus, our results appear to suggest that ectopic expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> is somewhat functionally equivalent to deletion of the <italic>phoP</italic> locus. This observation is in apparent conflict with a previous work by Matange and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Matange <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), suggesting a cAMP-independent transcriptional response in <italic>rv0805</italic> over-expressing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv. Although both studies were performed with <italic>rv0805</italic> over-expressing bacilli, the fact that important differences in the expression of PDEs in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Matange <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) and in our assays – yielding significantly different induction of <italic>rv0805</italic> expression - most likely account for this discrepancy. While we cannot completely rule out the possibility of cleavage of other cyclic nucleotide(s) by Rv0805 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Keppetipola &amp; Shuman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) impacting our results, consistent with a previous study our results correlate <italic>rv0805</italic> expression with intra-mycobacterial cAMP level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Further, our data on the effect of expression of cyclic nucleotide-specific PDE Rv0805 or its inactive mutant (Rv0805M) correlate well with enzyme activities of the corresponding PDEs on mycobacterial cAMP levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Thus, we conclude that PhoP-dependent regulation of <italic>rv0805</italic>, most likely, is a critical regulator of intra-mycobacterial cAMP level.</p>
<p>Our experiments to understand physiological significance of PhoP-dependent repression of <italic>rv0805</italic> expression uncovers a strikingly similar stress tolerance of WT-Rv0805 and <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO (significantly reduced relative to WT) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). These results are consistent with the notion that cAMP homeostasis, at least in part, accounts for mycobacterial stress response. Along the line, WT-Rv0805 displayed a reduced ability to inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion like <italic>phoPR-</italic>KO (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Further, we show that WT-Rv0805, unlike the WT bacilli or WT-Rv0805M, shows a significantly reduced intracellular growth in mice as that of <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, these results are of fundamental significance to establish that PhoP contributes to maintenance of cAMP homeostasis and integrates it to mechanisms of mycobacterial stress tolerance and intracellular survival. Together, we identify a novel mycobacterial pathway as a therapeutic target and provide yet another example of an intimate link between bacterial physiology and intracellular survival of the tubercle bacilli.</p>
<p>The results reported here are summarized schematically in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. According to this model, upon activation by an appropriate signal via the cognate sensor kinase PhoR, P∼PhoP binds to <italic>rv0805</italic> regulatory region and functions as a specific repressor of <italic>rv0805</italic>. Thus, we observed a reproducibly lower level of cAMP in <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO relative to the WT bacilli. However, from these results we are unable to claim that virulence attenuation of <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO is attributable to cAMP homeostasis or lack thereof. While this would demand uncoupling of regulatory control of PhoPR and <italic>rv0805</italic> expression, further support to PhoP-dependent <italic>rv0805</italic> repression was apparent from a significantly reduced expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> in WT bacilli grown under acidic pH, a condition which activates mycobacterial PhoPR system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramovitch <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bansal <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tan <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). In keeping with these results, we show comparable cAMP levels in <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO and WT-Rv0805. Thus, the above two strains remain ineffective to mount an appropriate stress response most likely due to their inability to coordinate regulation of gene expression because of dysregulation of cAMP homeostasis, facilitates an integrated view of our results. Given the fact that <italic>rv0805</italic>-depleted <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is growth attenuated <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McDowell <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), paradoxically ectopic expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> leads to dysregulated metabolic adaptation, thereby resulting in reduced stress tolerance and intracellular survival.</p>

<caption><title>Schematic summary of cAMP homeostasis and its impact on mycobacterial stress tolerance.</title>
<p>According to this model, upon activation by an appropriate signal via the cognate sensor PhoR, P∼PhoP binds to <italic>rv0805</italic> regulatory region and functions as a specific repressor by preventing access for mycobacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) to bind to the promoter and initiate transcription. In keeping with the PhoP-dependent <italic>rv0805</italic> repression, our results demonstrate a reproducibly lower level of cAMP in <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO relative to WT bacilli. Thus, <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO (or WT-Rv0805) remains ineffective to mount an appropriate stress response most likely due to its inability to coordinate regulated gene expression because of dysregulation of cAMP homeostasis, provides an explanation to their reduced stress tolerance. Together, these molecular events suggest that failure to maintain cAMP homeostasis most likely accounts for attenuated phenotype of the bacilli.</p></caption>

This approach efficiently inhibits expression of target genes via inducible expression of dCas9 along with gene specific guide RNAs (sgRNA).

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study describes how PhoP regulates cyclic-AMP production in the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that PhoP acts as a repressor of the cyclic-AMP-specific phosphodiesterase, Rv0805, which can degrade cyclic-AMP. The work requires substantive revision to clarify the presentation of the data, together with appending conclusions, and will be of interest to bacteriologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper reports how mycobacterial cAMP level is increased under stressful conditions and that the increase is important in the survival of the bacterium in animal hosts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors show that under different stresses the response regulator PhoP represses a phosphodiesterase (PDE) that degrades cAMP specifically. Identification of a PDE specific to cAMP is significant progress in understanding Mtb pathogenesis. An increase in cAMP apparently increases bacterial survival upon infection. On the practical side, the reduction of cAMP by increasing PDE can be a means to attenuate the growth of the bacilli. The results have wider implications since PhoP is implicated in controlling diverse mycobacterial stress responses and many bacterial pathogens modulate host cell cAMP level. The results here are straightforward, internally consistent, and of both theoretical and applied interests.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Repression of PDE promoter by binding of phosphorylated PhoP could have been shown at higher precision. The binding is now somewhere along a roughly 500 bp region. Although the regulation of PDE is shown to be by transcriptional repression only, it has been described as a homeostatic mechanism. The latter would have required a demonstration of both repression and activation by negative feedback.</p>
