<abstract>
<p>Animals navigate the auditory world by recognizing complex sounds, from the rustle of a predator to the call of a potential mate. This ability depends in part on the octopus cells of the auditory brainstem, which respond to multiple frequencies that change over time, as occurs in natural stimuli. Unlike the average neuron, which integrates inputs over time on the order of tens of milliseconds, octopus cells must detect momentary coincidence of excitatory inputs from the cochlea during an ongoing sound on both the millisecond and submillisecond time scale. Here, we show that octopus cells receive inhibitory inputs on their dendrites that enhance opportunities for coincidence detection in the cell body, thereby allowing for responses both to rapid onsets at the beginning of a sound and to frequency modulations during the sound. This mechanism is crucial for the fundamental process of integrating the synchronized frequencies of natural auditory signals over time.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Perception depends on the ability of neurons to encode discrete features of complex external stimuli. These computations are determined by the type of information received from the periphery, the nature and position of the synapses, and the biophysical properties of the target neuron. For instance, in the auditory system, spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) encode sound information from hair cells in the cochlea and distribute it to specialized target neurons in the cochlear nucleus complex (CNC) that extract individual elements of the original sound, such as frequency, phase, intensity, and timing. The outcome of each dedicated computation continues to be processed through parallel ascending pathways and ultimately to the cortex, where the auditory features are reassembled to generate a percept. Thus, understanding how these first computations are made is a key step towards deciphering the basis of perception.</p>
<p>To generate accurate percepts of complex auditory stimuli, neurons must compute both what frequencies are present and when those frequencies occur across multiple time scales. For instance, overlapping sound stimuli, such as two competing speakers in a noisy room, are perceptually distinguished by correctly binding together frequencies with coherent onsets that then continue to change together over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Such computations require coincidence detection that can accurately encode co-occurring frequencies with submillisecond precision. Frequency information is communicated by SGNs, whose auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) project through the eighth nerve, bifurcate, and spread tonotopically to fill each division of the CNC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In addition, SGNs fall into physiologically distinct subtypes that are recruited at different intensities, thereby allowing sounds to be detected across a wide dynamic range and in the presence of background noise. Many target neurons receive SGN inputs from a limited range of frequencies and fire at the onset of the sound, effectively breaking it up into its frequency components. This presents a challenge for perception as auditory circuits must ultimately bind together co-occurring frequencies while also retaining information about their sequence to locate and recognize sounds.</p>

<p>In the mammalian auditory system, precise encoding of broadband timing information begins with the octopus cells of the CNC. Octopus cells are excitatory neurons that bind together co-occurring frequency information on a submillisecond timescale and send this information along one of the parallel ascending pathways in the auditory brainstem. Octopus cells are named for their large-diameter tentacle-like dendrites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, which are oriented unidirectionally across a tonotopic array of SGNs such that each neuron integrates inputs from a wide range of frequencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. SGNs provide the major excitatory inputs onto octopus cells. Biophysically, octopus cells have low input resistances near rest (∼4MΩ), fast time constants (∼200µs), and large low-voltage-activated potassium (∼40nS at rest) and hyperpolarization activated (∼62nS at rest) conductances. Together these properties give these cells impressively narrow windows of coincidence detection on the order of 1 millisecond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. This combination of receiving SGN innervation across broad frequencies and their biophysical specializations establish octopus cells as spectrotemporal coincidence detectors that can reliably encode the timing of complex stimuli, such as the broadband transients found in speech and other natural sounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Fittingly, <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings from octopus cells demonstrate their ability to phase lock to broadband transients at rates up to 1kHz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, computational models of octopus cells demonstrate that onset responses are governed by the cell’s biophysical specializations and are, in large part, the result of temporal summation of excitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The simplicity of its connectivity combined with the precision of its temporal computations makes the octopus cell an attractive model for understanding how specialized anatomical and electrophysiological properties contribute to neuronal computations.</p>
<p>Although the octopus cell’s integration of SGN inputs within a very narrow time frame enables canonical coincidence detection, such a model does not explain how other temporal features of sound stimuli are encoded. Indeed, octopus cells encode spectrotemporal sequences within their broadly-tuned response areas, like frequency modulated sounds, that likely require further circuit specializations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Although threshold somatic depolarization can be sufficient to activate an octopus cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, the vast majority of synapses are found on dendrites. Further, SGN inputs are organized tonotopically along octopus cell dendrites, with inputs from high frequency regions located more distal than those from low frequency regions. Dendritic morphology, passive cable properties, active resting membrane properties, and the spatial and temporal relationship between synaptic inputs can all impact excitatory post synaptic potential (EPSP) summation as excitation sweeps across the dendritic arbor and towards the soma. This raises the possibility that computations made in the dendrites influence the effective window of coincidence detection by the octopus cell. Such mechanisms could enable flexible processing that is adaptive to the dynamics of the environment without compromising the fidelity of high-fidelity coincidence computations.</p>
<p>Here, we sought to define the circuit mechanisms that allow octopus cells to act as coincidence detectors across time scales. We generated a comprehensive anatomical and physiological map of excitatory and synaptic inputs onto octopus cell somas and dendrites and examined how this circuit organization influences octopus cell activation. Through a combination of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and computational modeling, we show that the somatic summation of excitation is shaped by dendritic inhibition. Thus, octopus cells depend on compartmentalized computations that enable preservation of timing information both at the moment of stimulus onset and within an extended window for evidence accumulation, which is fundamental for the spectrotemporal integration of natural auditory stimuli.</p>

<title>The balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses is different in somatic and dendritic domains</title>
<p>To determine the wiring pattern that drives octopus cell computations, we generated a detailed map of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Overall, octopus cells receive abundant excitatory VGLUT1+ innervation from SGNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and sparse inhibitory innervation from glycinergic neurons, as visualized using the glycinergic Cre driver <italic>Glyt2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> and the Ai34 synaptophysin-tdTomato (syp/tdT) fusion protein reporter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition, sparse inhibitory inputs nestle between SGN inputs, especially on octopus cell dendrites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Quantification of the number and distribution of presynaptic puncta onto octopus cells revealed marked differences in the ratio of excitation and inhibition in the somatic and dendritic compartments. Since innervation patterns have never been systematically analyzed, we made three-dimensional reconstructions of 16 octopus cells and their excitatory SGN (<italic>n</italic> = 8 cells, 4 mice) and inhibitory (<italic>n</italic> = 8 cells, 3 mice) inputs. Octopus cells were visualized using a <italic>Thy1</italic> reporter and presynaptic puncta were labeled with the syp/tdT reporter driven either by <italic>Foxg1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) or <italic>Glyt2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Consistent with qualitative assessment, the density of SGN inputs was higher (10.7 ± 3.0 SGN puncta/100µm<sup>2</sup>) than that of inhibitory inputs (4.2 ± 0.8 puncta/100µm<sup>2</sup>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Moreover, the relative proportions of excitatory and inhibitory inputs differed in the soma and dendrites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). On somas, SGNs provided dense innervation that continued on the proximal dendrite, then gradually declined with distance from the soma. By contrast, somas received very few inhibitory inputs. On dendrites, inhibitory puncta were evenly distributed. As a result, octopus cells have a strikingly different average ratio of excitatory and inhibitory puncta on the soma (7:1) and on the dendrite (5:2), suggesting that each compartment contributes differentially to the final computation made by the octopus cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p>

<title>The majority of excitatory synapses on octopus cells are from type Ia SGNs</title>
<p>Although uniformly glutamatergic, SGNs exhibit stereotyped physiological differences in response thresholds that could affect the nature of their inputs onto octopus cells and influence octopus cell coincidence detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. It was recently discovered that there are three molecularly distinct SGN subtypes, referred to as Ia, Ib, and Ic SGNs, which correlate with previously shown physiological groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Therefore, we further categorized excitatory inputs based on SGN subtype identity. These can be identified with the presence of <italic>Ntng1</italic>-dependent reporter expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> in Ib and Ic SGNs (Ib/c) and its absence in Ia SGNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, coupled with very low to undetectable levels of calretinin (CR-) in Ic SGNs, and moderate to high levels of calretinin (CR+, CR++) in Ib and Ia SGNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). <italic>Ntng1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>-labeled Ib/c SGNs accounted for 60.1 ± 2.6% of the entire population, with 28.5 ± 12.2% Ib SGNs, 31.6% Ic SGNs, and 39.9 ± 2.6% Ia SGNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>: <italic>n</italic> = 1599 neurons, 4 mice; mean ± SD). Further, proportions of SGN subtypes matched scRNA-seq estimates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), indicating that this approach provides full coverage. SGN subtype identity was further confirmed by examining the spatial organization of SGN peripheral processes <italic>en route</italic> to the IHCs in the cochlea (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 1A-C</xref>).</p>

<p>Within the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN), where octopus cells reside, <italic>Ntng1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> labeling was restricted to SGNs (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 1D</xref>). In the VCN, expression of <italic>Ntng1</italic>-tdT and CR in SGN central axons was consistent with the moderate to undetectable levels of CR in <italic>Ntng1</italic>-tdT SGN somas in the periphery (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2E</xref>). Thus, <italic>Ntng1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>-driven expression of syp/tdT is an appropriate tool for mapping subtype-specific connectivity onto octopus cells.</p>
<p>Reconstruction of <italic>Ntng1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>-labeled Ib/c puncta (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) demonstrated that octopus cells are dominated by inputs from Ia SGN fibers, which are the fibers with the lowest response thresholds and highest rates of spontaneous activity. Octopus cell dendrites received 4.1 ± 1.0 puncta/100µm<sup>2</sup> from Ib/c SGNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, magenta: <italic>n</italic> = 9 cells, 5 mice; mean ± SD), accounting for 38% of the total SGN density. Given that <italic>Ntng1</italic>-tdT+ cells account for 60.1% of the SGN population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, magenta), Ib/c inputs were underrepresented on octopus cells. Octopus cells receive similarly low innervation from Ic inputs (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2G-I</xref>: <italic>n</italic> = 6 cells, 2 mice), as estimated from the degree of sparse labeling of Ic axons achieved by <italic>Myo15</italic><sup>iCre</sup> reporter expression (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2A-F</xref>) and the expected proportion of Ic SGNs in the ganglion (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2F</xref>). By contrast, Ia SGNs, which comprise only ∼40% of the total population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, yellow), accounted for 62 ± 9.7% of SGN synapses on octopus cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, yellow: 6.6 ± 1.0 puncta/100µm<sup>2</sup>). All three subtypes showed the same overall distribution from the soma to the distal dendrite (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Together, excitatory and inhibitory puncta densities in the innervation maps indicate the average octopus cell receives ∼1035 SGN synapses (642 Ia SGN, 393 Ib/c SGN) and ∼354 inhibitory synapses. Additionally, the majority of synapses on the average octopus cell (83%) are found on dendrites, highlighting their critical role in the octopus cell computation.</p>
<p>Octopus cell reconstructions showed the same basic wiring patterns regardless of where each cell was positioned in the octopus cell area.

Octopus cells had similar morphologies (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 3E-G</xref>) and patterns of synaptic innervation (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 3H-M</xref>) regardless of where they were positioned along the tonotopic axis. Thus, we have established a wiring diagram that finds low threshold, Ia SGN synapses to be the primary input to both the soma and dendrites of octopus cells. Additionally, the whole-neuron wiring diagram identifies a dendritic domain where inhibitory synapses are approximately equal in number to the Ib/c excitatory synapses from the periphery.</p>

<title>SGN inputs to octopus cells facilitate at high stimulation frequencies</title>
<p>Whether or not an octopus cell responds to its inputs depends on when and how EPSPs travel to and then summate in the soma.

<title>Glycine evokes inhibitory post synaptic potentials that are occluded by a low input resistance</title>
<p>Given the increased density of inhibitory synapses on octopus cell dendrites, we considered the possibility that somatic and dendritic compartments contribute differently to the temporal computation made by octopus cells. A role for inhibition has never been incorporated into octopus cell models as previous efforts failed to reveal physiological evidence of functional inhibitory synapses onto octopus cells either <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> or <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Similarly, we did not observe light-evoked (<italic>Glyt2</italic>-ChR2<italic>)</italic> inhibitory post synaptic potentials (IPSPs) in octopus cell somas during whole-cell current clamp recordings from P30-45 mice. Since inhibitory synapses are located primarily on octopus cell dendrites, we posited that their voltage spread to the soma is limited given the extremely low input resistance of octopus cell somas.</p>
<p>To decrease electrotonic isolation of the dendrites and increase input resistance, we pharmacologically blocked voltagegated potassium (K<sub>v</sub>) and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels using 100µM 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) and 50µM ZD 7288 (ZD). This cocktail increased octopus cell membrane resistance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). To isolate inhibition, 15µM 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX) was added to block AMPA receptor activation. Consistent with our hypothesis, the increase in input resistance unveiled light-evoked IPSPs in recordings from octopus cell somas (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).

<p>To determine the types of glycinergic receptors contributing to IPSPs, we pharmacologically blocked subsets of glycine receptors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). IPSPs were reduced upon addition of 20µM picrotoxin (PTX), which blocks homomeric glycine receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Sequential addition of 100µM cyclothiazide (CTZ), which blocks α2-containing homomeric and heteromeric glycine receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, nearly abolished the remaining IPSPs, and responses were fully abolished with further application of 500nM STN. Collectively, these data demonstrate that glycinergic synaptic contacts onto octopus cell dendrites are functional. Additionally, glycine receptor subunit composition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) implicates a role for both large conductance extrasynaptic β-subunit lacking homomeric receptors and synaptically localized α2β receptors with slower kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To confirm whether the confinement of IPSPs to the dendrites is consistent with our understanding of octopus cell biophysics, we developed an improved biophysically and anatomically accurate model of octopus cells based on our findings (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. This model performed as predicted based on our experimental results. As in our current-clamp recordings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), removal of K<sup>v</sup> and HCN conductances in the model changed the input resistance and current-voltage relationship of the neuron, resulting in reduced electronic isolation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, blue). In control conditions, stimulation of dendritic glycinergic conductances induced negligible hyperpolarizing voltage changes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, black). With increased input resistance, dendritic IPSPs measured at the soma were similar to <italic>in vitro</italic> recordings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-F</xref>). Thus, this model confirms that dendritic IPSPs can elicit somatic hyperpolarization in octopus cells when electrotonic dendritic isolation is reduced.</p>
<p>While blocking K<sub>v</sub> and HCN allowed us to reveal IPSPs at the soma, 4-AP increases the duration of the already unphysiological ChR2-evoked presynaptic action potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, resulting in altered release probabilities and synaptic properties, amongst other caveats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. To directly confirm that the increase in somatically-measured IPSP amplitude can be explained by changes in input resistance alone, we used the octopus cell model to simulate dendritic glycinergic conductances and measure changes in dendritic current and somatic potential amplitude in the presence of blocked K<sub>v</sub> and HCN channels. K<sub>v</sub> and HCN block and the resulting change in input resistance increased the magnitude of soma-measured IPSPs for all glycine conductances (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>, blue). Dendrite-measured currents did not change as a result of the hyperpolarization induced by K<sub>v</sub> and HCN block regardless of synaptic location on the dendrites or the magnitude of the glycine conductance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>, dark orange, light orange).

<title>Inhibition decreases the magnitude and advances the timing of dendritic SGN inputs</title>
<p>SGN synapses onto octopus cell dendrites are arranged tonotopically, with higher frequency SGNs from the base of the cochlea terminating on the distal dendrites and lower frequency SGNs from more apical positions terminating more proximally (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This organization has been proposed to re-synchronize coincidentally firing SGNs that are activated at slightly different times due to the time it takes for the sound stimulus to travel from the base to the apex of the cochlea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. To test how inhibition in the dendrites shapes coincidence detection, we first used our model to explore the influence of simultaneous activation of inhibitory and excitatory synapses at varying locations along the dendritic tree. By placing inhibitory synapses on proximal or distal dendrites and moving the relative location of excitation, we modelled the effect of on-path and off-path inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> on somatically recorded EPSPs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 5</xref>).

Thus, the presence of inhibition appears to enable modulation of EPSP timing in dendritic compartments during continuous auditory stimuli when inhibition can be recruited beyond the onset of a sound and thus allow for adaptable temporal processing during the duration of a stimulus.</p>

<p>To directly test if the model’s prediction that temporally coincident excitation and inhibition affects the timing and amplitude of excitatory SGN inputs as they travel towards the octopus cell soma, we coincidently activated SGNs and glycinergic inputs <italic>in vitro</italic>. In these experiments, the octopus cell properties were not altered pharmacologically and inhibition was undetectable or only visible with averaging over many sweeps (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, blue). When synaptic inhibition was evoked together with excitation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, green), the soma-recorded EPSPs were smaller than when excitation was evoked alone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, black: <italic>n</italic> = 8 cells, 6 mice). ChR2-evoked inhibition decreased EPSP heights by 25.2 ± 9.0% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>, green) and shifted the peak of EPSPs forward 57.5 ± 26µs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>, green). This effect was mimicked by bath application of 25µM glycine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G-H</xref>, blue: <italic>n</italic> = 4 cells, 3 mice). Further, bath application of 1µM STN had the opposite effect, resulting in larger EPSPs, delayed peak times, and increased half-widths (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-H</xref>, orange: <italic>n</italic> = 5 cells, 4 mice). Thus, the timing of EPSP arrival may be shaped both by the release of synaptic glycine and by tonically active glycine channels. Of note, many SGNs also terminate on the octopus cell soma, where inhibition is minimal. This suggests that the octopus cell’s ability to act as a coincidence detector depends on two stages of compartmentalized computations, one in the dendrite that combines excitation and inhibition to provide important information about which frequencies co-occur in a complex sound stimulus and one in the soma that is restricted by the rigid temporal summation window for coincidence detection. Together with the electrotonic properties of the octopus cell and the dominance of low threshold, low jitter Ia SGN inputs, these combined computations can enable reliable coincidence detection and proper cross-frequency binding needed for perception of sound.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Coincidence detection plays a critical role in many cognitive and perceptual processes, from the ability to localize sound, to the binding of auditory and visual features of a common stimulus. Depending on the computation, the temporal window for integration can range widely, thereby requiring circuitry with distinct anatomical and physiological properties. Here, we describe a two-domain mechanism for coincidence detection that can detect co-occurring frequencies with different degrees of precision. By mapping and selectively activating synaptic inputs onto octopus cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a computational model, we revealed that compartmentalized dendritic nonlinearities impact the temporal integration window under which somatic coincidence detection computations are made. The arrival of many small, reliable excitatory inputs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) from low-threshold SGNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) is continuous throughout an ongoing stimulus. We demonstrate that glycinergic inhibition to octopus cell dendrites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) can shift the magnitude and timing of SGN EPSPs as they summate in the soma (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>,<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The narrow window for coincidence detection computations allows the octopus cell to respond with temporal precision using momentary evidence provided by SGNs at the onset of the stimulus. We propose that, as a stimulus persists, inhibition onto octopus cell dendrites can adjust the timing of excitation before arriving at the soma for the final input-output computation. This allows the cell to make an additional computation with a slightly longer window for evidence accumulation without compromising the accuracy of the somatic onset computation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<p>As coincidence detectors in the auditory system, octopus cells are faced with the challenge of recognizing complex sounds that include many frequencies that co-occur from the beginning to the end of the stimulus. As shown by <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, octopus cells respond well to cues that include complex spectrotemporal patterns, including frequency modulations beyond the onset of the stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Given that the auditory environment is filled with overlapping sound stimuli, such responses presumably allow the octopus cell to encode which frequencies belong to which sound. Our data thus support the role of octopus cells beyond simple onset coincidence detectors that rely solely on the temporal summation of excitation. The results suggest that, despite high K<sub>v</sub> and HCN conductances at rest, the addition of dendritic inhibition transforms the magnitude and timing of SGN signals as they arrive in the cell body, which may expand their response selectivity and allow them to become a slightly leakier integrator and thus accumulate evidence beyond onsets. Although, this inhibition is difficult to detect because of shunting, our data demonstrate that it is both present and impactful.</p>
<p>As well as needing to work beyond onsets, an effective coincidence detector in the auditory system must also function reliably across a range of sound intensities. Intensity information is encoded by the number and types of SGNs that are activated in the cochlea. The Ia, Ib, and Ic molecular subtypes defined in mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> broadly correspond to the anatomically and physiologically defined subtypes described across species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. We find that the majority of inputs onto octopus cells come from Ia SGNs, which most closely correspond to the low-threshold, high-spontaneous rate population. Consistent with this result, single-unit SGN recordings in cats demonstrated a bias towards low-threshold, high-spontaneous rate axon collaterals in the octopus cell area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Low-threshold SGNs are also characterized by short first spike latencies and low temporal jitter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. A hallmark of the octopus cell is the fact that it only fires action potentials when many SGN inputs are activated within a narrow period of time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. The presence of many low-threshold and temporally precise inputs on the octopus cell may help ensure that coincidence detection still works reliably for quiet sounds. Further, Ia inputs onto octopus cells do not exhibit paired-pulse depression, not unlike low levels of depression seen in Ia inputs to bushy cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. The presence of SGN inputs without paired-pulse depression could be beneficial for encoding sustained auditory signals. Finally, although Ia SGNs are over-represented, Ib and Ic inputs are also present. Since precise, low-threshold SGN responses can be saturated by background noise such that responses to relevant stimuli are masked<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, recruitment of higher threshold SGNs at higher sound intensities may compensate for this tradeoff.</p>
<p>The presence of inhibitory inputs onto dendrites is a fundamental feature of the nervous system and, in other systems, contributes to a neuron’s final computation. For example, direction selectivity computations in dendrites of retinal cells require excitation-inhibition interactions in dendritic compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. In pyramidal cells of the cortex and hippocampus, the spatial distribution of inhibition impacts dendritic non-linearities in a branch selective manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. However, octopus cells do not share all mechanisms for dendritic computation as neurons in the cortex and hippocampus. The lack of backpropagating action potentials and dendritic calcium spikes in octopus cells causes submillisecond timing differences in dendritic summation of coincident excitation and local inhibition to be consequential in subthreshold computation before somatic action potential generation.</p>
    <p>Although this work uncovers a role for inhibition, understanding of octopus cell computations is limited by the fact that it remains unclear what kind of information is carried by inhibitory inputs. Although the presence of presynaptic glycinergic puncta in the octopus cell area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> and glycinergic receptor expression in octopus cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup> is well established, it is unknown where this glycinergic innervation originates. Of the local neurons within the CNC that provide inhibition to the VCN, there is no evidence of connections to octopus cells from D-Stellate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, L-Stellate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>, or tuberculoventral cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. Outside of the CNC, terminal degeneration experiments in cats suggested the superior periolivary nucleus (SPON) and the ventral division of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL) as potential sources of descending inhibition to the octopus cell area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. Octopus cells provide excitatory input to both the SPON<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup> and the VNLL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup>, raising the possibility of feedback inhibition from the auditory brainstem as a circuit mechanism for elongated temporal summation windows during ongoing stimuli. Although feedback inhibition is not rapid enough to prevent or alter the onset response that octopus cells are well-known for, it could limit the duration of a response or change the effective coincidence detection window as the stimulus continues. Future studies will be required to identify the source of inhibition and its organization along the dendrites. If inhibitory inputs tonotopically match the local, narrowly-tuned dendritic SGN inputs, it is possible that frequency matched inhibition could influence spectral selectivity or feature extraction. On the other hand, broadly tuned inhibition could reduce depolarization block or serve as a temporal milestone that signals gaps or offsets. Further characterization of <italic>in vivo</italic> octopus cell responses in complex sound environments may clarify the effect of noise on signal detection and could reveal additional features of this cell’s contributions to perception of the auditory world.</p>

<p>All procedures were approved by and conducted in accordance with Harvard Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male and female mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) were bred on a C57BL/6 background at the Harvard Center for Comparative Medicine or obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed in groups of up to five animals and maintained on a 12hr light/dark cycle. Transgenic alleles were heterozygous for each transgene for all experimental animals. Descriptions of allele combinations for all experiments can be found in <bold>Supplemental Table 1</bold>.</p>
<p>Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and their central auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) were targeted using either <italic>Foxg1</italic><sup>tm1.1(Cre)Ddmo</sup> (<italic>Foxg1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup> or <italic>Foxg1</italic><sup>Flp</sup>, both of which drive robust reporter expression neurons in the auditory and vestibular ganglion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup> and the neocortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup>, but not in brainstem or midbrain neurons. <italic>Foxg1</italic><sup>Flp</sup> mice were generated by crossing the <italic>Foxg1</italic><sup>tm1.1Fsh</sup> mouse line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref></sup> with the Tg(EIIa-Cre)C5379Lmgd mouse line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup>, then backcrossing to isolate the flp transgene and remove the Cre transgene.</p>

<title>Histology and Reconstructions</title>
<p>For immunohistochemical labeling, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with 15mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a peristaltic pump (Gilson). Whole skulls containing brain and cochlea were immediately transferred to 20mL of 4% PFA and post-fixed overnight at 4°C. Fixed brains and cochlea were removed from the skulls and washed with 0.1M PBS.</p>
<p>Brains were collected from mice of both sexes, aged 28-38 days, and embedded in gelatin-albumin hardened with 5% glutaraldehyde and 37% PFA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref></sup>. Sections were cut at 35, 65, or 100μm with a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1000S) and free-floating tissue was collected in 0.1M PBS. For sections less than 65μm, tissue was permeabilized and nonspecific staining was blocked in a solution of 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% normal donkey serum (NDS, RRID: AB_2337258) in 0.1M PBS for 1 hour. After blocking, tissue was treated with primary antibody in a solution containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% NDS in PBS for 1-2 nights at room temperature. Primary antibodies used were: chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, RRID:AB_10000240), rabbit anti-RFP (1:1000, RRID:AB_2209751), goat anti-calretinin (1:1000, RRID:AB_1000034), and guinea pig anti-VGLUT1 (1:500, RRID:AB_887878). Sections were washed in 0.1M PBS then incubated in a secondary antibody solution (1:1000) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% NDS for 2-3hrs at room temperature. Tissue sections were mounted on charged slides and coverslipped (Vectashield Hardset Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI), and imaged using a Zeiss Observer.Z1 confocal microscope.</p>
<p>For 100μm sections, tissue was washed in CUBIC-1A solution for 1hr for strong permeabilization and delipidization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref></sup>. Tissue was then further permeabilized and nonspecific staining was blocked in a solution of 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% NDS in 0.1M PBS for 1hr. After blocking, tissue was treated with primary antibody in a solution containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% NDS in PBS for 4 nights at 37°C. Primary antibodies used were: chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, RRID:AB_10000240), and rabbit anti-RFP (1:1000, RRID:AB_2209751). Sections were then incubated in a secondary antibody solution (1:400) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% NDS for 4 nights at 37°C. Tissue sections were pre-incubated in CUBIC2 solution, then temporarily mounted on uncharged slides with CUBIC2 solution for immediate imaging using a Zeiss Observer.Z1 confocal microscope.</p>
<p>Octopus cells and synaptic puncta were reconstructed in Imaris (Oxford Instruments). YFP signal from the target octopus cell was used to generate a surface reconstruction and mask syp/tdT signal. Dendrites were reconstructed using the masked YFP signal and separated into 10μm increments. Masked syp/tdT puncta were marked and localized to a 10μm increment of the dendritic tree. Synapse counts, dendrite metrics, and masked channels were exported to Excel (Microsoft) for further analysis.</p>
<p>Cochlea were collected from mice of both sexes, aged 28-42 days. The bony labyrinth of the inner ear was decalcified in 0.5M ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) for 3 nights at 4°C and embedded in gelatin-albumin hardened with 5% glutaraldehyde and 37% PFA. Sections were cut at 65μm with a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1000S) and free-floating tissue was collected in 0.1M PBS. Sections were washed in CUBIC-1A solution for 1hr for strong permeabilization and delipidization. Tissue was further permeabilized and nonspecific staining was blocked in a solution of 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% NDS in 0.1M PBS for 1hr.

<title>Acute Slice Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Data were obtained from mice of both sexes, aged 24-47 days. Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with 3mL of 35°C artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF; 125mM NaCl, 25mM glucose, 25mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5mM KCl, 1.25mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.4mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.6mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, pH adjusted to 7.45 with NaOH). For high calcium concentration experiments presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, ACSF contained 125mM NaCl, 25mM glucose, 25mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5mM KCl, 1.25mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.4mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.3mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>. Mice were rapidly decapitated and the brain was removed and immediately submerged in ACSF. Brains were bisected and 250μm slices were prepared in the sagittal plane with a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1200S; Leica Systems). Prepared slices were incubated for 30min at 35°C, then allowed to recover at room temperature for at least 30min. ACSF was continuously bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Whole-cell recordings were conducted at 35°C using a Multiclamp 700B (Molecular Devices) in current-clamp mode with experimenter adjusted and maintained bridge balance and capacitance compensation. Data were filtered at 12kHz, digitized at 83–100kHz, and acquired using pClamp9 (Molecular Devices). Neurons were visualized using infrared Dodt gradient contrast (Zeiss Examiner.D1; Zeiss Axiocam 305 mono). Glass recording electrodes (3–7MΩ) were wrapped in parafilm to reduce capacitance and filled with an intracellular solution containing 115mM K-gluconate, 4.42mM KCl, 0.5mM EGTA, 10mM HEPES, 10mM Na<sub>2</sub>Phosphocreatine, 4mM MgATP, 0.3mM NaGTP, and 0.1% biocytin, osmolality adjusted to 300mmol/kg with sucrose, pH adjusted to 7.30 with KOH. All membrane potentials are corrected for a 11mV junction potential.</p>
<p>For optogenetic activation, full-field 470nm blue light was presented through a 20x immersion objective (Zeiss Examiner.D1). Onset, duration, and intensity of light was controlled by a Colibri5 LED Light Source (Zeiss). For electrical stimulation, glass stimulating electrodes were placed in the auditory nerve root and 20µs current pulses were generated with a DS3 current stimulator (Digitimer).</p>

<title>Computational Modelling</title>
<p>Computer simulations were performed using the NEURON 8.2 simulation environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref></sup>, with an integration time constant of 25µs. The morphology of the octopus neuron was obtained from McGinley et al., 2012. The active and passive properties of the model were optimized to match the experimental recordings. We set the passive parameters as follows: internal or axial resistance (R<sub>i</sub> or R<sub>a</sub>) to 150Ω.cm, membrane resistance (R<sub>m</sub>) to 5KΩ.cm<sup>2</sup>, capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) to 0.9µF/Cm<sup>2</sup> and resting membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) to -65mV. We included the following ion-channel conductances in our morphologically realistic octopus neuron model: Fast Na<sup>+</sup> (<italic>ḡ</italic><sub><italic>NA</italic></sub>), low-voltage activated K<sup>+</sup> (<italic>ḡ</italic><sub><italic>KLT</italic></sub>), high threshold K<sup>+</sup> (<italic>ḡ</italic><sub><italic>KHT</italic></sub>), fast transient K<sup>+</sup> (<italic>ḡ</italic><sub><italic>KA</italic></sub>), hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated HCN (<italic>ḡ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>), leak K<sup>+</sup> (<italic>ḡ</italic><sub><italic>leak</italic></sub>). The kinetics of all the active ion-channel conductances were obtained from Manis and Campagnola, 2018 and the maximal conductance was optimized to match experimental data. We introduced a scaling factor (scl) to scale the maximal conductance to match the sag and input resistance of the experimental recordings (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 4</xref>). Reversal potentials for HCN, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> respectively were (in mV), E<sub><italic>h</italic></sub>= -38, E<sub><italic>Na</italic></sub>= 50 and E<sub><italic>K</italic></sub>= -70. Excitatory AMPA synaptic conductance and Inhibitory glycine synaptic conductance were introduced in the proximal and distal dendrites to test the impact of dendritic inhibition on the EPSP height and peak time. The rise and decay time of AMPA and glycine conductance were set to 0.3ms and 3ms respectively, to mimic the fast synaptic transients observed in octopus cells. The reversal potential of AMPA and glycine conductance was set to 0 and -80mV respectively.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> work analyzes how specialized cells in the auditory cells, known as the octopus cells, can detect coincidences in their inputs at the submillisecond time scale. While previous work indicated that these cells receive no inhibitory inputs, the present study unambiguously demonstrates that these cells receive inhibitory glycinergic inputs. The physiologic impact of these inputs needs to be studied further. It remains <bold>incomplete</bold> at present but could be improved by addressing caveats related to similar sizes of excitatory postsynaptic potentials and spikes in the octopus neurons.</p>

<p>Kreeger and colleagues have explored the balance of excitation and inhibition in the cochlear nucleus octopus cells of mice using morphological, electrophysiological, and computational methods. On the surface, the conclusion, that synaptic inhibition is present, does not seem like a leap. However, the octopus cells have been in the past portrayed as devoid of inhibition. This view was supported by the seeming lack of glycinergic fibers in the octopus cell area and the lack of apparent IPSPs. Here, Kreeger et al. used beautiful immunohistochemical and mouse genetic methods to quantify the inhibitory and excitatory boutons over the complete surface of individual octopus cells and further analysed the proportions of the different subtypes of spiral ganglion cell inputs. I think the analysis stands as one of the most complete descriptions of any neuron, leaving little doubt about the presence of glycinergic boutons.</p>
<p>Kreeger et al then examined inhibition physiologically, but here I felt that the study was incomplete. Specifically, no attempt was made to assess the actual, biological values of synaptic conductance for AMPAR and GlyR. Thus, we don't really know how potent the GlyR could be in mediating inhibition. Here are some numbered comments:</p>
<p>(1) &quot;EPSPs&quot; were evoked either optogenetically or with electrical stimulation. The resulting depolarizations are interpreted to be EPSPs. However previous studies from Oertel show that octopus cells have tiny spikes, and distinguishing them from EPSPs is tricky. No mention is made here about how or whether that was done. Thus, the analysis of EPSP amplitude is ambiguous.</p>
<p>(2) For this and later analysis, a voltage clamp of synaptic inputs would have been a simple alternative to avoid contaminating spikes or shunts by background or voltage-gated conductances. Yet only the current clamp was employed. I can understand that the authors might feel that the voltage clamp is 'flawed' because of the failure to clamp dendrites. But that may have been a good price to pay in this case. The authors should have at least justified their choice of method and detailed its caveats.</p>
<p>(3) The modeling raised several concerns. First, there is little presentation of assumptions, and of course, a model is entirely about its assumptions. For example, what excitatory conductance amplitudes were used? The same for inhibitory conductance? How were these values arrived at? The authors note that EPSGs and IPSGs had peaks at 0.3 and 3 ms. On what basis were these numbers obtained? The model's conclusions entirely depend on these values, and no measurements were made here that could have provided them. Parenthetical reference is made to Figure S5 where a range of values are tested, but with little explanation or justification.</p>
<p>(4) In experiments that combined E and I stimulation, what exactly were time timecourses of the conductance changes, and how 'synchronous' were they, given the different methods to evoke them? (had the authors done voltage clamp they would know the answers).</p>
<p>(5) Figure 4G is confusing to me. Its point, according to the text, is to show that changes in membrane properties induced by a block of Kv and HCN channels would not be expected to alter the amplitudes of EPSCs and IPSCs across the dendritic expanse. Now we are talking about currents (not shunting effects), and the presumption is that the blockers would alter the resting potential and thus the driving force for the currents. But what was the measured membrane potential change in the blockers? Surely that was documented. To me, the bigger concern (stated in the text) is whether the blockers altered exocytosis, and thus the increase in IPSP amplitude in blockers is due BOTH to loss of shunting and increase in presynaptic spike width. Added to this is that 4AP will reduce the spike threshold, thus allowing more ChR2-expressing axons to reach the threshold. Figure 4G does not address this point.</p>
<p>(6) Figure 5F is striking as the key piece of biological data that shows that inhibition does reduce the amplitude of &quot;EPSPs&quot; in octopus cells. Given the other uncertainties mentioned, I wondered if it makes sense as an example of shunting inhibition. Specifically, what are the relative synaptic conductances, and would you predict a 25% reduction given the actual (not modeled) values?</p>
<p>(7) Some of the supplemental figures, like 4 and 5, are hardly mentioned. Few will glean anything from them unless the authors direct attention to them and explain them better. In general, the readers would benefit from more complete explanations of what was done.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kreeger et.al provided mechanistic evidence for flexible coincidence detection of auditory nerve synaptic inputs by octopus cells in the mouse cochlear nucleus. The octopus cells are specialized neurons that can fire repetitively at very high rates (&gt; 800 Hz in vivo), yield responses dominated by the onset of sound for simple stimuli, and integrate auditory nerve inputs over a wide frequency span. Previously, it was thought that octopus cells received little inhibitory input, and their integration of auditory input depended principally on temporally precise coincidence detection of excitatory auditory nerve inputs, coupled with a low input resistance established by high levels of expression of certain potassium channels and hyperpolarization-activated channels.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors used a combination of numerous genetic mouse models to characterize synaptic inputs and enable optogenetic stimulation of subsets of afferents, fluorescent microscopy, detailed reconstructions of the location of inhibitory synapses on the soma and dendrites of octopus cells, and computational modeling, to explore the importance of inhibitory inputs to the cells. They determined through assessment of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic densities that spiral ganglion neuron synapses are densest on the soma and proximal dendrite, while glycenergic inhibitory synaptic density is greater on the dendrites compared to the soma of octopus cells. Using different genetic lines, the authors further elucidated that the majority of excitatory synapses on the octopus cells are from type 1a spiral ganglion neurons, which have low response thresholds and high rates of spontaneous activity. In the second half of the paper, the authors employed electrophysiology to uncover the physiological response of octopus cells to excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Using a combination of pharmacological blockers in vitro cellular and computational modeling, the authors conclude that glycine in fact evokes IPSPs in octopus cells; these IPSPs are largely shunted by the high membrane conductance of the cells under normal conditions and thus were not clearly evident in prior studies. Pharmacological experiments point towards a specific glycine receptor subunit composition. Lastly, Kreeger et. al demonstrated with in vitro recordings and computational modeling that octopus cell inhibition modulates the amplitude and timing of dendritic spiral ganglion inputs to octopus cells, allowing for flexible coincidence detection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work combines a number of approaches and complementary observations to characterize the spatial patterns of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input, and the type of auditory nerve input to the octopus cells. The combination of multiple mouse lines enables a better understanding of and helps to define, the pattern of synaptic convergence onto these cells. The electrophysiology provides excellent functional evidence for the presence of the inhibitory inputs, and the modeling helps to interpret the likely functional role of inhibition. The work is technically well done and adds an interesting dimension related to the processing of sound by these neurons. The paper is overall well written, the experimental tests are well-motivated and easy to follow. The discussion is reasonable and touches on both the potential implications of the work as well as some caveats.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the conclusions presented by the authors are solid, a prominent question remains regarding the source of the glycinergic input onto octopus cells. In the discussion, the authors claim that there is no evidence for D-stellate, L-stellate, and tuberculoventral cell (all local inhibitory neurons of the ventral and dorsal cochlear nucleus) connections to octopus cells, and cite the relevant literature. An experimental approach will be necessary to properly rule out (or rule in) these cell types and others that may arise from other auditory brainstem nuclei. Understanding which cells provide the inhibitory input will be an essential step in clarifying its roles in the processing of sound by octopus cells.</p>
<p>The authors showed that type 1a SGNs are the most abundant inputs to octopus cells via microscopy. However, in Figure 3 they compare optical stimulation of all classes of ANFs, then compare this against stimulation of type 1b/c ANFs. While a difference in the paired-pulse ratio (and therefore, likely release probability) can be inferred by the difference between Foxg1-ChR2 and Ntng1-ChR2, it would have been preferable to have specific data with selective stimulation of type 1a neurons.</p>
