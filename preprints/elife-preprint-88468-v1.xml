<title>Abstract</title><p>Influenza A virus acutely transcribes viral mRNAs from the eight segmented viral genome when it infects. The kinetics of viral transcription, nuclear export of viral transcripts, and their potential variation between the eight segments are poorly characterised. Here we introduce a statistical framework for estimating the nuclear export rate of each segment from a snapshot of mRNA <italic>in situ</italic> localisation at a single time point, exploiting the cell-to-cell variation observed by an imaging-based <italic>in situ</italic> transcriptome assay. A mathematical modelling indicated that the relationship between the nuclear ratio and the total count of mRNAs in single cells is dictated by a proxy for the nuclear export rate. Using this model, we showed that the two influenza viral antigens hemagglutinin and neuraminidase were the slowest segments in the nuclear export, suggesting that influenza A virus uses the nuclear retention of viral transcripts to delay the expression of antigenic molecules. Our framework presented in this study can be widely used for investigating the nuclear retention of nascent transcripts produced in a transcription burst.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Temporal gene expression is of vital importance for viral pathogens to proliferate in the host. Human exogenous retroviruses insert their RNA genome into the host chromatin and use host factors to minimise the viral protein production to evade the immune response and persist in the host <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In contrast, influenza A virus acutely infects the respiratory tract and produces thousands of viral progenitors in a single round of infection to spread in the surrounding epithelial cells by transcribing and replicating its RNA genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Influenza A virus genome is segmented into eight single-stranded RNAs, and expression of each gene is essential for productive infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Unlike the human exogenous retroviruses, influenza A virus does not seem to have a sophisticated mechanism of controlling the viral gene expression at the transcription level. However, it has been known for decades that hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), the two influenza viral antigens targeted by the host immune response, are produced late during the course of infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, a mechanism of which is currently unclear.</p>
<p>Eight viral RNA segments are transcribed by the same set of molecular machinery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Viral genome is contained in the viral envelope in association with viral proteins. The 5′ and 3′ ends of each viral genomic RNA hybridise to form an intramolecular loop <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza A virus, comprising PB1 (polymerase basic 1), PB2 (polymerase basic 2), and PA (polymerase acidic) subunits, is associated with the 5′ and 3′ joint end; the rest of the loop is bound by the oligomeric viral nucleoprotein (NP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNPs) initiates the viral transcription in the nucleus by deriving a 5′-capped short RNA fragment from the host nascent RNA on the stalled RNA polymerase II (Pol II) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. At the end of transcription, the viral polymerase adds a poly-A tail to the viral mRNA by stuttering on a short uridine repeat in the viral RNA template <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, eight viral segments sharing the common mechanism of viral transcription with no additional layers of transcriptional controls e.g., transcription-factor binding, the transcription of eight influenza viral genes is likely to occur at the same rate across the segments that is determined by the collision of the vRNP and the stalled Pol II.</p>
<p>Another possible factor that would determine the rate of transcription is the length of viral RNA template <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, given that the duration of transcription is rate-limiting. However, this does not agree with the order of protein expression in the influenza virus infection: PB2 (2.4 kb), PB1 (2.3 kb) and PA (2.2 kb), the three longest viral genes, and NP (1.8 kb) are expressed first, followed by the expression of three segments HA (1.8 kb), NA (1.5 kb) and M (1.0 kb) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A third possibility is the nuclear retention of viral mRNAs. Nuclear retention of mRNAs has gained an attention as a point of control on the protein expression in the context of transcription burst <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Previous studies reported the accumulation of M mRNAs in the nuclear speckles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, NXF1-dependent nuclear export of HA, NA and M mRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, and the nuclear export inhibition by the host factor hnRNPAB for M, HA, NP and NS mRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. It is becoming clear that the influenza viral segments show differential dependencies on the nuclear export factors; and this dependency is not accounted for by the RNA structure (i.e., whether they are intron-less, unspliced or spliced). Because an incomplete set of viral segments was studied in each of these studies, the influenza viral mRNA transport remains elusive.</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce a statistical framework for systematically quantifying the nuclear transport across all the eight viral segments. We localised eight viral mRNAs simultaneously in single cells <italic>in situ</italic>. Intracellular distribution of viral mRNAs indicated that the nuclear export rate of viral transcripts varied according to the segments. A statistical model, exploiting cell-to-cell variation in the abundance of transcripts due to the stochastic nature of multiple virological processes prior to the onset of viral transcription, allowed for the estimation of nuclear export rate from the intracellular distribution of mRNAs observed at a single time point. With this model, we show that hemagglutinin and neuraminidase mRNAs were the slowest in exiting the nucleus, suggesting that influenza A virus uses nuclear retention of mRNAs to delay the production of antigenic molecules in the course of viral infection. This study demonstrates that the nuclear export rate of nascent transcripts can be estimated from a snapshot of RNA <italic>in situ</italic> measurement in single cells, and our result serves as a reference for the nuclear export rate of viral transcripts across the segments, shedding light on the comprehensive understanding on the nuclear export of viral transcripts.</p>

<title>Diffraction-limited, single-colour imaging of viral mRNAs</title>
<p>First, we used single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH) to study the viral transcription of PB1, HA, NP and NS. The lung carcinoma cell line A549 was infected with the WSN strain of influenza A virus at the multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) of ∼2 for two hours, and the viral mRNAs were visualised with a tile of short oligonucleotide probes, each labelled with a single fluorophore <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Viral mRNAs were detected as single diffraction-limited spots in the three-dimensional image stacks, allowing for absolute mRNA quantification (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We localised the mRNAs in 3D and counted the total number of mRNAs in each cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The median number of mRNAs per cell was 145, 231, 310 and 303 molecules for PB1, HA, NP and NS, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), in line with the theoretical prediction that the rate of mRNA production is partly determined by the gene length.</p>
<p>What came intriguingly was the intracellular distribution of mRNAs of the four segments. The intracellular distribution of mRNAs projected on the XY plane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) indicated that the HA mRNAs were more abundant in the nucleus compared to the other three segments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>We wished to quantify the nuclear ratio of mRNAs in each cell. The mRNA count within the 2D nuclear projection is considered to be a good approximation for the number of mRNAs contained in the nucleus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We validated this approximation for the lung epithelial A549 cells used in this study by looking at the intracellular Z positions of mRNAs: The mRNAs within the nuclear projection would have higher Z positions over the cell baseline, considering that the nucleus has a diameter of several microns, much thicker than the cytoplasm in the cell periphery. To this end, mRNAs were segmented into three regions in the 2D projection, that is, nuclear, perinuclear and peripheral, depending on the relative location to the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). In contrast to the perinuclear (orange) and peripheral (green) mRNAs, mRNAs within the nuclear projection (blue) were distributed around the nuclear focal plane Z = 0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>); and about 80% of mRNAs in the nuclear projection (blue) were above the cell baseline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>), defined by the median of the Z distribution of peripheral mRNAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>, red dashed line). Thus, in this paper, we consider the spots within the nuclear 2D projection to be the nuclear fraction for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p>With this approximation, about 30% of the PB1, NP and NS mRNAs were nuclear, while ∼70% of HA mRNAs were in the nuclear fraction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), confirming the visual inspection that the HA mRNAs are more abundant in the nucleus at the early time point of infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). This result indicates that the velocity of viral mRNA export from the nucleus varies according to the viral segments. Note that our fluorescent probes could also detect complementary RNA (cRNA), an intermediate RNA that is produced for the viral genome replication, as it has the same polarity as viral mRNA. However, the fluorescent signals detected at 2 hours post-infection are deemed to be from the mRNAs, because cRNA production occurs much later than the mRNA synthesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Mapping eight viral mRNAs in single cells by multiplex RNA FISH</title>
<p>Next, we wish to simultaneously quantify all the eight viral segments <italic>in situ</italic>. To this end, we applied MERFISH (multiplex error-robust RNA FISH) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, an imaging-based transcriptome assay in which multiple rounds of probe hybridisation and imaging are performed to identify hundreds to thousands of mRNA species <italic>in situ</italic> by decoding binary fluorescent signals. For example, hundreds of distinct mRNAs can be encoded in 16-bit binary signals, in which case eight rounds of hybridisation and imaging would be required to read out the signals with two fluorophores <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In our case of detecting eight influenza A virus segments, 6 bits were sufficient to accommodate all the eight mRNAs, with each code being separated by two or more binary flips from others (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Thus, only three rounds of hybridisation and two-colour imaging were required. We sought for an economical way of performing sequential rounds of hybridisation and imaging, instead of setting up a custom- built, automated liquid pumping system used elsewhere <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Inspired by an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution assay of molecular motors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we assembled a flow cell on a slide glass, comprising two stripes of double-sided tape and the coverslip, with cells on the coverslip facing inwards (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Liquids were introduced from the right open side and wicked from the left. During image acquisition, the two open sides were sealed with rubber cement. This easy implementation of flow cell allowed us to comfortably perform three rounds of hybridisation and two-colour imaging to read out the 6-bit binary tags; and by decoding the 6-bit encodings, the eight viral segments were identified in each cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). On average, about 100-200 molecules of each segment were contained per cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, top row). The difference in the total number of spots from the result presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> is likely due to the batch effect (experimental variation).</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> An overview of the assay. The viral mRNAs were hybridised with the encoding probes, and then the amplification probes were annealed (not shown in the diagram for simplicity).

<graphic xlink:href="536075v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>The nuclear fraction of mRNAs varied between the viral segments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, bottom row): While ∼30% of mRNAs were nuclear for PB1, NP and NS segments, about 70% of mRNAs remained in the nucleus for HA and NA segments; for the other segments (PB2, PA and M), around half of mRNAs were in the nucleus. This reiterates the idea that the velocity of viral mRNA export from the nucleus varies according to the viral segments. These results were confirmed by smFISH using probes for each segment that were synthesised economically in-house (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary figure 1A, B and C</xref>).</p>
<p>Single-cell clustering according to the abundance of eight viral segments revealed that the cell population was heterogeneous in terms of the abundance of viral mRNAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). A pair-wise analysis of the abundance of viral segments indicated inequal distribution of viral mRNAs, regardless of the segments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>): Cells that carry abundant mRNAs from one segment tend to also carry abundant mRNAs from the other segments. These observations suggest that the viral transcription is susceptible to the stochastic variation in each infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, which we subsequently used in our statistical model to estimate the nuclear export rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Estimating the nuclear export rate using population statistics</title>
<p>We suspected that the higher nuclear ratio of HA and NA mRNAs is due to the slower nuclear export rate for these mRNAs compared to other segments such as NP and NS. Thus, we wished to quantify the nuclear export rate of eight viral mRNA species from the observed nuclear-to-cytoplasmic distribution. To this end, we conceptualised a statistical model using the cell-to-cell variation in the abundance of viral transcripts of each segment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In this model, influenza viral particles are added to the cell population at time 0 h, and are allowed to undergo viral attachment to the cell surface, membrane fusion, and vRNP migration to the nucleus. The waiting time for these processes vary in each infection due to the stochastic nature of biochemical events <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, and therefore, the onset of viral transcription varies from cell to cell in the population. In other words, each cell will have a varying duration for viral transcription by the time the observation is made at time 2 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, top). As a result, the population contains front runners in which the viral transcription was initiated early, and therefore abundant viral transcripts are carried; slow starters in which the transcription began late, containing fewer transcripts; and many other cells that lie along the spectrum between the two. The cell population at the single point in time, therefore, forms a trajectory of the time development of viral transcription and subsequent nuclear export on the scale of nuclear fraction against the abundance of transcripts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, bottom): In a spontaneous transcription burst, the nascent transcripts emerge in the nucleus at the early stage of the burst, and they are exported to the cytoplasm as more transcripts are being synthesised <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Indeed, when the nuclear ratio of viral mRNA was plotted against the total quantity of mRNA molecules observed by multiplex RNA FISH in each cell, the plots formed a curve that originated from top left (i.e., nearly 100% of the nuclear ratio when a cell contained a few mRNA molecules), and descended as the number of mRNA molecules increased (30% to 70%, depending on the segments) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>We further validated this concept by performing smFISH measurements along the time-course with 40-min interval (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). A549 was infected with WSN at the M.O.I of ∼0.02. At each time point, the NP mRNAs were stained and quantified. At the beginning (0 and 40 min), the mRNA count was almost zero. As the mRNA count increased (80 min to 200 min post-infection) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, top), the nuclear ratio against the total mRNA count derived from the single cells progressed along a curve, from the top left to the bottom right (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, bottom), supporting the concept of our statistical model.</p>
<p>The curvature of the trace appeared to vary between segments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). We explored to see if the curvature could represent a proxy for the nuclear export rate. Thus, we formulated a simple kinetic model in which mRNAs are synthesised at the rate <italic>k</italic> in the nucleus, and are exported with the reaction constant ε (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In this model, the molar concentrations of mRNAs in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments are described, respectively,

The nuclear fraction φ described in equation (<xref rid="eqn5" ref-type="disp-formula">5</xref>) is time-independent, and the parameter α determines the curvature of the line that the single cells would trace in the time-course (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Thus, we estimated the parameter α by fitting to the observed data points derived at the time in which cells were fixed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). By obtaining the synthesis rate <italic>k</italic> from the total number of mRNAs produced by the time of fixation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, top row), the nuclear export rate ε for each segment was derived according to equation (6) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). The nuclear export rate ε agreed with the historical classification of the early and late influenza A virus genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, indicating that the timing of influenza A virus protein expression in the initial stage of infection is determined by the velocity of the nuclear export. Notably, the HA and NA mRNAs had the slowest nuclear export rate, suggesting that influenza A virus delays the viral antigen production by nuclear retention of viral transcripts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on the stochastic nature of influenza viral transcription studied by single-cell sequencing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we introduced a quantitative framework for estimating the nuclear export rate of viral mRNAs to advanced our current understanding on the kinetics of viral gene expression. This was achieved by <italic>in situ</italic> localisation of eight influenza A virus segments simultaneously, coupled with the statistical model that allowed for estimating the nuclear export rate from the intracellular distribution of mRNAs at a single time point. This is based on the concept that the cells in the population are at various stages of transcription at the time the observation is made, due to the multiple stochastic processes the virus needs to overcome before it begins transcription. We demonstrated that the initiation of each viral transcription is concurrent in the eight viral segments; it is instead the nuclear export rate that controls the temporal protein expression at the initial phase of infection. The early production of the polymerase subunits (PB2, PB1 and PA) and nucleoprotein would facilitate the formation of vRNP, and hence the viral transcription and genome replication. On the other hand, pushing back the expression of viral antigens HA and NA would be beneficial for the virus to delay the host immune response against the infected cells in which the virus is being replicated.</p>
<p>Instead of time-series measurements, the estimation of mRNA export rate was made from a snapshot of <italic>in situ</italic> RNA localisation data taken at a single time point. We anticipate that the statistical framework for quantifying the nuclear export rate proposed in our study can be widely used and benefits the research area on the regulation of gene expression, especially since nuclear retention has been recognised as a point of control against the transcription burst <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. For example, it is applicable for the cell population in which <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of mRNAs occurs concurrently, such as a stimuli-induced activation of immediate-early genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. On the contrary, this approach is not appropriate for scenarios in which asynchronous transcription bursts are taking place randomly in each single cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>; cells at the late stage of transcription burst, having residual amount of transcripts in the cytoplasm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, would obscure the time-course trajectory of the nuclear export.</p>
<p>The experiment in this study was conducted at the early stage of infection (up to 200 min post-infection). This conferred two advantages over investigating influenza viral mRNA export at the late stage of infection (e.g., 6-12 hours post- infection). First, our study allowed for the absolute quantification of viral transcripts at the single-molecule level in each cell, and thereby enabled us to formulate the model and fit the equation to the numerical data points. Otherwise at the late stage of infection, accurate quantification of mRNAs by the imaging- based single-molecule detection would not be feasible due to the high density of mRNAs. Second, at the late stage of infection, NS1 protein would be expressed in the cytoplasm. NS1 protein would then migrate into the nucleus and alter the nuclear export of viral mRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, obscuring the inherent nature of nuclear export of each viral segment. Thus, in our study, we elucidated the quantitative measure for the influenza viral mRNA nuclear export that is intrinsic to each viral segment.</p>
<p>Host factors that relay the influenza viral mRNAs to the nuclear pore remain elusive. NXF1 and CRM are two major cellular mRNA export pathways for the 5′-capped mRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Of these two pathways, influenza A virus mRNAs, also carrying 5′ cap structure derived from the host nascent mRNA and the poly-A tail as a result of viral polymerase stuttering the uridine repeat, are dependent on the NXF1 pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. However, the eight viral segments show differential dependencies on this export pathway. The segments HA, M and NS is exported by NXF1 and UAP56, whereas PB2, PB1 and PA appear to be independent of the NXF1 pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The nuclear export rate derived in our study does not agree with the dependencies on NXF1. According to the previous study, both HA and NS are dependent on NXF1 and UAP56 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>; however, in our study, HA and NS had significantly different nuclear export rate.</p>
<p>Two viral segments M and NS are subject to splicing, yielding unspliced and spliced transcripts. Our current system lacks the ability of discriminating between the unspliced and spliced forms of these segments; although we infer that the majority of NS segments that we detected in this study were in the unspliced form because we obtained similar result with probes exclusively detecting the unspliced form of NS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary figure 3</xref>). An observation that the unspliced form of M and NS dominates throughout the infection supports this <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In either case, the RNA structure does not appear to accord with the NXF1 dependency, nor the nuclear export rate, either.</p>
<p>Our study suggests that the nuclear export of influenza viral transcripts is intrinsic to the nucleotide sequence of each segment. Recently, the human nuclear factor hnRNPAB was shown to associate with the nucleoprotein of influenza A virus, and inhibit the NXF1 pathway. It is tempting to speculate that the host factors (e.g., hnRNPAB) have differential binding affinities to each segment, thus determining the velocity of nuclear export (or the degree of nuclear export inhibition). It is currently unknown what factors binds to the early genes such as PB2, PB1 and PA. Further studies will be required to identify the host factors that bind to these transcripts for the nuclear export. Our study serves as a reference for the nuclear export rate of each segment, and thus sheds light to comprehensive understanding on the nuclear export of viral segments. Having revealed the nuclear retention of influenza viral transcripts at the unprecedented resolution, this study opens up a new research direction on how the nuclear retention is regulated and its implication in viral pathogenesis.</p>

Stellaris RNA FISH Probe Designer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www">https://www</ext-link>. biosearchtech.com/stellaris-designer) was used to design the probes against the coding region of WSN mRNAs.</p>
<p>The coverslip was equilibrated in 1 ml of Wash buffer A (Stellaris) for &gt;5 min in a 12-well plate prior to hybridisation. Cells were hybridised to 125 nM probes in Hybridization buffer (Stellaris) on a Hybrislip (Sigma, GBL712222) at 37°C overnight in a humidified chamber. On the following day the coverslip was rinsed twice in 1 ml of Wash buffer A (Stellaris), each for 30 min. Cytoplasmic stain (HCS Cellmask Green Stain, Invitrogen, H32714) was included in the second wash at the concentration of 50 ng/ml in Figs <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary figure 3</xref>.

The coverslip was mounted in anti-fade medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, H-1200) on a slide glass and sealed with nail polish.</p>
<p>For an economical reason and to allow for more flexible design of probes to increase the number of fluorophores attached per mRNA molecule, the probes used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary figure 1</xref> (except the NP probes) were synthesised in-house (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary figure 1A</xref>). (The NP probe used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary figure 1</xref> was purchased from LGC Biosearch.) Candidate probe-binding sites in the coding region of each viral segment were identified using OligoMiner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, and were further selected against the human RefSeq. The sequences were flanked by P5 (5′ AAT GAT ACG GCG ACC ACC GA 3′) and P7 (5′ CAA GCA GAA GAC GGC ATA CGA GAT 3′), with P7 at the 5′ end and P5 at the 3′ end of the probe sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary figure 1A</xref>). For the probes against HA, NA, M and NS, additional 20-nt sequences RS0332 (5′ GGG AGA ATG AGG TGT AAT GT 3′) and RS0406 (5′ GAT GAT GTA GTA GTA AGG GT 3′) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> were inserted between P7 and the probe, the probe and P5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary figure 1A</xref>). These two insertions were used for additional probes to bind to increase the number of fluorophores per molecule. An oligonucleotide pool comprising the set of probe-binding sites with these additional nucleotide sequences was synthesised at Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). The oligonucleotide pool was subjected to PCR amplification (98°C for 30 sec; 18 cycles of 98°C for 5 sec, 64°C for 10 sec and 72°C for 20 sec; and 72°C for 5 min) (Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, NEB, M0530S) using the P7 and a T7-fused P5 primer (5′ TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA ATG ATA CGG CGA CCA CCG A 3′) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary figure 1A</xref>). RNA was synthesised using T7 RNA polymerase (HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit, NEB, E2040S). Then RNA was reverse- transcribed using a recombinant Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (GeneAce cDNA Synthesis Kit, Nippon Gene, 319-08881) with an ATTO550- conjugated P7 primer at the 5′ end. The single-stranded DNA probe was purified using a spin column (Zymo Research, D7010) after RNA digestion with a cocktail of RNase H and RNase A. The probe was further purified by Urea-PAGE to remove any residual RNA and the fluorescent-labelled primer.</p>
<p>The coverslip was equilibrated in 1 ml of 30% formamide buffer composed of 2×SSC and 30% deionised formamide (Sigma, F9037) in a 12-well plate for &gt;5 min prior to hybridisation. Cells were hybridised with the probes at the concentration of 5.6 nM per probe in 100 µl Hybridization buffer composed of 2×SSC, 30% deionised formamide, 0.1% yeast tRNA (Invitrogen, 15401-011), 1% (v/v) RNase inhibitor (NEB, M0314S) and 10% (w/v) Dextran Sulfate (Merck, S4030) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> on a Hybrislip at 37°C overnight in a humidified chamber. On the following day the coverslip was rinsed twice in 1 ml of 30% formamide buffer, each for 30 min. DAPI was included at 5 ng/ml in the second wash if additional staining was not performed with the external probes (for PB2, PB1 and PA). In this case the coverslip was rinsed in 1 ml of PBS after the DAPI staining, mounted in anti-fade medium (Vector Laboratories, H-1900) on a slide glass and sealed with nail polish. For staining HA, NA, M and NS with the extra probes, the coverslip was first equilibrated with 10% formamide buffer composed of 2×SSC, 10% deionised formamide and 0.05% (v/v) RNase inhibitor, and then hybridised with 10 nM each of probes for RS0332 and RS0406 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, both labelled with Quasar 570 (LGC Biosearch) at the 3′ end, in Stellaris hybridisation buffer (containing 10% formamide) at 37°C in the humidified chamber for 1 hour. Cells were washed in 10% formamide buffer twice, with DAPI included in the second wash.

<caption><title>Independent validation of the total mRNA count and the nuclear ratio of each segment by smFISH.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram of in-house probe synthesis. The pool of single-stranded DNA templates were PCR-amplified, T7-transcribed, and reverse-transcribed using the fluorescent-labelled primer.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study combines virology experiments and mathematical modeling to determine the nuclear export rate of each of the eight RNA segments of the influenza A virus, leading to the proposal that a specific retention of mRNA within the nucleus delays the expression of antigenic viral proteins. The proposed model for explaining the differential rate of export is <bold>compelling</bold>, going beyond the state of the art, but the experimental setup is <bold>incomplete</bold> and would benefit from additional approaches. The insight so far is interesting, but because in the end it is left as an observation, the overall advance remains limited.</p>

<p>The authors have approached the study of the mechanism by which the two more antigenic proteins of the influenza A virus, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are expressed later during the infection. For this aim, they set an experimental approach consisting of a 2-hour-long infection at a multiplicity of infection of 2 with the viral strain WSN. They used cells from the lung carcinoma cell line A549. They used the FISH technique to detect the mRNAs in situ and developed an imaging-based assay for mathematically modeling and estimating the nuclear export rate of each of the eight viral segments. They propose that the delay in the expression of HA and NA is based on the retention of their mRNA within the nucleus.</p>
<p>The main strength of this work is the fact that the authors have studied a long-unaddressed mechanism in influenza A virus infectious cycle, as is the late expression of HA and NA, by creating a work flow including mRNA detection (FISH) plus mathematical calculations to arrive at a model, which additionally could be useful for general biological processes where transcription occurs in a burst-like manner. The weakness of this work in its present state is that in order to &quot;quantify&quot; the export rate of the transcripts, several assumptions regarding the viral infection are made without empirical data. It would greatly improve if more precise experiments could be performed and/or include demonstration of the assumptions made (i.e., synchronized infections, empirically demonstrating that cRNA production does not occur within the first 2 hours of infection, and/or separate transcription and replication, inhibiting RNA degradation during viral infection).</p>

<p>In this study the authors developed a framework to investigate the export rates of Influenza viral RNAs translocating from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This model suggests that the influenza virus may control gene expression at the RNA export level, namely, the retention of certain transcripts in the nucleus for longer times, allows the generation of other viral encoded proteins that are exported regularly, and only later on do certain mRNAs get exported. These encode proteins that alert the cell to the presence of viral molecules, hence keeping their emergence to very end, might help the virus to avoid detection as late as possible in the infection cycle.</p>
<p>The study is of limited scope. The notion that some mRNAs are retained in the nucleus after transcription is concluded early on from the FISH data. The model does not contribute much to the understanding and is mostly confirming the FISH data. The export rate is an ambiguous number and this part is not elaborated upon. One is left with more questions since no mechanistic knowledge emerges, and no additional experimentation is attempted to try drive to a deeper understanding.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers and eLife editorial team for their valuable assessment.  While additional experiments could further strengthen the theoretical framework proposed in this study, we believe that we have successfully established the delayed nuclear export of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase mRNAs by quantifying the FISH observation with the mathematical model.  We agree that this finding raises a further important question to be addressed regarding the molecular mechanism underlying the prolonged nuclear retention of these segments.  Our ongoing investigation is focusing on identifying potential cis-elements that contribute to the delay of these segments.</p>
