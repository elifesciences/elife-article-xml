<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Macrophage phagocytosis has been implicated in regulating anti-tumour immunity. Trained innate immunity (TII), induced <italic>via</italic> modulation of mature myeloid cells or their bone marrow progenitors, mediates sustained increased responsiveness to secondary challenges. Despite the advances in the study of TII-mediated anti-tumour activity, the impact of TII on the orchestration of phagocytosis in the tumour setting requires further elucidation. Here, we investigated whether macrophage phagocytosis of tumour cells can be modulated through induction of TII.</p>
<p>To this end, mice were pre-treated with β-glucan, a fungal-derived agonist of TII, and bone marrow was isolated for macrophage differentiation. Macrophages were then co-cultured with tumour cells that were either apoptotic or opsonised with an antibody recognising a tumour antigen, to mimic efferocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), respectively.</p>
<p>While TII did not have any impact in the modulation of ADCP, efferocytosis was decreased in trained macrophages. Along the same line, gene expression analysis demonstrated that mRNA levels of molecules promoting efferocytosis were downregulated in trained macrophages. Trained macrophages exerted decreased levels of active caspase-1 and produced decreased levels of interleukin-1β upon efferocytosis of tumour cells.</p>
<p>Our findings reveal a hitherto unknown role of TII in the regulation of anti-tumour immunity and may set the stage for designing new cancer immunotherapeutic approaches targeting macrophage efferocytosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The identification of novel mechanisms to harness immune responses is essential for bolstering tumour suppression. There is an increasing need to better understand the regulation of macrophage responses to cancer to inform the development of novel therapeutic approaches and to increase the efficacy of current immunotherapies.</p>
<p>Macrophages represent a major orchestrator of immune responses in a plethora of pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. While residing in the tumour microenvironment, macrophages display remarkable heterogeneity and plasticity turning into essential components that can either promote or suppress tumour growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The tightly coordinated recognition and uptake of ‘foreign’ material through the process of phagocytosis is a major macrophage effector function that shapes host immune responses to both microbial and sterile stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In the tumour setting, macrophages can engulf cancer cells, that are opsonised with antibodies recognising surface tumour antigens, through antibody dependent-cellular phagocytosis (ADCP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and mediate the clearance of apoptotic cancer cells through the specialised type of phagocytosis called efferocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. These two different types of phagocytosis, that represent a cardinal function of macrophages, have been linked to distinct effects on tumour growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. While ADCP promotes anti-tumour effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, efferocytosis promotes a tumour-tolerant condition by inducing the release of immunosuppressive mediators such as interleukin 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Inhibition of signaling pathways or phagocyte receptors that upregulate efferocytosis, such as Mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK), has therefore been effective in reducing tumour growth in several experimental cancer models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Trained innate immunity (TII or trained immunity) defines long-lasting adaptations of innate immune cells based on transcriptional and epigenetic modifications of myeloid cells and their bone marrow progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Specifically, TII represents a state of enhanced immune responsiveness of the myeloid compartment to secondary challenges. We have previously shown that TII contributes to tumour suppression using experimental models of melanoma and lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The anti-tumour effects of TII were attributed at least in part to epigenetic and transcriptomic reprograming in neutrophils and enhanced tumour cell killing by release of reactive oxygen species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The tumour suppressive phenotype of TII has been corroborated by several studies employing different tumour models and utilising different agents to induce TII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. While the role of TII in promoting anti-tumour immunity is established, the impact of TII in efferocytosis or ADCP to shape anti-tumour immunity remains poorly explored.</p>
<p>The application of immunotherapies including checkpoint inhibitors that target the adaptive immune compartment for the treatment of melanoma has significantly improved the clinical management of this malignancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. However, current drugs have significant limitations as some patients suffer from side effects or do not benefit from treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Macrophages are abundant in the tumour microenvironment of melanoma and their therapeutic targeting may be a promising strategy to complement existing therapies and enhance treatment success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Of note, macrophages have been shown to contribute to ADCP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> of melanoma cells. In addition, targeted inhibition of efferocytosis incites anti-tumour immunity in melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we studied the role of TII on macrophage phagocytosis of melanoma cells and the cytokine profile of phagocytic macrophages. Our data demonstrate that ‘trained’ macrophages show decreased efferocytosis of tumour cells accompanied by reduced secretion of IL-1β. These findings unravel a hitherto unrecognized role of TII in the control of macrophage anti-tumour functions. The decreased macrophage efferocytosis of tumour cells has the potential to be harnessed therapeutically.</p>

<title>Efferocytosis of apoptotic tumour cells is decreased by trained macrophages</title>
<p>Having previously identified a tumour suppressive role for TII that is mediated by myeloid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, we sought to determine the impact of TII as a regulator of macrophage uptake of apoptotic tumour cells. To mimic efferocytosis conditions, macrophages pre-stained with CFSE were co-cultured with pHrodo red-labelled apoptotic melanoma cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). Pre-treatment of macrophages with the actin polymerization <italic>inhibitor cytochalasin</italic> D prior to their co-culture with tumour cells resulted in dose-dependent blockade of efferocytosis confirming the specificity of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">supplementary Fig. 1B, C</xref>). The effect of TII on macrophage efferocytosis of tumour cells was investigated using bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from the bone marrow of mice treated with β-glucan (hereafter described as trained macrophages). The increased levels of <italic>Tnf</italic> in trained macrophages upon their stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) confirmed the induction of TII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> in our experimental setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of the co-cultures revealed that efferocytosis was attenuated in trained macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). The dynamic behaviour of trained macrophages during efferocytosis of melanoma cells was mapped using real time imaging verifying their decreased capacity for tumour cell uptake (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>Given that macrophage phagocytosis can be differentially modulated by different types of phagocytic cargo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, we sought to investigate the behaviour of trained macrophages towards different key phagocytic cargos. To this end, trained or non-trained macrophages were cultured together with microbial bioparticles or apoptotic neutrophils to mimic phagocytosis during infection or resolution phase of sterile inflammatory responses, respectively. The uptake of both <italic>E. coli</italic> particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">supplementary Fig. 3A-D</xref>) and apoptotic neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">supplementary Fig. 3E, F</xref>) was elevated in trained macrophages compared to the phagocytic activity shown in control macrophages.

<title>Induction of TII combined with MerTK inhibition further downregulate efferocytosis of tumour cells</title>
<p>MerTK functions as an efferocytic receptor recognising the ‘eat-me’ signal PS on the outer surface membrane of apoptotic cells with the help of bridging molecules such as Gas6. As MerTK blockade has already been shown to promote tumour suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, we investigated the consequences of MerTK inhibition on trained macrophage efferocytosis.</p>
<p>To this end, trained or control macrophages were cultured with apoptotic melanoma cells in the presence of the small-molecule MerTK inhibitor UNC2025<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In trained macrophages, the presence of UNC2025 resulted in decreased efferocytosis compared to that one in control macrophages treated with the inhibitor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Gene expression analysis of molecules downstream of MerTK signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> in macrophages treated with the UNC2025 verified the downregulation of <italic>Liver X receptor alpha</italic> (<italic>Lxra</italic>) and <italic>ATP-binding cassette transporter</italic> (<italic>Abca1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).

MerTK protein levels were downregulated in trained macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Therefore, decreased efferocytosis of tumour cells by trained macrophages may be attributed at least in part to the downregulated molecular machinery orchestrating MerTK-dependent efferocytosis.</p>

<title>Secretion of IL-1β by trained macrophages upon efferocytosis of tumour cells is blunted</title>
<p>Macrophage efferocytosis not only paves the way towards the clearance of apoptotic cells, but also promotes metabolic alterations in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. At the same time, metabolic alterations in efferocytic macrophages induced by digested apoptotic material substantially regulates the cytokine secretion by efferocytic macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Since upregulation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has been linked to both enhanced efferocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and tumour growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, we determined the levels of IL-1β production in our co-culture setting. Production of IL-1β was induced as a result of efferocytosis, as IL-1β was minimally detected in either macrophage or apoptotic melanoma cell monocultures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Trained macrophages displayed lower levels of IL-1β production as shown in co-culture supernatants compared to those from control macrophages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), further underscoring the tumour suppressive effect of TII through inhibition of efferocytosis. Consistently, we demonstrated that levels of active caspase-1 were decreased in trained macrophages after efferocytosis of apoptotic tumour cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, C</xref>) thereby explaining at least in part the decreased levels of active IL-1β in co-culture supernatants.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The orchestration of host immune responses against cancer involves several immune cell types and events including monocyte infiltration, macrophage activation, cytokine release and phagocytosis of cancer cells, all of which aim to contribute to tumour suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Although immune cell interactions play important roles in the immunopathology of cancer, the network of molecules and mechanisms that coordinate this complex process warrants further elucidation. Therefore, identification of immune regulatory networks that aim to harness cancer-associated immunosuppression are required.</p>
<p>In an experimental model of melanoma, induction of TII has been shown to promote myeloid cell – dependent tumour suppression through reprograming the phenotype of neutrophils to inhibit tumour growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Here, we investigated whether TII regulates macrophage phagocytosis of tumour cells. We show for first time that trained macrophages have decreased phagocytic activity of apoptotic tumour cells and that is accompanied by lower levels of secreted IL-1β. We also found that <italic>Gas6</italic>, <italic>Lxra</italic>, <italic>Abca1</italic> and MerTK, all previously linked to enhanced efferocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, were downregulated by trained macrophages. Under the tested conditions, levels of ADCP were comparable between trained and control macrophages. Use of antibodies recognising alternative melanoma surface antigens may promote ADCP by trained macrophages.</p>
<p>Further studies would be useful to address why trained macrophages demonstrate a cargo-dependent phagocytic behaviour, i.e. decreased efferocytosis of tumour cells, unaltered ADCP and enhanced phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils and <italic>E. coli</italic> particles. In agreement with the literature, although using a different approach to induce TII, enhanced phagocytosis of pathogen particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> and apoptotic neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> by trained phagocytes has been demonstrated. Our findings on trained macrophage efferocytosis of different apoptotic cargos further support previous reports suggesting that the cellular identity of the engulfed apoptotic cell instruct distinct macrophage phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> that may be potentially linked to enhanced effectiveness of macrophage-based cell therapies.</p>
<p>Targeting efferocytosis to bolster anti-tumour immunity has recently attracted attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Of note, efferocytosis has been linked to cancer therapeutic resistance among several types of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. The role of TII on attenuating macrophage efferocytosis in the tumour setting was corroborated by showing that inhibition of the efferocytosis receptor MerTK further decreased the uptake of apoptotic tumour cells in co-cultures with trained macrophages. As blockade of MerTK may have a direct impact in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, further studies are required to address whether MerTK inhibition affects solely efferocytosis in our experimental setting.</p>
<p>The decreased caspase-1 activity in trained efferocytic macrophages was reflected by lower levels of IL-1β levels. Efferocytosis has been shown to induce the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in myeloid cells thereby promoting IL-1β secretion and tumour growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Further focus on the identification of specific inflammasomes that contribute to the attenuated efferocytosis by trained macrophages may support the development of novel cancer immunotherapeutic targets. In addition, future studies will provide further insight into the potential role of MerTK inhibition on macrophage IL-1β secretion during efferocytosis.</p>
<p>Given the macrophage heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> and the different types of central and peripheral trained innate immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, the use of BMDMs as the only source of macrophages may represent a limitation of this study. However, BMDMs have been utilised extensively for the elucidation of mechanisms orchestrating cargo-dependent macrophage phagocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Future validation experiments using different types of macrophages will strengthen the impact of this study.</p>
<p>Lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> data on macrophage efferocytosis is another limitation of our study. Further analyses are required to address the physiological relevance of trained macrophages in efferocytosis of tumour cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Cancer combination therapies, including the administration of immunotherapy, have contributed to the improvement of the clinical management of cancer particularly in aggressive types such as melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> and also breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The anti-tumour effect of β-glucan and the vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, both inducers of TII, is being tested in clinicals trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. TII - dependent decrease of efferocytosis may be a promising adjuvant immunotherapeutic strategy to complement existing cancer therapies and enhance treatment success.</p>
<p>In summary, the present study pinpoints a novel role for trained innate immunity in attenuating macrophage efferocytosis of tumour cells and demonstrates that the decreased efferocytosis by trained macrophages is associated with lower levels of active caspase-1 and IL-1β secretion. This novel role of trained innate immunity could be therapeutically exploited in pre-clinical models to expand our current mechanistic and translational understanding of the anti-tumour potential of trained immunity.</p>

<p>This study provides proof-of-principle data for the use of trained immunity to modulate macrophage interactions with tumours. The study makes a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution to the field of trained immunity. However, the study is <bold>incomplete</bold> without vivo data, which would have made the claims in the paper stronger by providing meaningful context for the in vitro experiments that were conducted.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors were attempting to describe whether trained innate immunity would modulate antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and/or efferocytosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of primary murine macrophages, and not a cell line, is considered a strength.</p>
<p>The trained immunity-mediated changes to phagocytosis affected both melanoma and breast cancer cells. The broad effect is consistent with trained immunity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The most significant weakness, also noted by the authors in the discussion, is the lack of in vivo data. Without these data, it is not possible to put the in vitro data in context. It is unknown if the described effects on efferocytosis will be relevant to the in vivo progression of cancer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors follow up their preclinical work on beta-glucan-induced trained immunity in murine tumor models that they published in Cell in 2020. In particular, they focus on the role of trained immunity and efferocytosis of cancer cells</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>While properly conducted, the work is underwhelming and fully depends on in vitro observations performed with co-cultures of bone marrow derived macrophages from beta-glucan-treated mice and tumor cell lines. From these in vitro studies, the authors conclude that trained immunity induction has no effect on antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, while it decreases efferocytosis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It would be important to study these phenomena in tumor mouse models in vivo. The authors clearly have the expertise as they have shown in previous studies. Especially because the in vitro observation appears to conflict with the in vivo anti-tumor found in mice prophylactically treated with beta-glucan. Clearly, trained immunity is associated with diverse cellular responses and mechanisms, some of which may promote tumor growth, as the current manuscript suggests, but in the absence of in vivo studies, it is merely a mechanistic exercise of which the relevance is difficult to determine.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chatzis et al showed that β-glucan trained macrophages have decreased phagocytic activity of apoptotic tumor cells and that is accompanied by lower levels of secreted IL-1β using a mouse model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This finding has a potential impact on designing new cancer immunotherapeutic approaches by targeting macrophage efferocytosis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Whether this finding could be applied to other scenarios is underdetermined.</p>
<p>(1) Does the decrease of efferocytosis also occur in human monocytes/macrophages after training?</p>
<p>(2) Both β-glucan and BCG are well-trained innate immunity agents, the authors showed that β-glucan decreased efferocytosis via IL-1 β, so it is interesting to know whether BCG has a similar effect.</p>
